                "content": "Watch CBS News By Christina Fan Updated on: January 2, 2025 / 1:03 PM EST / CBS New York NEW YORK - A mass shooting in Jamaica, Queens left 10 teenagers hurt when police say several suspects opened fire outside a venue. It happened just after 11:15 p.m. on New Year's Day outside the Amazura Concert Hall on 144th Place. Police are now searching for four male suspects who fired into a crowd of about 15 people standing outside the event space. Police said about 90 people were inside the address for a private event. Police sources told CBS News New York they were attending a vigil for 16-year-old Taearion Mungo, who was shot and killed last October. Sources said his mother booked the hall for what would have been his birthday. The venue was at capacity, and a line of about 15 people were waiting outside. Police said that's when four men walking down 91st Avenue approached the crowd and fired about 30 rounds. They then ran toward 143rd Place, where they got in a light colored sedan with out-of-state plates, according to police. \"We are deeply saddened by the recent and unfortunate isolated incident that occurred. Our hearts go out to all those affected by this senseless act. We are working closely with law enforcement to ensure a thorough investigation and to help bring those responsible to justice,\" Amazura Concert Hall said in a statement on social media. While the concert hall called it an isolated incident, police sources said officers have been called to the location for previous incidents. Sources also said the shooting appears to be gang-related. The street was crowded with ambulances waiting to rush the victims to local hospitals. They range in age from 16 to 19 years old and are all expected to survive their injuries. \"Officers responded to the multiple 911 calls and found a total of 10 victims -- six females, four males -- who were taken to area hospitals. All of the victims are expected to recover with non-life-threatening injuries,\" NYPD Chief of Patrol Philip Rivera told reporters overnight. Six of the victims were taken to the Jamaica Hospital Trauma Center with injuries ranging from gunshot wounds to the leg, foot, arm and buttocks, to graze wounds to the back. The other four are being treated at New York-Presbyterian Queens, Long Island Jewish Medical Center and Cohen Children's Medical Center. Police said they were also actively canvassing local medical centers for any unaccounted for gunshot victims related to this incident. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards Jr. called the shooting a \"life-changing ordeal\" and shared his thoughts for those impacted. \"Ten families woke up this morning to some of the most devastating news one could imagine receiving — their loved one had been shot. My thoughts are with the victims and all those impacted as they navigate this life-changing ordeal, and I'm relieved that seemingly no lives will be lost due to this despicable shooting,\" Richards said in a statement. \"I have been in constant communication with law enforcement, and while it does not appear this incident has a Queens nexus, under no circumstance will we allow any example of gun violence in our borough to go unpunished. I'm confident that those who perpetrated this heinous act will be arrested and held accountable for their actions.\" Investigators noted the public has been instrumental in helping them solve high-profile crimes in recent weeks, and they hope the public will once again help them catch the suspects in this case. Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or 1-888-57-PISTA (74782) for Spanish. You can also submit a tip via their website. All calls are kept confidential. Allen Devlin and John Dias contributed to this report.

            {
                "title": "Super Bowl - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Super Bowl is the annual league championship game of the National Football League (NFL) of the United States. It has served as the final game of every NFL season since 1966, replacing the NFL Championship Game. Since 2022, the game has been played on the second Sunday in February. Prior Super Bowls were played on Sundays in early to mid-January from 1967 to 1978, late January from 1979 to 2003,[a] and the first Sunday of February from 2004 to 2021. Winning teams are awarded the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the eponymous coach who won the first two Super Bowls. Because the NFL restricts the use of its \"Super Bowl\" trademark, it is frequently referred to as the \"big game\" or other generic terms by non-sponsoring corporations. The day the game is held is commonly referred to as \"Super Bowl Sunday\" or simply \"Super Sunday\". The game was created as part of a 1966 merger agreement between the NFL and the competing American Football League (AFL) to have their 'best' teams compete for a championship. It was originally called the AFL–NFL World Championship Game until the \"Super Bowl\" moniker was adopted in 1969's Super Bowl III. The first four Super Bowls from 1967 to 1970 were played prior to the merger, with the NFL and AFL each winning two. After the merger in 1970, the 10 AFL teams and three of the NFL teams formed the American Football Conference (AFC) and the remaining 13 NFL teams formed the National Football Conference (NFC). All games since 1971's Super Bowl V have been played between the best team from each of the two conferences, with the AFC and NFC tied at 27 wins each. Among the NFL's current 32 teams, 20 (11 NFC, nine AFC) have won a Super Bowl and 15 (eight AFC, seven NFC) hold multiple titles. The AFC's Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots have the most Super Bowl titles at six each. The Patriots also have the most Super Bowl appearances at 11.[1] The Patriots and the Denver Broncos of the AFC hold the record for the most defeats in the Super Bowl at five each. The Baltimore Ravens of the AFC and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the NFC are the only franchises to be undefeated in multiple Super Bowls, having each won two. Among the 12 teams who have not won a Super Bowl, the AFC's Cleveland Browns, Houston Texans, and Jacksonville Jaguars, and the NFC's Detroit Lions are the only four to have not appeared in the game. The Super Bowl is among the world's most-watched single sporting events and frequently commands the largest audience among all American broadcasts during the year. It is second only to the UEFA Champions League final as the most watched annual club sporting event worldwide,[2] and the seven most-watched broadcasts in American television history are Super Bowls.[3] Commercial airtime during the Super Bowl broadcast is the most expensive of the year because of the high viewership, leading to companies regularly developing their most expensive advertisements for the broadcast and commercial viewership becoming an integral part of the event. The Super Bowl is also the second-largest event for American food consumption, behind Thanksgiving dinner.[4] Since the turn of the 20th century, college football teams from across the United States have scheduled \"bowl games\" against each other. The original \"bowl game\" was the Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena, California, which was first played in 1902 as the \"Tournament East–West football game\" as part of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses. In 1923, the Tournament East-West football game moved to the new Rose Bowl Stadium; the stadium got its name from the fact that the game played there was part of the Tournament of Roses and that it was shaped like a bowl, much like the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut. The Tournament of Roses football game thus eventually came to be known as the Rose Bowl Game. Exploiting the Rose Bowl Game's popularity, post-season college football contests were created for Miami (the Orange Bowl), New Orleans (the Sugar Bowl), and El Paso (the Sun Bowl) in 1935, and for Dallas (the Cotton Bowl) in 1937. By the time the first Super Bowl was played, the term \"bowl\" for any major American football game was well established.[5] For four decades after its 1920 inception, the NFL successfully fended off several rival leagues. In 1960, it encountered its most serious competitor when the American Football League (AFL) was formed. The AFL vied with the NFL for players and fans. After the AFL's inaugural season, AFL commissioner Joe Foss sent an invitation to the NFL on January 14, 1961, to schedule a \"World Playoff\" game between the two leagues' champions, beginning with the upcoming 1961 season.[6] The first World Playoff game, if actually played, would have matched up the AFL champion Houston Oilers against the NFL champion Green Bay Packers.[7] In the mid-1960s, Lamar Hunt, owner of the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs, first used the term \"Super Bowl\"[8] to refer to the AFL–NFL championship game in the merger meetings. Hunt later said the name was likely in his head because his children had been playing with a Super Ball toy;[9] a vintage example of the ball is on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. In a July 25, 1966, letter to NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, Hunt wrote, \"I have kiddingly called it the 'Super Bowl,' which obviously can be improved upon.\" The leagues' owners chose the name \"AFL–NFL Championship Game\",[10] but in July 1966 the Kansas City Star quoted Hunt in discussing \"the Super Bowl—that's my term for the championship game between the two leagues\",[11] and the media immediately began using the term.[12] Although the league stated in 1967 that \"not many people like it\", asking for suggestions and considering alternatives such as \"Merger Bowl\" and \"The Game\", the Associated Press reported that \"Super Bowl\" \"grew and grew and grew—until it reached the point that there was Super Week, Super Sunday, Super Teams, Super Players, ad infinitum\".[10] \"Super Bowl\" became official beginning with the third annual game.[13] Roman numerals are used to identify each Super Bowl, rather than the year in which it is held, since the fifth edition, in January 1971.[14] The sole exception to this naming convention tradition occurred with Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016, following the 2015 regular season. The following year, the nomenclature returned to Roman numerals for Super Bowl LI, following the 2016 regular season. After the NFL's Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, some team owners feared for the future of the merger. At the time, many doubted the competitiveness of AFL teams compared with their NFL counterparts, though that perception changed when the AFL's New York Jets defeated the heavily favored NFL contender Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III in Miami. One year later, the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs defeated the NFL's Minnesota Vikings 23–7 in Super Bowl IV in New Orleans, which was the final AFL–NFL World Championship Game played before the merger. Beginning with the 1970 season, the NFL realigned into two conferences; the former AFL teams plus three NFL teams (the Baltimore Colts, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Cleveland Browns) would constitute the American Football Conference (AFC), while the remaining NFL clubs would form the National Football Conference (NFC). The champions of the two conferences would play each other in the Super Bowl. The winning team receives the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the former coach of the Green Bay Packers, who won the first two Super Bowl games as well as five NFL championships preceding the merger in 1961, 1962, 1965, 1966 and 1967. Following Lombardi's death in September 1970, the trophy was named after him. The first trophy awarded under the new name was presented to the Baltimore Colts following their win in Super Bowl V in Miami. The Super Bowl was held in January from its inception in 1967 until 2001. In 2002, a week of regular season games was postponed and rescheduled following the September 11 attacks; as a result, Super Bowl XXXVI became the first edition of the game played in February. Super Bowl XXXVII was held in January, but all subsequent games were held on the first Sunday in February until the schedule expansion of the 2021 season moved the game to the second Sunday.[15] The current NFL schedule begins on the weekend immediately after Labor Day (the first Monday in September). That weekend is the first of an 18-week regular season, followed by three weeks of playoff games and one week for the Pro Bowl. The Super Bowl is contested the week after the Pro Bowl. This schedule has been in effect since an 18th week (and 17th regular season game) were added to the NFL schedule for the 2021 season, with Super Bowl LVI on February 13, 2022, the first to be played under this format. The Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots are tied with a record six Super Bowl wins. The Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers have five victories each, while the Packers, Chiefs and New York Giants have four. Fourteen other NFL franchises have won at least one Super Bowl. The Patriots own the record for most Super Bowl appearances with eleven. The Cowboys, Steelers, Broncos and the 49ers are tied for second with eight appearances apiece, reaching that milestone in this respective order. Bill Belichick owns the record for the most Super Bowl wins (eight) and appearances (twelve: nine times as head coach, once as assistant head coach, and twice as defensive coordinator) by an individual. Tom Brady has the most Super Bowl starts (ten) and wins as a player (seven), while Charles Haley has the second-most wins among players with five. Eight teams have appeared in Super Bowl games without a win. The Minnesota Vikings were the first team to appear four times without a win, while the Buffalo Bills played in a record four consecutive Super Bowls, losing in each. The Patriots and Broncos are tied for the most Super Bowl losses at five. The Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, and Jacksonville Jaguars are the four teams to have never appeared in a Super Bowl, although the Browns and Lions both won NFL championships before the Super Bowl era. The Jaguars, who began play in 1995, and the Texans, who began play in 2002, are among the youngest franchises in the league. The Packers won the first two AFL–NFL World Championship Games, later renamed Super Bowls, defeating the Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders following the 1966 and 1967 seasons, respectively.[16][17] The Packers were led by quarterback Bart Starr, who was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) for both games.[18] These two championships, coupled with the Packers' NFL championships in 1961, 1962, and 1965, amount to the most successful stretch in NFL History; five championships in seven years, and the second threepeat in NFL history (1965, 1966, and 1967). The Packers are the only team to threepeat, as they also accomplished the feat in the pre-playoff era (1929, 1930 and 1931). The first playoff game in the NFL was in 1932. In Super Bowl III, the AFL's New York Jets defeated the 19.5-point favorite Baltimore Colts of the NFL, 16–7.[19] The Jets were led by quarterback Joe Namath, who had famously guaranteed a Jets win before the game, and former Colts head coach Weeb Ewbank, and their victory proved that the AFL was the NFL's competitive equal.[20] This was reinforced the following year when the Chiefs defeated the NFL's Vikings 23–7 in Super Bowl IV.[21] After the AFL–NFL merger was completed in 1970, three franchises—the Cowboys, Miami Dolphins, and Steelers—would go on to dominate the 1970s, winning a combined eight Super Bowls between them in the decade, with the Steelers winning four of the eight. The Baltimore Colts, now a member of the AFC, would start the decade by defeating the Cowboys in Super Bowl V, a game which is notable as being the only Super Bowl to date in which a player from the losing team won the Super Bowl MVP (Cowboys' linebacker Chuck Howley).[22][23] Beginning with this Super Bowl, all Super Bowls have served as the NFL's championship game. The Cowboys, coming back from a loss the previous season, won Super Bowl VI over the Dolphins.[24] However, this would be the Dolphins' final loss for over a year, as the next year, the Dolphins would go 14–0 in the regular season and eventually win all their playoff games, capped off with a 14–7 victory in Super Bowl VII, becoming the first and only team in the Super Bowl era to finish an entire perfect regular and postseason undefeated.[25][26] The Dolphins would repeat as league champions by winning Super Bowl VIII a year later with a 24–7 win over the Minnesota Vikings.[27] In the mid to late 1970s, the Steelers became the first NFL dynasty of the post-merger era by winning four Super Bowls (IX, X, XIII, and XIV) in six years.[28][29][30][31] They were led by head coach Chuck Noll,[32] the play of offensive stars Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Lynn Swann, John Stallworth, and Mike Webster, and their dominant \"Steel Curtain\" defense, led by \"Mean\" Joe Greene, L. C. Greenwood, Ernie Holmes, Mel Blount, Jack Ham, and Jack Lambert. Many of the team's key players were selected in the 1974 draft, in which Pittsburgh selected four future Hall of Famers, the most for any team in any sport in a single draft.[33] A fifth player, Donnie Shell, was signed by Pittsburgh after going unselected in the 1974 NFL Draft; he too was later enshrined in the Hall of Fame.[34] The Steelers were the first team to win three and then four Super Bowls and appeared in six AFC Championship Games during the decade, making the playoffs in eight straight seasons.[35] Pittsburgh still remains the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowls twice and four Super Bowls in a six-year period.[36][37] The Steelers' 1970s dynasty was interrupted only by the Raiders' first Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XI and the Cowboys' second Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XII.[38][39] Conversely, the Vikings, with their Purple People Eaters defense, were the only other team to appear in multiple Super Bowls (IV, VIII, IX and XI) during the decade but failed to win each one.[40] In the 1980s and 1990s, the tables turned for the AFC, as the NFC dominated the Super Bowls of the new decade and most of those in the 1990s. The NFC won 16 of the 20 Super Bowls during these two decades, including 13 straight from Super Bowl XIX to Super Bowl XXXI. The most successful team of the 1980s was the 49ers, which featured the West Coast offense of Hall of Fame head coach Bill Walsh.[41] This offense was led by three-time Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana, Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice, running back Roger Craig, and Hall of Fame defensive safety/cornerback Ronnie Lott. Under their leadership, the 49ers won four Super Bowls in the decade (XVI, XIX, XXIII, and XXIV) and made nine playoff appearances between 1981 and 1990, including eight division championships, becoming the second dynasty of the post-merger NFL.[42][43][44][45] The 1984 San Francisco 49ers were the first team to achieve an 18–1 record, doing so under Walsh. The 1989 San Francisco 49ers, under first-year head coach George Seifert, posted the most lop-sided victory in Super Bowl history, defeating the Denver Broncos by a score of 55–10 in Super Bowl XXIV.[46] The 1980s also produced the 1985 Chicago Bears, who posted an 18–1 record under head coach Mike Ditka; quarterback Jim McMahon; and Hall of Fame running back Walter Payton.[47] Their team won Super Bowl XX in dominant fashion.[48] The Washington Redskins and New York Giants were also top teams of this period; Washington won Super Bowls XVII, XXII, and XXVI.[49][50][51] The Giants claimed Super Bowls XXI and XXV.[52][53] Both teams won multiple Super Bowls with different starting quarterbacks; Washington won with Joe Theismann (XVII), Doug Williams (XXII) and Mark Rypien (XXVI), and the Giants with Phil Simms (XXI) and Jeff Hostetler (XXV). As in the 1970s, the Raiders were the only AFC team to interrupt the Super Bowl dominance of NFC teams; they won Super Bowls XV and XVIII (the latter as the Los Angeles Raiders).[54][55] Conversely, the Cincinnati Bengals (XVI and XXIII), Dolphins, (XVII and XIX), and Broncos (XXI, XXII and XXIV) made multiple Super Bowls in the 1980s without winning one.[56][57][58] Following several seasons with poor records in the 1980s, the Cowboys rose back to prominence in the 1990s. During this decade, the Cowboys made post-season appearances every year except for the seasons of 1990 and 1997.[59] From 1992 to 1996, the Cowboys won their division championship each year.[60] In this same period, the Buffalo Bills had made their mark reaching the Super Bowl for a record four consecutive years, only to lose all four (XXV-XXVIII).[61][62][63] After Super Bowl championships by division rivals New York (1990) and Washington (1991), the Cowboys won three of the next four Super Bowls (XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX) led by quarterback Troy Aikman, running back Emmitt Smith, and wide receiver Michael Irvin.[64][65][66] All three of these players went to the Hall of Fame. The Cowboys' streak was interrupted by the 49ers, who were the first team to win their league-leading fifth title overall with Super Bowl XXIX with a dominant performance featuring the Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young (who threw a Super Bowl record 6 touchdown passes), Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice, and Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders; however, the Cowboys' victory in Super Bowl XXX the next year also gave them five titles overall and they did so with Sanders after he won the Super Bowl the previous year with the 49ers.[67][68] The NFC's winning streak was continued by the Packers led by Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre, won Super Bowl XXXI, their first championship since Super Bowl II in 1967.[69] The Patriots made their maiden Super Bowl appearances in XX (1985) and XXXI (1996) but lost both times.[70] However, the turn of the century would soon bring hope and glory to the franchise.[71] Super Bowl XXXII saw quarterback John Elway and running back Terrell Davis lead the Denver Broncos to an upset victory over the defending champion Packers, snapping the NFC's thirteen-year winning streak.[72] The following year, the Broncos defeated the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway's fifth Super Bowl appearance, his second NFL championship, and his final NFL game.[73] The back-to-back victories heralded a change in momentum in which AFC teams would win nine out of 12 Super Bowls. In the years between 1995 and 2018, five teams—the Steelers, Patriots, Broncos, Baltimore Ravens, and Indianapolis Colts—accounted for 22 of the 24 AFC Super Bowl appearances (including the last 16), with those same teams often meeting each other earlier in the playoffs. In contrast, the NFC saw a different representative in the Super Bowl every season from 2001 through 2010.[74] The New England Patriots became the dominant team throughout the early 2000s, winning the championship three out of four years early in the decade.[75] They would become only the second team in the history of the NFL to do so (after the 1990s Dallas Cowboys). In Super Bowl XXXVI, first-year starting quarterback Tom Brady led his team to a 20–17 upset victory over the St. Louis Rams, who two seasons earlier won Super Bowl XXXIV.[76][77] Brady would go on to win the MVP award for this game. The Patriots also won Super Bowls XXXVIII[78] and XXXIX defeating the Carolina Panthers and the Philadelphia Eagles respectively.[79][80] This four-year stretch of Patriot dominance was interrupted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 48–21 Super Bowl XXXVII victory over the Oakland Raiders.[81] The Steelers and Colts continued the era of AFC dominance by winning Super Bowls XL and XLI in the 2005 and 2006 seasons, respectively defeating the Seattle Seahawks and Chicago Bears.[82][83] In the 2007 season, the Patriots became the fourth team in NFL history to have a perfect unbeaten and untied regular-season record, the second in the Super Bowl era after the 1972 Miami Dolphins, and the first to finish 16–0.[84] They easily marched through the AFC playoffs and were heavy favorites in Super Bowl XLII. However, they lost that game to Eli Manning and the New York Giants 17–14, leaving the Patriots' 2007 record at 18–1.[85] The following season, the Steelers logged their record sixth Super Bowl title (XLIII) in a 27–23, final-minute victory against the Arizona Cardinals.[86] The 2009 season saw the New Orleans Saints defeat the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV by a score of 31–17 to take home their first Championship.[87] With this victory, the Saints joined the New York Jets as the only teams to have won in their sole Super Bowl appearance, a distinction the Ravens also enjoyed in winning Super Bowl XXXV after the 2000 season and the Buccaneers in 2002.[88] In the AFC, this era was dominated by the Patriots, with the only four other teams to represent the conference being the Steelers, Ravens, Broncos, and Chiefs. The Patriots had tied a record with the 1970s Dallas Cowboys for most Super Bowl appearances in a decade with five appearances (2011, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018). The Patriots also had four Super Bowl appearances in five years. They also had eight consecutive AFC championship appearances spanning 2011–2018.[89] The Super Bowls of the 2000s and 2010s are notable for the performances (and the pedigrees) of several of the participating quarterbacks, especially on the AFC side in repeated appearances by the same teams and players. In particular, Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger, or Peyton Manning appeared as the AFC team's quarterback in all but two of the Super Bowls from 2001 through 2018.[90] Conversely, the only NFC teams to make the Super Bowl multiple times with the same quarterback in this era were the Seahawks, led by quarterback Russell Wilson, and the Giants, led by quarterback Eli Manning. One of these teams was featured in the culmination of the 2010 season, Super Bowl XLV, which brought the Packers their fourth Super Bowl victory and record thirteenth NFL championship overall with the defeat of the Steelers in February 2011.[91] This became Aaron Rodgers' only Super Bowl victory so far. The following year, in Super Bowl XLVI, the Patriots made their first appearance of the decade, a position where they would become a mainstay. The Patriots, however, lost to the Eli Manning-led Giants, 21–17, who had beaten the Patriots four years before.[92] This was the Giants' fourth Super Bowl victory.[93] In Super Bowl XLVII, the NFC's 49ers were defeated by the Ravens 34–31.[94] The game had been dubbed as the 'Harbaugh Bowl' in the weeks leading up to the game, due to the fact that the coaches of the two teams, John Harbaugh and Jim Harbaugh, are brothers.[95] During the third quarter, the Ravens had a commanding 28–6 lead. However, there was a blackout in New Orleans, where the game was being played.[96] The game was delayed for 34 minutes, and after play resumed, San Francisco stormed back with 17 straight points, but still lost. Super Bowl XLVIII, played at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium in February 2014, was the first Super Bowl held outdoors in a cold-weather environment.[97] The Seahawks won their first NFL title with a 43–8 defeat of the Broncos, in a highly touted matchup that pitted Seattle's top-ranked defense against a Peyton Manning-led Denver offense that had broken the NFL's single-season scoring record.[98][99][100] In Super Bowl XLIX, the Patriots beat the defending Super Bowl champions, the Seahawks, by a score of 28–24.[101] Down by 10, the Patriots mounted a late fourth quarter comeback to win the game with Tom Brady scoring two touchdowns in the fourth quarter.[102] In a key play in the final seconds of the game, then-rookie free agent Malcolm Butler would intercept a pass by Russell Wilson at the one-yard line, allowing the Patriots to run out the clock and end the game.[103] Tom Brady was awarded his third Super Bowl MVP, tying Joe Montana for the most Super Bowl MVP awards.[104] In Super Bowl 50, the first Super Bowl to be branded with Arabic numerals,[105] the Broncos, led by the league's top-ranked defense, defeated the Panthers, who had the league's top-ranked offense, in what became the final game of quarterback Peyton Manning's career.[106][107] Von Miller dominated, totaling 2.5 sacks and forcing two Cam Newton fumbles; both fumbles leading to Broncos touchdowns.[108][109] In Super Bowl LI, the first Super Bowl to end in overtime,[110] the Atlanta Falcons led 28–3 late in the third quarter, but the Patriots came back to tie the game 28–28 with back-to-back touchdowns and two-point conversions, and the Patriots went on to win 34–28 in overtime.[111] This 25-point deficit was the largest comeback win for any team in a Super Bowl, breaking the previous of a 10-point deficit to come back and win.[112] The Patriots never held the lead until the game-winning touchdown in overtime. It was Tom Brady's 5th Super Bowl win and he was awarded his record fourth Super Bowl MVP, throwing a then-record 466 yards for 43 completions.[113][114][115] In Super Bowl LII, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the defending champion Patriots 41–33, ending a 57-year championship drought for the franchise.[116] Nick Foles won the Super Bowl MVP.[117] The Patriots totaled 613 yards in defeat, with Tom Brady breaking his previous Super Bowl record of 466 passing yards with an all-time playoff record of 505 passing yards in the high-scoring game; while the Eagles would gain 538 yards in the victory.[118][119] The combined total for both teams of 1,151 yards of offense broke an NFL record (for any game) that had stood for nearly seven decades.[120] The Patriots' 33 points were the highest losing score in Super Bowl history, a record held until 2023, when the Eagles lost Super Bowl LVII to the Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 38–35.[121] It was the Eagles' third Super Bowl appearance and their first win in franchise history. With the Eagles' victory, the NFC East became the first division to have each team win at least one Super Bowl.[122] While Super Bowl LII produced the second highest-scoring Super Bowl, the following year's Super Bowl LIII became the lowest-scoring Super Bowl. The Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams, 13–3. In so doing, they became the team with the lowest point total by a winning team in Super Bowl history.[123] Tom Brady would receive a record sixth Super Bowl championship, the most of any player in NFL history, surpassing his tie with Charles Haley for five wins. Brady would also become the oldest player to ever win a Super Bowl at age 41, while Bill Belichick would be the oldest coach to ever win a Super Bowl at age 66.[124] Wide receiver Julian Edelman was named Super Bowl MVP.[125] In Super Bowl LIV, the Chiefs defeated the 49ers in a comeback, 31–20, for their first Super Bowl title in 50 years.[126] This victory marked the first time since 1991 that the NFC did not have more Super Bowl victories than the AFC. Notable was the absence of the Patriots, who after making it to the Super Bowl the last three years and winning two of them, had lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs, being bested by the Tennessee Titans 20–13.[127][128] That game represented Tom Brady's final game as a New England Patriot.[129] In Super Bowl LV, which took place in Tampa, Florida, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the defending champion Chiefs, 31–9.[130][131] No player on the Buccaneers who scored points (Rob Gronkowski, Antonio Brown, Leonard Fournette and Ryan Succop) was on the Buccaneers' roster the previous season.[132] This marked a record seventh Super Bowl victory for Tom Brady, also more than any individual NFL franchise, and who would also break his own record for the oldest quarterback to win a championship at 43 years old.[133][134] Tampa Bay head coach Bruce Arians would also break Bill Belichick's record for the oldest head coach to win a championship at 68.[135] Super Bowl LV also marked the first time in the history of the modern league that a host city's professional football franchise got to play in a Super Bowl that was hosted in their home stadium.[136] A year later in Inglewood, California, the Los Angeles Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 23–20 to win Super Bowl LVI, becoming the second team to win the Super Bowl in its home stadium.[137] On February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, the Chiefs overcame a 10-point deficit at halftime to defeat the Philadelphia Eagles 38–35, winning Super Bowl LVII on a last-minute field goal.[138] On February 11, 2024, the Chiefs won Super Bowl LVIII at Allegiant Stadium on an overtime touchdown. The first Super Bowl in Las Vegas, this was a rematch of Super Bowl LIV between the 49ers and the Chiefs, and was the Chiefs' fourth Super Bowl appearance in five years. The second Super Bowl to go into overtime, the Chiefs came back from another 10-point deficit to win their third Super Bowl in five years and secure back-to-back championships for the first time since the 2004 New England Patriots.[139] The Super Bowl is one of the most-watched annual sporting events in the world, with viewership overwhelmingly domestic.[2] The only other annual event that gathers more viewers is the UEFA Champions League final.[2] For many years, the Super Bowl has possessed a large US and global television viewership, and it is often the most-watched United States originating television program of the year.[140] The game tends to have a high Nielsen television rating, which is usually around a 40 rating and 60 shares. This means that, on average, more than 100 million people from the United States alone are tuned into the Super Bowl at any given moment. In press releases preceding the game, the NFL has claimed that the Super Bowl has a potential worldwide audience of around one billion people in over 200 countries.[141] However, this figure refers to the number of people able to watch the game, not the number of people who will actually be watching. Regardless, the statements have been frequently misinterpreted in the media as referring to the latter figure, leading to a misperception about the game's actual global audience.[142][143] The New York-based media research firm Initiative measured the global audience for the Super Bowl XXXIX at 93 million people, with 98 percent of that figure being viewers in North America, which meant roughly two million people outside North America watched the Super Bowl that year.[142] Super Bowl LVIII holds the record for average number of US viewers, with 123.7 million, making the game the most-viewed television broadcast of any kind in American history. The halftime show set a record with 129.2 million viewers tuning in.[144] The highest-rated game according to Nielsen was Super Bowl XVI in 1982, which was watched in 49.1% of households (73 shares), or 40,020,000 households at the time. Super Bowl XVI still ranks fourth on Nielsen's list of top-rated programs of all time, with three other Super Bowls (XVII, XX, and XLIX) in the top ten. Famous Super Bowl commercials include the 1984 introduction of Apple's Macintosh computer, the Budweiser \"Bud Bowl\" campaign, and the dot-com ads aired during Super Bowl XXXIV. As the television ratings of the Super Bowl have steadily increased over the years, commercial prices have also increased, with advertisers paying as much as $7 million for a thirty-second spot during Super Bowl LVI in 2022.[145] A segment of the audience tunes into the Super Bowl solely to view commercials.[146] In 2010, Nielsen reported that 51 percent of Super Bowl viewers tune in for the commercials.[147] Since 1991, the Super Bowl has begun between 6:19 and 6:40 PM EST so that most of the game is played during the primetime hours on the East Coast.[148] Throughout most of its history, the Super Bowl has been rotated annually between the same American television networks that broadcast the NFL's regular season and postseason games. Super Bowl I, played in 1967, is the only Super Bowl to have been broadcast in the United States by two different broadcasters simultaneously. At the time, NBC held the rights to nationally televise AFL games while CBS had the rights to broadcast NFL games. Both networks were allowed to cover the game, and each network used its own announcers, but NBC was only allowed to use the CBS feed instead of producing its own.[149][150] Beginning with Super Bowl II, NBC televised the game in even years and CBS in odd years. This annual rotation between the two networks continued through the 1970 AFL–NFL merger when NBC was given the rights to televise AFC games and CBS winning the rights to broadcast NFC games. Although ABC began broadcasting Monday Night Football in 1970, it was not added to the Super Bowl rotation until Super Bowl XIX, played in 1985. ABC, CBS and NBC then continued to rotate the Super Bowl until 1994, when Fox replaced CBS as the NFC broadcaster. CBS then took NBC's place in the rotation after the former replaced the latter as the AFC broadcaster in 1998. As a result of new contracts signed in 2006, with NBC taking over Sunday Night Football from ESPN, and Monday Night Football moving from ABC to ESPN, NBC took ABC's place in the Super Bowl rotation. The rotation between CBS, Fox, and NBC will continue until the new contracts that will take effect for the first time with Super Bowl LVIII, allowing ABC to return and starting a four-network rotation.[151] The four-year rotation beginning with Super Bowl LVIII also allows each broadcaster to offer simulcasts or alternative broadcasts on its sister networks and platforms.[151] CBS's sister network Nickelodeon is planning to air an alternate children-oriented telecast of Super Bowl LVIII.[152] And ABC's rights include ESPN simulcasts and alternative broadcasts on other ESPN networks.[151] The NFL has broken the traditional broadcasting rotation if it can be used to bolster other major sporting events a network airs afterwards.[153][154][155] For example, CBS was given Super Bowl XXVI (1992) after it won the rights to air the 1992 Winter Olympics, with NBC subsequently airing Super Bowl XXVII (1993) and Super Bowl XXVIII (1994) in consecutive years. Likewise, NBC aired Super Bowl LVI (2022) instead of CBS during the 2022 Winter Olympics, which were also aired by NBC.[155] CBS received Super Bowl LV (2021) in return.[155] Under the four-network rotation that will take effect beginning in 2024, the league will award NBC the Super Bowl during Winter Olympic years.[151] The first six Super Bowls were blacked out in the television markets of the host cities, due to league restrictions then in place. Super Bowl VII (1973) was telecast in Los Angeles on an experimental basis after all tickets were sold ten days before the game.[156] Game analyst John Madden is the only person to broadcast a Super Bowl for each of the four networks that have televised the game (five with CBS, three with Fox, two with ABC, and one with NBC). Note: Years listed are the year the game was actually played (will be played[ˇ]) rather than what NFL season it is considered to have been. ^ *: The current TV contract with the networks expires after the 2033 season (or in early 2034). Under the deal, the Super Bowl is currently rotated annually between CBS, Fox, NBC, and ABC in that order. ABC will return to the rotation in the upcoming contract, which is scheduled to take effect at the start of the 2023 season.[151] ^ **: The first Super Bowl was simultaneously broadcast by CBS and NBC, with each network using the same video feed (from CBS), but providing its own commentary. The Super Bowl provides an extremely strong lead-in to programming following it on the same channel, the effects of which can last for several hours. For instance, in discussing the ratings of a local TV station, Buffalo television critic Alan Pergament noted that following Super Bowl XLVII, which aired on CBS: \"A paid program that ran on CBS 4 (WIVB-TV) at 2:30 in the morning had a 1.3 rating. That's higher than some CW prime time shows get on WNLO-TV, Channel 4's sister station.\"[157] Because of this strong coattail effect, the network that airs the Super Bowl typically takes advantage of the large audience to air an episode of a hit series or to premiere the pilot of a promising new one in the lead-out slot, which immediately follows the Super Bowl and post-game coverage. Initially, it was sort of a novelty and so it didn't quite feel right. But it was just like, this is the year ... Bands of our generation, you can sort of be seen on a stage like this or, like, not seen. There's not a lot of middle places. It is a tremendous venue. Early Super Bowls featured a halftime show consisting of marching bands from local colleges or high schools; but as the popularity of the game increased, a trend emerged where popular singers and musicians performed during its pre-game ceremonies and the halftime show, or simply sang the national anthem of the United States, \"America the Beautiful\", or \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\".[159] The U.S. national anthem has been performed at all but one Super Bowl: Super Bowl XI in 1977 when Vikki Carr sang \"America the Beautiful\" in place of the anthem. Beginning with Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, \"America the Beautiful\" is sung before the national anthem every year and is followed by the presentation of the colors and a military flyover preceded the anthem. Beginning with Super Bowl LV in 2021, \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" is sung prior to \"America the Beautiful\" in honor of Black History Month. For many years, Whitney Houston's performance of the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV in 1991, during the Gulf War, had long been regarded as one of the best renditions of the anthem in history.[160][161][162] Before Super Bowl XLVIII, soprano Renée Fleming became the first opera singer to perform the anthem. Recently,[when?] the winner of the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award has been acknowledged before \"America the Beautiful\" and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Since Super Bowl XII in 1978, a former football player, a celebrity, or another special guest participates in the coin toss ceremony to recognize their community involvement or significance. The pre-game ceremonies usually go in the following order:[163] Unlike regular season or playoff games, thirty minutes are allocated for the Super Bowl halftime. After a special live episode of the Fox sketch comedy series In Living Color caused a drop in viewership for the Super Bowl XXVI halftime show, the NFL sought to increase the Super Bowl's audience by hiring A-list talent to perform. They approached Michael Jackson, whose performance the following year drew higher figures than the game itself.[164][165] Another notable performance came during Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002, when U2 performed; during their third song, \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", the band played under a large projection screen which scrolled through names of the victims of the September 11 attacks. The halftime show of Super Bowl XXXVIII attracted controversy, following an incident in which Justin Timberlake removed a piece of Janet Jackson's top, briefly exposing one of her breasts before the broadcast quickly cut away from the shot. The incident led to fines being issued by the FCC (and a larger crackdown over \"indecent\" content broadcast on television), and MTV (then a sister to the game's broadcaster that year, CBS, under Viacom) being banned by the NFL from producing the Super Bowl halftime show in the future. In an effort to prevent a repeat of the incident, the NFL held a moratorium on Super Bowl halftime shows featuring pop performers, and instead invited a single, headlining veteran act, such as Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Prince, and Bruce Springsteen. This practice ended at Super Bowl XLV, which returned to using current pop acts such as the Black Eyed Peas, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga.[166][167] Minnesota Vikings announcer Alan Roach is the official public address announcer of the Super Bowl since Super Bowl XL in 2006, with the exceptions of Super Bowl XLVIII, XLIX and 50 when the Denver Broncos played in those games. Roach was also Denver's regular P.A. announcer during those years, and thus the league felt it was a potential competitive advantage. In those years, NFL on Westwood One host and NFL Films voice Scott Graham held the duties.[168] Excluding Super Bowl XXXIX, the famous \"I'm going to Disney World!\" advertising campaign took place in every Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXI in 1987, when quarterback Phil Simms from the Giants became the first player to say the tagline. As of Super Bowl LVIII, 29 of 58 Super Bowls have been played in three metropolitan areas: the Greater Miami area (eleven times),[169] New Orleans (ten times), and the Greater Los Angeles area (eight times). No market or region without an active NFL franchise has ever hosted a Super Bowl, and the presence of an NFL team in a market or region is now a de jure requirement for bidding on the game.[170][171] For instance, while Los Angeles has been an eight-time host city, with its most recent being Super Bowl LVI in 2022, it did not host one from the departure of both its NFL teams in 1995 until the Rams and the Chargers subsequently came back to Los Angeles in 2016 and 2017 respectively. The Caesars Superdome in New Orleans has hosted seven Super Bowls, the most of any venue, with an eighth Super Bowl scheduled to take place in 2025. The Orange Bowl was the only AFL stadium to host a Super Bowl and the only stadium to host consecutive Super Bowls, hosting Super Bowls II and III. Seven Super Bowls have been held in a stadium other than the one the NFL team in that city was using at the time, a situation that has not arisen after Super Bowl XXVII's host stadium was selected on March 19, 1991. This was as the winning market was previously not required to host the Super Bowl in the same stadium that its NFL team used, if the stadium in which the Super Bowl was held was perceived to be a better stadium for a large high-profile event than the existing NFL home stadium in the same city; for example, five of Los Angeles's Bowls were played at the Rose Bowl, which has never been used by any NFL franchise outside of the Super Bowl. Besides the Rose Bowl, the only other Super Bowl venues that were not the home stadium to NFL teams at the time were Rice Stadium (the Houston Oilers had played in Rice Stadium previously but moved to the Astrodome several years before Super Bowl VIII) and Stanford Stadium. Starting with the selection of the Super Bowl XXVIII venue on May 23, 1990, the league has given preference in awarding the Super Bowl to brand new or recently renovated NFL stadiums, alongside a trend of teams demanding public money or relocating to play in new stadiums. To date only two teams have qualified for a Super Bowl at their home stadiums: the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who won Super Bowl LV hosted at Raymond James Stadium (selected on May 23, 2017), and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams the following season, who won Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium. Before that, the closest any team had come to accomplishing this feat were the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, who reached the NFC Championship Game but lost to the Eagles. In that instance, U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season (which the Vikings won); all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium hosted another playoff game in the same postseason were all Wild Card games. Two teams have played the Super Bowl in their home market but at a different venue than their home stadium: the Los Angeles Rams, who lost Super Bowl XIV in the Rose Bowl instead of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum; and the 49ers, who won Super Bowl XIX in Stanford Stadium instead of Candlestick Park, during a time when the league often picked a stadium that was not home to an NFL team to host the Super Bowl (see above). Traditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50 °F (10 °C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.[172] Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit area—Super Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit; two in Minneapolis—Super Bowl XXVI at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and Super Bowl LII at the U.S. Bank Stadium; one in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium for Super Bowl XLVI; and one in New Jersey—Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium. Only MetLife Stadium did not have a roof (be it fixed or retractable) but it was still picked as the host stadium for Super Bowl XLVIII in an apparent waiver of the warm-climate rule, with a contingency plan to reschedule the game in the event of heavy snowfall.[173] MetLife Stadium's selection over Sun Life Stadium generated controversy as the league requested a roof to be added to Sun Life Stadium (a venue afflicted with a heavy rainstorm during Super Bowl XLI) in order to be considered for future Super Bowls, which was done during a remodeling from 2015 into 2016. It then hosted Super Bowl LIV, and is scheduled to host Super Bowl LXIV.[174] There have been a few instances where the league has rescinded the Super Bowl from cities. Super Bowl XXVII in 1993 was originally awarded to Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona, but after Arizona voters elected not to recognize Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a paid state employees' holiday in 1990, the NFL moved the game to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.[175] When voters in Arizona opted to create such a legal holiday in 1992, Super Bowl XXX in 1996 was awarded to Tempe. Super Bowl XXXIII was awarded first to Candlestick Park in San Francisco, but when plans to renovate the stadium fell through, the game was moved to Pro Player Stadium in greater Miami. Super Bowl XXXVII was awarded to a new stadium not yet built in San Francisco, but when that stadium failed to be built, the game was moved to Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego. Super Bowl XLIV, slated for February 7, 2010, was withdrawn from New York City's proposed West Side Stadium, because the city, state, and proposed tenants (New York Jets) could not agree on funding. Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 was originally given to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box (a renovation proposal had passed successfully, but a second ballot question to add a rolling roof structure to be shared with Kaufmann Stadium critical for the game to be hosted was rejected), and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.[176] Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years before the event. The game has never been played in a metropolitan area that lacked an NFL franchise at the time the game was played, although in 2007 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.[177] Through Super Bowl LVI, teams were allowed to bid for the rights to host Super Bowls, where cities submitted proposals to host a Super Bowl and were evaluated in terms of stadium renovation and their ability to host, but this competition was rescinded in 2018.[needs update][172][178] The league has made all decisions regarding hosting sites from Super Bowl LVII onward; the league chose a potential venue unilaterally, the chosen team put together a hosting proposal, and the league voted upon it to determine if it is acceptable.[179] In 2014, a document listing the specific requirements of Super Bowl hosts was leaked, giving a clear list of what was required for a Super Bowl host.[180] Some of the host requirements include: Much of the cost of a Super Bowl is to be assumed by the host community, although some costs are enumerated within the requirements to be assumed by the NFL. New Orleans, the site of Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, invested more than $1 billion in infrastructure improvements in the years leading up to the game.[182] The NFL allocates backup stadiums for the Super Bowl every year, in the event of a last-minute relocation of the game.[183] The designated \"home team\" alternates between the NFC team in odd-numbered games and the AFC team in even-numbered games.[184][185] This alternation was initiated with the first Super Bowl, when the Packers were the designated home team. Regardless of being the home or away team of record, each team has their team logo and wordmark painted in one of the end zones. Designated away teams have won 32 of 58 Super Bowls to date (approximately 55%). Since Super Bowl XIII in 1979, the home team is given the choice of wearing their colored or white jerseys. Originally, the designated home team had to wear their colored jerseys, which resulted in the Cowboys donning their less exposed[discuss] dark blue jerseys for Super Bowl V. While most of the home teams in the Super Bowl have chosen to wear their colored jerseys, there have been seven exceptions: the Cowboys during Super Bowls XIII and XXVII, the Washington Redskins during Super Bowl XVII, the Steelers during Super Bowl XL, the Broncos during Super Bowl 50, the Patriots in Super Bowl LII, and the Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV. The Cowboys, since 1964, have worn white jerseys at home. The Washington Redskins wore white at home under coach Joe Gibbs starting in 1981 through 1992, continued by Richie Petitbon and Norv Turner through 2000, then again when Gibbs returned from 2004 through 2007. Meanwhile, the Steelers, who have always worn their black jerseys at home since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970, opted for the white jerseys after winning three consecutive playoff games on the road, wearing white. The Steelers' decision was compared with the Patriots in Super Bowl XX; the Patriots had worn white jerseys at home during the 1985 season, but after winning road playoff games against the Jets and Dolphins wearing red jerseys, New England opted to switch to scarlet for the Super Bowl as the designated home team. For the Broncos in Super Bowl 50, Denver general manager John Elway simply stated, \"We've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms\"; they previously had been 0–4 in Super Bowls when wearing their orange jerseys.[186][187] The Broncos' decision is also perceived to be made out of superstition, losing all Super Bowl games with the orange jerseys in terrible fashion. It is unclear why the Patriots chose to wear their white jerseys for Super Bowl LII. During the pairing of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, New England has mostly worn their blue jerseys for home games, but have worn white for a home game in the 2008, 2010, and 2011 seasons.[188] The Patriots were 3–0 in their white uniforms in Super Bowls before Super Bowl LII with Belichick and Brady,[189][190] and they may have been going on recent trends of teams who wear white for the Super Bowl game.[191][192][193] For Super Bowl LV, when the Buccaneers became the first team to reach the Super Bowl that their own stadium hosted, the Bucs coincidentally were designated the home team as per AFC-NFC rotation and elected to wear their white jerseys, having previously won both their divisional and championship post-season games on the road in white jerseys.[194] White-shirted teams have won 37 of 58 Super Bowls to date (approximately 64%). The only teams to win in their dark-colored uniform in more recent years are the Packers against the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV, the Eagles against the Patriots in Super Bowl LII, and the Chiefs against the 49ers in Super Bowls LIV and LVIII.[195] Since Super Bowl XXXIX, teams in white jerseys have won 16 of the last 20 Super Bowls. The 49ers, as part of the league's 75th Anniversary celebration, used their 1955 throwback uniform in Super Bowl XXIX, which for that year was their regular home jersey. The Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII wore their royal blue and yellow uniforms, which was a throwback uniform but then turned into their primary colors over the navy blue and metallic gold uniform, which they have previously worn for six home games including a home playoff game.[196] No team has yet worn a third jersey or Color Rush uniform for the Super Bowl. The 49ers reportedly requested to wear an all-white third jersey ensemble for Super Bowl LIV, which the San Francisco Chronicle noted they could do with special permission from the league; the league never granted such permission, and the 49ers instead opted for their standard uniform of white jerseys with gold pants.[197] Fifteen different regions have hosted Super Bowls. Note: Years listed are the year the game was actually played (or will be played[ˇ]; future games are denoted through italics) rather than what NFL season it is considered to have been. A total of 27 different stadiums have either hosted, or are scheduled to host, a Super Bowl, with 14 of the stadiums having hosted, or are scheduled to host, more than one Super Bowl. Seven of the Super Bowl hosting stadiums have been demolished. The years listed in the table below are the years the game was actually played (will be played[ˇ]) rather than the NFL season it concluded. ^ ^: Stadium has since been demolished. ^ ‡: Prior to the incorporation of Miami Gardens in 2003, the stadium was in unincorporated Miami-Dade County. ^ ††: The original Stanford Stadium, which hosted Super Bowl XIX, was demolished and a new stadium constructed on the site in 2006. ^ ˇ: Future Super Bowls, also denoted by italics. The Super Bowl has not yet been played in any region that lacked an NFL or AFL franchise at the time the game was played.[199] San Diego is the only metropolitan area as of 2021 that has hosted past Super Bowls, but does not currently have an NFL franchise: San Diego Stadium hosted three Super Bowls before their NFL franchise relocated to Los Angeles. Also, London, England, has occasionally been mentioned as a host city for a Super Bowl in the near future.[200] Wembley Stadium has hosted several NFL games as part of the NFL International Series and is specifically designed for large, individual events, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has openly discussed the possibility on different occasions.[201][202][203][204] Time zone complications are a significant obstacle to a Super Bowl in London; a typical 6:30 p.m. EST start would result in the game beginning at 11:30 p.m. local time in London: this is an unusually late hour to be holding spectator sports, while the NFL has never in its history started a game later than 9:15 p.m. local time.[204] Although bids have been submitted for all Super Bowls through Super Bowl LIX, the soonest that any stadium outside the NFL's footprint could serve as host would be Super Bowl LXII in 2028.[205] Eight stadiums that hosted at least one Super Bowl no longer exist: The NFL very actively seeks to prevent what it calls unauthorized commercial use of its trademarked terms \"NFL\", \"Super Bowl\", and \"Super Bowl Sunday\".[206] As a result, many events and promotions tied to the game, but not sanctioned by the NFL, are asked to refer to it as \"The Big Game\", or other generic descriptions.[207][208] A radio spot for Planters nuts parodied this, by saying \"it would be super ... to have a bowl ... of Planters nuts while watching the big game!\" and comedian Stephen Colbert began referring to the game in 2014 as the \"Superb Owl\". In 2015, the NFL filed opposition with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to a trademark application submitted by an Arizona-based nonprofit for \"Superb Owl\".[209] Another entity has a service mark for \"Superb Owl.\"[210] The NFL claims that the use of the phrase \"Super Bowl\" implies an NFL affiliation, and on this basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown publicly; for example, the league says Super Bowl showings are prohibited in churches or at other events that \"promote a message\", while non-sporting event venues are also prohibited to show the Super Bowl on any television screen larger than 55 inches.[211] Some critics say the NFL is exaggerating its ownership rights by stating that \"any use is prohibited\", as this contradicts the broad doctrine of fair use in the United States.[211] Legislation was proposed by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in 2008 \"to provide an exemption from exclusive rights in copyright for certain nonprofit organizations to display live football games\", and \"for other purposes\".[212] In 2004, the NFL started issuing cease-and-desist letters to casinos in Las Vegas that were hosting Super Bowl parties. \"Super Bowl\" is a registered trademark, owned by the NFL, and any other business using that name for profit-making ventures is in violation of federal law, according to the letters. In reaction to the letters, many Las Vegas resorts, rather than discontinue the popular and lucrative parties, started referring to them as \"Big Game Parties\".[213][214][215] In 2006, the NFL made an attempt to trademark \"The Big Game\" as well; however, it withdrew the application in 2007 due to growing commercial and public relations opposition to the move, mostly from Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley and their fans, as the Stanford Cardinal football and California Golden Bears football teams compete in the Big Game, which has been played since 1892 (28 years before the formation of the NFL and 75 years before Super Bowl I).[216] Additionally, the Mega Millions lottery game was known as The Big Game (then The Big Game Mega Millions) from 1996 to 2002.[217]",

The best team from the National Football Conference plays the best team from the American Football Conference to win the Vince Lombardi Trophy, which was named after the first coach to win a Super Bowl. For most American football fans, it is a very special event. Some people who do not like American football still watch it for the television advertisements and the half-time show. The TV advertisements during Super Bowl are the most expensive in the world in per second value. Because of the high cost of advertising, companies usually produce unique advertisements. As a result, watching advertisements has been a well publicized event in itself.[1] The Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots are the teams with the most Super Bowl Wins with six victories each. The San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys currently are tied for the second-most Super Bowl wins with five.[2] The Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, and the Jacksonville Jaguars have never played in a Super Bowl.[3] The New York Jets have not played in the Super Bowl since the American Football League (AFL) and the NFL joined together in 1970.

                "content": "On January 1, 2025, at approximately 8:39 a.m., the contents of the Tesla Cybertruck containing fireworks, exploded outside the main entrance of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas in Paradise, Nevada, United States. The explosion killed one person inside the vehicle and injured seven others. Authorities found that the truck contained firework materials and gas canisters. The cause of the explosion, including whether it was intentional, remains under investigation. At approximately 7:30 a.m. PST, a 2024 Tesla Cybertruck arrived in Las Vegas. The truck had been rented in Colorado using the Turo app, and authorities suspect it had been fitted with a detonation system composed of fireworks, gas tanks and camping fuel.[1] At 8:39 a.m., the driver parked the truck in the porte cochère of Trump International Hotel Las Vegas where it exploded and caught fire.[2] The first reports of a fire were received two minutes later.[3] First responders appeared within four minutes and extinguished the fire within an hour.[4] The vehicle had been functioning properly, according to Tesla chief executive Elon Musk.[5] The hotel was evacuated, with most of the guests moved to different locations.[6][2] Seven bystanders suffered minor injuries, two of whom were taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada.[7] All seven people were reported to be in stable condition.[8] The driver of the vehicle was killed. He was later identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as 37-year-old Matthew Alan Livelsberger from Colorado Springs, Colorado, a United States Army soldier since 2006 who was on approved leave at the time of the explosion.[9] Livelsberger was born and raised in Bucyrus, Ohio, and served in the Army for 19 years and was in active duty in the United States Army Special Forces at the time of his death. He was deployed in several countries, including Afghanistan, Ukraine, and Georgia, and received several commendations for his service.[10] He was last serving in Germany but was on leave in Colorado, disappearing until the Cybertruck explosion event according to his wife. He also owned several addresses within Colorado Springs.[11] The Federal Bureau of Investigation began investigating the explosion the same day.[4] Given that the explosion was caused by \"fireworks-style mortars\" and fuel, as opposed to a fault with the vehicle's lithium-ion battery, the incident is being investigated as a possible terrorist attack. President Joe Biden was briefed on the event.[12] Investigators are also exploring any possible connection with the New Orleans truck attack that occurred hours earlier and in which the same car-sharing application was used.[13][14] Tesla is independently investigating the incident.[13][15]",

Skattebo can go from star to legend by leading the Sun Devils to a Peach Bowl upset of Texas. Arizona State enters the game as the largest underdog of the four College Football Playoff quarterfinal games, but Skattebo and the rest of the Sun Devils' offense looked like a juggernaut on their way to a Big 12 title. As Skattebo plays the biggest game of his career, it's important to know the most important details about him — including how to pronounce his name. Here's a guide to pronouncing Skattebo's name and a look at his background. SN's PLAYOFF HQ: Live CFP scores | Updated CFP bracket | Full CFP schedule Skattebo's last name is pronounced \"SKAT-eh-boo.\" While the end of the name looks like it should be pronounced \"boh,\" it's actually pronounced as \"boo.\" It's not the most difficult name as far as college football players go, but it's easy to get tripped up on that last syllable. Arizona State's player profile for Skattebo emphasizes that the end of the name is \"pronounced BOO.\" MORE: Ranking best NFL Draft prospects in CFP Skattebo was born in Rio Linda, Calif. and played at Rio Linda High School. Details on Skattebo's family history are limited, but his father has long lived in the Sacramento area and works in the pest control industry. The powerful running back initially stayed in-state, starting his college career at FCS Sacramento State. While his coach, Troy Taylor, was hired by Stanford after the 2022 season, Skattebo went elsewhere in the Pac-12 and latched on with a newly hired Kenny Dillingham at Arizona State. Dillingham found a way to unlock Skattebo's full potential this season, as the senior racked up more than 2,000 scrimmage yards and forced himself into the Heisman conversation even if winning it never seemed realistic. MORE: College Football Playoff picks, predictions against the spread for CFP Skattebo's freshman season at Sacramento State was cancelled, but he got on the field in 2021 and took on a major role in 2022 with more than 1,700 scrimmage yards. After transferring to Arizona State, Skattebo posted a quiet 783 yards on the ground as the top running back in a shaky Sun Devils offense. Just as he did in his second season at Sacramento State, Skattebo broke out in 2024. With 2,074 total yards and 22 touchdowns entering the College Football Playoff, the senior etched his name in Arizona State history.

We'll send your free family report and tips to find out more The lion symbol represents the ferocious nature of family members, their bravery and valor. It is one of the oldest symbols in heraldry and is considered to be one of the most desirable to have on a coat of arms. The 'bordure' edge around the shield is a mark of difference used to identify separate families that hold similar coat of arms designs. It is one that became a distinctive mark of pride over time for those families that used one. The black color (known as Sable) symbolizes constancy and the enduring nature of the family. It is a symbol of family longevity through time. The red color (known as Gules) traditionally symbolized martyrdom and the historic military strength of family members when called upon in times of war. Skattebo is a surname of Norwegian origin, possibly derived from geographic features or historical references in Norway. The name may indicate a connection to specific locations or a heritage linked to farming or land ownership, reflecting the family’s roots in Scandinavian culture. Family crests and coats of arms emerged during the Middle Ages, mostly in wider Europe. They were used as a way to identify knights and nobles on the battlefield and in tournaments. The designs were unique to each family and were passed down from generation to generation. The earliest crests were simple designs, such as a single animal or symbol, but they became more elaborate over time. Coats of arms were also developed, which included a shield with the family crest, as well as other symbols and colors that represented the family's history and achievements. The use of family crests and coats of arms spread throughout Europe and became a symbol of social status and identity. They were often displayed on clothing, armor, and flags, and were used to mark the family's property and possessions. Today, family crests and coats of arms are still used as a way to honor and celebrate family heritage. Variations of the family name Skattebo can be intriguing, reflecting linguistic shifts and cultural adaptations across different countries. In the 17th century, the name saw variations like Skatteberg in Sweden, which emerged through the phonetic blending of regional dialects. As the 18th century progressed, migration patterns led to the variation Skattaboe in the Netherlands, where the double vowel was influenced by Dutch phonetics. Meanwhile, in the early 19th century, the name evolved into Skatibo in parts of Eastern Europe, showcasing Slavic suffixes that adapted the original structure. By the late 19th century, in America, the name transformed into Skattybo, often influenced by a desire for simplicity and ease of pronunciation among English speakers. Each variation tells a story of cultural exchange, phonetic evolution, and the adaptability of family identities through time and geography. Learn how to find your family crest.

                "content": "Jeremiah Smith (born November 29, 2005) is an American football wide receiver for the Ohio State Buckeyes. He was the top ranked recruit in the 2024 recruiting class, and the highest rated wide receiver recruit in history. Smith was born on November 29, 2005, in Miami Gardens, Florida.[1] He grew up in Hollywood, Florida, and attended Chaminade-Madonna College Preparatory School.[2] He had 31 receptions for 667 yards and seven touchdowns in his sophomore season.[3][4] Smith caught 58 passes for 1,073 yards and 20 touchdowns as a junior.[5] He also won the FHSAA Class 2A state championship in the 110 and the 400-meter hurdles during his junior year.[6] During his senior season, Smith was named All-American, and won the All-American Bowl Player of the Year Award.[7] Smith was rated a five-star recruit and the top ranked prospect of the incoming 2024 college football class.[8][9][10] Smith was the highest ranked wide receiver recruit in the modern recruiting era (2000-present), surpassing Dorial Green-Beckham and Julio Jones.[11] Smith committed to play at Ohio State over offers from Florida, Florida State, Georgia, Miami, and USC.[12][13] In his college debut against the Akron Zips, Smith recorded six receptions for 92 yards and two touchdowns, leading the team in yardage for that game in a 52–6 win for Ohio State.[14] Smith was named Big Ten Conference Freshman of the Week after recording six touches for 102 yards and two touchdowns in a win against Michigan State.[15] On January 1st 2025, Jeremiah had 2 receiving touchdowns in an MVP performance against the Oregon Ducks in the 2025 Rose Bowl. Smith is the cousin of NFL quarterback Geno Smith.[16]",

                "title": "Ohio State’s Jeremiah Smith: The Freshman Phenom Who Could Force the NFL to Rethink Its Eligibility Rules - Motorcycle Sports",
                "content": "Ohio State Buckeyes wide receiver Jeremiah Smith (4) puts on his champtionship hat following the College Football Playoff quarterfinal against the Oregon Ducks at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. on Jan. 1, 2025. Ohio State won 41-21. The NFL’s longstanding rule requiring players to be three years removed from high school before entering the draft has rarely faced serious scrutiny. But then, Ohio State freshman wide receiver Jeremiah Smith burst onto the scene. After a record-shattering season and a Rose Bowl performance for the ages, the 19-year-old phenom has ignited a debate: Should the NFL reconsider its eligibility rules? Smith’s blend of size (6-foot-3, 215 pounds), speed, and skill has drawn comparisons to Hall of Fame-caliber receivers like Julio Jones. Against Oregon in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals, Smith delivered a jaw-dropping stat line: seven receptions, 187 yards, and two touchdowns, earning him Rose Bowl Offensive MVP honors. Oregon head coach Dan Lanning, whose defense was torched in a 41-21 loss, didn’t mince words: “Smith is NFL-ready.” This wasn’t a one-off performance. In his freshman season, Smith smashed Ohio State’s rookie records with 70 receptions, 1,224 yards, and 14 touchdown catches. He recorded five games with 100 or more receiving yards and became a cornerstone of the Buckeyes’ high-powered offense. If he were eligible for the 2025 NFL Draft, experts like Dane Brugler of The Athletic believe Smith would be the No. 1 overall pick. The NFL’s three-year rule was designed with player development and safety in mind. Most 18- and 19-year-olds aren’t physically or mentally ready for the rigors of professional football. However, Smith is an exception to the rule—an athlete whose maturity and skill set already rival many NFL players. The rule also faces historical precedent. In 2003, former Ohio State running back Maurice Clarett sued the NFL in an attempt to enter the draft early. Despite initial success, an appellate court ruled in favor of the NFL, and the Supreme Court upheld the decision. Clarett’s career never recovered, serving as a cautionary tale for those challenging the system. Yet Smith’s situation is different. Clarett’s case was clouded by controversy, whereas Smith has been nothing but a standout athlete and team leader. His dominance as a freshman suggests that his development is already years ahead of his peers. Revising the NFL’s eligibility rules wouldn’t just impact prodigies like Smith—it could reshape the league. Allowing exceptional freshmen to enter the draft would introduce young, marketable stars to teams sooner, potentially driving fan engagement and revenue. It could also influence how college football programs develop players, prioritizing readiness for the pros over long-term collegiate careers. However, critics argue that opening the door for freshmen could flood the draft with underdeveloped players, many of whom wouldn’t be ready for the physical demands of the NFL. Teams would need to expand their scouting efforts to identify true outliers like Smith. For now, Smith has no choice but to wait. He’ll continue to dominate at Ohio State, likely rewriting record books and solidifying his case as one of the best wide receiver prospects in recent memory. By the time the 2027 NFL Draft rolls around, Smith could enter the league as a polished, generational talent. But his meteoric rise should serve as a wake-up call for the NFL. The league has evolved over the decades, adapting to changes in athlete performance, fan expectations, and player safety. Revisiting the eligibility rule to accommodate rare talents like Smith wouldn’t just benefit exceptional players—it could elevate the game itself.

While his early-season highlights certainly put him higher on the national radar, Smith has stood out since high school. Entering this season, he already stood out as one of the most talented players of any position set to debut this year. A post shared by The Sporting News (@sportingnews) Smith has met expectations so far and clearly has a bright future ahead of him. But who is he? Here's everything to know about Smith, the Ohio State true freshman pass-catcher who is the Buckeyes' 2024 breakout star. MORE: College football scores and results from every Week 5 game Growing up in South Florida, Smith made a name for himself as a member of the Chaminade-Madonna Prep varsity football team. He was named the Maxwell Award High School Player of the Year and MaxPreps Florida Player of the Year his senior season, and he also won the Nat Moore Trophy—an honor given to the top high school player in Miami-Dade, Broward and Monroe counties. In his final two seasons with the Lions, Smith caught 151 passes for 2,474 yards and 39 touchdowns while playing 28 games. In 2023, Chaminade-Madonna Prep was the nation’s No. 2-ranked team and finished the season undefeated as state champions. Oh, and Smith also ran track, qualifying for the 110- and 400-meter hurdles at states three times and capturing gold medals in both races at Florida's 1A meet his junior year. A rare talent, Smith became the first wide receiver to earn a No. 1 overall ranking in the 247Sports composite in over a decade. The last pass-catcher to do so was Dorial Green-Beckham in 2012, who eventually had a short career in the NFL. Naturally, Smith was a five-star prospect on every major recruiting service, too. Drawing comparisons to Julio Jones, Smith accumulated 40 offers and ended up visiting five schools throughout his recruiting process. Eventually, he narrowed it down to two: Miami and Ohio State. The 6-3, 215 pound wide receiver committed to be a Buckeye in 2022 but did not sign his letter of intent until the following December, giving him time to pay the Canes a visit. But he stuck with Ohio State, enrolling in February and becoming integral member of the team's offense in 2024. \"The way they care about their players on and off the field,\" Smith said. \"They're one of the best for their players. It's a family up there in Ohio. Thanksgiving, you know, they'll have their players come over and eat with them, stuff like that. So, I mean, it's definitely a brotherhood up there in Columbus for sure.\" MORE: ESPN ranks Ohio State's Jeremiah Smith top college football freshman An established threat through the air, Smith has enjoyed an impressive start to his true freshman season. Here's a look at how Smith has performed so far through his first six games. Smith started the College Football Playoff with a bang, hauling in a 37-yard touchdown pass from Will Howard before adding an 18-yard grab on the following drive.

                "title": "Radium - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Radium is a chemical element; it has symbol Ra and atomic number 88. It is the sixth element in group 2 of the periodic table, also known as the alkaline earth metals. Pure radium is silvery-white, but it readily reacts with nitrogen (rather than oxygen) upon exposure to air, forming a black surface layer of radium nitride (Ra3N2). All isotopes of radium are radioactive, the most stable isotope being radium-226 with a half-life of 1,600 years. When radium decays, it emits ionizing radiation as a by-product, which can excite fluorescent chemicals and cause radioluminescence. For this property, it was widely used in self-luminous paints following its discovery. Of the radioactive elements that occur in quantity, radium is considered particularly toxic, and it is carcinogenic due to the radioactivity of both it and its immediate decay product radon as well as its tendency to accumulate in the bones. Radium, in the form of radium chloride, was discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898 from ore mined at Jáchymov. They extracted the radium compound from uraninite and published the discovery at the French Academy of Sciences five days later. Radium was isolated in its metallic state by Marie Curie and André-Louis Debierne through the electrolysis of radium chloride in 1910, and soon afterwards the metal started being produced on larger scales in Austria, the United States, and Belgium. However, the amount of radium produced globally has always been small in comparison to other elements, and by the 2010s, annual production of radium, mainly via extraction from spent nuclear fuel, was less than 100 grams. In nature, radium is found in uranium ores in quantities as small as a seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite, and in thorium ores in trace amounts. Radium is not necessary for living organisms, and its radioactivity and chemical reactivity make adverse health effects likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its chemical mimicry of calcium. As of 2018, other than in nuclear medicine, radium has no commercial applications. Formerly, from the 1910s to the 1970s, it was used as a radioactive source for radioluminescent devices and also in radioactive quackery for its supposed curative power. In nearly all of its applications, radium has been replaced with less dangerous radioisotopes, with one of its few remaining non-medical uses being the production of actinium in nuclear reactors. Radium is the heaviest known alkaline earth metal and is the only radioactive member of its group. Its physical and chemical properties most closely resemble its lighter congener, barium.[4] Pure radium is a volatile, lustrous silvery-white metal, even though its lighter congeners calcium, strontium, and barium have a slight yellow tint.[4] Radium's lustrous surface rapidly becomes black upon exposure to air, likely due to the formation of radium nitride (Ra3N2).[5] Its melting point is either 700 °C (1,292 °F) or 960 °C (1,760 °F)[a] and its boiling point is 1,737 °C (3,159 °F); however, this is not well established.[6] Both of these values are slightly lower than those of barium, confirming periodic trends down the group 2 elements.[7] Like barium and the alkali metals, radium crystallizes in the body-centered cubic structure at standard temperature and pressure: the radium–radium bond distance is 514.8 picometers.[8] Radium has a density of 5.5 g/cm3, higher than that of barium, and the two elements have similar crystal structures (bcc at standard temperature and pressure).[9][10] Radium has 33 known isotopes with mass numbers from 202 to 234, all of which are radioactive.[2] Four of these – 223Ra (half-life 11.4 days), 224Ra (3.64 days), 226Ra (1600 years), and 228Ra (5.75 years) – occur naturally in the decay chains of primordial thorium-232, uranium-235, and uranium-238 (223Ra from uranium-235, 226Ra from uranium-238, and the other two from thorium-232). These isotopes nevertheless still have half-lives too short to be primordial radionuclides, and only exist in nature from these decay chains.[11] Together with the mostly artificial 225Ra (15 d), which occurs in nature only as a decay product of minute traces of neptunium-237,[12] these are the five most stable isotopes of radium.[2] All other 27 known radium isotopes have half-lives under two hours, and the majority have half-lives under a minute.[2] Of these, 221Ra (half-life 28 s) also occurs as a 237Np daughter, and 220Ra and 222Ra would be produced by the still-unobserved double beta decay of natural radon isotopes.[13] At least 12 nuclear isomers have been reported, the most stable of which is radium-205m with a half-life between 130~230 milliseconds; this is still shorter than twenty-four ground-state radium isotopes.[2] 226Ra is the most stable isotope of radium and is the last isotope in the (4n + 2) decay chain of uranium-238 with a half-life of over a millennium; it makes up almost all of natural radium. Its immediate decay product is the dense radioactive noble gas radon (specifically the isotope 222Rn), which is responsible for much of the danger of environmental radium.[14][b] It is 2.7 million times more radioactive than the same molar amount of natural uranium (mostly uranium-238), due to its proportionally shorter half-life.[15][16] A sample of radium metal maintains itself at a higher temperature than its surroundings because of the radiation it emits. Natural radium (which is mostly 226Ra) emits mostly alpha particles, but other steps in its decay chain (the uranium or radium series) emit alpha or beta particles, and almost all particle emissions are accompanied by gamma rays.[17] Experimental nuclear physics studies have shown that nuclei of several radium isotopes, such as 222Ra, 224Ra and 226Ra, have reflection-asymmetric (\"pear-like\") shapes.[18] In particular, this experimental information on radium-224 has been obtained at ISOLDE using a technique called Coulomb excitation.[19][20] Radium only exhibits the oxidation state of +2 in solution.[5] It forms the colorless Ra2+ cation in aqueous solution, which is highly basic and does not form complexes readily.[5] Most radium compounds are therefore simple ionic compounds,[5] though participation from the 6s and 6p electrons (in addition to the valence 7s electrons) is expected due to relativistic effects and would enhance the covalent character of radium compounds such as RaF2 and RaAt2.[21] For this reason, the standard electrode potential for the half-reaction Ra2+ (aq) + 2e- → Ra (s) is −2.916 V, even slightly lower than the value −2.92 V for barium, whereas the values had previously smoothly increased down the group (Ca: −2.84 V; Sr: −2.89 V; Ba: −2.92 V).[22] The values for barium and radium are almost exactly the same as those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium.[22] Solid radium compounds are white as radium ions provide no specific coloring, but they gradually turn yellow and then dark over time due to self-radiolysis from radium's alpha decay.[5] Insoluble radium compounds coprecipitate with all barium, most strontium, and most lead compounds.[23] Radium oxide (RaO) is poorly characterized, as the reaction of radium with air results in the formation of radium nitride.[24] Radium hydroxide (Ra(OH)2) is formed via the reaction of radium metal with water, and is the most readily soluble among the alkaline earth hydroxides and a stronger base than its barium congener, barium hydroxide.[25] It is also more soluble than actinium hydroxide and thorium hydroxide: these three adjacent hydroxides may be separated by precipitating them with ammonia.[25] Radium chloride (RaCl2) is a colorless, luminescent compound. It becomes yellow after some time due to self-damage by the alpha radiation given off by radium when it decays. Small amounts of barium impurities give the compound a rose color.[25] Its It is soluble in water, though less so than barium chloride, and its solubility decreases with increasing concentration of hydrochloric acid. Crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate RaCl2·2H2O, isomorphous with its barium analog.[25] Radium bromide (RaBr2) is also a colorless, luminous compound.[25] In water, it is more soluble than radium chloride. Like radium chloride, crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate RaBr2·2H2O, isomorphous with its barium analog. The ionizing radiation emitted by radium bromide excites nitrogen molecules in the air, making it glow. The alpha particles emitted by radium quickly gain two electrons to become neutral helium, which builds up inside and weakens radium bromide crystals. This effect sometimes causes the crystals to break or even explode.[25] Radium nitrate (Ra(NO3)2) is a white compound that can be made by dissolving radium carbonate in nitric acid. As the concentration of nitric acid increases, the solubility of radium nitrate decreases, an important property for the chemical purification of radium.[25] Radium forms much the same insoluble salts as its lighter congener barium: it forms the insoluble sulfate (RaSO4, the most insoluble known sulfate), chromate (RaCrO4), carbonate (RaCO3), iodate (Ra(IO3)2), tetrafluoroberyllate (RaBeF4), and nitrate (Ra(NO3)2). With the exception of the carbonate, all of these are less soluble in water than the corresponding barium salts, but they are all isostructural to their barium counterparts. Additionally, radium phosphate, oxalate, and sulfite are probably also insoluble, as they coprecipitate with the corresponding insoluble barium salts.[26] The great insolubility of radium sulfate (at 20 °C, only 2.1 mg will dissolve in 1 kg of water) means that it is one of the less biologically dangerous radium compounds.[27] The large ionic radius of Ra2+ (148 pm) results in weak ability to form coordination complexes and poor extraction of radium from aqueous solutions when not at high pH.[28] All isotopes of radium have half-lives much shorter than the age of the Earth, so that any primordial radium would have decayed long ago. Radium nevertheless still occurs in the environment, as the isotopes 223Ra, 224Ra, 226Ra, and 228Ra are part of the decay chains of natural thorium and uranium isotopes; since thorium and uranium have very long half-lives,[2] these daughters are continually being regenerated by their decay.[11] Of these four isotopes, the longest-lived is 226Ra (half-life 1600 years), a decay product of natural uranium. Because of its relative longevity, 226Ra is the most common isotope of the element, making up about one part per trillion of the Earth's crust; essentially all natural radium is 226Ra.[29] Thus, radium is found in tiny quantities in the uranium ore uraninite and various other uranium minerals, and in even tinier quantities in thorium minerals. One ton of pitchblende typically yields about one seventh of a gram of radium.[30] One kilogram of the Earth's crust contains about 900 picograms of radium, and one liter of sea water contains about 89 femtograms of radium.[31] Radium was discovered by Marie Skłodowska-Curie and her husband Pierre Curie on 21 December 1898 in a uraninite (pitchblende) sample from Jáchymov.[32] While studying the mineral earlier, the Curies removed uranium from it and found that the remaining material was still radioactive. In July 1898, while studying pitchblende, they isolated an element similar to bismuth which turned out to be polonium. They then isolated a radioactive mixture consisting of two components: compounds of barium, which gave a brilliant green flame color, and unknown radioactive compounds which gave carmine spectral lines that had never been documented before. The Curies found the radioactive compounds to be very similar to the barium compounds, except they were less soluble. This discovery made it possible for the Curies to isolate the radioactive compounds and discover a new element in them. The Curies announced their discovery to the French Academy of Sciences on 26 December 1898.[33] The naming of radium dates to about 1899, from the French word radium, formed in Modern Latin from radius (ray): this was in recognition of radium's emission of energy in the form of rays.[34] The gaseous emissions of radium, radon, were recognized and studied extensively by Friedrich Ernst Dorn in the early 1900s, though at the time they were characterized as \"radium emanations\".[35] In September 1910, Marie Curie and André-Louis Debierne announced that they had isolated radium as a pure metal through the electrolysis of pure radium chloride (RaCl2) solution using a mercury cathode, producing radium–mercury amalgam.[36] This amalgam was then heated in an atmosphere of hydrogen gas to remove the mercury, leaving pure radium metal.[37] Later that same year, E. Ebler isolated radium metal by thermal decomposition of its azide, Ra(N3)2.[38][39] Radium metal was first industrially produced at the beginning of the 20th century by Biraco, a subsidiary company of Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK) in its Olen plant in Belgium.[40] The metal became an important export of Belgium from 1922 up until World War II.[41] The general historical unit for radioactivity, the curie, is based on the radioactivity of 226Ra. it was originally defined as the radioactivity of one gram of radium-226,[42] but the definition was later refined to be 3.7×1010 disintegrations per second.[43] Radium was formerly used in self-luminous paints for watches, aircraft switches, clocks, and instrument dials and panels. A typical self-luminous watch that uses radium paint contains around 1 microgram of radium.[44] In the mid-1920s, a lawsuit was filed against the United States Radium Corporation by five dying \"Radium Girls\" – dial painters who had painted radium-based luminous paint on the components of watches and clocks.[45] The dial painters were instructed to lick their brushes to give them a fine point, thereby ingesting radium.[46] Their exposure to radium caused serious health effects which included sores, anemia, and bone cancer.[14] During the litigation, it was determined that the company's scientists and management had taken considerable precautions to protect themselves from the effects of radiation, but it did not seem to protect their employees. Additionally, for several years the companies had attempted to cover up the effects and avoid liability by insisting that the Radium Girls were instead suffering from syphilis.[47] As a result of the lawsuit, and an extensive study by the U.S. Public Health Service, the adverse effects of radioactivity became widely known, and radium-dial painters were instructed in proper safety precautions and provided with protective gear. Radium continued to be used in dials, especially in manufacturing during World War II, but from 1925 onward there were no further injuries to dial painters. [45] From the 1960s the use of radium paint was discontinued. In many cases luminous dials were implemented with non-radioactive fluorescent materials excited by light; such devices glow in the dark after exposure to light, but the glow fades.[14] Where long-lasting self-luminosity in darkness was required, safer radioactive promethium-147 (half-life 2.6 years) or tritium (half-life 12 years) paint was used; both continue to be used as of 2018.[48] These had the added advantage of not degrading the phosphor over time, unlike radium.[49] Tritium as it is used in these applications is considered safer than radium,[50] as it emits very low-energy beta radiation[51] (even lower-energy than the beta radiation emitted by promethium)[52] which cannot penetrate the skin,[53] unlike the gamma radiation emitted by radium isotopes.[50] Clocks, watches, and instruments dating from the first half of the 20th century, often in military applications, may have been painted with radioactive luminous paint. They are usually no longer luminous; this is not due to radioactive decay of the radium (which has a half-life of 1600 years) but to the fluorescence of the zinc sulfide fluorescent medium being worn out by the radiation from the radium.[54] Originally appearing as white, most radium paint from before the 1960s has tarnished to yellow over time. The radiation dose from an intact device is usually only a hazard when many devices are grouped together or if the device is disassembled or tampered with.[55] Radium was once an additive in products such as cosmetics, soap, razor blades, and even beverages due to its supposed curative powers. Many contemporary products were falsely advertised as being radioactive.[57] Such products soon fell out of vogue and were prohibited by authorities in many countries after it was discovered they could have serious adverse health effects. (See, for instance, Radithor or Revigator types of \"radium water\" or \"Standard Radium Solution for Drinking\".)[54] Spas featuring radium-rich water are still occasionally touted as beneficial, such as those in Misasa, Tottori, Japan,[58] though the sources of radioactivity in these spas vary and may be attributed to radon and other radioisotopes.[59] Radium (usually in the form of radium chloride or radium bromide) was used in medicine to produce radon gas, which in turn was used as a cancer treatment.[6] Several of these radon sources were used in Canada in the 1920s and 1930s.[60] However, many treatments that were used in the early 1900s are not used anymore because of the harmful effects radium bromide exposure caused. Some examples of these effects are anaemia, cancer, and genetic mutations.[61] As of 2011, safer gamma emitters such as 60Co, which is less costly and available in larger quantities, were usually used to replace the historical use of radium in this application,[28] but factors including increasing costs of cobalt and risks of keeping radioactive sources on site have led to an increase in the use of linear particle accelerators for the same applications.[62] In the U.S., from 1940 through the 1960s, radium was used in nasopharyngeal radium irradiation, a treatment that was administered to children to treat hearing loss and chronic otitis. The procedure was also administered to airmen and submarine crew to treat barotrauma.[63][64] Early in the 1900s, biologists used radium to induce mutations and study genetics. As early as 1904, Daniel MacDougal used radium in an attempt to determine whether it could provoke sudden large mutations and cause major evolutionary shifts. Thomas Hunt Morgan used radium to induce changes resulting in white-eyed fruit flies. Nobel-winning biologist Hermann Muller briefly studied the effects of radium on fruit fly mutations before turning to more affordable x-ray experiments.[65] Uranium had no large scale application in the late 19th century and therefore no large uranium mines existed. In the beginning, the silver mines in Jáchymov, Austria-Hungary (now Czech Republic) were the only large sources for uranium ore.[32] The uranium ore was only a byproduct of the mining activities.[66] In the first extraction of radium, Curie used the residues after extraction of uranium from pitchblende. The uranium had been extracted by dissolution in sulfuric acid leaving radium sulfate, which is similar to barium sulfate but even less soluble in the residues. The residues also contained rather substantial amounts of barium sulfate which thus acted as a carrier for the radium sulfate. The first steps of the radium extraction process involved boiling with sodium hydroxide, followed by hydrochloric acid treatment to minimize impurities of other compounds. The remaining residue was then treated with sodium carbonate to convert the barium sulfate into barium carbonate (carrying the radium), thus making it soluble in hydrochloric acid. After dissolution, the barium and radium were reprecipitated as sulfates; this was then repeated to further purify the mixed sulfate. Some impurities that form insoluble sulfides were removed by treating the chloride solution with hydrogen sulfide, followed by filtering. When the mixed sulfates were pure enough, they were once more converted to mixed chlorides; barium and radium thereafter were separated by fractional crystallisation while monitoring the progress using a spectroscope (radium gives characteristic red lines in contrast to the green barium lines), and the electroscope.[67] After the isolation of radium by Marie and Pierre Curie from uranium ore from Jáchymov, several scientists started to isolate radium in small quantities. Later, small companies purchased mine tailings from Jáchymov mines and started isolating radium. In 1904, the Austrian government nationalised the mines and stopped exporting raw ore. Until 1912, when radium production increased, radium availability was low.[66] The formation of an Austrian monopoly and the strong urge of other countries to have access to radium led to a worldwide search for uranium ores. The United States took over as leading producer in the early 1910s,[32] producing 70 g total from 1913 to 1920 in Pittsburgh alone.[68] The Curies' process was still used for industrial radium extraction in 1940, but mixed bromides were then used for the fractionation. If the barium content of the uranium ore is not high enough, additional barium can be added to carry the radium. These processes were applied to high grade uranium ores but may not have worked well with low grade ores.[69] Small amounts of radium were still extracted from uranium ore by this method of mixed precipitation and ion exchange as late as the 1990s,[29] but as of 2011, it is extracted only from spent nuclear fuel.[70] Pure radium metal is isolated by reducing radium oxide with aluminium metal in a vacuum at 1,200 °C.[28] In 1954, the total worldwide supply of purified radium amounted to about 5 pounds (2.3 kg).[44] Zaire and Canada were briefly the largest producers of radium in the late 1970s.[68] As of 1997 the chief radium-producing countries were Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, and Russia.[29] The annual production of radium compounds was only about 100 g in total as of 1984;[29] annual production of radium had reduced to less than 100 g by 2018.[71] Radium is seeing increasing use in the field of atomic, molecular, and optical physics.[72][20] Symmetry breaking forces scale proportional to Z 3 , {\\displaystyle \\ Z^{3}\\ ,} [73] which makes radium, the heaviest alkaline earth element, well suited for constraining new physics beyond the standard model. Some radium isotopes, such as radium-225, have octupole deformed parity doublets that enhance sensitivity to charge parity violating new physics by two to three orders of magnitude compared to 199Hg.[74] Radium is also a promising candidate for trapped ion optical clocks. The radium ion has two subhertz-linewidth transitions from the 7 s 2 S 1 / 2 {\\displaystyle \\ \\mathrm {7s^{2}S_{1/2}} \\ } ground state that could serve as the clock transition in an optical clock.[75] A 226Ra+ trapped ion atomic clock has been demonstrated on the 7 s 2 S 1 / 2 {\\displaystyle \\ \\mathrm {7s^{2}S_{1/2}} \\ } to 6 d 2 D 5 / 2 {\\displaystyle \\ \\mathrm {6d^{2}D_{5/2}} \\ } transition, which has been considered for the creation of a transportable optical clock as all transitions necessary for clock operation can be addressed with direct diode lasers at common wavelengths.[76] Some of the few practical uses of radium are derived from its radioactive properties. More recently discovered radioisotopes, such as cobalt-60 and caesium-137, are replacing radium in even these limited uses because several of these isotopes are more powerful emitters, safer to handle, and available in more concentrated form.[77] The isotope 223Ra was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2013 for use in medicine as a cancer treatment of bone metastasis in the form of a solution[78] including radium-223 chloride.[79] The main indication of treatment is the therapy of bony metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer.[80] 225Ra has also been used in experiments concerning therapeutic irradiation, as it is the only reasonably long-lived radium isotope which does not have radon as one of its daughters.[81] Radium was still used in 2007 as a radiation source in some industrial radiography devices to check for flawed metallic parts, similarly to X-ray imaging.[14] When mixed with beryllium, radium acts as a neutron source.[54][82] Up until at least 2004, radium-beryllium neutron sources were still sometimes used,[14][83] but other materials such as polonium and americium have become more common for use in neutron sources. RaBeF4-based (α, n) neutron sources have been deprecated despite the high number of neutrons they emit (1.84×106 neutrons per second) in favour of 241Am–Be sources.[84] As of 2011[update], the isotope 226Ra is mainly used to form 227Ac by neutron irradiation in a nuclear reactor.[28] Radium is highly radioactive, as is its immediate decay product, radon gas. When ingested, 80% of the ingested radium leaves the body through the feces, while the other 20% goes into the bloodstream, mostly accumulating in the bones. This is because the body treats radium as calcium and deposits it in the bones, where radioactivity degrades marrow and can mutate bone cells. Exposure to radium, internal or external, can cause cancer and other disorders, because radium and radon emit alpha and gamma rays upon their decay, which kill and mutate cells.[14] Radium is generally considered the most toxic of the radioactive elements.[84] Some of the biological effects of radium include the first case of \"radium-dermatitis\", reported in 1900, two years after the element's discovery. The French physicist Antoine Becquerel carried a small ampoule of radium in his waistcoat pocket for six hours and reported that his skin became ulcerated. Pierre Curie attached a tube filled with radium to his arm for ten hours, which resulted in the appearance of a skin lesion, suggesting the use of radium to attack cancerous tissue as it had attacked healthy tissue.[85] Handling of radium has been blamed for Marie Curie's death, due to aplastic anemia,[86] though analysis of her levels of radium exposure done after her death find them within accepted safe levels and attribute her illness and death to her use of radiography.[87] A significant amount of radium's danger comes from its daughter radon, which as a gas can enter the body far more readily than can its parent radium.[14] The first published recommendations for protection against radium and radiation in general were made by the British X-ray and Radium Protection Committee and were adopted internationally in 1928 at the first meeting of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), following preliminary guidance written by the Röntgen Society.[88] This meeting led to further developments of radiation protection programs[89] coordinated across all countries represented by the commission.[90] Exposure to radium is still regulated internationally by the ICRP, alongside the World Health Organization.[91] The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) publishes safety standards and provides recommendations for the handling of and exposure to radium in its works on naturally occurring radioactive materials and the broader International Basic Safety Standards,[92] which are not enforced by the IAEA but are available for adoption by members of the organization.[93] In addition, in efforts to reduce the quantity of old radiotherapy devices that contain radium, the IAEA has worked since 2022[94] to manage and recycle disused 226Ra sources.[95][96] In several countries, further regulations exist and are applied beyond those recommended by the IAEA and ICRP. For example, in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency-defined Maximum Contaminant Level for radium is 5 pCi/L for drinking water;[97] at the time of the Manhattan Project in the 1940s, the \"tolerance level\" for workers was set at 0.1 micrograms of ingested radium.[98] The Occupational Safety and Health Administration does not specifically set exposure limits for radium, and instead limits ionizing radiation exposure in units of roentgen equivalent man based on the exposed area of the body. Radium sources themselves, rather than worker exposures, are regulated more closely by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,[99] which requires licensing for anyone possessing 226Ra with activity of more than 0.01 μCi.[100] The particular governing bodies that regulate radioactive materials and nuclear energy are documented by the Nuclear Energy Agency for member countries[101] – for instance, in the Republic of Korea, the nation's radiation safety standards are managed by the Korea Radioisotope Institute, established in 1985, and the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety, established in 1990[102] – and the IAEA leads efforts in establishing governing bodies in locations that do not have government regulations on radioactive materials.[103][104] Beryllium Be Atomic Number: 4 Atomic Weight: 9.012182 Melting Point: 1560.15 KBoiling Point: 2742 KSpecific mass: 1.85 g/cm3 Electronegativity: 1.57 Magnesium Mg Atomic Number: 12 Atomic Weight: 24.3050 Melting Point: 923.15 K Boiling Point: 1363 KSpecific mass: 1.738 g/cm3 Electronegativity: 1.31 Calcium Ca Atomic Number: 20 Atomic Weight: 40.078 Melting Point: 1112.15 K Boiling Point: 1757 KSpecific mass: 1.54 g/cm3 Electronegativity: 1 Strontium Sr Atomic Number: 38 Atomic Weight: 87.62 Melting Point: 1042.15 K Boiling Point: 1655 KSpecific mass: 2.64 g/cm3 Electronegativity: 0.95 Barium Ba Atomic Number: 56 Atomic Weight: 137.327 Melting Point: 1002.15 K Boiling Point: 2170 KSpecific mass: 3.594 g/cm3 Electronegativity: 0.89 Radium Ra Atomic Number: 88 Atomic Weight: [226] Melting Point: 973.15 K Boiling Point: 2010 K Specific mass: 5.5 g/cm3 Electronegativity: 0.9",

                "content": "Radium is a chemical element. The symbol for radium is Ra, and its atomic number is 88. It was discovered by Marie Curie and Pierre Curie in the form of radium chloride in 1898. It is a slivery-white alkaline earth metal, but it turns black quickly when it is exposed to nitrogen in the air. All isotopes of radium are radioactive. The radioactivity of radium causes it to glow in the dark. Radium is used in many things, such as glowing watches, which are now banned because they can cause radiation poisoning. Some of the things radium was used for are now made using less dangerous radioactive elements, such as promethium. It can be used in treating cancer.[1] In nature, radium is found in tiny amounts in uranium and thorium ores. It does not exist naturally inside of people or other living things; it is dangerous when taken in because it takes the same place as calcium. Radium was discovered by Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie on 21 December 1898.[2] They found that some radioactive minerals had unknown compounds left over after removing uranium and barium. The unknown compounds were polonium and radium; the discovery was announced to the French Academy of Sciences on 26 December 1898. The original unit of measurement for radioactivity was called the curie. The unit was equal to the radioactivity of one gram of radium-226,[3] but later it was changed to 3.7×1010 disintegrations per second. Radium is the heaviest alkaline earth metal and the only radioactive element in the group. It has a silvery-white color, but turns black when it is exposed to air. It is more similar to barium than it is to any other element. It is also similar to barium in the ways it reacts with other things. Radium has 33 isotopes. All of these isotopes are radioactive. The isotope which lasts the longest is radium-226: it has a half-life of 1,600 years. Radium used to be used in glowing paints for watches and other instruments that are used in the dark. Radium stopped being used in the mid-1920s after a lawsuit by five people who were called \"Radium Girls\". The Radium Girls were told to lick the brushes used to paint with radium, which caused them to ingest radium.[4] This was very dangerous to their health. Ingesting radium in paint caused sores, anemia, and bone cancer in the Radium Girls. The lawsuit caused the dangers of radioactivity to be known by many more people. After the 1960s, radium paint was replaced by less dangerous radioactive paint made from promethium-147 or tritium. Radium was also used in different things such as toothpaste and food.[5] These products were made illegal after people found out about the dangers of radioactivity. Radium is not used now in anything except for nuclear reactors.[6] There are safer elements that can be used in all of the same ways radium was used. Radium is the most toxic radioactive element. It collects in bones when ingested, which causes cancer. However, even just being around radium can cause cancer. Radium creates radon when it decays. This is even more dangerous, because radon is a gas. Marie Curie's death was most likely caused by radium.[7]",

The 89th annual Cotton Bowl Classic will feature the Texas Longhorns of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and the Ohio State Buckeyes of the Big Ten Conference, who both advanced from a College Football Playoff quarterfinal game. The game is scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m. CST and will air on ESPN.[1][2] The Cotton Bowl Classic will be one of the 2024–25 bowl games concluding the 2024 FBS football season. Sponsored by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, the game is officially known as the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the 89th Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic. The 2025 Cotton bowl is a semifinal game for the College Football Playoff (CFP).[3] The game will feature the winner of the Rose Bowl, Ohio State, and the winner of the Peach Bowl, Texas.[4] The winner of this game will advance to the 2025 College Football Playoff National Championship game and will face the winner of the Orange Bowl.[4] Texas played to an 11–1 record (7–1 in conference) during the regular season; their only loss was to Georgia.

But not like this. Technically underdogs, both the Longhorns and Buckeyes survived their quarterfinals matchup to secure spots in the 2025 Cotton Bowl. The wins came drastically differently, though. (5) Texas escaped double-overtime after a jaw-dropping comeback by (4) Arizona State. (8) Ohio State avenged a regular season loss and dominated title favorite (1) Oregon. Now, one of the powerhouse programs will play for a national title. The last time Texas and Ohio State played, the Longhorns won the 2009 Fiesta Bowl. This time around, it will be a battle of some of the best defenses in the nation. It comes down to who can put it together at the right time.

These Venezuelan gangs, just the beginning.” Advertisement An aurora is a natural light display in the sky that is caused by particles from the sun interacting with a planet’s magnetic field. The most well-known aurora is the aurora borealis, the shimmering display of colorful lights that sometimes appears in Earth’s Northern Hemisphere. The phenomenon is also commonly called the northern lights. The aurora that occurs in the Southern Hemisphere is called aurora australis or the southern lights. (The word borealis is Latin for boreal, which simply means “northern.” The word australis is Latin for austral, which simply means “southern.”) On Earth, auroras appear in many colors ranging from green and pink to red, yellow, and blue. Both the northern and southern versions can be called aurora polaris because they occur around Earth’s poles, but this term is not commonly used. Auroras are not exclusive to Earth and occur on every planet in our solar system except Mercury. If you happen to find yourself near the North Pole or the South Pole, you might get the chance to see a natural light display that puts any fireworks to shame. This light show is called an aurora and humans have been amazed by it for thousands of years. Recorded sightings date back to the ancient Babylonians and Assyrians, and the phenomenon may even be depicted in some ancient cave paintings. The lights are named after Aurora, the Roman goddess of the dawn. The name aurora borealis is thought to have been coined by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei in the 1600s. An aurora is a natural light display that occurs in the skies close to Earth’s north and south poles. The process that results in an aurora starts at the sun. Because it is both very hot and very magnetic, the sun frequently releases charged particles (such as protons and electrons) into space that zip toward the planets, including Earth. Earth is surrounded by an invisible magnetic field that protects it (and us) from this solar wind by bouncing it back into space. However, the magnetic field is weakest at Earth’s north and south poles, and some solar particles manage to enter Earth’s atmosphere close to these areas and collide with Earth’s gas particles (oxygen, nitrogen, etc). These collisions emit light that the human eye can see and this, finally, results in an aurora. The aurora borealis is the northern aurora, and the southern aurora is called the aurora australis. While these auroras technically appear throughout the year, the human eye isn’t always able to see them. The visibility of an aurora depends on multiple factors such as your location, the weather, and the time of the year. Organizations such as NASA and NOAA that have studied auroras provide information for “aurora hunters”—people seeking to observe the lights. The aurora borealis is easiest to see during winter in cold, northern places such as Canada, Scandinavia, Greenland, Russia, and the North Pole itself, though it is sometimes visible at locations farther south. The aurora australis can be seen in places like Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, and the region of Argentina and Chile known as Patagonia. Like many celestial phenomena, the aurora borealis has been seen as an omen or sign of the gods by many different cultures. For example, a bright red aurora was said to have been visible in the skies prior to the death of Julius Caesar as well as the outbreaks of the American Civil War and the French Revolution. This rare “bloody” version of the northern lights was thought to signal incoming bloodshed or violence. The two auroras on Earth are the aurora borealis and the aurora australis—the northern lights and the southern lights. Many people travel just to see them. Getty.

                "content": "An aurora[a] (pl. aurorae or auroras),[b] also commonly known as the northern lights (aurora borealis) or southern lights (aurora australis),[c] is a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.[3] Auroras are the result of disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles. Planets in the Solar System, brown dwarfs, comets, and some natural satellites also host auroras. The term aurora borealis was coined by Galileo in 1619, from the Roman Aurora, goddess of the dawn, and the Greek Boreas, god of the cold north wind.[4][5] The word aurora is derived from the name of the Roman goddess of the dawn, Aurora, who travelled from east to west announcing the coming of the Sun.[6] Ancient Greek poets used the corresponding name \"Eos\" metaphorically to refer to dawn, often mentioning its play of colours across the otherwise dark sky (e.g., \"rosy-fingered dawn\").[7] The words borealis and australis are derived from the names of the ancient gods of the north wind (Boreas) and the south wind (Auster) in Greco-Roman mythology. Auroras are most commonly observed in the \"auroral zone\",[8] a band approximately 6° (~660 km) wide in latitude centered on 67° north and south.[9] The region that currently displays an aurora is called the \"auroral oval\". The oval is displaced by the solar wind, pushing it about 15° away from the geomagnetic pole (not the geographic pole) in the noon direction and 23° away in the midnight direction.[9] The peak equatorward extent of the oval is displaced slightly from geographic midnight. It is centered about 3–5° nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the magnetic pole in question is in between the observer and the Sun, which is called magnetic midnight. Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations. Elias Loomis (1860),[10] and later Hermann Fritz (1881)[11] and Sophus Tromholt (1881)[12] in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone. In northern latitudes, the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights. The southern counterpart, the aurora australis or the southern lights, has features almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone.[13] The aurora australis is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, the Southern Cone, South Africa, Australasia, the Falkland Islands, and under exceptional circumstances as far north as Uruguay.[14] The aurora borealis is visible from areas around the Arctic such as Alaska, Canada, Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Scandinavia, Finland, Scotland, and Russia. A geomagnetic storm causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, bringing the aurora to lower latitudes. On rare occasions, the aurora borealis can be seen as far south as the Mediterranean and the southern states of the US while the aurora australis can be seen as far north as New Caledonia and the Pilbara region in Western Australia. During the Carrington Event, the greatest geomagnetic storm ever observed, auroras were seen even in the tropics. Auroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead. From farther away, they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun were rising from an unusual direction. Auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either diffuse patches or arcs,[15] which can be subvisual. Auroras are occasionally seen in latitudes below the auroral zone, when a geomagnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval. Large geomagnetic storms are most common during the peak of the 11-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after the peak.[16][17] An electron spirals (gyrates) about a field line at an angle that is determined by its velocity vectors, parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the local geomagnetic field vector B. This angle is known as the \"pitch angle\" of the particle. The distance, or radius, of the electron from the field line at any time is known as its Larmor radius. The pitch angle increases as the electron travels to a region of greater field strength nearer to the atmosphere. Thus, it is possible for some particles to return, or mirror, if the angle becomes 90° before entering the atmosphere to collide with the denser molecules there. Other particles that do not mirror enter the atmosphere and contribute to the auroral display over a range of altitudes. Other types of auroras have been observed from space; for example, \"poleward arcs\" stretching sunward across the polar cap, the related \"theta aurora\",[18] and \"dayside arcs\" near noon. These are relatively infrequent and poorly understood. Other interesting effects occur such as pulsating aurora, \"black aurora\" and their rarer companion \"anti-black aurora\" and subvisual red arcs. In addition to all these, a weak glow (often deep red) observed around the two polar cusps, the field lines separating the ones that close through Earth from those that are swept into the tail and close remotely. Early work on the imaging of the auroras was done in 1949 by the University of Saskatchewan using the SCR-270 radar.[19] The altitudes where auroral emissions occur were revealed by Carl Størmer and his colleagues, who used cameras to triangulate more than 12,000 auroras.[20] They discovered that most of the light is produced between 90 and 150 km (56 and 93 mi) above the ground, while extending at times to more than 1,000 km (620 mi). According to Clark (2007), there are five main forms that can be seen from the ground, from least to most visible:[21] Brekke (1994) also described some auroras as \"curtains\".[23] The similarity to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or break up into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are also known as discrete auroras, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night.[24] These forms are consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. The appearances of arcs, rays, curtains, and coronas are determined by the shapes of the luminous parts of the atmosphere and a viewer's position.[25] Auroras change with time. Over the night they begin with glows and progress toward coronas, although they may not reach them. They tend to fade in the opposite order.[23] Until about 1963, it was thought that these changes are due to the rotation of the Earth under a pattern fixed with respect to the Sun. Later, it was found by comparing all-sky films of auroras from different places (collected during the International Geophysical Year) that they often undergo global changes in a process called auroral substorm. They change in a few minutes from quiet arcs all along the auroral oval to active displays along the darkside and after 1–3 hours they gradually change back.[29] Changes in auroras over time are commonly visualized using keograms.[30] At shorter time scales, auroras can change their appearances and intensity, sometimes so slowly as to be difficult to notice, and at other times rapidly down to the sub-second scale.[24] The phenomenon of pulsating auroras is an example of intensity variations over short timescales, typically with periods of 2–20 seconds. This type of aurora is generally accompanied by decreasing peak emission heights of about 8 km for blue and green emissions and above average solar wind speeds (c. 500 km/s).[31] In addition, the aurora and associated currents produce a strong radio emission around 150 kHz known as auroral kilometric radiation (AKR), discovered in 1972.[32] Ionospheric absorption makes AKR only observable from space. X-ray emissions, originating from the particles associated with auroras, have also been detected.[33] Aurora noise, similar to a crackling noise, begins about 70 m (230 ft) above Earth's surface and is caused by charged particles in an inversion layer of the atmosphere formed during a cold night. The charged particles discharge when particles from the Sun hit the inversion layer, creating the noise.[34][35] In 2016, more than fifty citizen science observations described what was to them an unknown type of aurora which they named \"STEVE\", for \"Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement\". STEVE is not an aurora but is caused by a 25 km (16 mi) wide ribbon of hot plasma at an altitude of 450 km (280 mi), with a temperature of 3,000 °C (3,270 K; 5,430 °F) and flowing at a speed of 6 km/s (3.7 mi/s) (compared to 10 m/s (33 ft/s) outside the ribbon).[36] The processes that cause STEVE are also associated with a picket-fence aurora, although the latter can be seen without STEVE.[37][38] It is an aurora because it is caused by precipitation of electrons in the atmosphere but it appears outside the auroral oval,[39] closer to the equator than typical auroras.[40] When the picket-fence aurora appears with STEVE, it is below.[38] First reported in 2020,[41][42] and confirmed in 2021,[43][44] the dune aurora phenomenon was discovered[45] by Finnish citizen scientists. It consists of regularly-spaced, parallel stripes of brighter emission in the green diffuse aurora which give the impression of sand dunes.[46] The phenomenon is believed to be caused by the modulation of atomic oxygen density by a large-scale atmospheric wave travelling horizontally in a waveguide through an inversion layer in the mesosphere in presence of electron precipitation.[43] Horse-collar auroras (HCA) are auroral features in which the auroral ellipse shifts poleward during the dawn and dusk portions and the polar cap becomes teardrop-shaped. They form during periods when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is permanently northward, when the IMF clock angle is small. Their formation is associated with the closure of the magnetic flux at the top of the dayside magnetosphere by the double lobe reconnection (DLR). There are approximately 8 HCA events per month, with no seasonal dependence, and that the IMF must be within 30 degrees of northwards.[47] Conjugate auroras are nearly exact mirror-image auroras found at conjugate points in the northern and southern hemispheres on the same geomagnetic field lines. These generally happen at the time of the equinoxes, when there is little difference in the orientation of the north and south geomagnetic poles to the sun. Attempts were made to image conjugate auroras by aircraft from Alaska and New Zealand in 1967, 1968, 1970, and 1971, with some success.[48] A full understanding of the physical processes which lead to different types of auroras is still incomplete, but the basic cause involves the interaction of the solar wind with Earth's magnetosphere. The varying intensity of the solar wind produces effects of different magnitudes but includes one or more of the following physical scenarios. The details of these phenomena are not fully understood. However, it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones and temporarily magnetically trapped particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled with particle acceleration processes.[49] The immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above.[50] Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone. The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000 km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere.[51] These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field. Electrons mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have, in contrast, a smoothly falling energy distribution, and an angular (pitch-angle) distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field. Pulsations were discovered to originate at or close to the equatorial crossing point of auroral zone magnetic field lines.[52] Protons are also associated with auroras, both discrete and diffuse. Auroras result from emissions of photons in Earth's upper atmosphere, above 80 km (50 mi), from ionized nitrogen atoms regaining an electron, and oxygen atoms and nitrogen based molecules returning from an excited state to ground state.[53] They are ionized or excited by the collision of particles precipitated into the atmosphere. Both incoming electrons and protons may be involved. Excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule: Oxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take 0.7 seconds to emit the 557.7 nm green light and up to two minutes for the red 630.0 nm emission. Collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission; this process is called collisional quenching. Because the highest parts of the atmosphere contain a higher percentage of oxygen and lower particle densities, such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red light. Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere due to increasing density, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually, even green light emissions are prevented. This is why there is a colour differential with altitude; at high altitudes oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/purple/red, then finally nitrogen blue/purple/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything. Green is the most common colour. Then comes pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, then yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue. Precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident hydrogen atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere. Proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes.[54] Bright auroras are generally associated with Birkeland currents (Schield et al., 1969;[55] Zmuda and Armstrong, 1973[56]), which flow down into the ionosphere on one side of the pole and out on the other. In between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric E layer (125 km); the rest (\"region 2\") detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the \"partial ring current\" carried by magnetically trapped plasma. The ionosphere is an ohmic conductor, so some consider that such currents require a driving voltage, which an, as yet unspecified, dynamo mechanism can supply. Electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms. In another interpretation, the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave/particle interactions. Ionospheric resistance has a complex nature, and leads to a secondary Hall current flow. By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral electrojet. An auroral electrojet index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity. Kristian Birkeland[57] deduced that the currents flowed in the east–west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named \"auroral electrojets\" (see also Birkeland currents). Ionosphere can contribute to the formation of auroral arcs via the feedback instability under high ionospheric resistance conditions, observed at night time and in dark Winter hemisphere.[58] Earth is constantly immersed in the solar wind, a flow of magnetized hot plasma (a gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the Sun in all directions, a result of the two-million-degree temperature of the Sun's outermost layer, the corona. The solar wind reaches Earth with a velocity typically around 400 km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm3 and a magnetic field intensity of around 2–5 nT (for comparison, Earth's surface field is typically 30,000–50,000 nT). During magnetic storms, in particular, flows can be several times faster; the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) may also be much stronger. Joan Feynman deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity.[59] Her work resulted from data collected by the Explorer 33 spacecraft. The solar wind and magnetosphere consist of plasma (ionized gas), which conducts electricity. It is well known (since Michael Faraday's work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts across (or is cut by), rather than along, the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the direction of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. Dynamos make use of this basic process (\"the dynamo effect\"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids. The IMF originates on the Sun, linked to the sunspots, and its field lines (lines of force) are dragged out by the solar wind. That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun angles them at Earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane, known as the Parker spiral. The field lines passing Earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge (\"limb\") of the visible Sun at any time.[60] The solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind. However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them. Energy is more effectively transferred by the temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere. Unsurprisingly this process is known as magnetic reconnection. As already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole. Auroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when coronal mass ejections increase the intensity of the solar wind.[61] Earth's magnetosphere is shaped by the impact of the solar wind on Earth's magnetic field. This forms an obstacle to the flow, diverting it, at an average distance of about 70,000 km (11 Earth radii or Re),[62] producing a bow shock 12,000 km to 15,000 km (1.9 to 2.4 Re) further upstream. The width of the magnetosphere abreast of Earth is typically 190,000 km (30 Re), and on the night side a long \"magnetotail\" of stretched field lines extends to great distances (> 200 Re). The high latitude magnetosphere is filled with plasma as the solar wind passes Earth. The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density, and speed in the solar wind. This flow is favoured by a southward component of the IMF, which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines.[63] The flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward Earth, around Earth and back into the solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side. In addition to moving perpendicular to Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along Earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones. The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow. On 26 February 2008, THEMIS probes were able to determine, for the first time, the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms.[64] Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the Moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.[65] Geomagnetic storms that ignite auroras may occur more often during the months around the equinoxes. It is not well understood, but geomagnetic storms may vary with Earth's seasons. Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth's axis to the ecliptic plane. As Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees. Similarly, the 23-degree tilt of Earth's axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident IMF throughout a year. These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere. In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door[colloquialism] through which energy from the solar wind can reach Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras. Recent evidence in 2021 has shown that individual separate substorms may in fact be correlated networked communities.[66] Just as there are many types of aurora, there are many different mechanisms that accelerate auroral particles into the atmosphere. Electron aurora in Earth's auroral zone (i.e. commonly visible aurora) can be split into two main categories with different immediate causes: diffuse and discrete aurora. Diffuse aurora appear relatively structureless to an observer on the ground, with indistinct edges and amorphous forms. Discrete aurora are structured into distinct features with well-defined edges such as arcs, rays and coronas; they also tend to be much brighter than the diffuse aurora. In both cases, the electrons that eventually cause the aurora start out as electrons trapped by the magnetic field in Earth's magnetosphere. These trapped particles bounce back and forth along magnetic field lines and are prevented from hitting the atmosphere by the magnetic mirror formed by the increasing magnetic field strength closer to Earth. The magnetic mirror's ability to trap a particle depends on the particle's pitch angle: the angle between its direction of motion and the local magnetic field. An aurora is created by processes that decrease the pitch angle of many individual electrons, freeing them from the magnetic trap and causing them to hit the atmosphere. In the case of diffuse auroras, the electron pitch angles are altered by their interaction with various plasma waves. Each interaction is essentially wave-particle scattering; the electron energy after interacting with the wave is similar to its energy before interaction, but the direction of motion is altered. If the final direction of motion after scattering is close to the field line (specifically, if it falls within the loss cone) then the electron will hit the atmosphere. Diffuse auroras are caused by the collective effect of many such scattered electrons hitting the atmosphere. The process is mediated by the plasma waves, which become stronger during periods of high geomagnetic activity, leading to increased diffuse aurora at those times. In the case of discrete auroras, the trapped electrons are accelerated toward Earth by electric fields that form at an altitude of about 4000–12000 km in the \"auroral acceleration region\". The electric fields point away from Earth (i.e. upward) along the magnetic field line.[67] Electrons moving downward through these fields gain a substantial amount of energy (on the order of a few keV) in the direction along the magnetic field line toward Earth. This field-aligned acceleration decreases the pitch angle for all of the electrons passing through the region, causing many of them to hit the upper atmosphere. In contrast to the scattering process leading to diffuse auroras, the electric field increases the kinetic energy of all of the electrons transiting downward through the acceleration region by the same amount. This accelerates electrons starting from the magnetosphere with initially low energies (tens of eV or less) to energies required to create an aurora (100s of eV or greater), allowing that large source of particles to contribute to creating auroral light. The accelerated electrons carry an electric current along the magnetic field lines (a Birkeland current). Since the electric field points in the same direction as the current, there is a net conversion of electromagnetic energy into particle energy in the auroral acceleration region (an electric load). The energy to power this load is eventually supplied by the magnetized solar wind flowing around the obstacle of Earth's magnetic field, although exactly how that power flows through the magnetosphere is still an active area of research.[68] While the energy to power the aurora is ultimately derived from the solar wind, the electrons themselves do not travel directly from the solar wind into Earth's auroral zone; magnetic field lines from these regions do not connect to the solar wind, so there is no direct access for solar wind electrons. Some auroral features are also created by electrons accelerated by dispersive Alfvén waves. At small wavelengths transverse to the background magnetic field (comparable to the electron inertial length or ion gyroradius), Alfvén waves develop a significant electric field parallel to the background magnetic field. This electric field can accelerate electrons to keV energies, significant to produce auroral arcs.[69] If the electrons have a speed close to that of the wave's phase velocity, they are accelerated in a manner analogous to a surfer catching an ocean wave.[70][71] This constantly-changing wave electric field can accelerate electrons along the field line, causing some of them to hit the atmosphere. Electrons accelerated by this mechanism tend to have a broad energy spectrum, in contrast to the sharply-peaked energy spectrum typical of electrons accelerated by quasi-static electric fields. In addition to the discrete and diffuse electron aurora, proton aurora is caused when magnetospheric protons collide with the upper atmosphere. The proton gains an electron in the interaction, and the resulting neutral hydrogen atom emits photons. The resulting light is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Other aurora not covered by the above discussion include transpolar arcs (formed poleward of the auroral zone), cusp aurora (formed in two small high-latitude areas on the dayside) and some non-terrestrial auroras. The discovery of a 1770 Japanese diary in 2017 depicting auroras above the ancient Japanese capital of Kyoto suggested that the storm may have been 7% larger than the Carrington event, which affected telegraph networks.[72][73] The auroras that resulted from the Carrington event on both 28 August and 2 September 1859, are thought to be the most spectacular in recent history. In a paper to the Royal Society on 21 November 1861, Balfour Stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self-recording magnetograph at the Kew Observatory and established the connection between the 2 September 1859 auroral storm and the Carrington–Hodgson flare event when he observed that \"It is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken in the act.\"[74] The second auroral event, which occurred on 2 September 1859, was a result of the (unseen) coronal mass ejection associated with the exceptionally intense Carrington–Hodgson white light solar flare on 1 September 1859. This event produced auroras so widespread and extraordinarily bright that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements, ship logs, and newspapers throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia. It was reported by The New York Times that in Boston on Friday 2 September 1859 the aurora was \"so brilliant that at about one o'clock ordinary print could be read by the light\".[75] One o'clock EST time on Friday 2 September would have been 6:00 GMT; the self-recording magnetograph at the Kew Observatory was recording the geomagnetic storm, which was then one hour old, at its full intensity. Between 1859 and 1862, Elias Loomis published a series of nine papers on the Great Auroral Exhibition of 1859 in the American Journal of Science where he collected worldwide reports of the auroral event.[10] That aurora is thought to have been produced by one of the most intense coronal mass ejections in history. It is also notable for the fact that it is the first time where the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked. This insight was made possible not only due to scientific magnetometer measurements of the era, but also as a result of a significant portion of the 125,000 miles (201,000 km) of telegraph lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm. Some telegraph lines, however, seem to have been of the appropriate length and orientation to produce a sufficient geomagnetically induced current from the electromagnetic field to allow for continued communication with the telegraph operator power supplies switched off.[76] The following conversation occurred between two operators of the American Telegraph Line between Boston and Portland, Maine, on the night of 2 September 1859 and reported in the Boston Traveller: Boston operator (to Portland operator): \"Please cut off your battery [power source] entirely for fifteen minutes.\" Portland operator: \"Will do so. It is now disconnected.\" Boston: \"Mine is disconnected, and we are working with the auroral current. How do you receive my writing?\" Portland: \"Better than with our batteries on. – Current comes and goes gradually.\" Boston: \"My current is very strong at times, and we can work better without the batteries, as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately, making current too strong at times for our relay magnets. Suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble.\" Portland: \"Very well. Shall I go ahead with business?\" Boston: \"Yes. Go ahead.\" The conversation was carried on for around two hours using no battery power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, and it was said that this was the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner.[75] Such events led to the general conclusion that The effect of the Aurora on the electric telegraph is generally to increase or diminish the electric current generated in working the wires. Sometimes it entirely neutralizes them, so that, in effect, no fluid [current] is discoverable in them. The aurora borealis seems to be composed of a mass of electric matter, resembling in every respect, that generated by the electric galvanic battery. The currents from it change coming on the wires, and then disappear: the mass of the aurora rolls from the horizon to the zenith.[77] In May 2024, a series of solar storms caused the aurora borealis to be observed from as far south as Ferdows, Iran.[78][79][80] The earliest datable record of an aurora was recorded in the Bamboo Annals, a historical chronicle of the history of ancient China, in 977 or 957 BC.[81] An aurora was described by the Greek explorer Pytheas in the 4th century BC.[82] Seneca wrote about auroras in the first book of his Naturales Quaestiones, classifying them, for instance, as pithaei ('barrel-like'); chasmata ('chasm'); pogoniae ('bearded'); cyparissae ('like cypress trees'); and describing their manifold colours. He wrote about whether they were above or below the clouds, and recalled that under Tiberius, an aurora formed above the port city of Ostia that was so intense and red that a cohort of the army, stationed nearby for fire duty, galloped to the rescue.[83] It has been suggested that Pliny the Elder depicted the aurora borealis in his Natural History, when he refers to trabes, chasma, \"falling red flames\", and \"daylight in the night\".[84] The earliest depiction of the aurora may have been in Cro-Magnon cave paintings of northern Spain dating to 30,000 BC.[85] The oldest known written record of the aurora was in a Chinese legend written around 2600 BC. On an autumn around 2000 BC,[86] according to a legend, a young woman named Fubao was sitting alone in the wilderness by a bay, when suddenly a \"magical band of light\" appeared like \"moving clouds and flowing water\", turning into a bright halo around the Big Dipper, which cascaded a pale silver brilliance, illuminating the earth and making shapes and shadows seem alive. Moved by this sight, Fubao became pregnant and gave birth to a son, the Emperor Xuanyuan, known legendarily as the initiator of Chinese culture and the ancestor of all Chinese people.[citation needed] In the Shanhaijing, a creature named Shilong is described to be like a red dragon shining in the night sky with a body a thousand miles long. In ancient times, the Chinese did not have a fixed word for the aurora, so it was named according to the different shapes of the aurora, such as \"Sky Dog\" (天狗), \"Sword/Knife Star\" (刀星), \"Chiyou banner\" (蚩尤旗), \"Sky's Open Eyes\" (天开眼), and \"Stars like Rain\" (星陨如雨).[citation needed] In Japanese folklore, pheasants were considered messengers from heaven. However, researchers from Japan's Graduate University for Advanced Studies and National Institute of Polar Research claimed in March 2020 that red pheasant tails witnessed across the night sky over Japan in 620 A.D., might be a red aurora produced during a magnetic storm.[87] In the traditions of Aboriginal Australians, the Aurora Australis is commonly associated with fire. For example, the Gunditjmara people of western Victoria called auroras puae buae ('ashes'), while the Gunai people of eastern Victoria perceived auroras as bushfires in the spirit world. The Dieri people of South Australia say that an auroral display is kootchee, an evil spirit creating a large fire. Similarly, the Ngarrindjeri people of South Australia refer to auroras seen over Kangaroo Island as the campfires of spirits in the 'Land of the Dead'. Aboriginal people[which?] in southwest Queensland believe the auroras to be the fires of the Oola Pikka, ghostly spirits who spoke to the people through auroras. Sacred law forbade anyone except male elders from watching or interpreting the messages of ancestors they believed were transmitted through an aurora.[88] Among the Māori people of New Zealand, aurora australis or Tahunui-a-rangi (\"great torches in the sky\") were lit by ancestors who sailed south to a \"land of ice\" (or their descendants);[89][90] these people were said to be Ui-te-Rangiora's expedition party who had reached the Southern Ocean.[89] around the 7th century.[91] In Scandinavia, the first mention of norðrljós (the northern lights) is found in the Norwegian chronicle Konungs Skuggsjá from AD 1230. The chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from Greenland, and he gives three possible explanations: that the ocean was surrounded by vast fires; that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side; or that glaciers could store energy so that they eventually became fluorescent.[92] Walter William Bryant wrote in his book Kepler (1920) that Tycho Brahe \"seems to have been something of a homoeopathist, for he recommends sulfur to cure infectious diseases 'brought on by the sulfurous vapours of the Aurora Borealis'\".[93] In 1778, Benjamin Franklin theorized in his paper Aurora Borealis, Suppositions and Conjectures towards forming an Hypothesis for its Explanation that an aurora was caused by a concentration of electrical charge in the polar regions intensified by the snow and moisture in the air:[94][95][96] May not then the great quantity of electricity brought into the polar regions by the clouds, which are condens'd there, and fall in snow, which electricity would enter the earth, but cannot penetrate the ice; may it not, I say (as a bottle overcharged) break thro' that low atmosphere and run along in the vacuum over the air towards the equator, diverging as the degrees of longitude enlarge, strongly visible where densest, and becoming less visible as it more diverges; till it finds a passage to the earth in more temperate climates, or is mingled with the upper air? Observations of the rhythmic movement of compass needles due to the influence of an aurora were confirmed in the Swedish city of Uppsala by Anders Celsius and Olof Hiorter. In 1741, Hiorter was able to link large magnetic fluctuation to the observation of an aurora overhead. This evidence helped to support their theory that 'magnetic storms' are responsible for such compass fluctuations.[97] A variety of Native American myths surround the spectacle. The European explorer Samuel Hearne travelled with Chipewyan Dene in 1771 and recorded their views on the ed-thin ('caribou'). According to Hearne, the Dene people saw the resemblance between an aurora and the sparks produced when caribou fur is stroked. They believed that the lights were the spirits of their departed friends dancing in the sky, and when they shone brightly it meant that their deceased friends were very happy.[98] During the night after the Battle of Fredericksburg, an aurora was seen from the battlefield. The Confederate Army took this as a sign that God was on their side, as the lights were rarely seen so far south. The painting Aurora Borealis by Frederic Edwin Church is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the American Civil War.[99] A mid 19th-century British source says auroras were a rare occurrence before the 18th century.[100] It quotes Halley as saying that before the aurora of 1716, no such phenomenon had been recorded for more than 80 years, and none of any consequence since 1574. It says no appearance is recorded in the Transactions of the French Academy of Sciences between 1666 and 1716; and that one aurora recorded in Berlin Miscellany for 1797 was called a very rare event. One observed in 1723 at Bologna was stated to be the first ever seen there. Celsius (1733) states the oldest residents of Uppsala thought the phenomenon a great rarity before 1716. The period between approximately 1645 and 1715 corresponds to the Maunder minimum in sunspot activity. In Robert W. Service's satirical poem \"The Ballad of the Northern Lights\" (1908), a Yukon prospector discovers that the aurora is the glow from a radium mine. He stakes his claim, then goes to town looking for investors. In the early 1900s, the Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland laid the foundation[colloquialism] for the current understanding of geomagnetism and polar auroras. In Sami mythology, the northern lights are caused by the deceased who bled to death cutting themselves, their blood spilling on the sky. Many aboriginal peoples of northern Eurasia and North America share similar beliefs of northern lights being the blood of the deceased, some believing they are caused by dead warriors' blood spraying on the sky as they engage in playing games, riding horses or having fun in some other way.[citation needed] Both Jupiter and Saturn have magnetic fields that are stronger than Earth's (Jupiter's equatorial field strength is 4.3 gauss, compared to 0.3 gauss for Earth), and both have extensive radiation belts. Auroras have been observed on both gas planets, most clearly using the Hubble Space Telescope, and the Cassini and Galileo spacecraft, as well as on Uranus and Neptune.[101] The aurorae on Saturn seem, like Earth's, to be powered by the solar wind. However, Jupiter's aurorae are more complex. Jupiter's main auroral oval is associated with the plasma produced by the volcanic moon Io, and the transport of this plasma within the planet's magnetosphere. An uncertain fraction of Jupiter's aurorae are powered by the solar wind. In addition, the moons, especially Io, are also powerful sources of aurora. These arise from electric currents along field lines (\"field aligned currents\"), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon. Io, which has active volcanism and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, which have been studied since 1955. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, auroras over Io, Europa and Ganymede have all been observed. Auroras have also been observed on Venus and Mars. Venus has no magnetic field and so Venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity, sometimes distributed over the full disc of the planet.[102] A Venusian aurora originates when electrons from the solar wind collide with the night-side atmosphere. An aurora was detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard Mars Express. The aurora was located at Terra Cimmeria, in the region of 177° east, 52° south. The total size of the emission region was about 30 km across, and possibly about 8 km high. By analysing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from Mars Global Surveyor, scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized. This correlation indicated that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.[101][103] Between 2014 and 2016, cometary auroras were observed on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko by multiple instruments on the Rosetta spacecraft.[104][105] The auroras were observed at far-ultraviolet wavelengths. Coma observations revealed atomic emissions of hydrogen and oxygen caused by the photodissociation (not photoionization, like in terrestrial auroras) of water molecules in the comet's coma.[105] The interaction of accelerated electrons from the solar wind with gas particles in the coma is responsible for the aurora.[105] Since comet 67P has no magnetic field, the aurora is diffusely spread around the comet.[105] Exoplanets, such as hot Jupiters, have been suggested to experience ionization in their upper atmospheres and generate an aurora modified by weather in their turbulent tropospheres.[106] However, there is no current detection of an exoplanet aurora. The first ever extra-solar auroras were discovered in July 2015 over the brown dwarf star LSR J1835+3259.[107] The mainly red aurora was found to be a million times brighter than the northern lights, a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere. It has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material from the surface of the brown dwarf to produce their own electrons. Another possible explanation for the auroras is that an as-yet-undetected body around the dwarf star is throwing off material, as is the case with Jupiter and its moon Io.[108]",

                "content": "THE ROSE PARADE BEGINS AT 8AM PST ON JANUARY 1 IN PASADENA, CALIFORNIA, USA. For millions of people around the world, the Rose Parade is an iconic New Year’s Day tradition. The Rose Parade travels 5 ½ miles along Colorado Blvd., featuring four main types of entries: floral-covered floats, equestrian units, marching bands, and Tournament Entries. Many of these participants have long-standing ties to the Tournament of Roses, helping to keep the event’s traditions alive. The earliest Tournament of Roses, drew 3,000 spectators and showcased beautiful, flower-covered, horse-drawn carriages. More than a century later, the parade floats are a marvel of state of the art technology, all tucked away beneath flowers and other all-natural materials. LEARN MORE ABOUT ROSE PARADE HISTORY LEARN MORE ABOUT ROSE PARADE PARTICIPANTS Each year, more than 80,000 hours of volunteer work are contributed by 935 volunteer members of the Tournament of Roses Association. Known as “White Suiters” for their iconic white uniforms, these community-spirited volunteers donate their evenings, weekends, and holidays to ensure the success of both the Rose Parade® and the Rose Bowl Game®. LEARN MORE ABOUT VOLUNTEER MEMBERSHIP The Rose Parade is broadcast live in the U.S. by several networks. Check our list of broadcasters or your local listings for more information. For seating and ticket information, please see our Tickets and Events page. For safety tips and parade-day guidelines, take a look at our Parade Day Guide. 935 ACTIVE VOLUNTEER MEMBERS 80,000 HOURS ANNUALLY CONTRIBUTED 31 OPERATING COMMITTEES On January 18, newly installed President Ed Morales announced the 2025 Pasadena Tournament of Roses theme, “Best Day Ever!” “The 2025 theme celebrates life’s best moments – those unexpected times that bring a smile, warm our hearts and fill us with joy. From a once-in-a-lifetime experience to the simplest pleasures, each is indelibly etched into our memory,” explained Morales. “Together, we celebrate where we’ve been and what we look forward to. It’s about family, friends, and community and what we have to celebrate – and to be thankful for. On New Year’s Day and throughout the year, let’s celebrate the times that make up our Best Day Ever!” On October 7, The Pasadena Tournament of Roses proudly announced Billie Jean King, sports icon and champion for equality as the Grand Marshal of the 2025 Rose Parade presented by Honda. Tournament of Roses President Ed Morales announced on the front steps of the iconic Tournament House as King made a grand entrance to Elton John’s hit song “Philadelphia Freedom”—a song famously written in her honor. King’s selection as Grand Marshal ties seamlessly into this year’s parade theme: “Best Day Ever!”, celebrating life’s best moments. The Rose Parade features three types of entries: floral-decorated floats sponsored by a participating corporation or community organization, equestrian units, and marching bands. The only cars that appear in the Rose Parade are those that may carry the Grand Marshal, the Mayor of Pasadena, the Rose Bowl Game Hall of Fame Inductees and the Tournament of Roses President. Many of the Rose Parade’s participating organizations have long histories with the Tournament of Roses and have made numerous appearances in the parade. INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THE ROSE PARADE? Visit our Apply page for more information about applying to be a Rose Parade participant. Deadlines for floats, equestrian units and marching bands vary. FLOATS The Rose Parade’s stunning floats have come a long way since the early days of the Tournament, but the parade has always stayed true to its floral roots. Every inch of each float is covered in flowers or other natural materials, such as leaves, seeds, and bark. Even the most delicate blooms, like roses, are carefully placed in individual vials of water and added to the float, one flower at a time. It’s a process that blends artistry, tradition, and nature! APPLY AS A FLOAT PARTICIPANT The Rose Parade’s musical tradition began in 1891, when the Monrovia, California City Band joined the second Tournament of Roses Parade, marching alongside flower-covered pony carts. Since then, musicians from all over the world have been part of this iconic New Year’s Day celebration. The parade has welcomed high school, college, and military bands, as well as a wide range of performers—from marching bands and drum and bugle corps to brass bands, percussion groups, and even bagpipes, all adding their own rhythm and flair to the festivities. APPLY AS A MARCHING BAND PARTICIPANT Read the 2025 Marching Band bios EQUESTRIAN UNITS On January 1, 1890, Grand Marshal Francis Rowland and President Charles Holder rode out on horseback to lead the very first Rose Parade through Pasadena. Equestrian units have been a beloved part of the parade ever since. Each year, a mix of horse breeds—ranging from Curly Horses and American Saddlebreds to Gypsy Cobs, Andalusians, Miniature Horses, and Draft Horses—parade down the route, each adding its own flair and style. With colorful costumes and impressive skills, these riders and horses not only honor the parade’s traditions but also bring the theme to life with excitement. APPLY AS AN EQUESTRIAN UNIT PARTICIPANT Read the 2025 Equestrian Unit bios Each year the Tournament of Roses selects three judges to grant float awards based on many criteria including float design, floral presentation and entertainment value. The Tournament of Roses announces the award-winning floats on New Year’s Day prior to the Rose Parade. As the award-winning floats venture down the parade route, they are preceded by banners showcasing their award. The banners are carried by select members of the Tournament of Roses Eagle Scout and Gold Award Girl Scout Troops. On September 12, the Tournament of Roses announced the selection of Morgan Anderson, Bill Brzeski and Drew Rios as the distinguished judges for the 2025 Float Awards sponsored by FTD®. The 2025 Float Judges bios can be read here. FTD is the official floral partner of the Tournament of Roses. The iconic American company has been affiliated with the Rose Parade for more than 60 years. FTD decorates the antique automobiles which carry the Rose Parade VIPs down Colorado Boulevard including the Grand Marshal, Tournament of Roses President, Mayor of Pasadena and the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame cars.

                "title": "Rose Parade - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Rose Parade, also known as the Tournament of Roses Parade (or simply the Tournament of Roses), is an annual parade held mostly along Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California, United States, on New Year's Day (or on Monday, January 2 if New Year's Day falls on a Sunday). Produced by the non-profit Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association, the parade usually starts at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time (UTC–8), and includes flower-covered floats, marching bands, and equestrian units. The parade is followed in the afternoon by the Rose Bowl, one of the major bowl games in college football. It has been uninterrupted except during World War II in 1942, 1943, and 1945, and in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[1] First held on January 1, 1890, the Rose Parade is watched by hundreds of thousands of spectators.[2][3] The Rose Bowl college football game was added in 1902 to help fund the cost of staging the parade.[4] Since 2011, Honda has been a presenting sponsor of the Rose Parade.[5] Accordingly, the company has the parade's first float, which like all floats, follows the parade's theme. Members of Pasadena's Valley Hunt Club first staged the parade in 1890. Since then the parade has been held in Pasadena every New Year's Day, except when January 1 falls on a Sunday. In that case, it is held on the subsequent Monday, January 2. This exception was instituted in 1893, as organizers did not wish to disturb horses hitched outside Sunday church services.[6] Many of the members of the Valley Hunt Club were former residents of the American East and Midwest. They wished to showcase their new California home's mild winter weather. At a club meeting, Professor Charles F. Holder announced, \"In New York, people are buried in the snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let's hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise.\" So the club organized horse-drawn carriages covered in flowers, followed by foot races, polo matches, and a game of tug-of-war on the town lot that attracted a crowd of 2,000 to the event. Upon seeing the scores of flowers on display, the professor decided to suggest the name \"Tournament of Roses.\" Over the next few founding years, the parade added marching bands and motorized floats. By 1895, the event was too large for the Valley Hunt Club to handle, resulting in the formation of an ad hoc non-profit organization – the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association. By the 11th annual tournament (1900), the town lot on which the activities were held was renamed Tournament Park, a large open area directly adjacent to Pasadena's world-famous institution of higher learning, Caltech. Activities soon included ostrich races, bronco busting demonstrations, and an odd novelty race between a camel and an elephant. (The elephant won the race.) Soon reviewing stands were built along the parade route and newspapers in Eastern Seaboard cities started to take notice of the event. The stately Italian Renaissance-style mansion of William Wrigley Jr. (the maker of Wrigley's chewing gum) was offered to the city of Pasadena after Mrs. Wrigley's death in 1958, under the condition that their home would be the Rose Parade's permanent headquarters. Tournament House is the name given to the former home where the organization is headquartered.[7] The first associated football game was played on January 1, 1902. Originally titled the \"Tournament East-West football game,\" it is considered to be the first Rose Bowl. The next game was not played until New Year's Day 1916; they have been played annually since then. The game derives its modern name from Rose Bowl Stadium, which was built for the 1923 game. In 2002 and 2006 (when the Rose Bowl Game was the BCS National Championship Game), the \"Granddaddy of 'em all\" was not held the same day as the parade; the 2002 game was played on January 3, the 2006 game was played on January 4. Not all fans were pleased with the change; some thought the atmosphere and tradition of the Rose Bowl was lost. Once the BCS title game was separated from the host bowl, it no longer affected the date of the Rose Bowl Game (even when the title game returned to Pasadena in 2010 and 2014). Traditionally, a flyover signals the start of the parade. Since 2019, the parade concludes with a special guest doing the ceremonial pass from the parade to the Rose Bowl. On July 15, 2020, it was announced that the Rose Parade for 2021 would be canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it was assessed under current conditions that the construction of floats for the parade could not be performed in a safe manner, while the event itself (due to large crowds and outside visitors) was also considered to be at a high risk of causing more instances of COVID-19 infections.[8] The parade was deferred to 2022. However, the parade number was still changed; what would have been called the 132nd parade officially became the 133rd parade. On November 13, 2020, it was announced that a TV special titled The Rose Parade's New Year's Celebration would take the parade's place and premiere on January 1, 2021.[9] The Tournament of Roses Parade has followed the same route mainly following Colorado Boulevard (Pasadena's main thoroughfare and a segment of the former US 66) for many decades.[quantify] The day before the parade, the entire environs of the neighborhood streets south of the intersection of Orange Grove Boulevard and Colorado Boulevard are sealed off and reserved for the marshaling of the dozens of floats, bands, equestrian units, and other elements. This sealed-off section acts as the \"Formation Area\", and the Formation Area Committee manages it. On parade morning the various elements are merged and dispatched in front of Tournament House. The parade starts heading north on South Orange Grove Boulevard beginning at Green Street. At Colorado Boulevard it passes the main grandstands (and the main television and media stands) and proceeds east on Colorado Boulevard. The parade then turns north on Sierra Madre Boulevard.[10] The floats then must travel under the Sierra Madre Boulevard/I-210 freeway overpass, requiring over-height floats to reduce their height. The parade ends at Paloma Street near Victory Park and Pasadena High School. Floats continue into the Post-Parade viewing area (which is open that afternoon and the following day). In total this route is 5.5 miles (8.9 km) long; the assembled bands, horse units, and floats take approximately two hours to pass by. The 2009 parade featured 46 floats, including some new entries, such as Jack in the Box's Jack-O-Licious, City of Mission Viejo's Making a Splash, RFD-TV's Hee Haw, and the City of Roseville's Entertaining Dreams for a Century. The 2010 parade saluted the men and women serving America throughout the world with a flyover at the beginning of the parade by four F/A-18 jets (performed by pilots of Strike Fighter Squadron 22, the \"Fighting Redcocks\") from the Naval Air Station at Lemoore, California). New floats that joined the 2011 Rose Parade were: Beverly Hills Tournament of Roses Committee, Cunard Line, Dole, Los Angeles County Firemen's Benefit & Welfare: Never Forget 9/11 \"Remember, Reflect, Renew\", UNO 40th Anniversary, \"Messina Wildlife Management\", Namco Bandai Games, \"Quikrete\" Cement & Concrete Products, \"Saving America's Mustangs Foundation\", and Shriner's Hospitals For Children. The 2012 Rose Parade had 43 floats, 21 bands, and 18 equestrian units with approximately 400 horses. The honor for being the last units in the parade went to All American Cowgirl Chicks (Equestrian), Needham Broughton High School (Band), and RFD-TV (Float). It also featured the first-ever Swedish entry, the Royal Swedish Navy Cadet Band. The 2013 parade featured 42 floats, 23 marching bands, and 21 equestrian units. New for the 2013 Rose Parade were floats from Nurses' float \"A Healing Place\", Delta Sigma Theta, and the city of San Gabriel centennial float \"Celebrating Our Journey\". It began with the Wells Fargo/Opening Unit, American Honda's float, the United States Marine Corps's Mounted Color Guard and the U.S. Marine Corps West Coast Composite Band. Farmers Insurance's \"Love Float\" featured the wedding of a Virginia couple, Nicole and Gerald of Chesapeake, VA. The couple was selected through a first-ever public vote by the American people. The parade's closing unit featured Coco Jones of the Disney Channel. Featured in the 2014 parade were 45 floats, including new floats from eHarmony, K9s4COPS, Public Storage (\"Adventures In Space\")[11] and SeaWorld. Actor, director, writer, producer Garry Marshall played the role of \"director\" on Burbank's \"Lights...camera...action!\" float. KC and the Sunshine Band were featured on Stella Rosa Wine's \"Stellabrate Good Times\" float. Performing on the e-Harmony float was Natalie Cole, singing \"This Will Be\". NBC's The Voice joined this parade too, along with Daryl Hall and the Harlem Globetrotters. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation float (\"Living the Dream: Love Is the Best Protection\") featured a wedding of a California couple, Aubrey Loots and Danny Leclair; some people called for a boycott of the parade as the couple are actually both men.[12] Nancy O'Dell, along with Jonathan and Drew Scott (of the Property Brothers) co-hosted the parade.[13] The 2015 parade had 41 floats. New participants were ABC's The Bachelor, American Armenian Rose Float Association, Kiehl's Since 1851, Northwestern Mutual, United Sikh Mission, and Zappos.com. The 2016 parade featured 44 floats, 19 equestrian units, and 20 marching bands. New participants were Los Angeles Lakers, City of Irvine Chamber of Commerce, South Dakota Tourism, the California Milk Advisory Board, PBS (featuring Downton Abbey), and Union Bank. It marked the end of Bob Eubanks and Stephanie Edwards's participation in the parade for local television station KTLA. Singpoli Group's float \"Marco Polo East Meets West\", constructed by float builder Paradiso was judged as the sweepstakes winner, the \"Most beautiful entry in the Parade with outstanding floral presentation and design.\"[14] The 2020 Rose Parade featured 40 floats, 17 equestrian units with over 450 horses, and 20 marching bands. The Co-Grand Marshals of the parade were gymnast Laurie Hernández, actress and singer Rita Moreno, and actress Gina Torres.[15] The 2022 parade featured 43 floats, 18 equestrian units, and 20 marching bands in addition to the special units. The grand marshal was actor LeVar Burton. The 2023 parade's grand marshal was politician Gabby Giffords.[16] The 2024 parade's grand marshal was actor and singer Audra McDonald. The 2025 parade featured 37 floats, 16 equestrian units, and 24 marching bands in addition to multiple special units. The 2025 parade's grand marshal was sports icon and equality champion Billie Jean King in conjunction with the Women's Sports Foundation, who celebrate 50 years of changing the game. Originally the parade featured flower-decorated horse carriages. Over time, floats built by volunteers from sponsoring communities supplanted the carriages. Currently, most are built by professional float building companies and take nearly a year to construct. Some communities and organizational sponsors still rely on volunteers. The Valley Hunt Club still enters a flower-decorated carriage. The Cal Poly Universities Rose Float still relies solely on students who volunteer, with the present day requirement that \"every inch of every float must be covered with flowers or other natural materials, such as leaves, seeds or bark\".[17] Floats are self-propelled on (generally used-up) truck chassis[citation needed] in contrast to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade which uses trailer-based floats pulled by new, intact (sponsor-provided) trucks. Typically 48 to 72 hours before parade day, one can view several of the floats being decorated with flowery mantles in the various 'float barns' that dot the Arroyo Seco / Rose Bowl area in West Pasadena, not far from the start of the parade. It is a rule of the parade that all surfaces of the float framework must be covered in natural materials (such as flowers, plants, seaweeds, seeds, bark, vegetables, or nuts, for example); furthermore, no artificial flowers or plant material are allowed, nor can the materials be artificially colored. Last-minute volunteer opportunities are usually available. There are 6 \"Self-Built\" Floats: Cal Poly Universities, City of Burbank, City of Downey, City of La Canada Flintridge, City of Sierra Madre, and City of South Pasadena. Additionally, there have been a variety of commercial float builders, who, as of 2025, include Artistic Entertainment Services (AES) and Phoenix Decorating Company. Previous professional builders include Fiesta Parade Floats (1988-2024), Paradiso Parade Floats (2012-2018), and Charisma Floats & Designs (1987-2011). Anaheim city's float at the 2008 Rose Parade included the Stanley Cup that the NHL's Anaheim Ducks had won in 2007, hoisted by player Brad May. (As the regulations state that the outside of the float must exclusively use organic material, ABC commentators speculated that the city got an exception to display the Cup.)[18] Also, the Los Angeles Dodgers had a float in celebration of the franchise's 50th anniversary in Los Angeles, with Hall of Fame sportscasters Vin Scully and Jaime Jarrin as well as former players Steve Garvey, Fernando Valenzuela, Eric Karros, and Nomar Garciaparra. The 2010 parade floats included the Boy Scouts of America's 100th Anniversary float, the Consulate General of Mexico in Los Angeles in celebration of Mexico's bicentennial of independence, and \"Safety Harbor Kids\". The 2010 parade also featured a 113-foot-long (34 m) float from Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance Pet Foods, which set a Guinness world record for the longest single-chassis float. The City of West Covina paid tribute to the \"service and commitment of the Tuskegee Airmen\" with a float entitled \"Tuskegee Airmen – A Cut Above\", which featured a large bald eagle, two replica World War II \"Redtails\" fighter planes, and historical images of some of the airmen who served our country. The float won the Mayor's trophy as the most outstanding city entry – national or international, also Anaheim float featured the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game that was played at Angel Stadium of Anaheim, four former MLB All-Stars, pitchers Mark Langston, Chuck Finley, and Troy Percival, along with second baseman Bobby Grich were aboard. Since January 1, 2012, fell on a Sunday, tradition dictated that the parade would be held on Monday, January 2, 2012. The 2012 Rose Parade had 43 floats, featuring the Honda float featuring Grammy Award-winning musician Kenny G aboard, the LMU Centennial Celebration float,[19] and the Girl Scouts of the USA 100th Anniversary float (entitled \"What Will You Do Today?\"). Float builder Fiesta Floats donated their services to the design of the Girl Scouts float, which was decorated by the organization's volunteers (of all ages).[20] Paramount Pictures also participated in the 2012 parade with its centennial celebration float \"100 Years of Movie Magic\". Namco Bandai Games joined the parade for the first time, commemorating the Power Rangers. Others were Microsoft Kinect (\"You are the Controller\") and the Kit-Cat Klock (\"Timeless Fun for Everyone\").[21] The floats compete for one of 24 awards selected by three judges each year. Since Honda became the title sponsor, its floats are not eligible to compete for an award. After the parade, the floats are parked at the end of the parade route on Sierra Madre Boulevard and Washington Boulevard, near Victory Park and are on display for a day and a half (two-and-a-half days when January 1 falls on Friday) after the parade. None of the float riders or dignitaries/celebrities involved in the parade are present, and animated features on some floats are not activated. Admission to the viewing area is $13 and children are admitted free. The 2018 Rose Parade was the last parade for the city of Los Angeles after 122 consecutive years sponsoring floats for the Rose Parade. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti was aboard the float titled \"Everyone is Welcome\". Prior to the parade an \"Equestfest\" is held at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center to showcase the performances by the talented riding teams. Equestrian units taking part in \"Equestfest\" have included the Clydesdales of the U.S. Army's First Cavalry Division from Fort Hood, \"Traveler\" (the USC mascot), the Sons and Daughters of the Reel West, and the California State Fire Fighters Association. Bob Eubanks and Shawn Parr have served as announcers at \"Equestfest.\" Montie Montana was a perennial participant until his death in 1998. TV viewers know him from more than 60 appearances, waving to the crowd from his silver saddle.[22] 2010: 23 units – All American Cowgirl Chicks, Amigos de Anza Equestrian Drill Team, Arizona Mini Mystique Driving Drill Team, Benny Martinez Family, Calizona Appaloosa Horse Club, Cowgirls Historical Foundation, Giddy Up Gals, L.A.

United States Marine Corps Mounted Color Guard (Barstow, California) Top marching bands from all over the world are invited. Many of the nation's top high school marching bands, along with college and organizational marching bands participate. The bands participating in the parade have developed traditions throughout its history. For example, Pasadena City College's Tournament of Roses Honor Band always marches in the Rose Parade, along with the Los Angeles Unified School District All City Honor Band, all of whom are selected by audition the previous autumn. Positions in both bands are coveted, and those selected are among the best student musicians in California. The Tournament of Roses Honor Band's Herald Trumpets unit marches and plays directly before the Rose Queen's float. Nine trumpet players and one snare drummer are selected from those who audition for the band for the unit. University marching bands from the two schools competing in the Rose Bowl Game are invited to march in the parade. They typically accompany the float that represents the school and conference. . Bands that have a long-standing arrangement to be in the parade include:[23] In 1891, the Monrovia Town Band was the first musical group to perform in the Rose Parade. In 1998, the Washington Township High School Minutemen Marching Band from Sewell, New Jersey became the first band in the history of the Rose Parade to decorate its entire ranks with live flowers, in keeping with the practice of decorating the parade floats. From the neighboring town of Arcadia, the Arcadia High School Apache Marching Band and Colorguard has appeared for 15 years, returning about every four years. The Allen Eagle Escadrille from Allen, Texas had a record breaking 780 members in the 2016 Rose Parade. In addition to the parade, the bands participate in a two-day, three-show Bandfest at Pasadena City College's Jackie and Mack Robinson Stadium, usually on December 29 and 30 (December 30 and 31 when the parade is on January 2). Number of the bands also perform at other Southern California venues. Shortly after the parade in January, the newly elected President of the Tournament of Roses has the duty of picking a theme for the forthcoming festivities. Most of the floral floats in the parade are inspired by this theme.[26] On January 19, 2023, Pasadena attorney Alex Aghajanian was confirmed as President of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association for 2023–2024. He announced that the theme for the 135th Rose Parade and the 110th Rose Bowl game would be \"Celebrating a World of Music: The Universal Language\". The Tournament of Roses President will lead the 14-member Executive Committee and the organization of 935 volunteer members for the upcoming year.[27] The Grand Marshal of the parade is an honorary position selected by the president of the Tournament. Many are picked for a relationship to the theme that is also picked by the president. Traditionally, the Grand Marshal of the parade also participates in the Coin Toss during the Rose Bowl. The 2022 Grand Marshal was actor LeVar Burton.[33] As there was no parade in 2021, there was no Grand Marshal that year. The 2020 Co-Grand Marshals were Rita Moreno (from Electric Company), Gina Torres and Laurie Hernández. The 2019 Grand Marshal was singer Chaka Khan. The 2018 Grand Marshal was Oscar nominee and distinguished humanitarian Gary Sinise. For the 2017 parade, Greg Louganis, Janet Evans and Allyson Felix served as marshals. Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns was selected as the 2016 Grand Marshal. The 2015 parade Grand Marshal was to be Louis Zamperini.[34][35] After his death on July 2, 2014, the Tournament announced that it was \"committed to honoring him as the Grand Marshal of the 2015 Rose Parade.\"[36] During the parade, USC mascot Traveler walked in his place, riderless to honor Zamperini.[37] Vin Scully was chosen as the Grand Marshal of the 2014 parade and Rose Bowl Game. Previously, President Sally Bixby named Jane Goodall as the Grand Marshal for the 2013 parade, succeeding J. R. Martinez, the 2012 grand marshal.[38] Food Network star Paula Deen was the Grand Marshal of the 2011 parade.[39] Captain Chesley Sullenberger was the 2010 Grand Marshal and actress Cloris Leachman served as the 2009 Grand Marshal, the 10th female grand marshal in the history of the parade. Mary Pickford was the first female Grand Marshal. Other Hollywood celebrities who appeared as Grand Marshal are Leo Carrillo, Harold Lloyd, Walt Disney, John Wayne, George Lucas, and Bob Hope. Repeat Marshals of the Tournament of Roses Parade Each September, some 1,000 young women (and a few young men) between the ages of 17 and 25 interview to serve as a member of the Tournament of Roses Rose Court. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses administers a selection process to determine which greater Pasadena-area young women will have the honor of being crowned Queen of the Tournament of Roses, or more commonly known as \"Rose Queen.\" In addition to one Rose Queen, six Rose Princesses will also be selected to make up the Rose Court. The Rose Court will then ride on a specially-designed float in the Rose Parade and will also preside over the Rose Bowl Game. The Rose Court will also attend over one hundred events in the Southern California area as ambassadors of the Tournament of Roses. Residency for the Rose Queen and Court hopefuls include the Pasadena City College district and starting with the 2025 Rose Parade and thereafter, the cities of Alhambra and San Gabriel and the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Eagle Rock, Highland Park, Monterey Hills and El Sereno, which are served by the Los Angeles Community College District. One Tree Hill and Chicago P.D. actress Sophia Bush was Rose Queen in 2000. 1997 Rose Princess Lisa Remillard is an anchor with San Diego's KUSI television station.[40] The 2015 Rose Queen was Madison Triplett (John Marshall Fundamental High School). Members of the Royal Court were Mackenzie Byers (Pasadena City College), Gabrielle Current (Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy), Veronica Mejia (Pasadena City College), Bergen Onufer (Mayfield Senior School), Simona Shao (Westridge School) and Emily Stoker (Temple City High School).[41] The 2016 Rose Queen was Erika Karen Winter (Flintridge Preparatory School). Members of the Royal Court were Natalie Breanne Hernandez-Barber (Alverno High School), Donaly Elizabeth Marquez (Blair International Baccalaureate School), Bryce Marie Bakewell (Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy), Rachelle Liu (San Marino High School), Regina Pullens (Maranatha High School), and Sarah Shaklan (La Canada High School).[42] The 2017 Rose Queen was Victoria \"Tori\" Castellanos (Temple City High School). Isabella Marez of La Salle High School was crowned as the 100th Tournament of Roses Queen on October 18, 2017. Other members of the 2018 Royal Court: Julianne Lauenstein (La Cañada High School); Sydney Pickering (Arcadia High School); Savannah Bradley (Pasadena High School); Georgia Cervenka (La Cañada High School); Lauren Buehner (Arcadia High School); Alexandra Artura (Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy). The 2019 Royal Court consisted of Louise Siskel, Rucha Kadam, Helen Rossi, Lauren Baydaline, Sherry Ma, Ashley Hackett, and Micaele McElrath. As there was no parade in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no Rose Queen crowned for that year. Before that, the last time that a Rose Queen was not crowned was 1929. The Royal Court for the 2022 Rose Parade was announced on October 4, 2021, by Dr. Robert Miller, the president of the Tournament of Roses Association. They are: Jeannine Briggs (John Marshall Fundamental High School), Nadia Chung (La Cañada High School), Ava Feldman (South Pasadena High School), Abigail Griffith (Pasadena High School), Swetha Somasundaram (Arcadia High School), McKenzie Street (Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy), and Jaeda Walden (La Cañada High School). The coronation of the new queen was held on October 26, 2021. Nadia Chung was named as the 2022 Rose Queen. The 2022 Rose Queen is required to have been vaccinated against COVID-19.[43] The 2023 Rose Court was announced on October 3 and consisted of: Salia Baligh, Uma Wittenberg, Adrian Crick, Sahanna Rajinikanthan, Bella Ballard, Zoe Denoncourt, Michelle Cortez-Peralta[44] The 2025 Rose Court consisted of: Rose Queen Lindsay Charles (Westridge School), Princess Simone Ball (Arcadia High School), Princess Saniyah Brunston (John Muir High School), Princes Lara Georgian (Mayfield Senior school), Princess Kate Kelly (La Canada High School), Princess Lisette Parker (Maranatha High School), and Princess Natalia Pradhan (Flintridge Preparatory School). More recent attendance figures are followed by the TV and predicted attendance in parentheses. Most estimates are conducted by the Tournament of Roses and the Pasadena Police Department. A number of studies were conducted by the Anderson School of Management at UCLA on attendance and economic impact to Southern California. The Los Angeles Times ran a study in 1980 that said the actual attendance at the parade was actually about 60% of what is claimed each year.[citation needed] The Rose Parade is televised on ABC, NBC, Univision (in Spanish), HGTV, Sky Link TV (in Mandarin and Cantonese), Hallmark Channel, RFD TV, and KTLA (the latter three offer interruption-free coverage, although KTLA continues to repeat the parade throughout the day with commercials, and starting 2020 it has been livestreamed on its YouTube page). WGN-TV in Chicago carried KTLA's uninterrupted coverage of the 2009 parade (WGN and KTLA have historically been sister stations via former owner Tribune Media; both are now owned by Nexstar Media Group). Until 2005, the parade was also broadcast on CBS, and KTTV also televised the parade from the station's sign-on in 1949 until 1995. ABC serves as the official broadcaster of the parade[citation needed], and its sister network ESPN currently airs the Rose Bowl (which formerly aired on ABC). Each year, the newly elected Tournament of Roses President is responsible for selecting the year's theme and grand marshal. Preparation and construction of the floral floats theoretically begins after the theme is announced. The selection of marching bands is already well under way except for Rose Bowl Game college bands. In 2005, Libby Evans Wright was elected as the first female president of the Association. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses appointed former Los Angeles Times executive P. Scott McKibben as its executive director in 2010, replacing John M. (Mitch) Dorger, who had served as CEO since 2000. On September 8, 2011, he resigned for personal reasons. Chief Operating Officer William B. Flinn was named interim executive director.[51] From March 1, 2012, to January 2, 2017, William B. Flinn took over the role of Executive Director. David Eads became the Executive Director in 2017. The Tournament of Roses has become such a large event that it requires 65,000 hours of combined manpower each year, or the equivalent of roughly 7.42 years of combined manpower. The group has 935 members, each of whom is assigned to one of 34 committees, and around 50 student ambassadors. Responsibilities include: During the Parade, many Tournament members are required to wear white suits with red ties, name tags, membership pins and official ribbons. Because of this, the volunteers are commonly referred to as \"White Suiters.\"[52] In December each year, a fleet of white vehicles with special \"ToR\" license plates are seen throughout the San Gabriel Valley. The use of these cars is currently donated by American Honda for use by high-ranking Tournament members. Each year, an honor troop of Eagle Scouts from the San Gabriel Valley Council, (now GLAAC), and \"The Tournament Troop\" of Girl Scout Gold Award recipients of the Arcadia Service Unit of the Girl Scouts Greater Los Angeles, is selected to carry the parade banners down the route. Each year, for the last 35 years, more than 100 scouts have participated. The Tournament of Roses Radio Amateurs (TORRA) provided audio communications and video co-ordination for the parade officials through the use of Amateur radio from 1968 until 2005. With over 300 ham radio operators in TORRA there were several ham radio sites along the parade route equipped with amateur television as well as 2-way ham radios. Several mobile units – including motorcycles and pedestrian units (creepie-peepies) provided the video coverage. With modern technology and cell phone service, TORRA was no longer needed. Thousands more volunteers help cover the floats in those beautiful flower and seed mixes during \"Deco week,\" Dec 26- parade day. Many of these come back year after year, some even camp nearby to help all week long. For the 2006 Tournament of Roses Parade on January 2 (it is always held on January 2 when January 1 falls on a Sunday) winds with gusts up to 45 mph (72 km/h) and five inches (130 mm) of rain in the Pasadena area were predicted. The forecast proved accurate, ruining the 51 year record of good weather for the parade. It rained continuously and heavily throughout the entire 2006 parade. The President of the Tournament, the Grand Marshal of the Parade and the executive committee,[citation needed] deliberated into the early morning at the Tournament House. With street rumors circulating of the parade being canceled or postponed and restlessness of the crowd further east along the parade route, the parade got underway despite the bleak weather.[53] Low television ratings and poor attendance plagued the ceremony. Some floats sustained water damage by the end of the parade. The 1893 parade was the first parade to fall on a Sunday. The parade organizers decided that the parade might spook the horses outside of the churches along the parade route and disrupt the services. The \"Never on Sunday\" rule was instituted and has been in place ever since: if January 1 falls on a Sunday, the parade is shifted to the 2nd.[54] There are conflicting reports on the number of times this has happened. Several articles say that 2017 (the latest occurrence) was the 15th time.[55][56] However, the correct answer seems to be that the 2023 parade was the 20th time this has happened with the years being 1893, 1899, 1905, 1911, 1922, 1928, 1933, 1939, 1950, 1956, 1961, 1967, 1978, 1984, 1989, 1995, 2006, 2012, 2017, and 2023.[57]",

                "content": "in Europe (dark grey) – [Legend] Montenegro is a country in Southeastern Europe, on the Balkan Peninsula.[9] Its 25 municipalities have a total population of 633,158 people in an area of 13,812 km2 (5,333 sq mi). It is bordered by Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast, Kosovo to the east, Albania to the southeast, Croatia to the west, and has a coastline along the Adriatic Sea to the southwest.[10] The capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is the Old Royal Capital and cultural centre. Before the arrival of the Slav peoples in the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries CE, the area now known as Montenegro was inhabited principally by people known as Illyrians. During the Early Medieval period, three principalities were located on the territory of modern-day Montenegro: Duklja, roughly corresponding to the southern half; Travunia, the west; and Rascia proper, the north.[11][12][13] The Principality of Zeta emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries. From the late 14th century to the late 18th century, large parts of southern Montenegro were ruled by the Venetian Republic and incorporated into Venetian Albania.[14] The name Montenegro was first used to refer to the country in the late 15th century. After falling under Ottoman Empire rule, Montenegro gained semi-autonomy in 1696 under the rule of the House of Petrović-Njegoš, first as a theocracy and later as a secular principality. Montenegro's independence was recognised by the Great Powers at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. In 1910, the country became a kingdom. After World War I, the kingdom became part of Yugoslavia. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, the republics of Serbia and Montenegro together proclaimed a federation. In June 2006 Montenegro declared its independence from Serbia and Montenegro following an independence referendum, creating Montenegro and Serbia as they exist today.[15] Montenegro has an upper-middle-income economy, mostly service-based, and is in late transition to a market economy.[16] It is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the World Trade Organization, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe, and the Central European Free Trade Agreement.[17] Montenegro is also a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean,[18] and has been in the process of joining the European Union since 2012.[19] Montenegro's (/ˌmɒntɪˈniːɡroʊ, -ˈneɪɡroʊ, -ˈnɛɡroʊ/ ⓘ MON-tin-E(E)G-roh, -⁠AY-groh;[20] Montenegrin: Crna Gora[b] / Црна Гора;[c] Albanian: Mali i Zi)[21][22] English name derives from a Venetian calque of the Montenegrin phrase \"Crna Gora\", meaning literally \"Black Mountain\", deriving from the appearance of Mount Lovćen which was covered in dense evergreen forests.[23] Crna Gora was mentioned for the first time in edicts issued by Stefan Uroš I to the Serbian Orthodox Zeta Episcopate seat at Vranjina island in Lake Skadar.[24] It came to denote the majority of contemporary Montenegro in the 15th century.[25] Modern-day Montenegro was more and more known by that name in the historical period following the fall of the Serbian Despotate in 1459.[26] Originally, it had referred to only a small strip of land under the rule of the Paštrovići tribe, but the name eventually came to be used for the wider mountainous region after the Crnojević noble family took power in Upper Zeta.[25] The aforementioned region became known as Stara Crna Gora 'Old Montenegro' by the 19th century to distinguish the independent region from the neighbouring Ottoman-occupied Montenegrin territory of Brda (the \"Highlands\"). Montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century, as the result of wars against the Ottoman Empire, which saw the annexation of Old Herzegovina and parts of Metohija and southern Raška. Its borders have changed little since then, losing Metohija and gaining the Bay of Kotor.[citation needed] After the second session of the AVNOJ during World War II in Yugoslavia, the contemporary modern state of Montenegro was founded as the Federal State of Montenegro (Montenegrin: Савезна држава Црне Горе / Savezna država Crne Gore) on 15 November 1943 within the Yugoslav Federation by the ZAVNOCGB. After the war, Montenegro became a republic under its name, the People's Republic of Montenegro (Montenegrin: Народна Република Црна Гора / Narodna Republika Crna Gora) on 29 November 1945. In 1963, it was renamed to the Socialist Republic of Montenegro (Montenegrin: Социјалистичка Република Црна Гора / Socijalistička Republika Crna Gora). As the breakup of Yugoslavia occurred, the SRCG was renamed to the Republic of Montenegro (Montenegrin: Република Црна Гора / Republika Crna Gora) on 27 April 1992 within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by removing the adjective \"socialist\" from the republic's title. Since 22 October 2007, a year after its independence, the name of the country became simply known as Montenegro. The country is known as Mali i Zi (lit. black mountain) in Albanian,[27] while it is known as Crna Gora in Montenegrin, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian. Modern-day Montenegro was part of Illyria and populated by the Indo-European-speaking Illyrians.[28][29] The Illyrian kingdom was conquered by the Roman Republic in the Illyro-Roman Wars and the region was incorporated into the province of Illyricum (later Dalmatia and Praevalitana).[30][31][32] Three principalities were located on the territory: Duklja, roughly corresponding to the southern half, Travunia, the west, and Raška, the north.[11][12] Duklja gained its independence from the Byzantine Roman Empire in 1042. Over the next few decades, it expanded its territory to neighbouring Rascia and Bosnia, and also became recognised as a kingdom. Its power started declining at the beginning of the 12th century. After King Bodin's death (in 1101 or 1108), civil wars ensued. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, Mihailo (1046–1081), and his grandson Constantine Bodin (1081–1101).[33] [citation needed] As the nobility fought for the throne, the kingdom was weakened, and by 1186, the territory of modern-day Montenegro became part of the state ruled by Stefan Nemanja and was a part of various state formations ruled by the Nemanjić dynasty for the next two centuries. After the Serbian Empire collapsed in the second half of the 14th century, the most powerful Zetan family, the Balšićs, became sovereigns of Zeta.[citation needed] By the 13th century, Zeta had replaced Duklja when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro (Zeta) came under the rule of the Balšić noble family, then the Crnojević noble family, and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as Crna Gora.[citation needed] In 1421, Zeta was annexed to the Serbian Despotate, but after 1455, another noble family from Zeta, the Crnojevićs, became sovereign rulers of the country, making it the last free monarchy of the Balkans before it fell to the Ottomans in 1496, and got annexed to the sanjak of Shkodër. For a short time, Montenegro existed as a separate autonomous sanjak in 1514–1528 (Sanjak of Montenegro). Also, Old Herzegovina region was part of Sanjak of Herzegovina.[citation needed] From 1392, numerous parts of the territory were controlled by Republic of Venice, including the city of Budva, in that time known as \"Budua\". The Venetian territory was centred on the Bay of Kotor, and the Republic introduced governors who meddled in Montenegrin politics. Venice controlled territories in present-day Montenegro until its fall in 1797.[14][34][35] Large portions fell under the control of the Ottoman Empire from 1496 to 1878. In the 16th century, Montenegro developed a unique form of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire that permitted Montenegrin clans freedom from certain restrictions. Nevertheless, the Montenegrins were disgruntled with Ottoman rule, and in the 17th century, repeatedly rebelled, which culminated in the defeat of the Ottomans in the Great Turkish War at the end of that century.[citation needed] Montenegrin territories were controlled by warlike clans. Most clans had a chieftain (knez), who was not permitted to assume the title unless he proved to be as worthy a leader as his predecessor. An assembly of Montenegrin clans (Zbor) was held every year on 12 July in Cetinje, and any adult clansman could take part.[36] In 1515, Montenegro became a theocracy led by the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral, which flourished after the Petrović-Njegoš of Cetinje became the prince-bishop (whose title was \"Vladika of Montenegro\").[citation needed] People from Montenegro in this historical period were described as Orthodox Serbs.[37] In 1858, one of the major Montenegrin victories over the Ottomans occurred at the Battle of Grahovac. Grand Duke Mirko Petrović, elder brother of Knjaz Danilo, led an army of 7,500 and defeated the numerically superior Ottomans with 15,000 troops at Grahovac on 1 May 1858. This forced the Great Powers to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Ottoman Empire, de facto recognizing Montenegro's independence.[citation needed] In the Battle of Vučji Do Montenegrins inflicted a major defeat on the Ottoman Army under Grand Vizier Ahmed Muhtar Pasha. In the aftermath of the Russian victory against the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, the major powers restructured the map of the Balkan region. The Ottoman Empire recognised the independence of Montenegro in the Treaty of Berlin in 1878.[citation needed] The first Montenegrin constitution (also known as the Danilo Code) was proclaimed in 1855. Under Nicholas I (ruled 1860–1918), the principality was enlarged several times in the Montenegro-Turkish Wars and was recognised as independent in 1878. Nicholas I established diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire.[citation needed] Minor border skirmishes excepted, diplomacy ushered in about 30 years of peace between the two states until the deposition of Abdul Hamid II in 1909.[38] The political skills of Abdul Hamid II and Nicholas I played a major role in the mutually amicable relations.[38] Modernization of the state followed, culminating with the draft of a Constitution in 1905. However, political rifts emerged between the reigning People's Party, who supported the process of democratisation and union with Serbia, and those of the True People's Party, who were monarchist.[citation needed] In 1910, Montenegro became a kingdom, and as a result of the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, a common border with Serbia was established, with Shkodër being awarded to Albania, though the current capital city of Montenegro, Podgorica, was on the old border of Albania and Yugoslavia. Montenegro became one of the Allied Powers during World War I (1914–1918). In the Battle of Mojkovac fought in January 1916 between Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Montenegro, Montenegrins achieved a decisive victory even though they were outnumbered five to one. The Austro-Hungarians accepted military surrender on 25 January 1916.[39] From 1916 to October 1918 Austria-Hungary occupied Montenegro. During the occupation, King Nicholas fled the country and established a government-in-exile in Bordeaux.[citation needed] In 1922, Montenegro formally became the Oblast of Cetinje in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, with the addition of the coastal areas around Budva and Bay of Kotor. In a further restructuring in 1929, it became a part of a larger Zeta Banate of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia that reached the Neretva River.[citation needed] Nicholas's grandson, the Serb King Alexander I, dominated the Yugoslav government. Zeta Banovina was one of nine banovinas that formed the kingdom; it consisted of the present-day Montenegro and parts of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia.[citation needed] In April 1941, Nazi Germany, the Kingdom of Italy, and other Axis allies attacked and occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Italian forces occupied Montenegro and established a puppet Kingdom of Montenegro. In May, the Montenegrin branch of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia started preparations for an uprising planned for mid-July. The Communist Party and its Youth League organised 6,000 of its members into detachments prepared for guerrilla warfare. According to some historians, the first armed uprising in Nazi-occupied Europe happened on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro.[40] Unexpectedly, the uprising took hold, and by 20 July, 32,000 men and women had joined the fight. Except for the coast and major towns (Podgorica, Cetinje, Pljevlja, and Nikšić), which were besieged, Montenegro was mostly liberated. In a month of fighting, the Italian army suffered 5,000 dead, wounded, and captured. The uprising lasted until mid-August, when it was suppressed by a counter-offensive of 67,000 Italian troops brought in from Albania. Faced with new and overwhelming Italian forces, many of the fighters laid down their arms and returned home. Nevertheless, intense guerrilla fighting lasted until December. Fighters who remained under arms fractured into two groups. Most of them went on to join the Yugoslav Partisans, consisting of communists and those inclined towards active resistance; these included Arso Jovanović, Sava Kovačević, Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo, Milovan Đilas, Peko Dapčević, Vlado Dapčević, Veljko Vlahović, and Blažo Jovanović. Those loyal to the Karađorđević dynasty and opposing communism went on to become Chetniks, and turned to collaboration with Italians against the Partisans. War broke out between Partisans and Chetniks during the first half of 1942. Pressured by Italians and Chetniks, the core of the Montenegrin Partisans went to Serbia and Bosnia, where they joined with other Yugoslav Partisans. Fighting between Partisans and Chetniks continued through the war. Chetniks with Italian backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943. Montenegrin Chetniks received the status of \"anti-communist militia\" and received weapons, ammunition, food rations, and money from Italy. Most of them were moved to Mostar, where they fought in the Battle of Neretva against the Partisans, but were dealt a heavy defeat. During German operation Schwartz against the Partisans in May and June 1943, Germans disarmed many Chetniks without fighting, as they feared they would turn against them in case of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Partisans managed to take hold of most of Montenegro for a brief time, but Montenegro was soon occupied by German forces, and fierce fighting continued during late 1943 and 1944. Montenegro was liberated by the Partisans in December 1944. Montenegro became one of the six constituent republics of the communist Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). Its capital became Podgorica, renamed Titograd in honour of President Josip Broz Tito. After the war, the infrastructure of Yugoslavia was rebuilt, industrialization began, and the University of Montenegro was established. Greater autonomy was established until the Socialist Republic of Montenegro ratified a new constitution in 1974.[41][42] After the formal dissolution of the SFRY in 1992, Montenegro remained part of a smaller Federal Republic of Yugoslavia along with Serbia. In the referendum on remaining in Yugoslavia in 1992, 96% of the votes cast were in favour of the federation with Serbia. The referendum was boycotted by opposition parties such as the Liberal Alliance of Montenegro,[43] the Social Democratic and Socialist Parties,[44] as well as minority parties such as the Democratic League in Montenegro,[45] leading to a relatively low turnout of 66%.[43] During the 1991–1995 Bosnian War and Croatian War, Montenegrin police and military forces, under orders of president Momir Bulatovic[46] and Interior Minister Pavle Bulatovic[47] joined Serbian troops in attacks on Dubrovnik, Croatia.[48] These operations, aimed at acquiring more territory, were characterised by large-scale violations of human rights.[49] Montenegrin General Pavle Strugar was convicted for his part in the bombing of Dubrovnik.[50] Bosnian refugees were arrested by Montenegrin police and transported to Serb camps in Foča, where they were subjected to systematic torture and executed.[51] In 1996, Milo Đukanović's government severed ties between Montenegro and its partner Serbia, which was led by Slobodan Milošević. Montenegro formed its own economic policy and adopted the German Deutsche Mark as its currency and subsequently adopted the euro, although not part of the Eurozone. Subsequent governments pursued pro-independence policies, and political tensions with Serbia simmered despite political changes in Belgrade. Targets in Montenegro were bombed by NATO forces during Operation Allied Force in 1999, although the extent of these attacks was limited in both time and area affected.[52] In 2002, Serbia and Montenegro came to a new agreement for continued cooperation and entered into negotiations regarding the future status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This resulted in the Belgrade Agreement, which saw the country's transformation into a more decentralised state union named Serbia and Montenegro in 2003. The Belgrade Agreement also contained a provision delaying any future referendum on the independence of Montenegro for at least three years.[citation needed] The status of the union between Montenegro and Serbia was decided by a referendum on Montenegrin independence on 21 May 2006. A total of 419,240 votes were cast, representing 86.5% of the electorate; 230,661 votes (55.5%) were for independence and 185,002 votes (44.5%) were against.[53] This narrowly surpassed the 55% threshold needed to validate the referendum under the rules set by the European Union. According to the electoral commission, the 55% threshold was passed by only 2,300 votes. Serbia, the member-states of the European Union, and the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council all recognised Montenegro's independence. The 2006 referendum was monitored by five international observer missions, headed by an OSCE/ODIHR team, and around 3,000 observers in total (including domestic observers from CDT (OSCE PA), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe (CLRAE), and the European Parliament (EP) to form an International Referendum Observation Mission (IROM). The IROM—in its preliminary report—\"assessed compliance of the referendum process with OSCE commitments, Council of Europe commitments, other international standards for democratic electoral processes, and domestic legislation.\" Furthermore, the report stated that the competitive pre-referendum environment was marked by an active and generally peaceful campaign and that \"there were no reports of restrictions on fundamental civil and political rights.\" On 3 June 2006, the Montenegrin Parliament declared the independence of Montenegro,[54] formally confirming the result of the referendum. On 28 June 2006, Montenegro joined the United Nations as its 192nd member state.[55] Montenegro has been dominated since the breakup of Yugoslavia by Milo Đukanović (four-time prime minister and also twice president), accused of having established an authoritarianism and clientelist regime, while maintaining close relations with organized crime.[56] The massive privatizations of the Đukanović era lead to the enrichment of him and oligarchs close to him. His brother Aleksandar, owner of Montenegro's first private bank, oversaw the privatizations, while his sister, Ana Kolarevic, has long controlled the judiciary. The clientelist networks of the ruling party dominated all segments of social life. A party card was required to start a business or obtain a position in the administration. This policy also contributed to the reinforcement of regional disparities and social inequalities. Unemployment climbs to 36.6 per cent in the northern part of the country, compared to 3.9 per cent in the coastal region, while a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line (2018).[57] The Law on the Status of the Descendants of the Petrović Njegoš Dynasty was passed by the Parliament of Montenegro on 12 July 2011. It rehabilitated the Royal House of Montenegro and recognised limited symbolic roles within the constitutional framework of the republic. In 2015, the investigative journalists' network OCCRP named Montenegro's long-time President and Prime Minister Milo Đukanović \"Person of the Year in Organized Crime\".[58] The extent of Đukanović's corruption led to street demonstrations and calls for his removal.[59][60] In October 2016, for the day of the parliamentary election, a coup d'état was prepared by a group of persons that included leaders of the Montenegrin opposition, Serbian nationals and Russian agents; the coup was prevented.[61] In 2017, fourteen people, including two Russian nationals and two Montenegrin opposition leaders, Andrija Mandić and Milan Knežević, were indicted for their alleged roles in the coup attempt on charges such as \"preparing a conspiracy against the constitutional order and the security of Montenegro\" and an \"attempted terrorist act.\"[62] Montenegro formally became a member of NATO in June 2017, despite attempts by Russia to sabotage it,[63] an event that triggered a promise of retaliatory actions from Russia's government.[64][65][66] Montenegro has been in negotiations with the EU since 2012. In 2018, the earlier goal of acceding by 2022[67] was revised to 2025.[68] Legislation is being passed bringing Montenegro law in line with EU membership requirements. In April 2018, Milo Djukanovic, the leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), won Montenegro's presidential election. The veteran politician had served as Prime Minister six times and as president once before. He had dominated Montenegrin politics since 1991.[69] Anti-corruption protests began in February 2019 against Đukanović and the Prime Minister Duško Marković-led government of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), which had been in power since 1991.[70][71] As of late December 2019,[update] the newly adopted Law on Religion, which de jure transferred the ownership of church buildings and estates built before 1918 from the Serbian Orthodox Church to the Montenegrin state,[72][73] sparked large[74] protests and road blockages.[75] Seventeen opposition Democratic Front MPs were arrested prior to the voting for disrupting the vote.[76] Demonstrations continued into March[77] 2020 as peaceful protest walks, mostly organised by the Serbian Orthodox Church in the majority of Montenegrin municipalities.[78][79][80] In its political rights and civil liberties worldwide report in May 2020, Freedom House marked Montenegro as a hybrid regime rather than a democracy because of declining standards in governance, justice, elections, and media freedom.[81][82] For the first time in three decades, in the 2020 parliamentary election, the opposition won more votes than Đukanović's ruling party.[83] In February 2022, that very same government was voted out in the first successful vote of no-confidence in the country's history.[84] In September 2022 an investigation linked six Russian diplomats with twenty eight Russian citizens holding temporary visas for Montenegro and two local citizens in a spy investigation. The diplomats were expelled.[85] The Russian citizens were later banned from Montenegro and the two locals, one an ex-diplomat, face charges of illegal weapons, organising a criminal organisation and espionage.[86] In March 2023, Jakov Milatovic, a pro-western candidate of the Europe Now movement, won the presidential election run-off over incumbent Milo Djukanovic to succeed him as the incumbent president of Montenegro.[87] The Europe Now movement won the highest number of seats in the 2023 Montenegrin parliamentary election.[88][89] On 31 October 2023, Milojko Spajic of the Europe Now Movement became Montenegro's new prime minister, leading a coalition of both pro-European and pro-Serb parties.[90] The Parliament of Montenegro in June 2024 adopted a resolution acknowledging the atrocities committed at the Jasenovac concentration camp during World War II.[91] This decision, spearheaded by pro-Serbian factions, is viewed as a response to Montenegro's earlier support for a UN resolution on the Srebrenica genocide. Croatia has criticized the move, accusing Montenegro of politicizing historical events and warned that it could harm Montenegro's path to EU membership and bilateral relations between Croatia and Montenegro. The resolution has led to increased diplomatic tensions between the two nations.[92] Montenegro features high peaks along its borders with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Serbia. Its geography also includes a segment of the karst of the western Balkan Peninsula, to a narrow coastal plain that is only 1.5 to 6 kilometres (1 to 4 miles) wide. The plain stops abruptly in the north, where Mount Lovćen and Mount Orjen plunge into the inlet of the Bay of Kotor.[93] Montenegro's large karst region lies generally at elevations of 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) above sea level; some parts, however, rise to 2,000 m (6,560 ft), such as Mount Orjen 1,894 metres (6,210 ft), the highest massif among the coastal limestone ranges. The Zeta River valley, at an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), is the lowest segment. The mountains of Montenegro include some of the most rugged terrains in Europe, averaging more than 2,000 metres (6,600 feet) in elevation. One of the country's notable peaks is Bobotov Kuk in the Durmitor mountains, which reaches a height of 2,522 metres (8,270 ft) and was previously thought to be the country's highest point. In 2018, new triangulation measurements showed that Zla Kolata in the Prokletije mountains, which reaches a height of 2,534 metres (8,310 ft).[94] Owing to the hyperhumid climate on their western sides, the Montenegrin mountain ranges were among the most ice-eroded parts of the Balkan Peninsula during the last glacial period. Internationally, Montenegro borders Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Albania and Croatia. It lies between latitudes 41° and 44°N, and longitudes 18° and 21°E. Montenegro is a member of the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River, as more than 2,000 km2 (772 sq mi) of the country's territory lie within the Danube catchment area. The diversity of the geological base, landscape, climate, and soil, and the position of Montenegro on the Balkan Peninsula and Adriatic Sea, created the conditions for high biological diversity, putting Montenegro among the \"hot-spots\" of European and world biodiversity. The number of species per area unit index in Montenegro is 0.837, the highest in any European country.[95] Biological estimates suggest that over 1,200 species of freshwater algae, 300 species of marine algae, 589 species of moss, 7,000–8,000 species of vascular plants, 2,000 species of fungi, 16,000–20,000 species of insects, 407 species of marine fish, 56 species of reptile, 333 species of regularly visiting birds and a high species diversity of mammals are found in Montenegro.[96] Montenegro can be divided into two main biogeographic regions, which include the Mediterranean Biogeographic Region and the Alpine Biogeographic Region.[96] It is also home to three terrestrial ecoregions: Balkan mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests, and Illyrian deciduous forests.[97] It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.41/10, ranking it 73rd globally out of 172 countries.[98] The total share of protected areas in Montenegro is 9.05% of the country's area, which mainly comes from the five national parks of Montenegro.[96] Montenegro is a parliamentary representative democratic republic with a codified constitution established in 2007. The constitution describes Montenegro as a \"civic, democratic, ecological state of social justice, based on the reign of Law\".[99] Montenegro is a multi-party system. The President of Montenegro is the representative head of state, elected for a period of five years through direct election. The President promotes the country internationally through diplomatic engagements, promulgates laws by ordinance, calls elections for the Parliament, and ceremonially proposes candidates for Prime Minister, president and justices of the Constitutional Court to the Parliament. The President also ceremonially proposes the calling of a referendum to Parliament, grants amnesty for criminal offences prescribed by the national law, confers decoration and awards and performs other constitutional duties and is a member of the Supreme Defence Council. The official residence of the President is in Cetinje. The incumbent president is Jakov Milatović who has held the position since May 2023. The Government of Montenegro is the executive branch of government authority of Montenegro and led by the Prime Minister.[100] The role of Prime Minister is the most politically powerful office in Montenegro. All of Montenegro's governments since 2006 have been coalitions comprising a minimum of three political parties. The government is primarily based in Podgorica. The Parliament of Montenegro is the country's unicameral legislature, located in Podgorica. The Parliament has power to appoint the government, pass legislation (parliamentary law) and scrutinise bills (proposed parliamentary law). It also appoints justices of all courts, approves the budget and performs other duties as established by the country's Constitution. Parliament can pass a motion of no confidence in the Government by simple majority vote. One member of the Montenegrin parliament, known as a Deputy, is elected per 6,000 voters.[101] There are currently 81 deputies. Elections to the Parliament are conducted by the D'Hondt method, a form of proportional representation. In 2019, Montenegro was described as a hybrid regime (a political system which combines democratic and authoritarian features) according to the United States–based Freedom House. The organisation cited state capture, abuse of power, and strongman tactics by Prime Minister Milo Đukanović (2008–2010 and 2012–2016) as explanations for its description as such. Đukanović held a number of senior government positions, including the Presidency, before and after the dissolution of the union between Serbia and Montenegro. In 2021, the Economist Democracy Index (EDI) declared Montenegro as a \"flawed democracy\" and as of 2023,[update] it remains regarded as such by the EDI. Đukanović's pro-European and pro-NATO Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) narrowly lost the 2020 parliamentary election which ended the party's 30-year rule[102] and the pro-Serbia \"For the Future of Montenegro\" (ZBCG) parliamentary group, composed mainly of Serb nationalist parties, formed a government under Prime Minister Zdravko Krivokapic.[103] Prime Minister Krivokapic's government was toppled in a no-confidence vote after just 14 months in power.[104] In April 2022, a new minority government, led by Prime Minister Dritan Abazović, brought together moderate parties that are both pro-European and pro-Serb. However, his government lost a confidence vote after only 113 days. Since Montenegro had been unable to find a government which could command the confidence of the Parliament,[105] Abazović remained in his post until the Spajić Cabinet had been formed after the Parliamentary election which took place on 11 June 2023, where the Europe Now! party led by Milojko Spajić won the most seats.[106] In October 2023, a new minority government with confidence and supply support from ZBCG enabled Milojko Spajić to become the new prime minister.[107] Montenegro is divided into twenty-five municipalities (opština).[108] Each municipality can contain multiple cities and towns. Historically, the territory of the country was divided into nahije and during the beginning of SR Montenegro was divided into counties (srez). Regions of Montenegro—designed for statistical purposes by the Statistical Office—have no administrative function. Note that other organizations (i.e. Football Association of Montenegro) use different municipalities as a part of similar regions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was given the task of defining the foreign policy priorities and activities needed for their implementation in cooperation with other state administration authorities, the President, the Speaker of the Parliament, and other relevant stakeholders.[109] The country joined NATO on 5 June 2017.[110] Integration into the European Union remains a high-priority for Montenegro and has been the focus of Montenegrin foreign policy since its independence from Serbia.[111] In June 2023, newly elected President Milatović stated that he expects Montenegro to join the European Union by 2027 or 2028.[112] The current Constitution of Montenegro was ratified and adopted by the Constitutional Parliament of Montenegro on 19 October 2007 in a session by achieving the required two-thirds supermajority of votes. It was officially proclaimed on 22 October 2007. The Constitution defines Montenegro as a civic, democratic and environmentally friendly country with social justice, established by the sovereign rights of its government.[113][114] The judiciary in Montenegro is composed of several courts, with the Supreme Court being the highest judicial authority. It oversees the uniform application of laws. Administrative Courts handle disputes related to public administration. The judiciary also includes Basic Courts (for minor civil and criminal cases), High Courts (for more serious cases and appeals), and the Appellate Court for reviewing lower court decisions. The Constitutional Court is a separate body, tasked with safeguarding the constitution by reviewing laws and acts of public authorities to ensure their compliance with the Constitution. Judges in Montenegro are appointed by the Judicial Council and serve until the age of 67. The President of Montenegro appoints judges upon the recommendation of the Judicial Council. Additionally, the Protector of Human Rights and Freedoms of Montenegro (Ombudsman) is appointed by the Parliament for a six-year term, ensuring the protection of human rights and social justice. Montenegro has a relatively low homicide rate, with the rate fluctuating around 1.5 to 2.0 murders per 100,000 people in recent years. Abortion in Montenegro is legal on request during the first ten weeks of pregnancy. Discrimination on the basis of both sexual orientation and gender identity is banned in employment, the provision of goods and services, education and health services. Montenegro also possesses hate crime and hate speech laws which include sexual orientation and gender identity as grounds of non-discrimination. Since 15 July 2021, same-sex couples may register their relationship as a Life Partnership. Law enforcement in Montenegro is carried out by several agencies under the Ministry of Interior. Civil law enforcement in Montenegro is primarily the responsibility of the Police Directorate, the national police force. Municipal police, known as Communal Police, enforce local laws in their respective municipalities.[115] Law enforcement in Montenegro is carried out by several agencies under the Ministry of Interior. The primary law enforcement body is the Montenegrin Police Directorate, responsible for crime investigation, maintaining public order, and general law enforcement. The Municipal Police assist with local law enforcement tasks, primarily focusing on traffic regulation and minor public order issues.[116] Private security firms operate in Montenegro but have no legal authority to arrest or detain suspects. The National Security Agency (ANB) is responsible for counterintelligence and internal security, while Interpol Montenegro collaborates with international agencies to counter transnational crime. Special units within the police, such as the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit (SAJ), handle organized crime, terrorism, and high-risk operations. An agreement signed with the EU effective July 2023 permits EU Frontex border management personnel to operate in Montenegro in support of local border police operating on other, non EU, borders in Montenegro.[117] Emergency services in Montenegro include medical services, firefighters, and search and rescue units, which are coordinated by the Directorate for Emergency Situations. Emergency medical services are operated by local health institutions but are overseen by the Ministry of Health. The military of Montenegro consist of three professional service branches: the Montenegrin Ground Army, the Montenegrin Navy and the Montenegrin Air Force. The armed forces of Montenegro are managed by the Ministry of Defence, and controlled by the Chief of the General Staff. The President of Montenegro is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, to whom members of the forces swear an oath of allegiance. The Armed Forces are charged with protecting Montenegro, promoting the global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. Montenegro is a NATO member and a member of Adriatic Charter.[118][119] The government planned to have the army participate in peacekeeping missions through the UN and NATO such as the International Security Assistance Force.[120] Montenegro is the 35th most peaceful country in the world, according to the 2024 Global Peace Index.[121] The economy of Montenegro is mostly service-based and is in late transition to a market economy. According to the International Monetary Fund, the nominal GDP of Montenegro was $5.424 billion in 2019.[6] The GDP PPP for 2019 was $12.516 billion, or $20,083 per capita.[6] According to Eurostat data, the Montenegrin GDP per capita stood at 48% of the EU average in 2018.[122] Montenegro joined the Central European Free Trade Agreement in 2007 and has a free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association since 2012. The Central Bank of Montenegro is not part of the euro system but the country is \"euroised\", using the euro unilaterally as its currency. Montenegro was ranked 65th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, up from 75th in 2023.[123][124] The Montenegrin road infrastructure is not at Western European standards. No roads meet full motorway standards. Construction of new motorways is considered a national priority, as they are important for uniform economic development and the development of Montenegro as an attractive tourist destination. The European routes that pass through Montenegro are E65 and E80. The backbone of the Montenegrin rail network is the Belgrade–Bar railway, which provides international connection towards Serbia. A domestic branch line, the Nikšić-Podgorica railway, operated as a freight-only line for decades, that opened for passenger traffic after reconstruction and electrification in 2012. The other branch line from Podgorica towards the Albanian border, the Podgorica–Shkodër railway, is not in use. Montenegro has two international airports, Podgorica Airport and Tivat Airport. The Port of Bar is Montenegro's main seaport. Initially built in 1906, the port was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Reconstruction began in 1950. It is equipped to handle over five million tons of cargo annually, but has been operating at a loss and well below capacity. The reconstruction of the Belgrade-Bar railway and the proposed Belgrade-Bar motorway are expected to return operating levels to capacity. In 2023 there is a plan to install an LNG terminal at Bar to receive gas imports.[125] A total of 2.1 million visitors visited Montenegro in 2022 spending 12.4m nights there.[126] The majority of foreign visitors to Montenegro come from the neighbouring countries of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, as well as Russia.[127] The Montenegrin Adriatic coast is 295 km (183 mi) long, with 72 km (45 mi) of beaches and many well-preserved ancient towns. Some of the most popular beaches include Jaz Beach, Mogren Beach, Bečići Beach, Sveti Stefan Beach and Velika Plaža.[128] Meanwhile, some of the most popular ancient towns include Herceg Novi, Perast, Kotor, Budva and Ulcinj.[129] National Geographic Traveler (edited once a decade) ranks Montenegro among the \"50 Places of a Lifetime\". Montenegrin seaside town Sveti Stefan was once used as the cover for the magazine.[130] The coast region of Montenegro was considered one of the great \"discoveries\" among world tourists. In January 2010, The New York Times ranked the Ulcinj South Coast region of Montenegro, including Velika Plaža, Ada Bojana, and the Hotel Mediteran of Ulcinj, among the \"Top 31 Places to Go in 2010\" as part of a worldwide ranking.[131] The 2023 census reported 623,633 citizens.[132] Montenegro is a multiethnic state with no ethnic majority.[133][134] Montenegrins make up 41.1% of the population, Serbs 32.9%, Bosniaks 9.45%, Albanians 4.99%, and Russians 2.01%.[135] There is a significant number of other ethnic groups, including Romani people, Croats, Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Turks. Montenegro is one of 22 countries with a GHI score of less than 5.[136] The official language in Montenegro is Montenegrin. Serbian, Bosnian, Albanian, and Croatian are recognised in official usage. Montenegrin, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian are mutually intelligible as standard varieties of the Serbo-Croatian language. Serbian is the most spoken language in the country, as a plurality of the population at 43.18% consider it as their native language, while 34.52% speaks the Montenegrin language. There is also singificant number of people speaking Bosnian (6.98%), Albanian (5.25%), and Russian (2.36%).[137] Montenegro has historically stood at the crossroads of multiculturalism, and over centuries this has shaped its unique co-existence between its Christian and Muslim populations.[138] Montenegrins have throughout history been Eastern Orthodox Christians that are members of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which is governed by the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral and the Eparchy of Budimlja and Nikšić.[139] Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the predominant religion in Montenegro, with 71.1% of the population adhering to the religion.[140] Meanwhile, the Serbian Orthodox Church is the largest and most popular church, with approximately 90% of Orthodox Christians in Montenegro following the church.[141] A schismatic church called The Montenegrin Orthodox Church, which broke off from the Serbian Orthodox church in 1993, is followed by the remaining 10% of Orthodox Christians in the country. It also has not been officially recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and is not in communion with any other canonical Orthodox Christian Church.[142] Despite tensions between religious groups during the Bosnian War, Montenegro remained fairly stable, mainly due to its population's perspective on religious tolerance and faith diversity.[143] Religious institutions have guaranteed rights and are separate from the state. The second largest religion is Islam, practiced by 19% of the population. Montenegro has one of the highest proportion of Muslims in Europe and the third highest proportion among Slavic countries, behind only Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia. A little more than one-fourth of the country's Albanians are Catholics (8,126 in the 2003 census) while the rest (22,267) are mainly Sunni Muslims; in 2012 a protocol recognised Islam as an official religion, which ensures that halal foods are served at military facilities, hospitals, dormitories and social facilities; and that Muslim women are permitted to wear headscarves in schools and at public institutions, as well as ensuring that Muslims have the right to take Fridays off for the Jumu'ah (Friday)-prayer.[144] Since the time of Vojislavljević dynasty Catholicism is autochthonous in the Montenegrin area.[145] A small Roman Catholic population, mostly Albanians with some Croats, is divided between the Archdiocese of Antivari headed by the Primate of Serbia and the Diocese of Kotor that is a part of the Catholic Church in Croatia. Montenegrin culture has been shaped most importantly by Orthodox, Ottoman (Turk), Slavic, Central European, and seafaring Adriatic cultures (notably parts of Italy, like the Republic of Venice). Montenegro has many significant cultural and historical sites, including heritage sites from the pre-Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque periods. The Montenegrin coastal region is known for its religious monuments, including the Cathedral of Saint Tryphon in Kotor[146] (Cattaro under the Venetians), the basilica of St. Luke (over 800 years), Our Lady of the Rocks (Škrpjela), the Savina Monastery and others. Medieval monasteries contain many artistically important frescoes. One cultural dimension is the ethical ideal of Čojstvo i Junaštvo, \"Humaneness and Gallantry\".[147][148] The traditional folk dance of the Montenegrins is the Oro, the \"eagle dance\" that involves dancing in circles with couples alternating in the centre, and is finished by forming a human pyramid of dancers standing on each other's shoulders. Television, magazines, and newspapers are operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations that depend on advertising, subscription, and other sales-related revenues. The Constitution of Montenegro guarantees freedom of speech. Montenegro's media system is under transformation, along with the rest of the country. Sport in Montenegro revolves mostly around team sports, such as water polo, football, basketball, handball, and volleyball. Other sports involved are boxing, tennis, swimming, judo, karate, athletics, table tennis, and chess. Water polo is the most popular and is considered the national sport.[149] Montenegro men's national water polo team is one of the world's top ranked teams, winning the gold medal at the 2008 Men's European Water Polo Championship in Málaga, Spain, and winning the gold medal at the 2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League, held in Podgorica. The Montenegrin team PVK Primorac from Kotor became a champion of Europe at the LEN Euroleague 2009 in Rijeka, Croatia. Montenegro came fourth in the men's water polo in the 2016 Olympics. Football is the second most popular sport.[149] The Montenegro national football team, founded in 2006, played in playoffs for UEFA Euro 2012, its highest play appearance. The Montenegro national basketball team is known for good performances and won a lot of medals as part of the Yugoslavia national basketball team. In 2006, the Basketball Federation of Montenegro along with this team joined the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) on its own, following the Independence. Montenegro participated in two EuroBaskets. Among women sports, the national handball team is the most successful, winning the country's first Olympic medal, claiming silver at the 2012 Summer Olympics. This was followed by the 2012 European Championship which Montenegro won, becoming European champions. ŽRK Budućnost Podgorica has twice won the EHF Champions League. Montenegro was one of the host countries for the 2022 European Women's Handball Championship and came third. The first major influences to Montenegrin cuisine came from the Levant and Turkey: sarma, musaka, pilav, pita, gibanica, burek, ćevapi, kebab, đuveč, and Turkish sweets such as baklava and tulumba. Hungarian cuisine influences stews and sataraš. While Central European cuisine is evident in the prevalence of crêpes, doughnuts, jams, many types of biscuits and cakes, and various kinds of breads. Montenegrin cuisine also varies geographically; with the cuisine in the coastal area differing from that of the northern highland region. The coastal area is traditionally a representative of Mediterranean cuisine, with seafood being a common dish. The traditional dishes of Montenegro's Adriatic coast, unlike its heartland, have been significantly influenced by Italian cuisine.[150] 42°30′N 19°18′E﻿ / ﻿42.500°N 19.300°E﻿ / 42.500; 19.300",

                "content": "on the European continent (dark grey) — [Legend] Montenegro (meaning Black Mountain) is a small country in Southeastern Europe. It is on the Adriatic Sea, between Albania (to the South) and Croatia to the North. Inland (to the East and South-East) it also has a common border with Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. For most of the 20th century it was part of Yugoslavia. It had also been independent before World War I and existed as a kingdom. Its leader is Jakov Milatović. Montenegro was an independent country during the 20th century, but after WW1 was united to the newly created Kingdom of Yugoslavia.[8] Montenegro was part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 1918 until 1941 when Nazi Germany and the Kingdom of Italy invaded it in 1941. In 1945 the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes became SFR Yugoslavia (SFRY). This was the time Montenegro became the Socialist Republic of Montenegro, a federated state in Yugoslavia along with Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, and Macedonia. In 1948, Josip Broz Tito ended his friendship with Stalin. Yugoslavia became neutral and founded the Non-Aligned Movement. In 1991, Yugoslavia started to breakup. A country named Serbia and Montenegro was formed in 1992. Montenegro came to exist when its people decided to split from the country Serbia and Montenegro on May 21, 2006. Montenegro became a independent country after the Yugoslav Wars during the 1990s. The national song is called \"Oj, svijetla majska zoro.\"Montenegrin Cyrillic: \"Ој, свијетла мајска зоро.\"English: \"Oh, Bright Dawn of May.\" The size of the economy's GDP is $4.114 billion and it has 621,873 people in Montenegro in 2020.[1] The traditional old capital of Montenegro is Cetinje, but Podgorica is the new capital. The country adopted the Euro unilaterally as Montenegro does not have its own currency, but the adoption has raised the national debt to 57 percent of GDP in 2011. The most professed religion is Eastern Orthodoxy at 72.1% and the second most is Islam at 19.2%.[2]",

The Fulbright ETA program in Montenegro provides invaluable first-hand exposure to fluent English speakers, significantly helping to improve English language learning while also providing an avenue for cultural exchange. ETAs are usually placed at the University of Montenegro in Niksic and a leading high school in the capital of Podgorica. At the university, ETAs provide support for English language teaching instruction to English language majors studying to become English language teachers and interpreters. This placement includes independent teaching of communication and academic writing workshops. At the high school level, ETAs help Montenegrin teachers teach their subjects (e.g., mathematics, biology, physics, history) in English, as part of specialized bilingual programs (co-teaching assignment). For the last two years, we have also had a third ETA placed at the two private universities, the University of Donja Gorica and Mediteran, half-time at each, providing support for English language majors. This placement includes independent teaching of communication and academic writing workshops. The grant period is 10 months, or two semesters. The school year may vary, but candidates should expect to begin teaching in September and to conclude the exam period at the end of June. All grantees are required to attend a virtual pre-departure orientation in June or July as a condition of their grant. The Public Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy in Podgorica will provide in-country orientation upon arrival (assistance with in-country registration, security brief, etc). Well-rounded, articulate, self-driven candidates at all degree levels with an interest in international education and the initiative to teach conversational English at secondary school and university levels will be considered. Undergraduate and master degrees in the humanities and social sciences, with a focus on English, American Studies and Education, are preferred. Degrees in biology, mathematics, physics or history, with an interest in teaching these subjects in English to high school students are also welcome. Successful candidates will not just be teaching English, but also sharing about the United States culture and explaining the United States educational system to local citizens who have little contextual understanding of the United States. Previous teaching experience is highly appreciated. Applicants must be fluent English-speakers. In general, you will find that Montenegrins are very welcoming. You are likely to encounter some curiosity and receive questions about your work and about American life. Fulbright grantees occupy a unique position in Montenegro, somewhere between the status of an official visitor and a private citizen. While you will be subject to the same customs procedures, temporary registration formalities, and Montenegrin laws that apply to all private visitors to Montenegro, you will still be seen as representatives of the United States. In many situations, you will be called upon to represent the United States. Be conscientious of the fact that your actions and behavior will inform the way Montenegrins think about Americans. The climate in the capital of Podgorica is Mediterranean, with hot summers, mild and rainy winters, and continental in Niksic with somewhat colder weather and some snow. The culture is Mediterranean and laid back as well, with people enjoying their coffee culture and free time. The university educational system is based on the European Bologna framework, but the organization is less structured than in the United States, especially at the university level and does require flexibility and adjustment in the beginning to succeed in the academically different environment. Students are generally motivated and dedicated to their studies, and fellow teachers usually overwhelmed with the number of lessons and commitments, but generally kind and welcoming. Montenegrin language proficiency is not required but can be helpful. Some study of Montenegrin prior to arrival is encouraged to promote deeper engagement with the host community. Grantees will be based at either universities or high schools. Grantees will either teach independently or in coordination with an experienced English instructor, and will serve as a resource for classes and units focusing on conversation, vocabulary, reading, writing, academic writing and culture in the United States. Candidates must be prepared to take the initiative to develop and implement a curriculum with little to no guidance. Grantees will be expected to be able to work both independently and co-teach, depending on their placement. Course prep time and classroom may vary depending on placement type, but ETAs should expect to be engaged in ETA grant responsibilities for approximately 20 hours per week. Grantees are expected to engage in supplementary projects related to their personal, career, and/or educational interests for 2-3 hours per week. This may be an independent study/research project or other activity that will not conflict with assigned teaching and advising responsibilities. Applicants should include a brief description of their supplementary projects in their Statements of Grant Purpose. Grantees are also asked to design and/or participate in activities at the three American Corners in Montenegro (For more information, visit: https://me.usembassy.gov/education-culture/american-spaces/). Grantees are strongly encouraged to become involved with educational advising and outreach conducted through the EducationUSA Center, which is housed within the American Corner in Podgorica (For more information, visit: https://educationusa.state.gov/centers/educationusa-montenegro). Grantees are also encouraged to become involved in initiatives organized by the State Department’s Regional English Language Office, based in Belgrade (https://www.facebook.com/RELOBelgrade/), in addition to activities of the English Language Teachers Association of Montenegro which are carried out with State Department support (http://www.eltam.me/). This is an estimated amount and is subject to change. The financial terms of the grant will be confirmed in the grant document issued after selection. This is an estimated amount and is subject to change. The financial terms of the grant will be confirmed in the grant document issued after selection. The one-time allowances total includes allowances for round trip international airfare, settling in expenses, research, and language training.

                "content": "Kenny Dillingham (born April 28, 1990) is an American football coach who is currently the head football coach at Arizona State University. He previously served as the offensive coordinator at the University of Oregon, Florida State University, Auburn University and the University of Memphis. Dillingham began his coaching career at 17 years old, after he tore his ACL during his senior year.[1] He started off working with the junior varsity team at Chaparral High School before being promoted to the offensive coordinator of the varsity team at 21 years old.[2] While he was coaching at Chaparral, he went to Arizona State University, graduating in 2012 with a degree in interdisciplinary studies. He was hired to be an offensive assistant at Arizona State in 2014 under offensive coordinator Mike Norvell, whom he had met while coaching at Chaparral.[2] After Norvell was hired to be the head coach at Memphis in 2016, Dillingham was hired as a graduate assistant for the Tigers.[3] Dillingham spent the 2016 season as the de facto quarterbacks coach, since the team did not have an official quarterbacks coach. After Tigers offensive coordinator Chip Long left to be the offensive coordinator at Notre Dame, Dillingham was named the official quarterbacks coach for Memphis and added tight ends coach to his duties for 2017. After Long's successor Darrell Dickey left for Texas A&M, Dillingham was promoted to offensive coordinator for the 2018 season. In 2017-2018 Memphis had back to back top 5 offenses in college football. While at Memphis, Dillingham was rated the #1 recruiter in conference by the 247 recruiter rankings.[4] Dillingham was hired by Gus Malzahn to be the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Auburn in 2019, replacing Chip Lindsey. [5][6] During his time at Auburn he helped Bo Nix become the SEC Rookie of the Year while leading the most improved offense in the SEC. He spent one season with the Tigers, where they recorded a 9-3 record averaging 33.2 points per game.[7] Auburn also had its highest recruiting ranking in the 247 recruiting ranking era during Dillingham’s year as OC. After Norvell left Memphis to be the next head coach at Florida State, Dillingham departed Auburn to join Florida State as their offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, replacing Kendal Briles.[8][9][10] On December 17, 2021, Dillingham was hired as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at the University of Oregon under head coach Dan Lanning.[11] On November 27, 2022, Dillingham was named the 26th head coach at Arizona State University, replacing Herm Edwards.[12] He is the first Sun Devil alumnus and native Arizonan to hold this position. In his second season, Dillingham's team was projected to finish last in the Big 12 according to the conference’s preseason media poll.[13] However, they exceeded expectations, winning the Big 12 Championship game by defeating Iowa State and earning a first-round bye in the 2024 College Football Playoff.[14] Dillingham and his wife, Briana, have one child. He has wanted to coach Arizona State since he was young as it is his hometown team.[15] # denotes interim head coach",

                "content": "NEW! Find where to watch all of your favorite sports! Go behind the scenes of Arizona State's incredible season with head coach Kenny Dillingham and College GameDay. (3:43) WHEN KENNY DILLINGHAM speaks, it is hard not to listen. The sound of his voice, however, is only half the portrait. Watching him speak paints a far more complete picture. Dillingham's eyes seem to widen and ignite as if they have been flickered on by a match. Sometimes, his hands join the party while his eyebrows shoot up to the sky and his head bobs up and down, all of it harmonizing with the cadence of his words, which often feel like they are being spoken a mile a minute. This season, Dillingham's postgame interviews after wins have become a fascination and a small, but significant manifestation of his character. Whether baptized by a vat of celebratory Gatorade or simply worn out by being planted for three-plus hours under the Arizona sun, Dillingham often appears drenched and out of breath, as if he has gone through an entire game himself or run through a mental marathon. But even so, that only taps into a portion of the energy he possesses. Whatever remains, he seems to channel into his public speaking. Even through a screen, Dillingham comes alive. His coaching staff and players gravitate toward the combination of youth and bravado that makes him unique. And for those who decide to use the word \"quirky\" to describe him, they quickly follow it up with a caveat. \"He marches to the beat of his own drum,\" ASU assistant head coach and special teams coordinator Charles Ragle said. \"But he knows who he is and I think that that combination is what makes him special.\" Once in a press conference room, Dillingham might be slightly more subdued, but he doesn't hold back. He calls for his players to get paid \"what they deserve,\" and he has no problem referring to them as \"underpaid.\" He'll announce an impromptu kicker tryout in the middle of the season, or he'll explain matter-of-factly why he will support Arizona State players who decide to enter the portal while letting them stay on the roster throughout the playoff run. In this new, evolving era of the sport, Dillingham has little issue saying the quiet part out loud. The 34-year-old's filter is more like a sieve, an approach that stands out against the backdrop of monotone coachspeak machines that equate any display of personality as antithetical to their mission. Whether he is waxing poetic about his players on national TV or jumping with the ASU student crowd or even arguing with referees after they put one second back on the clock, like they did against BYU, Dillingham -- and by extension the Sun Devils -- have become the sport's Energizer Bunnies, speeding past expectations with a combination of fearlessness and chemistry that takes programs years to achieve. \"I love to compete. If you don't like to compete, you're not going to like it here,\" Dillingam said in a recent interview with ESPN. \"That's really what started the turnaround was just getting guys who are competitive.\" Arizona State has a running back in Cam Skattebo who has supercharged its offense. It has a defense that has improved leaps and bounds in a year, and a quarterback in Sam Leavitt, who could be a Heisman contender next year. But how the Sun Devils went from being picked to finish last in the Big 12 to conference champions and College Football Playoff quarterfinalists (where they'll face Texas in the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl on Wednesday at 1 p.m. ET) can't be explained without Dillingham, who is at the center of the glorious frenzy he has created. The Arizona native's edge and competitive zeal have permeated the program and turned the dire situation he inherited into a winning one overnight. \"He's somebody that stays true to himself. He's not trying to conform to an image,\" cornerbacks coach Bryan Carrington said. \"He's trying to do this in a unique, sincere, organic way, and for him being a Sun Devil, you can tell that he's very passionate about this place, he's very calculated about this place. He treats this place like his baby, because it's his dream.\" CHARLIE RAGLE SITS in Arizona State coaches meetings these days and listens intently. His brain often fluctuates between nostalgia and mild disbelief. Ragle isn't just the Sun Devils' assistant head coach and special teams coordinator. He isn't just a longtime football coach who has coached up and down the ranks of Arizona high school football. He's, maybe most importantly, the one responsible for Dillingham being here, at the head of a meeting room in front of an entire coaching staff, and not anywhere else -- especially not a courtroom. When Dillingham was entering his senior year of high school football at Chaparral High in Arizona, his father John -- a lawyer and member of the school's booster club -- asked Ragle to give Kenny a shot despite him coming off a knee surgery. But once Ragle, then the head coach at Chaparral, saw Kenny struggling to move on the field, he offered him a different opportunity. \"His knee was screwed up, and he came to me at some point that spring and was just like, 'I can't play. I can't do it,'\" Ragle said. \"''I'm basically done with football.'\" Ragle didn't want to see Dillingham walk away from the sport, so he asked him to stay, not to play, but to help as a student coach. Dillingham agreed. Once the season was over, however, he told Ragle of his uncertain plans: go to Arizona State and maybe become a lawyer, like his dad. Ragle didn't want to get in the way, but he asked Dillingham to take his classes and then make his way over to Chaparral in the afternoons to continue helping him. \"I just kind of took a liking to him,\" Ragle said. \"He was full of energy, same way he is now.\" If Ragle was the one who started the fire within Dillingham to coach, neither he nor anyone else had to do much to stoke it. Dillingham was hooked and poured everything into coaching. He quickly went from student coach to quarterbacks coach from 2007 through 2012 at Chaparral. He was the offensive coordinator for the school in 2013 when he willed himself into a job at Arizona State. \"The energy that he has right now is the same energy he had back then,\" said Todd Graham, who was the Sun Devils head coach at the time. \"He would come around our program every day and just wear me out wanting to come and sit in on meetings.\" Graham and Mike Norvell, who was then the offensive coordinator at ASU, finally relented and let Dillingham join. The 23-year-old asked if he could attend every day and Graham agreed, not expecting him to actually do it. \"Sure enough, he came every day,\" Graham said. \"I remember me and Mike watching him and talking about, 'Man, this guy wants it, he loves ASU, he loves the kids, he loves the program.' So we let him come around and the next year we hired him as a [graduate assistant].\" Dillingham's big break turned into a tidal wave of promotions. When Norvell went to be the head coach at Memphis in 2016, Dillingham followed as a graduate assistant. A year later he was the quarterbacks and tight ends coach. A year after that, he was the Tigers' offensive coordinator at just 28 years old. \"People always told him he was going to be a great coach. That usually means you're not a very good player,\" Ragle said. \"But he said they were telling him that when he was a little kid in little league. So I just think that the further he went in this, I think that he saw the success he was having in that. I think he realized he could be pretty good at this.\" Over the years, Dillingham made a name for himself as a youthful personality who could get the most out of quarterbacks such as Jordan Travis and Bo Nix. From starting at Memphis to becoming the offensive coordinator at Auburn, Florida State and Oregon, he was charting a path that seemed to be on an eventual collision course with a head coaching gig. Then, just a few months after he turned 32 years old, his alma mater called. WALK INTO THE Arizona State locker room on any given day and you might not be able to differentiate player from head coach so easily. Between the fracas of music blaring and Madden playing, Dillingham is often right in the middle, sticks in his hands, trying to do what he does on Saturdays: win. \"He will be head coach one minute and then he'll be the guy that's kicking the player's ass in Madden in the locker room an hour later,\" Carrington said. \"He's definitely a coach that's a full-time competitor,\" graduate offensive lineman Ben Coleman said. \"And I think that's really cool, because if your coach wants to compete so bad and everything, how can you show up to practice and not want to compete?\" Whether it's video games, pingpong or any other competitive forum, Coleman and his teammates have noticed something else, too: Dillingham isn't afraid to lose. \"He does care if he wins, but he's not scared to put himself in a position where he may not be favored in a situation,\" Coleman said. \"I think that was a good thing this year, because we saw it everyday. He's not scared to put himself in a situation where, 'I know you guys don't think I'm favored. I don't really care. I'm confident in my work and my abilities.'\" As Arizona State went into the season coming off back-to-back 3-9 campaigns and into the Big 12 without much fanfare, coaches and players say now that they thrived off letting Dillingham's self-belief seep into the rest of the roster. It does help, Coleman adds, that Dillingham's youth is more than just relatable; it's magnetic. Motivation and self-belief can only carry you so far in a game decided by slim margins and execution. But Dillingham's attitude goes hand in hand with his football acumen. Players and coaches rave about his ability to think outside the box when it comes to anything from offensive formations to trick plays. \"It's just how he looks at things and how his mind works. He sees things differently, he's really good at seeing numbers, and I think he's better than most people that I've been around when it comes to what football is -- a math problem,\" Ragle said. \"He has a gift with numbers and how his mind works. Sometimes you're like, 'Dude, that's completely ass backwards.' You know what? Nobody else in here sees it that way and that's OK.\" \"He's a genius. He is a genius forwards and backwards on both sides of the ball,\" Carrington said. \"The way this game comes to him and how fast he can regurgitate information, find a competitive edge and seek to be crafty.\" Carrington, who completed his diversity coaching fellowship under Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay, often sees the similarities between Dillingham and McVay in terms of their thinking, wittiness and deep wells of football knowledge and concepts. \"From finding ways to exploit teams, to get offenses or defenses in conflict, he's always got ideas,\" Carrington said. \"Some of the stuff that we've tried this year is almost like he's playing video games just like he plays Madden against the kids. If that's a creative field goal fake or a punt, fake or onside kick, he's always trying to find a competitive edge.\" The edge can often be tangible -- a play here, a formation there, a matchup over there -- but for Dillingham and ASU, the intangible advantage they have employed this year has come with ease. All season long, Dillingham's pulpit has professed an often-used \"nobody believes in us\" mentality that has resonated with a congregation ripe for hearing that message. Last season, the program had nothing to play for because of a self-imposed bowl ban that followed coach Herm Edwards' tenure, which was being investigated by the NCAA because of allegations of repeated recruiting violations. The Sun Devils brought in 23 players in the transfer portal last season (only one of them was a four-star recruit). Seventeen of them started in the Big 12 title game. \"I think we've embraced being the underdog, because he's allowed .us to do that and has ignited a fire within everybody to embrace us being picked 16th,\" Carrington said. \"We're in the College Football Playoff a year after having a team with nothing to play for and a disaster situation. We were behind the eight ball. So yeah, the guys that chose to come here already had a chip on their shoulder and they wanted to flip the script.\" Not even those inside, however, expected it to flip this quickly. In the span of a year, the Sun Devils nearly doubled their combined win total of the past two years. Their offense is averaging over 100 more yards per game than it did last season while nearly doubling its points per game total. Their defense, meanwhile, ranks in the top 30 of SP+ and has forced 22 turnovers this season. Last season, it forced nine -- a mark that was better than only four teams in all of FBS. \"I would've thought we would've probably been probably one year away from it, but I knew with the excitement and plan Kenny brought into this program, I knew it would happen pretty quickly,\" running backs coach Shaun Aguano said. \"We knew [winning] was going to come along sometime. It just happened faster than we thought.\" THE MORE GAMES Arizona State won this season, the more Aguano's phone kept buzzing with calls and texts from local high school coaches. Aguano, a longtime staple of the Arizona high school scene and one of the winningest high school coaches in the area, became the interim coach at ASU after the school fired Edwards in 2022. In and around the city, there was a lot of support for Aguano, and keeping him on staff was one of Dillingham's first decisions. It didn't take long for Aguano to see that Dillingham had the right mindset for the program. \"When he talks about activating the Valley, he's got the community involved more than I've ever seen in the years I've been here,\" Aguano said. \"That same energy that he shows in those interviews is the exact same thing that he projects when he's in front of the team or in front of the coaches. He's bouncing around the hallways from five in the morning till 10 at night, and that carries to the rest of the program.\" When it comes to recruiting and the portal, Dillingham's spark plays well. As Coleman explained, not every coach has the ability to connect with younger players and relate to them. Follow Dillingham on X, and posts and reposts will quickly fill up your timeline. If there's anything being said about his team or his players that is positive, he is there to amplify it, comment on it or add to the noise. It wouldn't be far-fetched to say the 34-year-old is one of the most online coaches in FBS. \"How could you not want to go play for somebody who is publicly advocating for you?\" Coleman said. Dillingham's approach has been to embrace the game's evolution rather than fight it or even begrudgingly accept it. It's why he has no problem asking for money publicly, wearing a T-shirt with ASU's NIL collective postgame or promoting his players on podiums and through posts and connecting them with local businesses for NIL opportunities. \"We're doing more with guys who just got it out of the mud, but eventually you should get what you deserve,\" Dillingham said after the Sun Devils knocked off No. 14 BYU on Nov. 23, while wearing the collective's shirt. \"Our guys deserve more, and that's why I wore this.\" \"He's more versed in NIL than anyone we have ever had here,\" Aguano said. \"He understands exactly what's going on, the rules of everything, how to take advantage of it.\" It's not just the players' pockets he's thinking about, either. When he has been asked about his own contract extension talks, Dillingham has shifted the focus toward assistants and players. And when the program reached nine wins this season, triggering a $200,000 bonus for Dillingham, he promptly redistributed it among 20 off-field staff members. \"This dude is thinking about football nonstop,\" Ragle said. \"And it's not just the X's and O's, it's about how the game is changing. You see guys that are in their early 60s, late 50s, I think growing weary of the game and the way that college football is changing in real time, and he's over here manufacturing ideas that can help his program.\" But those inside the program know that Dillingham's fervor and strategy, however impressive, has to be backed by substance, and that, ultimately, comes down to winning. After the Sun Devils earned 11 wins this season, coaches who have been out on the trail or recruiting the portal have noticed the difference in the way ASU is perceived. \"It's a lot of people that are answering the phones that weren't answering the phone three months ago,\" Carrington said. \"We're the flavor of the month now.\" Graham knows well what the Valley can be when it is, in fact, activated. While he was in Tempe for six seasons, Graham saw the highs and lows, including back-to-back double-digit win seasons in 2012 and 2013 and the way that the city and the school were passionate for a winner. Graham believes that Dillingham's hire came at what was likely the lowest point of the program after the \"debilitating\" mistakes that preceded it. \"He had a harder job than I had,\" Graham said. \"And let me tell you, a year ago, at 3-9, there weren't many people believing in what he was doing. Now? He's got a whole lot of people believing. It's a magical place to be right now.\" While Dillingham may shy away from credit at any turn, there is a clear awareness within the program of how crucial he has been to the turnaround. Football is a team sport, but successful program-building always requires more than just a face. \"I'm like, 'I know you don't need credit, but we all know that you're the driving force of this whole program,'\" Coleman said. \"Because when stuff goes wrong, he's the first person that gets looked at, so when stuff goes right, I always like to say that he's the reason why stuff goes right.\" A lot has gone right for Arizona State this season, and though it is not done yet, what Dillingham has been able to do in a flash has given the Sun Devils hope, momentum, but most importantly, a blueprint for success.",

                "title": "Kenny Dillingham pushes Arizona State into College Football Playoff",
                "content": "ATLANTA — It all lined up perfectly, the 32-year-old wunderkind taking over the program he knew inside and out, returning to the metropolitan area where he was born and raised, fulfilling his lifelong goal of becoming a head coach before most of his peers had even gotten their careers off the ground. But besides the paycheck, there were reasons to be skeptical about the task Kenny Dillingham was signing up for. Despite his relative inexperience and unbridled ambition, Dillingham knew the drill when it came to Arizona State football: Decades of unfulfilled potential, challenges getting the local community to support college sports in a pro-dominated market and the potential for NCAA penalties thanks to the mismanagement of his predecessor, Herm Edwards. If it didn’t work, Dillingham’s aspirations were probably not going to end up the way he envisioned, “Usually you only get one opportunity to be a head coach,” Dillingham said. “When we took over, it was in a different place. I knew it was going to be difficult.” Instead, the youngest coach in FBS has made it look easy. On Wednesday afternoon, Arizona State — a 3-9 team just one year ago, picked to finish last in the Big 12 six months ago — will take the field against Texas in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals. Forget the fact that Arizona State is the biggest underdog in any of the remaining playoff matchups. Forget that this program hasn’t finished a season in the top 10 since 1996. Forget that Dillingham was a graduate assistant at Memphis a mere eight years ago while his counterpart, Steve Sarkisian, has a résumé that took him from one blue blood (Southern California) to another (Alabama) to yet one more (Texas) with a two-year NFL stint in between. EXPERT PICKS: Who wins Fiesta Bowl between Penn State, Boise State? TUESDAY SCHEDULE: Breaking down the five bowls on New Year's Eve In a college football era defined by disruption, where season by season fortunes hinge on fine margins and a program’s relationship with its players feels more transactional than organic, Arizona State is here to show us what’s possible. And Dillingham is here to show us that the new normal doesn’t have to be so bad. “He just makes it about the players,” defensive coordinator Brian Ward said. “It's not the top-down model, the hierarchy that’s always been college football. I think a lot of people have a hard time adjusting and adapting. Kenny is different.” These are cynical times for college sports. When coaches aren’t complaining publicly about the recruiting environment or the transfer portal, most of them are doing it privately. Every time a coach walks away, even if they’re at the typical retirement age, it seems like a referendum on the industry’s struggle to manage name, image and likeness rules in an orderly manner. The NCAA seems feckless, unable to enforce its rules while it waits to be rescued by Congress. Even expanding the College Football Playoff to 12 teams has created detractors nitpicking the teams that were selected or the competitiveness of the first-round games a little more than a week ago. But at the end of the day, what’s better for the sport: the same five or six programs dominating everything, or a perennial mediocrity like Arizona State finally getting it right and being rewarded with relevance and hope? It’s an easy answer. Yes, college football needs the gravitas of its Texases and Ohio States. But for far too long, the Arizona States didn't really have a place in this sport barring a massive, once-a-century type of fluke. Even a year ago, Arizona State would have gotten a pat on the head and a cool bowl trip for going 11-2 and winning the Big 12. That would have been a nice reward for the players, but it’s not validation. The new CFP has shown that every school is one good hire and a nice run in the transfer portal away from getting its chance to compete for a national title, even as unlikely as that might be. And were not talking about Little Sisters of the Poor here. Arizona State has 57,000 in-person undergrads, sits adjacent to a top-15 media market and has one of the most attractive on-campus setups in the country when you consider the weather and scenery. If *that* school is doomed to be shut out of college football’s spoils because of decades-long structural disadvantages, you’re not maximizing what the sport can be and how it can touch all corners of the country. It’s uncertain what this run means for the future of Arizona State. But at least there’s a chance to ignite something that for too long felt unattainable — even for someone like Dillingham who went to high school half an hour from campus. “We compete against teams and fan bases that are obsessive,” Dillingham said. “We have to become an obsessive fan base, and if we can do that in (one of the largest cities) in the country where people go to retire, you’ve got something special. People have to see the joy, see the excitement. They have to see there’s no difference between winning for the city and how it creates winning for the local businesses and what winning does for a player when they reap benefits and are top-five in the Heisman vote. Everybody wins when you win, so why not get the entire state, the entire city behind a winner?” And with Dillingham, you’re not going to have to search hard for the emotional connection. He cries in front of players. Sometimes he loses his cool and turns into an Internet meme. He simultaneously makes you believe he belongs in the upper echelon of college coaches while conveying a sense that there’s a true generational shift underway from the Nick Saban types to the Millennials like Dillingham or Notre Dame’s Marcus Freeman who are now starting to get these jobs. That sense of inexperience and lack of seriousness — whether fair or not — has forever been the most significant barrier in college football for younger coaches. But as the sport’s longtime standard bearers find frustration in the sport’s new culture where relationships are year-to-year and there are no rules binding players to programs, youth may be an asset. “Intuition and thinking outside the box in this era is important, and he doesn’t have years of experience that ‘This is how I’ve always done it as a head coach,’” said Sarkisian, who was 35 when he took over his first head coaching job at Washington. “He has a little more of a blank canvas that he can shape in terms of how to manage the portal, manage NIL, manage conference realignment. “I look back on it when I was 34 thinking, I didn’t know what the heck I was doing. But I had a ton of energy back then, and Kenny does too. The rapport with players is always helpful when you’re a little younger, and that energy is needed when you’re struggling in Year 1 so I have a ton of respect for the job he's done.” Energy is a word you’ll hear a lot around Dillingham, but it’s not just staying up late to make recruiting phone calls or doing a lot of interviews to give the appearance of working hard. More important is the locker room energy that he seeks when bringing people into the program. If a recruit doesn’t respond to his extroverted personality— or isn’t going to match his energy, as the kids say — it’s just not going to work. “He’s all about getting good people at our place,” said Hines Ward, the longtime Pittsburgh Steelers standout who joined Dillingham’s staff this year as receivers coach. “We’re not going to beg kids to come to Arizona State. We’re going to get kids that want to be a part of our program, that wants to get development and be a part of something special we're building. It’s made it fun.” It’s always hard to know exactly what goes on behind closed doors in a football program, but it was notable that within a couple days of winning the Big 12 title Dillingham’s social media feed was amplifying announcements of Arizona State players who entered the transfer portal along with message of support like: Dillingham didn’t have to do that — not many coaches do. But in his mind, players shouldn’t have to choose between getting a better opportunity somewhere else and missing out on a potential once-in-a-lifetime experience. Without everyone’s contributions from the starting quarterback to the scout team, Arizona State isn’t here. So where others complain, Dillingham adapts. But in the end, he insists what’s happened for the Sun Devils isn’t because he’s some genius. This may not have even happened at a different school, he said, where he doesn’t have the same history and institutional knowledge of the unique circumstances surrounding Arizona State. But now they're here, getting ready to play a game that would have seemed impossible a couple years ago. Now the future looks limitless, and maybe Arizona State won’t even need to wait to ascend another level. That’s what the 12-team College Football Playoff has done. And that’s what Dillingham’s infectious personality has gotten the Sun Devils to believe. “There’s no doubt we’re playing with house money,” he said. \"Nobody expected us to be here. But our guys got to this point because they’re ultra competitors. I get asked all the time, 'Have you reflected?’ No, I haven’t reflected. Right now it’s about doing whatever we can to be the best version of us today, tomorrow and the next day. But eventually I’ll probably look back and be like holy cow, look what we just did.\"",

                "content": "Babies born in the new year, and for the 14 years following, will make up the newest generation: Generation Beta. Its members will explore new digital landscapes, many of which we likely can't fathom now, and see the next century. Members of Gen Beta, for short, will be the children of younger millennials and older Gen Zers and by 2035, they are estimated to make up at least 16% of the global population, according to McCrindle, an Australian social researcher led by generational analyst Mark McCrindle. Additionally, many Gen Beta members will likely live into the 22nd century. Babies born in 2025 will be 76 years old when the year 2101 comes around. Here's what to know about Generation Beta and those that came before. Members of Gen Beta will be born between 2025 and 2039, according to McCrindle. Generation Beta follows Generation Alpha, in line with the Greek alphabet. McCrindle predicts that digital and physical life will be seamless for Gen Beta. While members of Gen Alpha have become acquainted with smart technology and artificial intelligence, Gen Beta will experience AI and automation in every aspect of life, from school to work to health care and entertainment, McCrindle says. Gen Z, millennial, zillennial?Find your generation — and what it means — by year As technology continues to rapidly advance, Gen Z parents are likely to be more cautious with how their children interact with the digital world. According to McCrindle, 36% of Gen Z parents, compared to 30% of millennial parents, strongly agree that children's screen time should be limited. Technology aside, Gen Beta will be asked to manage life through climate change, global population shifts and rapid urbanization, McCrindle states. But members of this generation will also be raised by eco-conscious millennial and Gen Z parents who prioritize adaptability. According to the Pew Research Center, 71% of millennials and 67% of Gen Zers believe climate change should be the top priority to ensure a sustainable planet for the future. The start and end of a new generation is sometimes vague, but these generation group names are often used for individuals born between the following years: ◾ Greatest Generation: 1901-1927 ◾ Silent Generation: 1928-1945 (age 80+) ◾ Baby Boomers: 1946-1964 (age 61-79) ◾ Generation X: 1965-1979 (age 46-60) ◾ Millennials: 1980-1994 (age 31-45) ◾ Generation Z: 1995-2009 (age 16-30) ◾ Gen Alpha: 2010-2024 (age 15 and younger) If naming conventions continue following the current trend, it is likely that the next generational group, after Gen Beta, will be Generation Gamma, according to McCrindle. This generation will likely represent those born between 2040 and 2054. Greta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY. Follow her on X and Instagram @gretalcross. Story idea?

                "title": "What Is Gen Beta? How Babies Born From 2025 Will Change the World - Newsweek",
                "content": "The name of the new generation born after January 1, 2025, has been revealed to be Gen Beta, officially the world's youngest generation, according to Mark McCrindle, a demographer and social analyst. McCrindle, who previously coined the name Gen Alpha, wrote in a blog post that the new generation will span from 2025 until 2039. By 2035, Gen Beta is expected to make up 16 percent of the population, and many may live to see the turn of the 22nd century. Newsweek reached out to McCrindle's company of the same name for comment via a form on its website outside of business hours. The birth of Gen Beta as a generation is significant because this new generation will be the first to live in a world where artificial intelligence and automation are a part of everyday life, in addition to other vast technological advancements to come. McCrindle noted that Gen Beta will likely be the first generation to experience automation in terms of their transport and become accustomed to utilizing wearable health technologies and immersive virtual environments. AI will also likely be a staple in the everyday lives of these children and play a role in their education, shopping, and other activities involving learning or decision-making. Gen Beta will also likely have to come to grips with the worsening effects of global warming and the ramifications of climate change in the present day and in the future, as well as global population shifts and sociopolitical and economic instability in some regions. McCrindle said that he decided to give Gen Alpha and Gen Beta their names because moving to the Greek alphabet signified a major shift in the generations, in terms of the world they will grow up in and specifically the technological shifts that are yet to come. He noted that the generation to come in 2025 and later will not only be the first to live in an AI-immersed world, but they will also be raised by a generation where technology is also used as a parenting tool. Likely to be raised by Millennials or members of Gen Z, Gen Beta will likely highly value \"adaptability, equality, and eco-consciousness,\" as those are popular values for their parents. These ideals may influence how Gen Beta votes and makes political decisions in the future, as Jason Dorsey, a generational researcher and author, told NBC News: \"We will likely have Gen Z as elected officials when Gen Beta is old enough to vote. Climate change will continue to be a really big deal for them.\" To see Generation Beta's place amongst other sociological groups, here's a breakdown of historical generational cohorts: Generations, not set as a rule to span a specific period of time, are often heavily influenced by sociopolitical and economic shifts as well as historical events, but they typically span from approximately 15 to 20 years. However, definitions differ, and some maintain that generations last 20 to 30 years, according to the American Association of Marketing. In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, McCrindle wrote: \"Move over, Gen Alpha: 2025 marks the start of the Gen Beta era,\" sharing a link to an NBC News article. David Statter, the founder of VirtuIRL, a product, game, and brand development studio, wrote: \"Today marks the end of the Gen Alpha cohort and the start of Generation Beta—welcome to the world, little Betas! Fitting name, though, since they'll be the first AI-native humans, paving the way for v2.0 of humanity. Cyborgs, assemble.\" Depending on what happens globally socially, politically, economically, and in terms of the climate, Gen Beta's upbringing, comprised of access to advanced technology on a regular basis, could inform the policy decisions they decide to enact when trying to solve these issues worldwide.

                "content": "With the arrival of the new year, a new generation is officially on the horizon: Gen Beta. Defined as individuals born between 2025 and 2039, most members of this generation are expected to live well into the 22nd century, according to social researcher and futurist Mark McCrindle. Gen Beta kicks off in 2025: Your guide to all the generation names and years Gen Beta also includes the children of younger Gen Ys (millennials) and older Gen Zs, and they will make up 16% of the global population by 2035, McCrindle said. The futurist also anticipated that Gen Beta will be a generation characterized by significant technological integration and a strong appreciation for diversity. Read below to learn more about this newest cohort. Gen Beta takes its name from the Greek alphabet, following Gen Alpha, which marked the beginning of a new naming convention. According to McCrindle, the naming reflects the distinct way these generations are being shaped by an increasingly tech-integrated world. According to McCrindle, the digital and physical worlds will seamlessly blend for Generation Beta. While Gen Alpha witnessed the rise of smart technology and artificial intelligence, Gen Beta will grow up in a world where these innovations are fully integrated into daily life. From education and careers to health care and entertainment, AI and automation will play a central role, personalizing everything from learning and shopping to social interactions in ways that are just starting to take shape. McCrindle predicted that Gen Beta will find a balance between staying connected and expressing themselves. Growing up in a world of constant connectivity, they'll build friendships, learn and work in a space where digital interaction is the norm. According to McCrindle, helping Gen Beta build safe and thoughtful digital identities, with guidance from their parents, will be essential. Just as important is encouraging them to develop a strong sense of individuality both online and in real life. As society increasingly embraces themes of change and acceptance, Gen Beta is also expected to grow up in an environment that fosters curiosity and inclusivity. Gen Beta will grow up in a world dealing with climate change and other big challenges, according to McCrindle. With millennial and Gen Z parents who care about sustainability, they'll be more focused on global issues and finding innovative ways to tackle them. In fact, according to Pew Research Center, 71% of millennials and 67% of Gen Zs think climate change should be a top priority for the future. Gen Beta will witness major demographic shifts, such as declining birth rates and longer life expectancies. As McCrindle pointed out, by the time Gen Beta comes of age, the focus will shift from overpopulation to population sustainability. Following the trend, the next generation after Gen Beta is likely to be Generation Gamma, born between 2040 and 2054. As we navigate these changing generations, McCrindle emphasized the importance of understanding their needs, values and preferences to anticipate how they will shape society's future. © 2025 ABC News",

                "title": "Rose Parade - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Rose Parade, also known as the Tournament of Roses Parade (or simply the Tournament of Roses), is an annual parade held mostly along Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California, United States, on New Year's Day (or on Monday, January 2 if New Year's Day falls on a Sunday). Produced by the non-profit Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association, the parade usually starts at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time (UTC–8), and includes flower-covered floats, marching bands, and equestrian units. The parade is followed in the afternoon by the Rose Bowl, one of the major bowl games in college football. It has been uninterrupted except during World War II in 1942, 1943, and 1945, and in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[1] First held on January 1, 1890, the Rose Parade is watched by hundreds of thousands of spectators.[2][3] The Rose Bowl college football game was added in 1902 to help fund the cost of staging the parade.[4] Since 2011, Honda has been a presenting sponsor of the Rose Parade.[5] Accordingly, the company has the parade's first float, which like all floats, follows the parade's theme. Members of Pasadena's Valley Hunt Club first staged the parade in 1890. Since then the parade has been held in Pasadena every New Year's Day, except when January 1 falls on a Sunday. In that case, it is held on the subsequent Monday, January 2. This exception was instituted in 1893, as organizers did not wish to disturb horses hitched outside Sunday church services.[6] Many of the members of the Valley Hunt Club were former residents of the American East and Midwest. They wished to showcase their new California home's mild winter weather. At a club meeting, Professor Charles F. Holder announced, \"In New York, people are buried in the snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let's hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise.\" So the club organized horse-drawn carriages covered in flowers, followed by foot races, polo matches, and a game of tug-of-war on the town lot that attracted a crowd of 2,000 to the event. Upon seeing the scores of flowers on display, the professor decided to suggest the name \"Tournament of Roses.\" Over the next few founding years, the parade added marching bands and motorized floats. By 1895, the event was too large for the Valley Hunt Club to handle, resulting in the formation of an ad hoc non-profit organization – the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association. By the 11th annual tournament (1900), the town lot on which the activities were held was renamed Tournament Park, a large open area directly adjacent to Pasadena's world-famous institution of higher learning, Caltech. Activities soon included ostrich races, bronco busting demonstrations, and an odd novelty race between a camel and an elephant. (The elephant won the race.) Soon reviewing stands were built along the parade route and newspapers in Eastern Seaboard cities started to take notice of the event. The stately Italian Renaissance-style mansion of William Wrigley Jr. (the maker of Wrigley's chewing gum) was offered to the city of Pasadena after Mrs. Wrigley's death in 1958, under the condition that their home would be the Rose Parade's permanent headquarters. Tournament House is the name given to the former home where the organization is headquartered.[7] The first associated football game was played on January 1, 1902. Originally titled the \"Tournament East-West football game,\" it is considered to be the first Rose Bowl. The next game was not played until New Year's Day 1916; they have been played annually since then. The game derives its modern name from Rose Bowl Stadium, which was built for the 1923 game. In 2002 and 2006 (when the Rose Bowl Game was the BCS National Championship Game), the \"Granddaddy of 'em all\" was not held the same day as the parade; the 2002 game was played on January 3, the 2006 game was played on January 4. Not all fans were pleased with the change; some thought the atmosphere and tradition of the Rose Bowl was lost. Once the BCS title game was separated from the host bowl, it no longer affected the date of the Rose Bowl Game (even when the title game returned to Pasadena in 2010 and 2014). Traditionally, a flyover signals the start of the parade. Since 2019, the parade concludes with a special guest doing the ceremonial pass from the parade to the Rose Bowl. On July 15, 2020, it was announced that the Rose Parade for 2021 would be canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it was assessed under current conditions that the construction of floats for the parade could not be performed in a safe manner, while the event itself (due to large crowds and outside visitors) was also considered to be at a high risk of causing more instances of COVID-19 infections.[8] The parade was deferred to 2022. However, the parade number was still changed; what would have been called the 132nd parade officially became the 133rd parade. On November 13, 2020, it was announced that a TV special titled The Rose Parade's New Year's Celebration would take the parade's place and premiere on January 1, 2021.[9] The Tournament of Roses Parade has followed the same route mainly following Colorado Boulevard (Pasadena's main thoroughfare and a segment of the former US 66) for many decades.[quantify] The day before the parade, the entire environs of the neighborhood streets south of the intersection of Orange Grove Boulevard and Colorado Boulevard are sealed off and reserved for the marshaling of the dozens of floats, bands, equestrian units, and other elements. This sealed-off section acts as the \"Formation Area\", and the Formation Area Committee manages it. On parade morning the various elements are merged and dispatched in front of Tournament House. The parade starts heading north on South Orange Grove Boulevard beginning at Green Street. At Colorado Boulevard it passes the main grandstands (and the main television and media stands) and proceeds east on Colorado Boulevard. The parade then turns north on Sierra Madre Boulevard.[10] The floats then must travel under the Sierra Madre Boulevard/I-210 freeway overpass, requiring over-height floats to reduce their height. The parade ends at Paloma Street near Victory Park and Pasadena High School. Floats continue into the Post-Parade viewing area (which is open that afternoon and the following day). In total this route is 5.5 miles (8.9 km) long; the assembled bands, horse units, and floats take approximately two hours to pass by. The 2009 parade featured 46 floats, including some new entries, such as Jack in the Box's Jack-O-Licious, City of Mission Viejo's Making a Splash, RFD-TV's Hee Haw, and the City of Roseville's Entertaining Dreams for a Century. The 2010 parade saluted the men and women serving America throughout the world with a flyover at the beginning of the parade by four F/A-18 jets (performed by pilots of Strike Fighter Squadron 22, the \"Fighting Redcocks\") from the Naval Air Station at Lemoore, California). New floats that joined the 2011 Rose Parade were: Beverly Hills Tournament of Roses Committee, Cunard Line, Dole, Los Angeles County Firemen's Benefit & Welfare: Never Forget 9/11 \"Remember, Reflect, Renew\", UNO 40th Anniversary, \"Messina Wildlife Management\", Namco Bandai Games, \"Quikrete\" Cement & Concrete Products, \"Saving America's Mustangs Foundation\", and Shriner's Hospitals For Children. The 2012 Rose Parade had 43 floats, 21 bands, and 18 equestrian units with approximately 400 horses. The honor for being the last units in the parade went to All American Cowgirl Chicks (Equestrian), Needham Broughton High School (Band), and RFD-TV (Float). It also featured the first-ever Swedish entry, the Royal Swedish Navy Cadet Band. The 2013 parade featured 42 floats, 23 marching bands, and 21 equestrian units. New for the 2013 Rose Parade were floats from Nurses' float \"A Healing Place\", Delta Sigma Theta, and the city of San Gabriel centennial float \"Celebrating Our Journey\". It began with the Wells Fargo/Opening Unit, American Honda's float, the United States Marine Corps's Mounted Color Guard and the U.S. Marine Corps West Coast Composite Band. Farmers Insurance's \"Love Float\" featured the wedding of a Virginia couple, Nicole and Gerald of Chesapeake, VA. The couple was selected through a first-ever public vote by the American people. The parade's closing unit featured Coco Jones of the Disney Channel. Featured in the 2014 parade were 45 floats, including new floats from eHarmony, K9s4COPS, Public Storage (\"Adventures In Space\")[11] and SeaWorld. Actor, director, writer, producer Garry Marshall played the role of \"director\" on Burbank's \"Lights...camera...action!\" float. KC and the Sunshine Band were featured on Stella Rosa Wine's \"Stellabrate Good Times\" float. Performing on the e-Harmony float was Natalie Cole, singing \"This Will Be\". NBC's The Voice joined this parade too, along with Daryl Hall and the Harlem Globetrotters. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation float (\"Living the Dream: Love Is the Best Protection\") featured a wedding of a California couple, Aubrey Loots and Danny Leclair; some people called for a boycott of the parade as the couple are actually both men.[12] Nancy O'Dell, along with Jonathan and Drew Scott (of the Property Brothers) co-hosted the parade.[13] The 2015 parade had 41 floats. New participants were ABC's The Bachelor, American Armenian Rose Float Association, Kiehl's Since 1851, Northwestern Mutual, United Sikh Mission, and Zappos.com. The 2016 parade featured 44 floats, 19 equestrian units, and 20 marching bands. New participants were Los Angeles Lakers, City of Irvine Chamber of Commerce, South Dakota Tourism, the California Milk Advisory Board, PBS (featuring Downton Abbey), and Union Bank. It marked the end of Bob Eubanks and Stephanie Edwards's participation in the parade for local television station KTLA. Singpoli Group's float \"Marco Polo East Meets West\", constructed by float builder Paradiso was judged as the sweepstakes winner, the \"Most beautiful entry in the Parade with outstanding floral presentation and design.\"[14] The 2020 Rose Parade featured 40 floats, 17 equestrian units with over 450 horses, and 20 marching bands. The Co-Grand Marshals of the parade were gymnast Laurie Hernández, actress and singer Rita Moreno, and actress Gina Torres.[15] The 2022 parade featured 43 floats, 18 equestrian units, and 20 marching bands in addition to the special units. The grand marshal was actor LeVar Burton. The 2023 parade's grand marshal was politician Gabby Giffords.[16] The 2024 parade's grand marshal was actor and singer Audra McDonald. The 2025 parade featured 37 floats, 16 equestrian units, and 24 marching bands in addition to multiple special units. The 2025 parade's grand marshal was sports icon and equality champion Billie Jean King in conjunction with the Women's Sports Foundation, who celebrate 50 years of changing the game. Originally the parade featured flower-decorated horse carriages. Over time, floats built by volunteers from sponsoring communities supplanted the carriages. Currently, most are built by professional float building companies and take nearly a year to construct. Some communities and organizational sponsors still rely on volunteers. The Valley Hunt Club still enters a flower-decorated carriage. The Cal Poly Universities Rose Float still relies solely on students who volunteer, with the present day requirement that \"every inch of every float must be covered with flowers or other natural materials, such as leaves, seeds or bark\".[17] Floats are self-propelled on (generally used-up) truck chassis[citation needed] in contrast to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade which uses trailer-based floats pulled by new, intact (sponsor-provided) trucks. Typically 48 to 72 hours before parade day, one can view several of the floats being decorated with flowery mantles in the various 'float barns' that dot the Arroyo Seco / Rose Bowl area in West Pasadena, not far from the start of the parade. It is a rule of the parade that all surfaces of the float framework must be covered in natural materials (such as flowers, plants, seaweeds, seeds, bark, vegetables, or nuts, for example); furthermore, no artificial flowers or plant material are allowed, nor can the materials be artificially colored. Last-minute volunteer opportunities are usually available. There are 6 \"Self-Built\" Floats: Cal Poly Universities, City of Burbank, City of Downey, City of La Canada Flintridge, City of Sierra Madre, and City of South Pasadena. Additionally, there have been a variety of commercial float builders, who, as of 2025, include Artistic Entertainment Services (AES) and Phoenix Decorating Company. Previous professional builders include Fiesta Parade Floats (1988-2024), Paradiso Parade Floats (2012-2018), and Charisma Floats & Designs (1987-2011). Anaheim city's float at the 2008 Rose Parade included the Stanley Cup that the NHL's Anaheim Ducks had won in 2007, hoisted by player Brad May. (As the regulations state that the outside of the float must exclusively use organic material, ABC commentators speculated that the city got an exception to display the Cup.)[18] Also, the Los Angeles Dodgers had a float in celebration of the franchise's 50th anniversary in Los Angeles, with Hall of Fame sportscasters Vin Scully and Jaime Jarrin as well as former players Steve Garvey, Fernando Valenzuela, Eric Karros, and Nomar Garciaparra. The 2010 parade floats included the Boy Scouts of America's 100th Anniversary float, the Consulate General of Mexico in Los Angeles in celebration of Mexico's bicentennial of independence, and \"Safety Harbor Kids\". The 2010 parade also featured a 113-foot-long (34 m) float from Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance Pet Foods, which set a Guinness world record for the longest single-chassis float. The City of West Covina paid tribute to the \"service and commitment of the Tuskegee Airmen\" with a float entitled \"Tuskegee Airmen – A Cut Above\", which featured a large bald eagle, two replica World War II \"Redtails\" fighter planes, and historical images of some of the airmen who served our country. The float won the Mayor's trophy as the most outstanding city entry – national or international, also Anaheim float featured the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game that was played at Angel Stadium of Anaheim, four former MLB All-Stars, pitchers Mark Langston, Chuck Finley, and Troy Percival, along with second baseman Bobby Grich were aboard. Since January 1, 2012, fell on a Sunday, tradition dictated that the parade would be held on Monday, January 2, 2012. The 2012 Rose Parade had 43 floats, featuring the Honda float featuring Grammy Award-winning musician Kenny G aboard, the LMU Centennial Celebration float,[19] and the Girl Scouts of the USA 100th Anniversary float (entitled \"What Will You Do Today?\"). Float builder Fiesta Floats donated their services to the design of the Girl Scouts float, which was decorated by the organization's volunteers (of all ages).[20] Paramount Pictures also participated in the 2012 parade with its centennial celebration float \"100 Years of Movie Magic\". Namco Bandai Games joined the parade for the first time, commemorating the Power Rangers. Others were Microsoft Kinect (\"You are the Controller\") and the Kit-Cat Klock (\"Timeless Fun for Everyone\").[21] The floats compete for one of 24 awards selected by three judges each year. Since Honda became the title sponsor, its floats are not eligible to compete for an award. After the parade, the floats are parked at the end of the parade route on Sierra Madre Boulevard and Washington Boulevard, near Victory Park and are on display for a day and a half (two-and-a-half days when January 1 falls on Friday) after the parade. None of the float riders or dignitaries/celebrities involved in the parade are present, and animated features on some floats are not activated. Admission to the viewing area is $13 and children are admitted free. The 2018 Rose Parade was the last parade for the city of Los Angeles after 122 consecutive years sponsoring floats for the Rose Parade. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti was aboard the float titled \"Everyone is Welcome\". Prior to the parade an \"Equestfest\" is held at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center to showcase the performances by the talented riding teams. Equestrian units taking part in \"Equestfest\" have included the Clydesdales of the U.S. Army's First Cavalry Division from Fort Hood, \"Traveler\" (the USC mascot), the Sons and Daughters of the Reel West, and the California State Fire Fighters Association. Bob Eubanks and Shawn Parr have served as announcers at \"Equestfest.\" Montie Montana was a perennial participant until his death in 1998. TV viewers know him from more than 60 appearances, waving to the crowd from his silver saddle.[22] 2010: 23 units – All American Cowgirl Chicks, Amigos de Anza Equestrian Drill Team, Arizona Mini Mystique Driving Drill Team, Benny Martinez Family, Calizona Appaloosa Horse Club, Cowgirls Historical Foundation, Giddy Up Gals, L.A.

Many of the nation's top high school marching bands, along with college and organizational marching bands participate. The bands participating in the parade have developed traditions throughout its history. For example, Pasadena City College's Tournament of Roses Honor Band always marches in the Rose Parade, along with the Los Angeles Unified School District All City Honor Band, all of whom are selected by audition the previous autumn. Positions in both bands are coveted, and those selected are among the best student musicians in California. The Tournament of Roses Honor Band's Herald Trumpets unit marches and plays directly before the Rose Queen's float. Nine trumpet players and one snare drummer are selected from those who audition for the band for the unit. University marching bands from the two schools competing in the Rose Bowl Game are invited to march in the parade. They typically accompany the float that represents the school and conference. . Bands that have a long-standing arrangement to be in the parade include:[23] In 1891, the Monrovia Town Band was the first musical group to perform in the Rose Parade. In 1998, the Washington Township High School Minutemen Marching Band from Sewell, New Jersey became the first band in the history of the Rose Parade to decorate its entire ranks with live flowers, in keeping with the practice of decorating the parade floats. From the neighboring town of Arcadia, the Arcadia High School Apache Marching Band and Colorguard has appeared for 15 years, returning about every four years. The Allen Eagle Escadrille from Allen, Texas had a record breaking 780 members in the 2016 Rose Parade. In addition to the parade, the bands participate in a two-day, three-show Bandfest at Pasadena City College's Jackie and Mack Robinson Stadium, usually on December 29 and 30 (December 30 and 31 when the parade is on January 2). Number of the bands also perform at other Southern California venues. Shortly after the parade in January, the newly elected President of the Tournament of Roses has the duty of picking a theme for the forthcoming festivities. Most of the floral floats in the parade are inspired by this theme.[26] On January 19, 2023, Pasadena attorney Alex Aghajanian was confirmed as President of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association for 2023–2024. He announced that the theme for the 135th Rose Parade and the 110th Rose Bowl game would be \"Celebrating a World of Music: The Universal Language\". The Tournament of Roses President will lead the 14-member Executive Committee and the organization of 935 volunteer members for the upcoming year.[27] The Grand Marshal of the parade is an honorary position selected by the president of the Tournament. Many are picked for a relationship to the theme that is also picked by the president. Traditionally, the Grand Marshal of the parade also participates in the Coin Toss during the Rose Bowl. The 2022 Grand Marshal was actor LeVar Burton.[33] As there was no parade in 2021, there was no Grand Marshal that year. The 2020 Co-Grand Marshals were Rita Moreno (from Electric Company), Gina Torres and Laurie Hernández. The 2019 Grand Marshal was singer Chaka Khan. The 2018 Grand Marshal was Oscar nominee and distinguished humanitarian Gary Sinise. For the 2017 parade, Greg Louganis, Janet Evans and Allyson Felix served as marshals. Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns was selected as the 2016 Grand Marshal. The 2015 parade Grand Marshal was to be Louis Zamperini.[34][35] After his death on July 2, 2014, the Tournament announced that it was \"committed to honoring him as the Grand Marshal of the 2015 Rose Parade.\"[36] During the parade, USC mascot Traveler walked in his place, riderless to honor Zamperini.[37] Vin Scully was chosen as the Grand Marshal of the 2014 parade and Rose Bowl Game. Previously, President Sally Bixby named Jane Goodall as the Grand Marshal for the 2013 parade, succeeding J. R. Martinez, the 2012 grand marshal.[38] Food Network star Paula Deen was the Grand Marshal of the 2011 parade.[39] Captain Chesley Sullenberger was the 2010 Grand Marshal and actress Cloris Leachman served as the 2009 Grand Marshal, the 10th female grand marshal in the history of the parade. Mary Pickford was the first female Grand Marshal. Other Hollywood celebrities who appeared as Grand Marshal are Leo Carrillo, Harold Lloyd, Walt Disney, John Wayne, George Lucas, and Bob Hope. Repeat Marshals of the Tournament of Roses Parade Each September, some 1,000 young women (and a few young men) between the ages of 17 and 25 interview to serve as a member of the Tournament of Roses Rose Court. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses administers a selection process to determine which greater Pasadena-area young women will have the honor of being crowned Queen of the Tournament of Roses, or more commonly known as \"Rose Queen.\" In addition to one Rose Queen, six Rose Princesses will also be selected to make up the Rose Court. The Rose Court will then ride on a specially-designed float in the Rose Parade and will also preside over the Rose Bowl Game. The Rose Court will also attend over one hundred events in the Southern California area as ambassadors of the Tournament of Roses. Residency for the Rose Queen and Court hopefuls include the Pasadena City College district and starting with the 2025 Rose Parade and thereafter, the cities of Alhambra and San Gabriel and the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Eagle Rock, Highland Park, Monterey Hills and El Sereno, which are served by the Los Angeles Community College District. One Tree Hill and Chicago P.D. actress Sophia Bush was Rose Queen in 2000. 1997 Rose Princess Lisa Remillard is an anchor with San Diego's KUSI television station.[40] The 2015 Rose Queen was Madison Triplett (John Marshall Fundamental High School). Members of the Royal Court were Mackenzie Byers (Pasadena City College), Gabrielle Current (Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy), Veronica Mejia (Pasadena City College), Bergen Onufer (Mayfield Senior School), Simona Shao (Westridge School) and Emily Stoker (Temple City High School).[41] The 2016 Rose Queen was Erika Karen Winter (Flintridge Preparatory School). Members of the Royal Court were Natalie Breanne Hernandez-Barber (Alverno High School), Donaly Elizabeth Marquez (Blair International Baccalaureate School), Bryce Marie Bakewell (Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy), Rachelle Liu (San Marino High School), Regina Pullens (Maranatha High School), and Sarah Shaklan (La Canada High School).[42] The 2017 Rose Queen was Victoria \"Tori\" Castellanos (Temple City High School). Isabella Marez of La Salle High School was crowned as the 100th Tournament of Roses Queen on October 18, 2017. Other members of the 2018 Royal Court: Julianne Lauenstein (La Cañada High School); Sydney Pickering (Arcadia High School); Savannah Bradley (Pasadena High School); Georgia Cervenka (La Cañada High School); Lauren Buehner (Arcadia High School); Alexandra Artura (Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy). The 2019 Royal Court consisted of Louise Siskel, Rucha Kadam, Helen Rossi, Lauren Baydaline, Sherry Ma, Ashley Hackett, and Micaele McElrath. As there was no parade in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no Rose Queen crowned for that year. Before that, the last time that a Rose Queen was not crowned was 1929. The Royal Court for the 2022 Rose Parade was announced on October 4, 2021, by Dr. Robert Miller, the president of the Tournament of Roses Association. They are: Jeannine Briggs (John Marshall Fundamental High School), Nadia Chung (La Cañada High School), Ava Feldman (South Pasadena High School), Abigail Griffith (Pasadena High School), Swetha Somasundaram (Arcadia High School), McKenzie Street (Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy), and Jaeda Walden (La Cañada High School). The coronation of the new queen was held on October 26, 2021. Nadia Chung was named as the 2022 Rose Queen. The 2022 Rose Queen is required to have been vaccinated against COVID-19.[43] The 2023 Rose Court was announced on October 3 and consisted of: Salia Baligh, Uma Wittenberg, Adrian Crick, Sahanna Rajinikanthan, Bella Ballard, Zoe Denoncourt, Michelle Cortez-Peralta[44] The 2025 Rose Court consisted of: Rose Queen Lindsay Charles (Westridge School), Princess Simone Ball (Arcadia High School), Princess Saniyah Brunston (John Muir High School), Princes Lara Georgian (Mayfield Senior school), Princess Kate Kelly (La Canada High School), Princess Lisette Parker (Maranatha High School), and Princess Natalia Pradhan (Flintridge Preparatory School). More recent attendance figures are followed by the TV and predicted attendance in parentheses. Most estimates are conducted by the Tournament of Roses and the Pasadena Police Department. A number of studies were conducted by the Anderson School of Management at UCLA on attendance and economic impact to Southern California. The Los Angeles Times ran a study in 1980 that said the actual attendance at the parade was actually about 60% of what is claimed each year.[citation needed] The Rose Parade is televised on ABC, NBC, Univision (in Spanish), HGTV, Sky Link TV (in Mandarin and Cantonese), Hallmark Channel, RFD TV, and KTLA (the latter three offer interruption-free coverage, although KTLA continues to repeat the parade throughout the day with commercials, and starting 2020 it has been livestreamed on its YouTube page). WGN-TV in Chicago carried KTLA's uninterrupted coverage of the 2009 parade (WGN and KTLA have historically been sister stations via former owner Tribune Media; both are now owned by Nexstar Media Group). Until 2005, the parade was also broadcast on CBS, and KTTV also televised the parade from the station's sign-on in 1949 until 1995. ABC serves as the official broadcaster of the parade[citation needed], and its sister network ESPN currently airs the Rose Bowl (which formerly aired on ABC). Each year, the newly elected Tournament of Roses President is responsible for selecting the year's theme and grand marshal. Preparation and construction of the floral floats theoretically begins after the theme is announced. The selection of marching bands is already well under way except for Rose Bowl Game college bands. In 2005, Libby Evans Wright was elected as the first female president of the Association. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses appointed former Los Angeles Times executive P. Scott McKibben as its executive director in 2010, replacing John M. (Mitch) Dorger, who had served as CEO since 2000. On September 8, 2011, he resigned for personal reasons. Chief Operating Officer William B. Flinn was named interim executive director.[51] From March 1, 2012, to January 2, 2017, William B. Flinn took over the role of Executive Director. David Eads became the Executive Director in 2017. The Tournament of Roses has become such a large event that it requires 65,000 hours of combined manpower each year, or the equivalent of roughly 7.42 years of combined manpower. The group has 935 members, each of whom is assigned to one of 34 committees, and around 50 student ambassadors. Responsibilities include: During the Parade, many Tournament members are required to wear white suits with red ties, name tags, membership pins and official ribbons. Because of this, the volunteers are commonly referred to as \"White Suiters.\"[52] In December each year, a fleet of white vehicles with special \"ToR\" license plates are seen throughout the San Gabriel Valley. The use of these cars is currently donated by American Honda for use by high-ranking Tournament members. Each year, an honor troop of Eagle Scouts from the San Gabriel Valley Council, (now GLAAC), and \"The Tournament Troop\" of Girl Scout Gold Award recipients of the Arcadia Service Unit of the Girl Scouts Greater Los Angeles, is selected to carry the parade banners down the route. Each year, for the last 35 years, more than 100 scouts have participated. The Tournament of Roses Radio Amateurs (TORRA) provided audio communications and video co-ordination for the parade officials through the use of Amateur radio from 1968 until 2005. With over 300 ham radio operators in TORRA there were several ham radio sites along the parade route equipped with amateur television as well as 2-way ham radios. Several mobile units – including motorcycles and pedestrian units (creepie-peepies) provided the video coverage. With modern technology and cell phone service, TORRA was no longer needed. Thousands more volunteers help cover the floats in those beautiful flower and seed mixes during \"Deco week,\" Dec 26- parade day. Many of these come back year after year, some even camp nearby to help all week long. For the 2006 Tournament of Roses Parade on January 2 (it is always held on January 2 when January 1 falls on a Sunday) winds with gusts up to 45 mph (72 km/h) and five inches (130 mm) of rain in the Pasadena area were predicted. The forecast proved accurate, ruining the 51 year record of good weather for the parade. It rained continuously and heavily throughout the entire 2006 parade. The President of the Tournament, the Grand Marshal of the Parade and the executive committee,[citation needed] deliberated into the early morning at the Tournament House. With street rumors circulating of the parade being canceled or postponed and restlessness of the crowd further east along the parade route, the parade got underway despite the bleak weather.[53] Low television ratings and poor attendance plagued the ceremony. Some floats sustained water damage by the end of the parade. The 1893 parade was the first parade to fall on a Sunday. The parade organizers decided that the parade might spook the horses outside of the churches along the parade route and disrupt the services. The \"Never on Sunday\" rule was instituted and has been in place ever since: if January 1 falls on a Sunday, the parade is shifted to the 2nd.[54] There are conflicting reports on the number of times this has happened. Several articles say that 2017 (the latest occurrence) was the 15th time.[55][56] However, the correct answer seems to be that the 2023 parade was the 20th time this has happened with the years being 1893, 1899, 1905, 1911, 1922, 1928, 1933, 1939, 1950, 1956, 1961, 1967, 1978, 1984, 1989, 1995, 2006, 2012, 2017, and 2023.[57]",

                "content": "Thursday Night Football (often abbreviated as TNF) is the branding used for broadcasts of National Football League (NFL) games that broadcast primarily on Thursday nights. Most of the games kick off at 8:15 Eastern Time (8:20 prior to 2022 and 8:25 prior to 2018). In the past, games in the package[clarification needed] also aired occasionally on Saturdays in the later portion of the season, as well as select games from the NFL International Series (since 2017, these games have been branded as NFL Network Specials). Debuting on November 23, 2006, the telecasts were originally part of NFL Network's Run to the Playoffs package, which consisted of eight total games broadcast on Thursday and Saturday nights (five on Thursdays, and three on Saturdays, originally branded as Saturday Night Football) during the latter portion of the season. Since 2012, the TNF package has begun during the second week of the NFL season; the NFL Kickoff Game and the NFL on Thanksgiving are both broadcast as part of NBC Sports' Sunday Night Football contract and are not included in Thursday Night Football, although the Thanksgiving primetime game was previously part of the package from 2006 until 2011. In 2014, the NFL shifted the package to a new model to increase its prominence. The entire TNF package would be produced by a separate rightsholder, who would hold rights to simulcast a portion of the package on their respective network. CBS was the first rightsholder under this model, airing nine games on broadcast television, and producing the remainder of the package to air exclusively on NFL Network[clarification needed] to satisfy its carriage agreements. The package was also extended to Week 16 of the season, and included a new Saturday doubleheader split between CBS and NFL Network. On January 18, 2015, CBS and NFL Network extended the same arrangement for a second season. In 2016 and 2017, the NFL continued with a similar arrangement, but adding NBC as a second rightsholder alongside CBS, with each network airing five games on broadcast television each. In 2018, the rights shifted to Fox, through the 2022 season. In 2016, the NFL also began to sub-license digital streaming rights to the broadcast television portion of the package to third-parties, beginning with Twitter in 2016, and Amazon in 2017—initially on Prime Video, and later also being carried freely on Amazon-owned live streaming platform Twitch. In 2021, it was announced that Amazon had acquired the exclusive rights to Thursday Night Football beginning in the 2023 season under the NFL's new broadcasting deals, marking the first time that the NFL had sold one of its main television packages to a digital media company. NFL Network and Fox ceded the final season of the existing contract to Amazon, resulting in its coverage launching in 2022. As before, all of the games are also streamed for free on Twitch, and aired on local broadcast television stations in the markets of the opposing teams as per NFL rules. As with all other nationally televised games, they are also carried on radio as part of the NFL on Westwood One Sports package. The NFL Network's coverage was not the first time that NFL games were covered on Thursday or Saturday. ABC televised occasional Thursday night games from 1978 to 1986 as part of its Monday Night Football package. Prior to the new contract, ESPN carried a handful of sporadic Thursday night games (usually those displaced from Sunday night) and the broadcast networks used to air several national games on Saturday afternoons in mid-to-late December after the college football regular season ended. Incidentally, the only reason the league is even allowed to televise football games on Saturday night stems from a legal loophole: the league's antitrust exemption, the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, was written when the NFL regular season ended in mid-December, and as such, it contains specific language that prohibits televising NFL games in most markets on Friday nights and all day on Saturdays between the second week of September and the second week of December, to protect high school and college football. Since most high school and college seasons have ended by mid-December, other than bowl games, there has been little desire to close this loophole, even though the regular season has expanded well beyond mid-December since the law's passage. In 2005, when the NFL negotiated a new set of television contracts, Comcast-owned OLN offered to pay $450 million for an eight-year contract to carry NFL prime time games. In exchange, Comcast planned to add NFL Network to its digital cable lineup. The channel was added, but NFL Network decided to air the games itself, foregoing a rights fee.[1] The other television deals generated $3.735 billion per year over an eight-year period for CBS, Fox, NBC, ESPN and DirecTV (owner of the out-of-market sports package NFL Sunday Ticket).[citation needed] As previously mentioned, Thursday Night Football debuted on November 23, 2006, with the Kansas City Chiefs handing the visiting Denver Broncos a 19–10 Thanksgiving defeat. Each of the game broadcasts were titled either Thursday Night Football or Saturday Night Football, depending on the night on which it aired. This format carried over to the 2007 season. At its launch, the package proved highly controversial mainly due to the relative unavailability of NFL Network at the time; the league used the games as leverage to encourage television providers to carry NFL Network on their basic service tiers, rather than in premium, sports-oriented packages that required subscribers to pay a higher fee; although, as with all other national cable telecasts of NFL games, the league's own regulations require the games to be syndicated to over-the-air television stations in the local markets of the teams. These issues were magnified in 2007, when a game between the New England Patriots and New York Giants that saw the Patriots defeat the Giants to close out a perfect regular season was simulcast nationally on both CBS and NBC, in addition to NFL Network and the local stations that the game was sold to, following concerns from politicians and other critics. Starting in 2008, NFL Network eliminated all but one of the Saturday night games and started their Thursday night package three weeks earlier. This was done to accommodate the earlier schedule and the league's antitrust exemption that prohibits Saturday games from being held for most of the season. In the following season, all references to Saturday Night Football were dropped, and any games that are not played on Thursday (such as in 2016, two Christmas weekend games and an NFL International Series game) have since been branded as \"special editions\" of Thursday Night Football, and later Thursday Night Special or NFL Network Special. As part of new media contracts taking effect in the 2012 season, the Thanksgiving primetime game was moved from NFL Network to NBC's Sunday Night Football package.[2] During Super Bowl week in 2012, it was announced that the Thursday Night Football package would expand from eight to 13 games and air on NFL Network, again soliciting and rejecting offers from Turner Sports and Comcast.[citation needed] For the four seasons from 2012 to 2016, and again in 2020 and 2021 all 32 teams played a Thursday game following a Sunday game that guarantees each team a nationally televised game with 26 of them playing on Thursday Night Football and the other six playing on Thanksgiving.[3] In addition, matchups are created with the intent to minimize travel in the leadup to the Thursday game. In general, the road team will play a home game the Sunday prior, while the home team will either play at home or a road game against a nearby opponent the Sunday before hosting the Thursday game. However, there will be instances where the road team comes in having played a road game the Sunday prior in a nearby city that makes it possible for teams from far away to play each other on Thursday, as well as consolidate long road trips for the road team. For the 2012 season, a Spanish-language broadcast was added as second audio program. In January 2014, it was reported that the NFL was planning to sub-license a package of up to eight Thursday Night Football games to another broadcaster for the 2014 season. The NFL had negotiated with its existing broadcast partners, along with Turner Sports. These eight games were to be simulcast by NFL Network, and reports indicated that ESPN planned to place the games on ABC in the event it won the rights, bringing the NFL back to ABC for the first time since Super Bowl XL and the move of Monday Night Football to ESPN in 2006.[4][5][6][7] The remaining games would remain exclusive to NFL Network, in order to satisfy carriage agreements with television providers guaranteeing a minimum number of games to air exclusively on the channel.[8] The decision came as the league wished to heighten the profile of its Thursday night games, which had suffered from relatively lower viewership and advertising revenue in comparison to other games.[9] On February 5, 2014, the NFL announced that CBS had acquired the partial rights to TNF for the 2014 season. Under the agreement, all of the Thursday Night Football telecasts would be produced by CBS Sports and called by CBS's primary announcing team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms. The first eight games of the season were simulcast nationally on NFL Network and CBS; the remaining games in the package only aired nationally on NFL Network, but per league broadcast policies, were simulcast on local stations in the participating teams' markets. CBS affiliates were given right of first refusal to air the local simulcast before it is offered to another station (as had occurred in Cincinnati, Ohio where the market's NBC affiliate WLWT aired a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Cleveland Browns instead of CBS affiliate WKRC-TV). A Saturday doubleheader was also added on Week 16: NFL Network aired the early game, while CBS aired the second, prime time game.[10][11][12][13][14] The NFL considered CBS's bid to be the most attractive, owing to CBS's overall ratings stature (CBS had been the highest-rated broadcast network in the United States since the 2005-06 television season), a commitment to aggressively promote the Thursday games across its properties, and its plans to utilize CBS Sports' top NFL talent and production staff across all of the games in the package to ensure a major improvement in quality over the previous, in-house productions.[9] CBS staff also cited experience with its joint coverage of the NCAA Men's basketball tournament with Turner Sports as an advantage in its collaboration with NFL Network staff, as talent from both networks collaborate on pre-game, halftime and post-game coverage. During the games, a distinct graphics package co-branded with both CBS and NFL Network logos was used, certain players on each team wore microphones, and 4K cameras were used to allow zoom-in shots during instant replays.[13][15] With the move of selected games to CBS, media executives expected more major match-ups to appear on Thursday Night Football than in previous years in order to attract better viewership; in the past, Thursday Night Football had been criticized for often featuring games between lesser and poorer-performing teams.[16][17] CBS and the NFL unveiled the games scheduled for Thursday Night Football in April 2014; CBS's slate of games featured a number of major divisional rivalries, including New York Giants–Washington, Green Bay–Minnesota, and its opening game on September 11, 2014, featuring the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens.[12][18] In the wake of the controversy surrounding Ravens player Ray Rice (who had been removed from the team and suspended from the NFL earlier in the week following the discovery of footage showing the player physically assaulting his wife, Janay, who was engaged to Rice at the time the security camera footage was recorded), changes were made to pre-game coverage on the first game in order to accommodate additional interviews and discussion related to the incident. Among these changes were the removal of an introductory segment featuring Rihanna (who was similarly assaulted by fellow performer Chris Brown in 2009) performing her song \"Run This Town\".[19][20] Following complaints by Rihanna on Twitter regarding the removal, the song was pulled entirely from future broadcasts.[21] The rights were negotiated under a one-year contract valued at $275 million; on January 18, 2015, the NFL announced that it would renew the arrangement with CBS for the 2015 season, with its value increasing to around $300 million.[22][9][23] In November 2015, The Hollywood Reporter reported that in response to the success of the package under CBS, the NFL was planning to negotiate a long-term contract for TNF, with CBS, Fox, NBC, and Turner Sports showing interest.[23] The New York Post reported that this deal would also include the sale of a stake in NFL Network itself.[8] On December 16, 2015, it was reported that the NFL was shopping the TNF package as a one-year deal with an option for a second year, similarly to the current arrangement with CBS; the league also requested that bidders outline goals for \"growing\" NFL Network. The league was also reportedly interested in selling non-exclusive digital rights to simulcast the games to another partner, such as Amazon.com, Apple Inc., Google, or Yahoo! (which exclusively streamed an International Series as part of a trial during the 2015 season, but would shut down its original video content service in January 2016).[24] In January 2016, it was reported that the NFL was considering splitting the TNF package across multiple broadcasters in tandem with the possibility of expanding the overall package to 17 games. It was also reported that ESPN and Turner Sports were not interested in the package due to its short-term nature, and that Fox was attempting to outbid CBS.[25][26] On February 1, 2016, the NFL announced that TNF would be shared between CBS, NBC, and NFL Network for the 2016 and 2017 seasons. CBS and NBC would each air five games (resulting in a schedule of ten games on broadcast television in comparison to eight under the previous deal), followed by an additional eight games exclusively on NFL Network to satisfy NFL Network's retransmission consent contracts with cable providers; the eight NFL Network-exclusive games included six Thursday contests, a Sunday morning International Series contest, and a Christmas Day game. As with the previous contract, all games will be simulcast by NFL Network. Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the league was \"thrilled to add NBC to the TNF mix, a trusted partner with a proven track record of success broadcasting NFL football in primetime, and look forward to expanding with a digital partner for what will be a unique tri-cast on broadcast, cable and digital platforms.\"[27][28] On April 5, 2016, it was revealed that Twitter had acquired non-exclusive worldwide digital streaming rights to the ten broadcast television TNF games. The collaboration will also include streaming content on Twitter's Periscope service, such as behind the scenes access.[29] This also gave NBC a rare distinction of holding two primetime NFL packages, with them already holding Sunday Night games. Rogers Media, who owns television rights to the TNF package in Canada through the end of the 2016 season but has not yet acquired digital rights (the majority of the NFL's media rights in Canada are owned by Rogers's rival, Bell Media), successfully forced Twitter to block the game streams in that country, overriding the league's insistence that the free stream be global.[30][31] Due to the streaming deal, over-the-top television providers PlayStation Vue and Sling TV are also required to black out the simulcast of the games on NFL Network.[32] The first game produced by NBC Sports was broadcast exclusively on NFL Network on November 3, 2016, while the first game simulcast nationally on NBC aired on November 17. A cappella group Pentatonix recorded a reworked version of their song \"Sing\" (\"Weekend Go\") to serve as the opening theme song for NBC's TNF telecasts;[33][34] NBC also commissioned new instrumental theme music by Jimmy Greco, \"Can't Hold Us Down\", which was performed by members of the orchestra from the Broadway musical Hamilton.[35] Both were retained for NBC's games in 2017. On April 4, 2017, it was announced that Amazon.com had acquired non-exclusive streaming rights to the ten broadcast television games for the 2017 season over their Amazon Prime Video service, under a deal valued at $50 million, a five-fold increase over the $10 million paid by Twitter. The streams were exclusive to paid Prime subscribers.[36] The deal includes $30 million worth of promotion.[37] Amazon planned several special features for its inaugural game, including broadcasting alternate feeds with Spanish, Portuguese, and a secondary English broadcast featuring soccer commentators Ross Dyer and Tommy Smyth (intended for international viewers unfamiliar with the rules and terminology of American football), and a pre-show hosted by Tiki Barber and Curtis Stone that featured presentations of NFL merchandise available for purchase on Amazon.[38][39][40][41] The November 16, 2017 telecast between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tennessee Titans was the first NFL broadcast to intentionally use the Skycam as its primary camera angle, as opposed to the usual sideline camera that has been used since telecasts of NFL games began in 1939. NBC Sports had previously switched to a skycam-only presentation for portions of two Sunday night games earlier that season because of fog and smoke (and, sixteen years prior, during its coverage of the XFL); positive reaction to the impromptu change prompted NBC to experiment with using the strategy for the full game.[42] The Skycam Angle was also used for the December 14 telecast between the Denver Broncos and the Indianapolis Colts. In early January 2018, Bloomberg reported that ABC/ESPN and Fox Sports had both made bids for the next TNF package. Both Fox and Fox Sports 1 were named as potential outlets for the package in the Fox Sports bid, which was intended to showcase Fox's continued commitment to sports after the sale of its entertainment businesses to ESPN's majority-owner The Walt Disney Company (which excluded the Fox network itself and Fox Sports' national operations, such as FS1, among other assets). CBS and NBC were also considering renewing their existing contracts, but had requested a lower rights fee to compensate for the decreasing viewership of the NFL (TNF had been cited as one factor in the downturn, due to a perceived oversaturation of nationally televised games). It was also reported that the NFL would also allow digital companies to make bids for exclusive rights to the TNF package which forego a television partner entirely, unlike the previous non-exclusive deals with Twitter and Amazon.[43] On January 30, 2018, it was reported by multiple sources that Fox had won the package.[44][45] The next day, the NFL officially announced that Fox had acquired the broadcast television rights to the TNF package under a five-year deal lasting from 2018 through 2022 (which is aligned with the conclusion of the NFL's other television deals). Fox would air eleven games per season in simulcast with NFL Network, and Fox Sports would produce all games within the package. ESPN reported that Fox would be paying around $60 million per game—an increase over the estimated $45 million per game paid by CBS and NBC under the previous contract, totaling an estimated $660 million per season.[46][47] The Fox deal was terminated a season early in 2021.[48] Amazon renewed its digital rights for the 2018 and 2019 seasons; in contrast to 2017 in which the games required an Amazon Prime subscription, for 2018 and 2019, Amazon also carries game coverage for free on its live streaming platform Twitch.[49] Alongside the main Fox feed, British English, and Spanish options, the Amazon Prime streams offer an alternate commentary feed featuring ESPN anchor Hannah Storm and NFL Network chief correspondent Andrea Kremer—the first all-female commentary team in NFL history.[50] The Twitch streams offer access to the service's standard chat room (along with special football-themed emotes), an interactive extension, and co-streams featuring prominent personalities, while streams on Amazon Fire devices offer integration with the X-Ray feature to access statistics and other content.[51] Fox employed 45 cameras, a dual-skycam setup, triple-lens pylon cameras, and Intel True View replay systems where available. Fox NFL Thursday originated from Fox News Channel's Studio F in New York City, as well as an outdoor plaza setup on Sixth Avenue (Fox Square) with a scaled football field and an audience.[52][53] A new graphics package was produced by Drive Studio, inspired by Times Square to reflect its New York City-based studio programming; unlike CBS and NBC, Fox utilized the same in-game presentation it uses for all other NFL games broadcast by the network.[54] For 2019, Fox announced that it would produce all of its games in 1080p upscaled to 4K, with hybrid log–gamma (HLG) high-dynamic-range color, beginning with its season premiere September 26, 2019. The telecasts were distributed via the Fox Sports app, Prime Video, and to participating television providers. HDR was only supported through television providers, but Fox stated that HDR and surround sound support would be enabled via streaming \"soon\".[55] Due a carriage dispute between Dish Network and Fox resulting in the removal of its owned-and-operated stations and cable networks, it was reported that Fox had pushed NFL Network to black out its simulcast of the October 3, 2019 game between the Los Angeles Rams and the Seattle Seahawks for Dish Network subscribers to prevent circumvention. However, due to a clause in Dish's carriage agreement that forbade the channel from performing provider-specific programming substitutions, NFL Network agreed to forego the simulcast entirely, and the game was made exclusive to Fox (making it the first TNF game to not air in some capacity on NFL Network).[56][57] Fox and Dish agreed to a multi-year carriage agreement on October 6, 2019.[58] On April 29, 2020, Amazon renewed its digital rights through the 2022 season, maintaining the TNF simulcasts and digital content, and also adding exclusive international rights to one late-season game per-season outside of the package (which will be produced by CBS).[59] For its simulcasts, Amazon replaced the British feed with a new \"Scout's Feed\" with extended analysis by Bucky Brooks and Daniel Jeremiah (akin to the ESPN \"film room\" broadcasts of college football games), and \"NFL Next Live\" on Twitch (with viewer interactivity).[60] On October 19, because of a COVID-19 outbreak involving the Tennessee Titans, the originally scheduled Thursday Night game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills, was moved to the following Monday due to the Titans playing the Bills the previous Tuesday. The Chiefs won 26–17. In a similar move, the Baltimore Ravens had their scheduled Week 13 TNF game against the Dallas Cowboys postponed to the following Tuesday. The Ravens had dealt with their own outbreak, which included positive tests from players including reigning MVP Lamar Jackson. For that reason, the Ravens had to postpone their Thanksgiving game against the Pittsburgh Steelers three times, the first time was originally postponed to the Sunday after Thanksgiving in the afternoon, then postponed a second time to the following Tuesday night, then postponed again to the following Wednesday in the afternoon. The postponements forced the Steelers' Week 13 game against the Washington Football Team to be moved from Sunday, December 6, to Monday, December 7, and as mentioned, the Cowboys-Ravens game a day later, with both games remaining on NFL Network, Fox, and Prime Video.[citation needed] In March 2021, Amazon acquired exclusive rights to TNF as part of the next round of NFL broadcasting agreements from 2023 through 2033. NFL Network, Fox, and Amazon subsequently opted out of the final year of the current agreement, meaning that Amazon's rights would begin in the 2022 NFL season instead.[48] Also in that time, reports have verified that Amazon was close to partnering with NBC Sports to produce their broadcasts, and their contract is likely to be a three-year deal with Amazon having the option to extend it to five.[61] This partnership became materialized as along with lead play-by-play announcer Al Michaels, Sunday Night Football producer Fred Gaudelli moved to Amazon as part of collaboration from NBC Sports; Gaudelli explained that his production operated under a notion that they needed to produce a \"great\" broadcast before they could start \"breaking things and being different\", as NFL viewers had specific expectations as to how a game should be broadcast. Jared Stacy, Amazon's head of global live sports production, stated that they were \"challenged by our leadership to figure out what’s next and to take some swings\". Gaudelli went as far as suggesting that the on-field down and distance graphic use Amazon's \"smile\" symbol as an arrow.[62][63] Amazon will employ 13 \"super slo-mo\" cameras, two Skycams, and TrackMan ball tracking. Pinar Toprak composed new theme music for the telecasts. Features from the previous simulcasts of TNF on Amazon platforms will return, including X-Ray, and broadcasts on Twitch. Amazon also plans alternate broadcasts for Prime Video and Twitch, such as one that features the sports comedy team Dude Perfect.[64][65][66] It was reported that Amazon was seeking advertising rates 20% higher than those of Thursday games in past seasons.[67] Per a corporate policy prohibiting advertising that \"encourage, glamorize or depict excessive consumption of alcohol\" on its platforms, Amazon is not allowing commercials for alcoholic beverages to air during its telecasts (although they may still appear in advertising slots sold by the league, or as part of commercial time held by local broadcasters).[67][68][69] As with all other NFL telecasts not on national broadcast television, all Thursday Night Football games are required to be simulcast on a broadcast television station in the home market of each participating team.[65] To ensure availability of the broadcasts at commercial establishments such as bars and restaurants (which might not be configured to handle streaming-only broadcasts), Amazon partnered with DirecTV (which had historically carried NFL Sunday Ticket) to carry its Thursday Night Football telecasts on special channels for its business customers.[70] In addition, Amazon reached an agreement with Nielsen Media Research to provide audience measurement under a three-year deal, allowing the games' viewership on Prime Video, Twitch, out-of-home, and on local broadcast stations to be tabulated in the Nielsen ratings.[71] Amazon carried a preseason game on August 25, 2022, featuring the San Francisco 49ers at the Houston Texans.[64] The first regular season game on September 15, 2022 featured the Los Angeles Chargers at the Kansas City Chiefs.[72] Nielsen reported an average of 13 million viewers across all measured platforms, which were in line with the average numbers that were garnered by Fox's Thursday Night Football broadcasts in the 2021 season, and an increase of five million over that year's season opener (which was an NFL Network-exclusive game).[73] On October 18, 2022, the NFL announced that Thursday Night Football would add a Friday afternoon game on the Friday after Thanksgiving beginning in 2023; Thursday Night Football had taken Thanksgiving week off since. The game will compete directly with the long-standing slate of college football games held on the Friday after Thanksgiving.[74][75][76] Thursday Night Football had gone on hiatus during Thanksgiving week since 2012, as the Thanksgiving primetime game had been reassigned to the Sunday Night Football package.[77][2] As an e-commerce company, the game is expected to leverage a captive audience of holiday shoppers for \"Black Friday\" as a potential audience, including the potential for advertising retail products and \"Cyber Monday\" promotions. The strategy is comparable to Prime Video's acquisition of Premier League soccer fixtures in early-December in the United Kingdom, which similarly leverages holiday shopping activity.[78] On March 28, 2023, following an underwhelming slate of games for the 2022 season that led to a 46% drop in viewership, significant changes were made in response to Amazon's demands for more compelling games. Starting in the 2023 season, teams are not required to have a Thursday game following a Sunday, while teams can play up to two Thursday games following a Sunday game per season. The league also approved the option of flexing Sunday games into Thursday despite overwhelming opposition from players and coaches. Up to two games from weeks 13 through 17 can be flexed with 28 days advanced notice, up from 15 days that was originally proposed. Additionally, only games between teams that have not played two Thursday games are eligible to be flexed and the same team can’t be flexed both times.[79] In Week 16 was the first game flexed in TNF history for a rivalry game between the Browns–Bengals replace in favor of Broncos–Chargers game. In 2025, when Christmas Day falls on a Thursday, TNF will air their traditional game on Christmas night. In 2026, when Christmas Day falls on a Friday, TNF is likely to air their traditional game on Thursday, Christmas Eve. The initial NFL Network team consisted of HBO Sports' Bryant Gumbel as play-by-play announcer, NBC Sports' Cris Collinsworth as the color commentator for the Thursday telecasts, and Dick Vermeil replacing Collinsworth for Saturday telecasts. In 2007, Collinsworth replaced Vermeil alongside Gumbel for all games. Gumbel left the network after the 2007 season and his then-HBO colleague Bob Papa, who is also the radio voice of the New York Giants, was brought in to replace him. Collinsworth stayed on until the end of the 2008 season, then left to take over for the retiring John Madden as lead analyst on NBC Sunday Night Football. NFL Network replaced him with Matt Millen, who returned to broadcasting in 2009, and then added former ESPN analyst Joe Theismann for 2010. For 2011, then ESPN and now CBS play-by-play man Brad Nessler took over the Thursday night broadcast. He was joined by NFL Network draft analyst and NBC Notre Dame color man Mike Mayock, and the pairing spent three seasons calling games. As a result of CBS taking over production responsibilities for the TNF broadcasts, its number one broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms took over the broadcast booth.[14] With NBC adding games in 2016, Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth, the broadcast team of NBC Sunday Night Football, were required under league contract to do the same. NBC had initially hired former Monday Night Football play-by-play man Mike Tirico for Thursdays before the league nixed the idea of any separate broadcast teams for Sunday and Thursday nights. Tirico would eventually call three Sunday Night Football games, including the Thanksgiving night game which is in the SNF package, in order for NBC to allow Michaels over a week's rest before the end of the season.[28][80] Tirico would also call the December 22, 2016 TNF game alongside Collinsworth, as well as two NBC-produced Thursday Night Special game broadcasts on December 18 and Christmas Day, respectively, both alongside former USFL and NFL quarterback Doug Flutie, who serves as the analyst for NBC's college football coverage as well.[81] On May 31, 2017, it was announced that Tirico would replace Michaels full-time for NBC's Thursday Night Football games.[82] For 2017, Kurt Warner would similarly fill in for Collinsworth on two non-Thursday games.[83] For 2017, CBS hired Tony Romo as its lead color commentator. Numerous complications needed to be resolved, namely Romo's reluctance to cover both Sunday and Thursday nights as required under the Thursday Night Football contract,[84] and the fact that Simms remains under contract with CBS through the next several years.[85] However, the network confirmed via press release that Romo's duties would include Sunday and Thursday games.[86] With TNF moving to Fox in 2018, the network announced that its top team of Joe Buck and Troy Aikman would call the games, after months of speculation that five-time NFL MVP Peyton Manning would be hired by the network to call their Thursday games. They were joined by Erin Andrews, who normally works with Buck and Aikman on Sundays alongside Kristina Pink and Mike Pereira, one of two rule analysts for Fox. In previous seasons prior to Fox's TNF contract, Buck did not call any NFL games during late October, working Major League Baseball playoff games instead. For 2018, none of Fox's scheduled MLB playoff broadcasts landed on a Thursday (Fox carried the NLCS and the World Series that year), so Buck continued to broadcast both sports, crisscrossing the country in seven cities over a 22-day period.[87] The following year, the Chiefs–Broncos telecast fell on the same evening as Game 4 of the ALCS, requiring Buck to leave New York City for Denver and Joe Davis to fill in on baseball.[88] NFL Network has occasionally used non-Fox Sports broadcast teams for the games that air exclusively on that network. On October 14, 2018, the NFL announced via press release, that the NFL GameDay Morning studio team of Rich Eisen, Steve Mariucci, Kurt Warner, and Michael Irvin, would be calling the Eagles-Jaguars London Game on October 28. They were joined by Melissa Stark, who made her first appearance as a sideline reporter since ABC's coverage of Super Bowl XXXVII, and Peter Schrager, from Fox Sports, and NFL Network's Good Morning Football. The network kept the four-man booth for the 2019 London Games. For 2018 and 2019, NFL Network borrowed Mike Tirico from former TNF holder NBC to serve as play-by-play for the network's Saturday games (Browns-Broncos and Ravens-Chargers in 2018, and Bills-Patriots in 2019), and reunited him with Warner on color commentary. Tirico and Warner were joined by Schrager on the sidelines.[89] The early Saturday games in 2018 (Texans-Jets and Redskins-Titans) were announced by the trio of Curt Menefee, Steve Mariucci, and Nate Burleson, with Stark on the sideline. Menefee and Mariucci were both dropped from Saturday coverage in 2019, as they were replaced by Eisen and Joe Thomas for Texans-Buccaneers, the early game of the tripleheader in 2019, while Fox's B-Team of Kevin Burkhardt, Charles Davis, and Pam Oliver called Rams-49ers, the third game of the 2019 Saturday tripleheader. Tirico had been scheduled to call Saturday games again in 2020, but after Al Michaels failed to clear NBC protocols for COVID-19, Tirico was dispatched to Sunday Night Football and Joe Davis worked the Saturday broadcasts with Warner.[90] In 2021 NFL London Game was produced by CBS with Greg Gumbel and Adam Archuleta, Joe Davis and Kurt Warner paired up again Raiders vs. Browns in week 15 and Colts vs. Cardinals in week 16, Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen worked Colts vs. Patriots in week 15 and the TNF game between the 49ers and Titans in week 16. After unsuccessfully attempting to lure Aikman away from Fox for TNF full-time (with both Buck and Aikman ultimately leaving Fox for ESPN and Monday Night Football instead), Amazon hired Al Michaels and ESPN college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit as its lead broadcast team.[91][92] In July 2022, Amazon then added former ESPN and ABC News reporter Kaylee Hartung as its sideline reporter.[93] In January 2023, Hartung joined NBC News' The Today Show as a national correspondent.[94][95] Each game telecast on NFL Network was preceded by NFL GameDay Kickoff, which broadcast live from the site of each game and featured Colleen Wolfe as its host, with Joe Thomas, Michael Irvin, and Steve Smith Sr., or other NFL Network colleagues as analysts. The show generally begins two hours before game time (6:00 p.m. ET). NFL Network later introduced a second studio show earlier in the afternoon, TNF First Look, hosted by Andrew Siciliano.[96] CBS games were preceded by Thursday Night Kickoff, hosted by James Brown, Bill Cowher, and Deion Sanders, and was simulcast on CBS and NFL Network. NBC games were preceded by Football Night in America (which was renamed in reference of the host city of the game, such as Football Night in Tampa), hosted by Liam McHugh, Tony Dungy, and Rodney Harrison, and were likewise simulcast on NBC and NFL Network. NFL Network’s pregame crew typically joined the NBC and CBS crews for pregame coverage. NBC, CBS, Twitter (in 2016) and Amazon (in 2017) would join NFL Network’s pregame coverage at 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time during its games.[15] This resulted in some controversy among viewers and the producers of syndicated programming in the locally programmed timeslot before network primetime, where the pre-game affects programs such as Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy! and Entertainment Tonight (all distributed by CBS's sister syndication division CBS Media Ventures), along with several other programs, which then require pre-emption or slotting on lower-profile alternate timeslots or stations to air in markets where they are carried by CBS, Fox, or NBC affiliates in order to accommodate the Thursday games.[97] For Fox, game telecasts were preceded by Fox NFL Thursday. In 2018, it was hosted with a fixed lineup hosted by Michael Strahan, with analysts Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, and insider Jay Glazer.[98] Unlike CBS and NBC, the NFL Network crew would not join Fox’s pregame coverage, as the latter’s pregame became the main pregame show for TNF. In 2019, Strahan remained host, but with Bradshaw and Long rotating as analyst, alongside analyst Tony Gonzalez, and insider Peter Schrager, serving as insider. Fox also signed Rob Gronkowski to make appearances on the program.[99] To accommodate Strahan's commitments to ABC's morning show Good Morning America, the program was broadcast from New York City, with studio segments originating from Fox News Channel's studios rather than Fox Sports' Los Angeles studios.[100] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the pre-game show moved to Los Angeles with Curt Menefee serving as main host. Strahan made remote appearances during the season due to his GMA commitments.[101] Gonzalez left Fox prior to the 2021 season to pursue other film and television projects.[102] Amazon's games are preceded by TNF Tonight and Thursday Night Kickoff, which is hosted from the game site by Charissa Thompson, Tony Gonzalez, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Andrew Whitworth, and Richard Sherman, with contributions by Taylor Rooks and Albert Breer.[103] Marshawn Lynch also appears as part of a pre-recorded segment called \"'N Yo' City\". Aqib Talib was also set to appear on the pregame show as well, but stepped down due to personal legal difficulties. Like CBS, NBC, and Fox, Prime Video's coverage is required to be picked up via over-the-air syndication in the markets of the teams that play each week. As with all other national games, Westwood One provides radio broadcasts of Thursday Night Football games as part of its national radio package for the NFL. Ian Eagle handles play-by-play, with Tony Boselli handling color analysis.[104] This table shows the National Football League teams' all-time standings for games played on Thursday Night Football. Standings are current as of Week 17 of the 2024 NFL season. • *St. Louis Rams, 1995–2015 • **San Diego Chargers, 1961–2016 • ***Oakland Raiders, 1995–2019 • **** Washington Redskins, 1937-2019; Washington Football Team, 2020-2021 Upon the original launch of the Thursday and Saturday night games, few television service providers carried the NFL Network due to disputes during the network's terms in its carriage contracts during negotiations. These disputes were magnified throughout the 2007 season, as two high-profile matchups were to be broadcast by the network. The first was a matchup between the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers which was scheduled for the week after Thanksgiving and saw both teams at 10–1, vying for the top seed in the NFC, and the second was Week 17 Saturday night game between the New England Patriots and the New York Giants, where the Patriots had a chance to become the first team since the 1972 Miami Dolphins to end a regular season undefeated. In the first case, fans were displeased that a matchup between two teams at such a critical point in the season was not available on broadcast television except in the Dallas and Green Bay markets. To avoid such a problem with the potential sixteenth victory for the Patriots, CBS and NBC bought broadcast rights to the game so it could be seen by a nationwide audience on both cable and broadcast television. This ended up causing another controversy, however, as the move by the networks infringed on the exclusivity that would normally have been enjoyed by WWOR-TV in New York City and WCVB-TV in Boston, which were the Giants' and Patriots' respective local over-the-air broadcasters for cable-televised games (the game aired on these stations, as well as on WCBS-TV, WNBC, WBZ-TV and WHDH in the teams' market areas).[110] Thursday Night Football games on NFL Network are among the lowest-rated nationally televised NFL broadcasts. Critics have argued that the games televised on Thursday Night Football have been of lower quality than other prime time games, as they often featured match-ups between lesser or poor-performing teams, and that the shortened rest between games triggered by Thursday games also has an effect on their overall quality.[16][17] In an analysis by Sports on Earth writer Aaron Roberts, it was determined that most Thursday games were of average or above-average quality in comparison to normal, non-prime time games, but that this was \"by design\" due to the leverage of other NFL broadcasters on how games are scheduled throughout the season (which traditionally prioritizes \"major\" games for either late-afternoon or Sunday and Monday nights).[111][112] The move of selected games to CBS brought improved ratings: the inaugural game was the highest-rated program of the night, with an audience share of 13.7 and an average of 20.7 million viewers, representing a 108% increase in ratings over the first NFL Network game in 2013. The game, whose ratings were boosted by coverage of the Ray Rice scandal, also brought CBS its highest prime time ratings on a Thursday night since May 2006. While lower, at 9.6 million viewers, the Week 3 game between the Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers was also the highest-rated program of the night.[113][114][115][116] The first four games of the package, however, featured blowout victories.[117][118] In total, average viewership of the games increased from around 7 million to around 11.8 million in the 2014 season.[119] Controversy over ratings and the quality of play in Thursday night contests escalated when on November 28, 2016, a report circulated that the league was considering ending the franchise. The NFL, however, denied this rumor.[120] The subsequent game on December 1, 2016 between the Dallas Cowboys and the Minnesota Vikings was the highest rated Thursday Night Football of the season.[121][122] During the 2016 season, current and former players including Richard Sherman,[123] J. J. Watt,[124] and Charles Woodson[125] expressed their dislikes for Thursday Night Football, with Richard Sherman calling it a \"poopfest\".[126] The September 20, 2018 game between the New York Jets and Cleveland Browns, which saw the debut of Cleveland's first overall pick Baker Mayfield, as well as the team breaking a nearly two-year losing streak, set a record for the highest-rated NFL Network-exclusive broadcast in Thursday Night Football history, with a 5.2 household rating and over 8 million viewers.[127] Criticism of Thursday night game quality intensified during and after the 2022 NFL season, the first season in which TNF games were broadcast exclusively by Amazon Prime. For example, an overwhelming number of NFL fans, commentators, and former players reacted negatively to an October 6, 2022 game in which the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos punted 12 times, threw four combined interceptions, and scored zero combined touchdowns in over 60 minutes of gameplay.[128][129][130] The criticism was even shared among those working to deliver the Thursday night games to a national audience. For example, after the conclusion of the 2022 regular season, Al Michaels, the full time play-by-play announcer for TNF, commented on his experience calling TNF games and said, “I mean, you just can’t oversell something. Do you want me to sell you a 20-year-old Mazda? That’s what you’re asking me to do. I can’t sell you a used car.\" In the same interview, Michaels even referenced the aforementioned Week 5 contest between Indianapolis and Denver as a primary example of a suboptimal game that he had to call and described the game as \"dreadful.\"[131] The following offseason, the NFL enabled flexible scheduling for Thursday night games, which the league had previously balked at.[132] As mentioned, a team needing to play a Thursday night game can result in a shortened rest period for players between games.[16][17] On October 6, 2014, Arian Foster, then of the Houston Texans, made a statement considering it hypocritical for the NFL to emphasize the safety of players (particularly in regards to concussions) while allowing its players to play a game on only three days' rest, which he considered to be equally \"dangerous\".[118] Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks has also voiced displeasure about Thursday night games reducing prep time, and wrote a 2016 editorial for The Players' Tribune about the games.[133] Sherman's 2017 season (and his run with the Seahawks; he would sign a new deal with the San Francisco 49ers in the 2018 off-season) would end on November 9, 2017 during a Thursday night game against the Arizona Cardinals, when he ruptured his Achilles tendon.[134] On January 29, 2015, the NFL released its health and safety report, which states that an average of 4.8 injuries were sustained during Thursday games compared to 6.9 injuries per game on Sundays and Mondays.[135] During their September 29, 2022 game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa hit the ground with his left elbow, back and back of his helmet after taking a sack. Tagovailoa demonstrated a fencing response, and was stretchered off the field and transported to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center with head and neck injuries. He was discharged from the hospital later that night.[136][137] The game took place only four days after the Dolphins' previous game against Buffalo, where Tagovailoa was briefly taken out of the game due to a head injury (initially reported by the team as a back injury), but returned to the game afterward. That decision prompted an investigation by the NFLPA as a possible violation of concussion protocol;[137][138] the NFL stated there were indications that the concussion protocol had been followed in this case.[139] The NFL faced scrutiny over its concussion policy following the game, with critics arguing that Tagovailoa should not have been cleared to play at all (especially with the shortened rest between the games and the multiple injuries); the league's chief medical officer Allen Sills stated that \"we want to be thorough, and we want to be consistent and be fair to everyone involved and make sure that we have all the data on hand before we reach a final determination.\"[139][140] The injury also prompted discussions over how such situations should be handled during broadcasts, as Amazon faced criticism for airing multiple, graphic replays of the injury during the telecast, and limiting discussion of the event during the halftime show. The first injury was discussed during a segment of the pre-game show, and acknowledged by color commentator Kirk Herbstreit after the second injury. A more extensive discussion did occur during the post-game show, where reporter Michael Smith stated that \"I think there’s room for both concern for Tua — and frustration and outrage.\" ESPN analyst Cris Canty argued that the lack of discussion at halftime was an example of the NFL \"protecting its own interest\", while NBC Sports ProFootballTalk analyst Michael David Smith felt it was hypocritical of Richard Sherman to have signed with Amazon to join the Thursday Night Football studio panel, despite his previous criticisms of the games over player safety.[141][142][143]",
