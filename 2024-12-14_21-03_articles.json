                "content": "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her biographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular music and the subject of widespread media coverage. Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, starting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The latter's singles, \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\", found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Bad Blood\" and \"Look What You Made Me Do\". Shifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and switched to indie folk styles in the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore. She experimented with subdued pop genres on Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024), and began re-recording her Big Machine albums as Taylor's Version[a] due to an ownership dispute with the label. Through the 2020s, she garnered the US number one songs \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"All Too Well\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"Cruel Summer\", \"Is It Over Now?\", and \"Fortnight\". She has undertaken six concert tours, including the Eras Tour (2023–2024), the highest-grossing tour of all time. Miss Americana (2020), All Too Well: The Short Film (2021) and The Eras Tour (2023) are amongst her films. Swift is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with a record seven albums that moved one million copies first-week. She is the highest-grossing performer, the first billionaire from music primarily, and the world's richest female musician. She has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as Rolling Stone, Billboard and Forbes, as well as the only individual from the arts to have been named the Time Person of the Year (2023). Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 30 MTV Video Music Awards, and 49 Billboard Music Awards, having won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year and the IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year at least four times each. She is an advocate of artists' rights and women's empowerment. Her fans are known as Swifties. Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[1] She is named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor.[2][3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[4] Swift's younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[5] Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer,[6] whose singing in church became one of Swift's earliest memories of music that shaped her career.[4] Swift is of Scottish, English, and German descent, with distant Italian and Irish ancestry.[7][8][9] Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania that her father had purchased from one of his clients,[10] and she spent her summers at her family's vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where she occasionally performed acoustic songs at a local coffee shop.[11] She is a Christian[12] and attended preschool and kindergarten at a Montessori school run by the Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[13][14] When her family moved to Wyomissing, she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[15][16] As a child, she performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions[17] and traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[18] Her early love for country music was influenced by Shania Twain, Patsy Cline, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[14] and she spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[19][20] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, she became determined to pursue a country-music career in Nashville, Tennessee.[21] At 11, Swift traveled to Nashville with her mother to visit record labels and submit demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[22] She was rejected by all the labels, which led her to focus on songwriting.[23] She started learning the guitar at 12 with the help of Ronnie Cremer, a computer repairman and local musician who also assisted Swift with writing an original song.[24] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with the talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD.[25] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, 13-year-old Swift was given an artist development deal and began to travel regularly to Nashville with her mother.[26][27] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[28][29] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[30] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[3][31] In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[32][33] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[34] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[35] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing,[36] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people's stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[27][20] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[37] At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[39] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[27] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[40][41][42] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[20] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[43] Released in October 2006, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[44][45] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a platinum-certified debut album.[46] Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations.[47] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[48] as a replacement for Eric Church.[49] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[47][28] Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\", and \"Should've Said No\". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one. \"Our Song\" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a Hot Country Songs number-one single,[50] and \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was Swift's breakthrough single on mainstream radio and charts.[51][52][53] Swift released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[54][55] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[56] Brad Paisley,[57] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[58] Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[59] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[60] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[61] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[62] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[63] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[64] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[65] Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released in November 2008 in North America,[66] and in March 2009 in other markets.[67] On the Billboard 200, Fearless spent 11 weeks at number one, becoming Swift's first chart topper and the longest-running number-one female country album.[68] It was the bestselling album of 2009 in the US.[69] Its lead single, \"Love Story\", was her first number one in Australia and the first country song to top Billboard's Pop Songs chart,[70][71] and its third single, \"You Belong with Me\", was the first country song to top Billboard's all-genre Radio Songs chart.[72] Three other singles were released in 2008–2010: \"White Horse\", \"Fifteen\", and \"Fearless\". All five singles were Hot Country Songs top 10 entries, with \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" topping the chart.[73] In 2009, Swift toured as an opening act for Keith Urban and embarked on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour.[74] \"You Belong with Me\" won Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[75] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by the rapper Kanye West, an incident that became the subject of controversy and widespread media coverage.[76] That year, Swift won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[77] Billboard named her the 2009 Artist of the Year.[78] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for \"Love Story\" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called \"Thug Story\".[79] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.[80] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[81] Throughout 2009, Swift featured on and wrote other musicians' releases. She featured on \"Half of My Heart\" by John Mayer, whom she was romantically linked with in late 2009.[82][83] She wrote \"Best Days of Your Life\" for Kellie Pickler,[84] co-wrote and featured on Boys Like Girls' \"Two Is Better Than One,[85] and wrote two songs—\"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\"—for the soundtrack of Hannah Montana: The Movie, in which she had a cameo appearance.[86][87] She wrote and recorded \"Today Was a Fairytale\" for the soundtrack of Valentine's Day (2010), in which she had her acting debut.[88] \"Today Was a Fairytale\" was her first number-one single on the Canadian Hot 100.[89] While shooting Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[90] On television, she made her debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode[91] and hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host ever to write their own opening monologue.[92][93] Swift's third studio album, Speak Now, was released in October 2010.[94] Written solely by Swift,[95] the album debuted the Billboard 200 with over one million US copies sold first week[96] and became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist.[97] Speak Now was supported by six singles: \"Mine\", \"Back to December\", \"Mean\", \"The Story of Us\", \"Sparks Fly\", and \"Ours\". \"Mine\" peaked at number three and was the highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100,[98] the first three singles reached the top 10 in Canada,[89] and the last two reached number one on Hot Country Songs.[73] Swift promoted Speak Now with the Speak Now World Tour from February 2011 to March 2012[99] and the live album Speak Now World Tour – Live.[100] At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, Swift performed \"Mean\", which won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance.[101] She was named Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011),[102][103] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[104] and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[105] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[106] At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[107] Rolling Stone named Speak Now on its list of \"50 Best Female Albums of All Time\" (2012).[108] Red, Swift's fourth studio album, was released in October 2012.[109] On Red, Swift worked with Chapman and new producers including Max Martin, Shellback, Dan Wilson, Jeff Bhasker, Dann Huff, and Butch Walker, resulting in a genre-spanning record that incorporated eclectic styles of pop and rock such as Britrock, dubstep, and dance-pop.[110][111] The album opened at number one on the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million sales[112] and was Swift's first number-one album in the UK.[113] Its lead single, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", was her first number one on the Billboard Hot 100,[114] and its third single, \"I Knew You Were Trouble\", reached the top five on charts worldwide.[115] Other singles from Red were \"Begin Again\", \"22\", \"Everything Has Changed\", \"The Last Time\", and \"Red\".[116] Red and its single \"Begin Again\" received three nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (2014).[117] Swift received American Music Awards for Best Female Country Artist in 2012, Artist of the Year in 2013,[118][119] and the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist Award for the fifth and sixth consecutive years.[120] At the 2014 Country Music Association Awards, Swift was honored with the Pinnacle Award, making her the second recipient in history after Garth Brooks.[121] The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and became the highest-grossing country tour upon completion.[122] Swift continued writing songs for films and featuring on other artists' releases. On the soundtrack album to The Hunger Games (2012), Swift wrote and recorded \"Eyes Open\" and \"Safe & Sound\"; the latter of which was co-written with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett. \"Safe & Sound\" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[123] She wrote and produced \"Sweeter than Fiction\" with Jack Antonoff for the soundtrack to One Chance (2013).[124] Swift featured on B.o.B's \"Both of Us\" (2012)[125] and provided vocals for Tim McGraw's \"Highway Don't Care\" (2013), also featuring Keith Urban.[126] She was a voice actress in The Lorax (2012),[127] made a cameo in the sitcom New Girl (2013),[128] and had a supporting role in the dystopian film The Giver (2014).[129] From 2010 to 2013, Swift was romantically involved with the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, the political heir Conor Kennedy, and the singer Harry Styles.[83] In March 2014, Swift began living in New York City, which she credited as a creative influence on her fifth studio album, 1989.[note 1] She described 1989 as her first \"official pop album\" and produced it with Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.[132] Released in October 2014, the album opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.28 million copies sold.[133] Its singles \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\" reached number one in Australia, Canada, and the US, with the first two making Swift the first woman to replace herself at the Hot 100 top spot.[134] Other singles include \"Style\", \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Out of the Woods\", and \"New Romantics\".[135] The 1989 World Tour (2015) was the highest-grossing tour of the year with $250 million in total revenue.[136] After publishing an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal stressing the importance of albums as a creative medium for artists,[137] in November 2014, Swift removed her catalog from ad-supported, free music streaming platforms such as Spotify.[138] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during its free three-month trial period and threatened to withdraw her music from the platform,[139] which prompted Apple Inc. to announce that it would pay artists during the free trial period.[140] Swift then agreed to keep 1989 and her catalog on Apple Music.[141] Big Machine Records returned Swift's catalog to Spotify among other free streaming platforms in June 2017.[142] Swift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[143] At the 2014 American Music Awards, Swift received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence.[144] On her 25th birthday in 2014, the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live opened an exhibit in her honor in Los Angeles that ran until October 4, 2015.[145][146] In 2015, Swift won the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist.[147] \"Bad Blood\" won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.[148] At the 58th Grammy Awards (2016), 1989 won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, making Swift the first woman to win Album of the Year twice.[149] Swift dated the DJ Calvin Harris from March 2015 to June 2016.[150] They co-wrote the song \"This Is What You Came For\", featuring vocals from Rihanna; Swift was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg.[151] She recorded \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" with Zayn Malik for the soundtrack to Fifty Shades Darker (2017)[152] and won a Country Music Association Award for Song of the Year with \"Better Man\", which she wrote for the band Little Big Town.[153] In April 2016, Kanye West released the single \"Famous\", in which he references Swift in the line, \"I made that bitch famous.\" Swift criticized West and said she never consented to the lyric, but West claimed that he had received her approval and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the song amicably over the phone. The controversy made Swift a subject of an online \"cancel\" movement.[154] In late 2016, after briefly dating Tom Hiddleston, Swift began a six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn and retreated herself from the public spotlight.[155][156] In August 2017, Swift successfully countersued David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from loss of employment. Four years earlier, she informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event.[157] The public controversies influenced Swift's sixth studio album, Reputation, which explored the impact of her fame and musically incorporated electropop with urban styles of hip hop and R&B.[158] Released in November 2017,[159] Reputation opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million US sales[160] and topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada.[161] The album's lead single, \"Look What You Made Me Do\", was Swift's first UK number-one single[162] and topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the US.[163] Its singles \"...Ready for It?\", \"End Game\", and \"Delicate\" were released to pop radio.[164] Reputation was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.[165] Swift featured on the country duo Sugarland's \"Babe\" (2018).[166] At the 2018 American Music Awards, Swift won four awards, which made her accumulate 23 trophies in total and become the AMAs' most awarded female musician, surpassing Whitney Houston.[167] The same year, she embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour,[168] which became the highest-grossing North American concert tour in history and grossed $345.7 million worldwide.[169] In November 2018, Swift signed a new deal with Universal Music Group, which promoted her subsequent albums under Republic Records' imprint.[170] The contract included a provision for Swift to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[171][172] Swift's first album with Republic Records, Lover, was released in August 2019.[173] She produced the album with Antonoff, Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little.[174] Lover peaked atop the charts of such territories as Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the US.[175] The album spawned five singles: \"Me!\", \"You Need to Calm Down\", \"Lover\", \"The Man\", and \"Cruel Summer\"; the first two singles peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and the lattermost single became a resurgent success in 2023, reaching number one.[176] Lover was 2019's best selling album in the US and best selling album by a solo artist worldwide.[177] The album and its singles earned three nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.[178] At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Video of the Year for \"You Need to Calm Down\", becoming the first female and second artist overall to win the category for a self-directed video.[179] While promoting Lover in 2019, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with the talent manager Scooter Braun after he purchased Big Machine Records, including the masters of her albums that the label had released.[180] Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine would only allow her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under a new contract, which she refused to sign.[180] In November 2020, Swift began re-recording her back catalog, which enabled her to own the new masters and the licensing of her songs for commercial use, substituting for the Big Machine-owned masters.[181] In February 2020, Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group after her 16-year contract with Sony/ATV expired.[182] Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Swift surprise-released two \"sister albums\" that she recorded and produced with Antonoff and Aaron Dessner: Folklore in July and Evermore in December.[183] Joe Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced a few songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[184] Both albums incorporated a muted indie folk and alternative rock production;[185] each was supported by three singles catering to US pop, country, and triple A radio formats. The singles were \"Cardigan\", \"Betty\", and \"Exile\" from Folklore, and \"Willow\", \"No Body, No Crime\", and \"Coney Island\" from Evermore.[186] Folklore was the bestselling album of 2020 in the US[187] and, together with \"Cardigan\", made Swift the first artist to debut a US number-one album and a number-one song in the same week; she achieved the feat again with Evermore and \"Willow\".[188] According to Billboard, Swift was the highest-paid musician in the US and highest-paid solo musician worldwide of 2020.[189] Folklore made Swift the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times, winning the category at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021).[190] At the American Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Artist of the Year for a third record time (2020)[191] and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and Favorite Pop/Rock Album (2021).[192] Swift played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song \"Beautiful Ghosts\".[193][194] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift's life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival.[195] Swift's re-recordings of her first six studio albums began with Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version), which were released in April and November 2021. Both peaked atop the Billboard 200, and the former was the first re-recorded album to do so.[196] Fearless (Taylor's Version) was preceded by \"Love Story (Taylor's Version)\", which made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and re-recorded versions of a song reach number one on Hot Country Songs.[197] Red (Taylor's Version) was supported by \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", which became the longest song in history to top the Hot 100.[198] Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights, was released in October 2022.[199] The album incorporates a restrained electropop[200] and synth-pop sound[201] with elements of hip hop, R&B, and electronica.[199][202] In the US, Midnights was her fifth to open atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies, and its tracks, led by the single \"Anti-Hero\", made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 10 of the Hot 100.[203] Globally, the album broke the record for the most single-day streams and most single-week streams on Spotify and peaked atop the charts of at least 14 countries.[204] The album's two further singles, \"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma\", both peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[205] According to Billboard, Swift was the top-earning solo artist in the US and the top-earning musician worldwide of 2021.[206][207] She won six American Music Awards including Artist of the Year in 2022.[208] At the MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won her third and fourth trophies for Video of the Year with All Too Well: The Short Film, her self-directed short film that accompanies \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", in 2022[209] and \"Anti-Hero\" in 2023.[210] During this period, Swift won three Grammy Awards: Best Music Video for All Too Well: The Short Film[211] and Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year for Midnights. Swift became the first artist to win Album of the Year four times in Grammy history.[212] Swift's next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), were released in July and October 2023. The former made Swift the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand,[213] and the latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, claiming her career's largest album sales week.[214] 1989 (Taylor's Version)'s single \"Is It Over Now?\" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[215] Swift featured on Big Red Machine's \"Renegade\" and \"Birch\" (2021),[216] Haim's \"Gasoline\" (2021),[217] Ed Sheeran's \"The Joker and the Queen\" (2022),[218] and the National's \"The Alcott\" (2023).[219] For the soundtrack of Where the Crawdads Sing (2022), she wrote and recorded \"Carolina\", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards.[220] In 2023, Swift was the most streamed artist on Spotify,[221] Apple Music,[222] and Amazon Music;[223] and the first act to place number one on the year-end Billboard top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023).[224] She had five out of the 10 best-selling albums of 2023 in the US, a record since Luminate began tracking US music sales in 1991.[225] Besides music, Swift had a supporting role in the period comedy film Amsterdam (2022)[226] and began writing an original script for her directorial feature film debut with Searchlight Pictures.[227] In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums. Media outlets extensively covered the tour's global cultural and economic impact,[228] and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[203] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour's ticket sales.[229] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history.[230][231] Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[232][233] Swift's eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, was released on April 19, 2024.[234] Topping charts globally, the album broke a string of records: it marked the first album ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week; sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US; made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 14 of the Billboard Hot 100 and the top 10 of Australia's ARIA Singles Chart; and went on to spend 16 weeks atop the Billboard 200—Swift's longest-running number-one album on the chart. The lead single, \"Fortnight,\" featuring Post Malone, became Swift's 12th number one song on the Hot 100.[235][236][237] After the pandemic, Swift's music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity.[238] From 2023 onward, Swift found ubiquitous success, albeit more dominant than before, with the successes of the re-recordings, the Eras Tour, its concert film, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department, significantly increasing her net worth; Music Business Worldwide remarked this as a \"new stratosphere of global career success\" for Swift.[239][240] In 2023, she began dating the American football player Travis Kelce,[241] and in 2024, won Artist of the Year at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[242] The same year, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to Twitter and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[243] In July, Swift and Kelce received death threats from a stalker in Gelsenkirchen, Germany,[244] and three children were killed in a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed workshop in Southport, England, leading to civil unrest in the UK.[245] In August, all three of the Eras Tour concerts in Vienna were canceled following the arrest of two suspects for allegedly planning an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack in the city. The plan was uncovered by US Intelligence and was thwarted by Austrian police forces.[246] Swift's early musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[247] and Keith Urban's country crossover sounds incorporating rock, pop, and blues.[248] She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift to Red.[249] The albums feature country signifiers such as banjo, six-string banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and a slight vocal twang, in addition to pop melodies and rock influences;[250][251] Speak Now draws on rock styles such as pop rock, pop-punk, and 1980s arena rock.[95][252] Critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's narrative songwriting rather than musical direction[253][254] and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray from its roots.[255][256] After the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna.[257][258] 1989, the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense synthesizers and drum machines.[259] Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums;[260] Reputation consists of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences;[158][261] and Lover features eclectic elements from country, pop-punk, and folk rock.[262] When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity,[263] but others regarded it as necessary for Swift's artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism.[264][265] Her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore explore alternative and indie styles of rock and folk, and both incorporate a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestration, synthesizers, and drum pads.[266][267] The latter experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric time signatures, and diverse instruments.[268][269] Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's artistry as a singer-songwriter.[267] Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department both incorporate a minimalist, subdued synth-pop sound, making use of analog synthesizers, sustained bass notes, and simple drum machine patterns.[270][271] With continuous musical reinventions,[272] Swift was described by Time and the BBC as a musical \"chameleon\".[273][274] Jody Rosen commented that by originating her career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[275] Clash wrote that she has the versatility to \"no longer [...] be defined by any genre or sound label\".[276] According to Ann Powers, Swift's sound is genre-agnostic, blending and \"reconfiguring\" elements of country, R&B, indie pop, and hip hop.[277][278] Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range[283] and a generally soft and breathy timbre that Rolling Stone deemed versatile.[284][285] Reviews of Swift's early country albums criticized her vocals as weak and strained compared to those of other female country singers.[286] Despite the criticism, most reviewers appreciated that Swift refrained from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune and how she prioritized \"intimacy over power and nuance\" to communicate the messages of her songs with her audience[287]—a style that has been described as conversational.[288][289] According to Powers, Swift's defining vocal feature was her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[290] On Red and 1989, Swift's vocals are electronically processed to accompany the pop production.[291][288] Her voice on Reputation and Midnights incorporates hip-hop and R&B influences that result in a near-rap delivery which emphasizes rhythm and cadence over melody.[292][277] She uses her lower register vocals extensively in \"Cardigan\"[293] and both her lower and upper registers in Evermore; the musicologist Alyssa Barca described her timbre in the upper register as \"breathy and bright\" and the lower register as \"full and dark\".[269] Reviews in The New York Times, Variety and The Atlantic were more appreciative of Swift's vocals in her later albums.[251][294][295][296] She ranked 102nd on Rolling Stone's 2023 list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time: \"A decade ago, including her on this list would have been a controversial move, but recent releases like Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights officially settled the argument.\"[285] Laura Snapes of The Guardian said that Swift's \"vocal directness\" enables her to express wide-ranging feelings, highlighting some trademarks such as \"yo-yoing vocal yelp\" and \"climactic, processed cri de coeur\".[297] Amanda Petrusich praised how the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals accentuate her lyrics.[298] Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood. She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations.[299][300] She enjoyed Disney film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them.[301] Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton;[19][104] 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette;[302] Joni Mitchell;[303] and Fall Out Boy.[304] She listed Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs.[28][305] Her literary influences include the authors William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne, F. Scott Fitzgerald,[306] and the poets William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson;[307] the last of whom was a distant cousin of Swift.[308] In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[28] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[309][310] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[311][312] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[95][313] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[314] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[257] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[315] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[316] Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,[317][318] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[300][319] She often references or draws inspiration from historical events and figures.[320] Swift's confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[321][28][322] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music,[323][324][325] although some perceived her as a fragile, juvenile artist, a label she has consistently challenged.[321] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[326][327] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[158] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[327] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[28] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[328][329][330] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[331] On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[332] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[311] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[332] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[333] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[334] Swift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[335] Fans noticed that the fifth track of every Swift album was the most emotionally vulnerable of the album.[336] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[337] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[338] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[203] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You're Anything Like Me\".[339] Critics have analyzed the distinctive qualities and thematic depth in Swift's songwriting. Critic Kitty Empire opined in 2024 that Swift is \"a profoundly old-fashioned artist\", whose songs \"tell a story, in succinct, emotive ways that often scan meticulously\" unlike most pop music of the time; Empire attributed it to Swift's country beginnings.[340] Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[341][334] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[342] Mojo dubbed her \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[343] Academics have variably described her as a poet laureate,[344] philosopher,[345] and bard.[346] Swift commands large audiences on stage,[347][348][349] captivating them through emotional storytelling and vocal delivery rather than relying on elaborate choreography.[350] According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[351] In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\"[352] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour,[353] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\".[354] Swift's concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[355] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[356] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[357] acoustic guitar; piano;[358] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[359][360] six-string banjo,[361] or ukulele.[362] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[298][363] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains \"integral to her singer-songwriter origins\".[364][358] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift \"pop's most approachable superstar\",[365] and the 21st century's most popular performer.[366] Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[367] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time, she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\" in 2011[368] and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White the year before.[369] In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes.\"[370] From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement.[371] She worked with American Express for the \"Blank Space\" music video (which Kahn directed) and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[372] Swift produced the music video for \"Bad Blood\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[373] Her production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media, starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour.[374] She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles \"Me!\" with Dave Meyers, and \"You Need to Calm Down\" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and \"Lover\" with Drew Kirsch,[375] but first ventured into sole direction with the video for \"The Man\" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction).[376] After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,[203] which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director.[377] Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.[367] Swift's discography is a \"critically hailed songbook\", as per Time's Sam Lansky.[378] She has won 14 Grammy Awards (including four for Album of the Year—the most won by an artist),[379] an Emmy Award,[380] 40 American Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[381] 49 Billboard Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[382] 118 Guinness World Records,[383] 30 MTV Video Music Awards (including five Video of the Year wins—the most by an act),[384] 12 Country Music Association Awards (including the Pinnacle Award),[385] eight Academy of Country Music Awards,[386] and two Brit Awards.[147] As a songwriter, she has been honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association,[59][387] the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the National Music Publishers' Association and was the youngest person on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time in 2015.[388][389] At the 64th BMI Awards in 2016, Swift was the first woman to be honored with an award named after its recipient.[390] From available data, Swift has amassed over 50 million album sales and 150 million single sales as of 2019,[391][392][393] and 114 million units globally, including 78 billion streams as of 2021.[394][395] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ranked her as the Global Recording Artist of the Year for a record four times (2014, 2019, 2022, and 2023).[396] Swift has the most number-one albums in the UK and Ireland for a female artist this century,[397][398] earned the highest income for an artist on Chinese digital music platforms (CN¥ 159,000,000 as of 2021),[399] and is the first artist to occupy the entire top five[note 2] of the Australian albums chart[402][403] and the top ten of the country's singles chart.[404] Swift remains the world's highest-grossing touring act ever, with cumulative ticket sales at $3.12 billion as of December 2024, per Pollstar.[405] The Eras Tour is the highest-grossing tour of all time and the first to surpass $1 billion in revenue.[406][407] Beginning with Fearless, each of her studio albums have opened with over one million global units.[408][409] Swift is the most-streamed act on Spotify,[410] and the most-streamed female artist on Apple Music.[411] On Spotify, she is the only artist to have received more than 250 million and 350 million streams in one day (260 million on October 27, 2023, and 380 million on April 19, 2024)[412] and was the first female act to reach 100 million monthly listeners.[413][198] The most entries and the most simultaneous entries (175 and 34 songs), and most number-ones (5) for a soloist on the Billboard Global 200, are among her feats.[414][415] Swift is the first and only artist to occupy the top nine spots on the Global 200.[414] She has the most entries (154), top-ten songs (20), and number-ones (3)[note 3] among solo acts on the Global 200 Excl. US.[414] In the US, Swift has sold over 37.3 million albums as of 2019,[393] when Billboard placed her eighth on its Greatest of All Time Artists Chart.[416] Twelve of her songs have topped the Billboard Hot 100.[417] She is the longest-reigning and the first act to spend at least 100 weeks atop the Billboard Artist 100 (120 weeks);[418][419] the soloist with the most cumulative weeks atop and in the top ten of the Billboard 200 (84 and 425);[420][421] the woman with the most Billboard 200 number-ones (14),[422] Hot 100 entries (total and single-week: 264 and 32),[423] number-one debuts (7),[note 4] top-ten songs (59),[417] top-five songs (36),[198] Streaming Songs chart-toppers (9),[417] and weeks atop the Top Country Albums chart (101);[425] and the act with the most number-one songs on Pop Airplay (13)[426] and Digital Songs (29).[417] Swift is the first woman to simultaneously chart five albums in the top 10 and eleven albums on the entire Billboard 200;[427][428] and the first act to occupy the top four spots and chart seven albums[note 5] in the top 10 on the Top Album Sales chart.[430][431] She is the second highest-certified female digital singles artist (and fifth overall) in the US, with 137.5 million total units certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[432] and the first woman to have both an album (Fearless) and a song (\"Shake It Off\") certified Diamond.[433] Swift is the only artist in Luminate history to have seven albums sell over a million copies in a week.[434] Swift has appeared in various power listings. Time included her on its annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010, 2015, and 2019.[435] She was one of the \"Silence Breakers\" that the magazine spotlighted as Person of the Year in 2017 for speaking up about sexual assault,[436] and she received the honor again in 2023 for her cultural domination that year.[378] Time described Swift as the first Person of the Year to be recognized for \"achievement in the arts\", as well as the first woman to be recognized and appear on a Person of the Year cover more than once.[437][378] In 2014, she was named to Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in the music category[438] and again in 2017 in its \"All-Star Alumni\" category.[439] Swift became the youngest woman to be included on Forbes' list of the 100 most powerful women in 2015, ranked at number 64.[440] In 2023, she was ranked by Forbes as the fifth-most powerful woman in the world, the first entertainer to place in the top five.[441] Swift received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from New York University and served as its commencement speaker on May 18, 2022.[203] In 2024, Billboard ranked her at number 2 on its \"Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century\" list.[442] Swift has been credited with making a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture, and the economy.[443][444] She dominates cultural conversations,[445][446] leading some publications to describe her as a cultural \"vitality\" or zeitgeist.[447][448][449] Her music, life, and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture.[272] Initially a teen idol,[450] she has been referred to as a pop icon;[260][451] publications describe her enormous popularity and longevity as unwitnessed since the 20th century.[452][453] In 2013, New York magazine's Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the \"world's biggest pop star\" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift \"falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends\", leaving her contemporaries \"vying for second place\".[275] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[454] Swift's fans are known as Swifties.[229] Billboard noted that only a few artists have achieved her level of chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support.[455] Swift's million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[456][457] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an \"economic genius\".[458] Although labeled by the media in her early career as \"America's Sweetheart\" for her girl next door persona,[459][460] Swift has been called by detractors \"calculated\" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[461][462] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and \"slut-shaming\",[463][464] as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[465] Swift has also been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[466][467] Swift's private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.[468][469] In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights.[470][471] In December 2023, Swift's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, alleging stalking and safety risks; media outlets have reported that the information posted by Sweeney is a synthesis of publicly available data.[472][473] In February 2024, it was reported that Swift had sold one of her two private jets.[474] \"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we're at this moment where there's no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that's on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact.\" Swift helped shape the modern country music scene,[476] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[275][476] pioneered the use of the internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[27][47] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[477][275] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[478] her guitar performances contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\": a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[479][480] According to Pitchfork, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[481] and Billboard notes her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[482] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[483] Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift.[484][485] She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album \"eras\".[486][487] Swift is a subject of academic study and

She became the first artist to enter at number one on both the Hot 100 singles chart and Billboard 200 album chart in the same week.[10] On December 11, 2020, Swift released her ninth studio album, evermore. It is meant to be a \"sister\" album to folklore.[11] Due to Swift not being able to own her own masters, she has begun re-recording all of her old albums.

Today she's the most recognizable country-- or formerly country? or pop?-- artist in North America, if not the world: her songwriting takes in half a dozen genres, and her economic impact changes cities. We will move through Swift's own catalogue, including hits, deep cuts, outtakes, re-recordings, considering songwriting as its own art, distinct from poems recited or silently read. We will learn how to study fan culture, celebrity culture, adolescence, adulthood and appropriation; how to think about white texts, Southern texts, transatlantic texts, and queer subtexts. We will learn how to think about illicit affairs, and hoaxes, champagne problems and incomplete closure. We will look at her precursors, from Dolly Parton to the Border Ballads, and at work about her (such as the documentary \"Miss Americana\"). And we will read literary works important to her and works about song and performance, with novels, memoirs and poems by (among others) Willa Cather, James Weldon Johnson, Tracey Thorn, and William Wordsworth.

Here’s how it works. The Geminid meteor shower, one of the most prolific meteor showers of the year peaks tonight, Dec. 13. Famed for its bright, vividly colored meteors, the Geminids promise a spectacle as Earth passes through the debris left behind by asteroid 3200 Phaethon. Under optimal conditions, the Geminids can produce up to 120 meteors per hour, but this year's near full-moon will likely wash out fainter meteors, reducing visibility. Still, if you have clear skies, it's worth braving the chill for a glimpse of this celestial treat. While moonlight may hinder some meteor spotting efforts, brighter meteors and the occassional fireball can blaze so bright they'll still be visible. Geminid meteors will appear to radiate from the Gemini constellation but don't look directly at Gemini to spot the meteors, as the shooting stars will be visible across the night sky. Make sure to move your gaze around the nearby constellations as meteors closer to the radiant tend to have shorter trains and are more difficult to spot. Peak Geminid activity typically occurs in the late evening and into the early morning hours, with the best viewing time around 2 a.m. local time when the Gemini constellation, the shower's radiant, is at its highest point in the sky. You can also watch the Geminid meteor shower live online from the comfort of your own home courtesy of Astronomer Gianluca Masi of the Virtual Telescope Project. The livestream is scheduled to start at 6:00 p.m. EST (2300 GMT) on Dec. 13, weather permitting. Keep up to date with what you can see tonight with our night sky live blog. You don't need any special equipment to see meteors. Make sure you dress warmly, bring blankets and perhaps a thermos of hot chocolate to make the experience all the most cozy. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Don't worry if clouds or other factors put a stop to your meteor hunting efforts tonight. The Geminid meteor shower is active through Dec. 21, so you may still spot some meteors in the coming days, especially in the predawn hours when the moon sets earlier.

Here are some of the best-known meteor showers, when, and where to see them—followed by more details about each. Plus, meteor shower watching tips. Good luck—and be sure to share your experiences and any photos in the comments section! Jump to meteor shower watching tips Meteor shower season begins in the spring and ends in the winter. When gardens and wildlife wake up from winter’s sleep it’s as if the shooting stars do too—decorating the night with bright streaks! From the Lyrids to the Perseids, Geminids to the Quadrantids, each meteor shower has its own special charm. As the year goes on, these showers come and go, their brightness increasing and decreasing. By the time January comes, the sky quiets down, and the major meteor showers seem to take a break. This cycle is reminiscent of the old Roman calendar and the zodiac signs, which begin in spring. Just as the Earth starts fresh with the spring equinox, so does the cycle of shooting stars, mirroring the cycle of life through the four seasons. Speaking of four seasons … Find out what the weather will be like all year! This chart lists the most well-known meteor showers as well as the Farmers’ Almanac recommendations for your best chances of catching a shooting star, based on predictions of each shower’s period of peak activity. February and March usually don’t have big meteor showers like the ones in other months. But you might still spot meteors on any night. It only takes clear skies and a little bit of luck! These meteors, which people often call “random” meteors, don’t belong to any specific meteor shower and may be seen all year-round. Speaking of luck … Why is wishing on a shooting star believed to be good luck? Find out! Here are more details about each of the meteor showers listed above, including your probability of seeing shooting stars based on the phase of the Moon during each period of peak activity. We highly recommend: The Perseids (August), Geminids (December), and Quadrantids (January). Named after the Lyra constellation, the Lyrid Meteor Shower will light up the sky from April 14 to 25, with the best viewing on the early morning of April 22. Look east and overhead between 2 and 4 a.m. local time. This shower comes from the area near the bright star Vega, which makes it easier to spot, even if you’re not sure where Lyra is. Related: Learn more about Vega and the 10 Brightest Stars If you happen to see a meteor during this time, it most likely will be dust from Comet Thatcher. These meteors light up as bright lines when they hit Earth’s atmosphere at really fast speeds (110,000 miles per hour). The Lyrids have been watched for over 2,000 years and usually show about 10 to 20 meteors per hour. Sometimes, like in 1982, there can be a lot more—up to 90 meteors in an hour. 2024 Observation Note: The full Moon might make it a bit harder to see shooting stars. Still, 10 to 15 meteors per hour may be visible if the weather conditions are perfect. Catch a meteor this morning, when one of the year’s principal meteor showers—the Eta Aquarids—is due to reach its peak! Look southeast between 2 to 4 a.m. local time. While the Eta Aquarids may not dazzle you with impressive numbers, this shower has one significant claim to fame: its particles come from the most famous of all comets: Halley’s comet! Their radiant is just a few degrees from the intersection of Aquarius, Pegasus, and Pisces. Average rates tend to be about 5 to 20 per hour in the Northern Hemisphere and 60 or more per hour in the Southern Hemisphere. But do think of the Eta Aquarids as interplanetary postcards from the reigning king of comets, currently coasting out beyond the orbit of Neptune. 2024 Observation Note: Light from a waning crescent Moon in that part of the sky poses only a minor hindrance to spotting the faintest meteors. Shower activity will become noticeable once the radiant clears the eastern horizon at about 2:30 a.m. local daylight time. That’s when a bright Eta Aquarid may skim overhead, creating a long, dramatic “Earth-grazer.” Several weak, long lasting meteor showers that primarily emanate from out of the southern part of the sky are active from mid-July through August. The best is the Delta Aquarid shower, due to peak during the predawn hours of July 29. From midnight until the first light of dawn, you can normally expect to see about 10 to 20 moderately swift meteors emanating from out of the southern part of the sky. (We recommend looking between 1 to 3 a.m.) 2024 Observation Note: This year, the chances of seeing a meteor during this time may not be optimal based on the presence of the Moon, just past last quarter phase, that will rise soon after midnight. Related: Moon Phase Calendar Return to Top Get set for one of the best sky events of the year! The Perseid Meteor Shower begins on July 25 and ends on August 18, but it is going to be at its best at around 11 p.m. on August 11 until dawn on August 12. (We recommend 1 to 3 a.m. on August 12.) Related: Top Sky Events 2024 This yearly shower is famous for putting on a great show, usually sending 45 to 90 meteors across the sky every hour when it’s at its peak. If the sky is really dark, you might even see more! Do you live in a big city? One of the best things about The Perseids is that they are bright meteors that break up and leave long, glowing trails, which can still be seen even where there are city lights. 2024 Observation Note: The last quarter Moon will set around 11 p.m., leaving the sky nice and dark for the shooting stars to shine through! This year’s Orionid meteor shower is expected to peak early on the morning of October 21. Look south from 2 to 4 a.m. Under ideal conditions, you may be able to see up to 20 swift meteors might be seen per hour. The meteors of this annual display have paths that appear to radiate from a spot between Gemini and Orion. A few Orionids may actually appear as early as the start of October and as late as November 7 or so. 2024 Observation Note: Unfortunately, the Moon is in a bright waning gibbous phase nearby Taurus, and its glare will very likely spoil the view this year. Psst … did you know that the best time to stargaze is during a New Moon? Learn why! November provides two great opportunities for meteor watching. November 5, 2024 marks the peak of the Taurid Meteor Shower, which is known for its slow and bright meteors with impressive fireballs, radiating from the Taurus constellation. What’s great about the Taurids is that they are one of the few meteor showers that may be observed in the evening! This makes seeing shooting stars tonight much easier for kids (and people who don’t want to stay up or wake up at 3 a.m.). 2024 Observation Note: About a dozen shower meteors per hour may be visible under dark skies after a waxing crescent moon sets in the early evening. Optimal time for viewing begins around 11 p.m on November 4, 2025, when the Taurus constellation is directly overhead. We recommend looking south on November 5 from 1 to 3 a.m. for best results. The Taurids, specifically the Southern Taurids, are debris from Comet Encke. Although not the most abundant shower, their bright meteors make them worth observing from anywhere on Earth. You won’t need any special equipment—just look up. Swift meteors of the Leonid swarm will streak away from the Sickle of Leo during the latter part of November, but probably in reduced numbers for most observers. The comet (55P/Tempel-Tuttle) that produces spectacular meteor displays at roughly 33-year intervals arrived at aphelion, beyond the orbit of Uranus in 2014, and as a result the Leonids have been weak in recent years. The maximum of this year’s display occurs this morning, when about 20 meteors per hour are predicted under ideal conditions. 2024 Observation Note: Unfortunately, your chances of spotting a meteor this morning may be ruined by a bright waning gibbous Moon in Taurus brightening the predawn skies. Look east about one hour before the break of dawn (approximately 4 to 5 a.m.) when the constellation Leo will be high in the eastern sky. The Leonids are known for leaving visible trains. The Geminid Meteor Shower, due to peak during the overnight hours of December 13-14, can produce as many as 60 to 120 slow, graceful meteors per hour under ideal conditions. They tend to be bright and appear yellow and have a reputation for occasional fireballs. Rates increase steadily for several days before maximum, then drop off quickly. The meteors that appear after maximum, however, tend to be especially bright. Remember to dress warmly for the cold December night and perhaps bring along a warm drink to enhance your stargazing experience. The Geminids provide one of the best meteor viewing opportunities, not just for their quantity and brilliance, but also because they’re visible before midnight, making them accessible to many. With the Geminids stemming from an asteroid rather than a comet, they offer a unique twist on the typical meteor shower narrative. Don’t miss out on this cosmic event that promises to enchant anyone willing to gaze up at the vast night sky. 2024 Observation Note: Despite the near-full Moon’s presence, the intensity and brightness of the Geminids ensure a spectacular show, with vivid colors that make them stand out against the night sky. Although the moonlight may conceal the faintest meteors, you’ll still be treated to an unforgettable display, especially if you position yourself with the Moon at your back. Look overhead from approximately 1 to 3 a.m. Mark your calendars for January 3, 2025, for a spectacular night sky show! The Quadrantid Meteor Shower, known for its bright and quick appearance, will be at its best without the Moon’s light to interfere! 2025 Observation Note: This year, maximum activity for the “Quads,” which only lasts for a few hours, will occur at 10 a.m. EST and therefore will favor observers along the west coast of North America (7 a.m. PST) and Hawaii (5 a.m. HST). A single observer in these regions, between midnight and dawn might expect to see 40 to 60 of these moderately swift blue meteors per hour; across central and eastern North America, lesser numbers of around 20 to 30 per hour may be seen. The shower’s radiant is halfway between the head of Draco and the end of the Big Dipper’s handle in the predawn northeast sky. The Quadrantids get their name from an old constellation called Quadrans Muralis, even though they seem to come from the constellation Boötes nowadays. This meteor shower has been wowing people since the 1830s when it was first noted by Adolphe Quetelet. Return to Top The best way to watch for meteors is to check your weather forecast, find a place with a clear view of the sky, and arrange comfortable deck chairs with pillows and blankets. Be sure to wear warm clothing—even in summer—as the nights and earlier morning can be colder than you might think! Related: Farmers’ Almanac Extended Weather Forecast Another factor to consider is bright moonlight, which can considerably cut into the potential number of meteors that might be seen. If a gibbous or full Moon is present during your meteor watch, its bright light will make seeing meteors difficult. For a better experience, get away from city lights, give your eyes time to get used to the dark, and then just look up.

The Geminid meteor shower peaks tonight (Dec. 13) but if you're unable to catch the prolific shower in person, you can still enjoy this spectacular event from the comfort of your home. Astronomer Gianluca Masi of the Virtual Telescope Project is offering a free livestream of the Geminid meteor shower on Dec. 13, starting at 6:00 p.m. EST (2300 GMT), weather permitting. You can watch all the action unfold here on Space.com courtesy of the Virtual Telescope Project, or directly on their WebTV page or YouTube channel. Unfortunately this year, the bright near-full moon will wash out the fainter meteors, but we can still expect some impressive Geminids. \"While this shower offers at its peak 100 meteors per hour under dark skies, this time we can likely expect 15 shooting stars per hour,\" according to Masi. \"We will set up a special, very large field of view equipment in Manciano, under the darkest skies of Italy and will share the brightest meteors in real-time!\" Masi continued. Night sky live Keep up to date with what you can see tonight with our night sky live blog. The Geminid meteor shower is famed for being one of the brightest and most reliable meteor shower events of the year. From the Virtual Telescope Project livestream from Manciano Italy, the dark skies will give observers the best chance of catching a glimpse of an impressive Geminid, regardless of the bright moon. Geminds are unusual because unlike other meteor showers that result from debris left over from comets, they are created by bits of near-Earth object 3200 Phaethon, an asteroid that may have undergone a collision with another object in the distant past to create a stream of debris. The strange asteroid behaves like a comet and orbits the sun every 1.4 years. When Earth passes through the debris left behind by Phaethon the \"asteroid crumbs\" heat up as they enter Earth's atmosphere and burn up in bright bursts of light.

                "content": "Washington Virginia Around the Globe One of the best meteor showers of the year is peaking tonight, sparking shooting stars into the chilly December sky. Here's when and where to look for the Geminid meteor shower. By Brian Lada, AccuWeather meteorologist and senior content editor Published Dec 9, 2024 1:47 PM EST | Updated Dec 12, 2024 10:11 PM EST Although a nearly full moon will contest the peak of the Geminid meteor shower, there are ways you can still observe the shower. Don’t let the moon stop you from seeing shooting stars. One of the best meteor showers of the year is about to peak, sparking shooting stars into the chilly December sky. It's considered one of the best meteor showers of the year because the meteors are bright and plentiful. The Geminid meteor shower peaks tonight, Thursday, Dec. 12, into the early hours of Friday, Dec. 13. Most years, it boasts up to 120 meteors per hour; however, a nearly full moon will outshine many of the dimmer meteors in 2024. The Geminids over the Himalayas in Tibet (Getty Images) While the Geminid meteor shower is most prominently seen from the Northern Hemisphere, it is also observable from the Southern Hemisphere. Meteor showers derive their names from the constellation where their meteors seem to originate, with the upcoming event linked to Gemini. Gemini is relatively simple to identify in the night sky; it lies to the northeast of Orion and between the constellations Taurus and Cancer. The constellation is distinguished by its two brightest stars, Castor and Pollux, which symbolize the heads of the Gemini twins. To spot Geminid meteors, you don’t need to look directly at the constellation. The meteors will be visible throughout the entire night sky with the first shooting stars appearing not long after nightfall. However, due to the nearly full moon competing for dominance in the sky on peak night, stargazers are advised to look for meteors in darker areas where the moon is out of sight. Astronomy Professor Chris Palma from Penn State University offers his advice on how to catch the best astronomical events this December. December has the longest nights of the entire year, providing more time for stargazing. However, it also brings an uptick in storms and clouds, which can make it challenging to view some of the upcoming celestial sights. There is one final meteor shower of the year following the Geminids. On the night of Dec. 21 into the morning of Dec. 22, the Ursids will peak. However, it will not be as impressive of a show compared to the Geminids, as the late-December event only brings around 10 meteors per hour.

                "content": "Visit the Meteor Shower Calendar The 2024 Meteor Shower List is presented in four separate parts. The showers are broken down by intensity with major, minor, variable, and weak showers being separated into their own groups. The general public is encouraged to use the list of major showers as they are the most well known and provide the most activity on a year to year basis. The other showers rarely surpass ten meteors per hour at maximum and are difficult to observe by the general public. Information and Table Template Courtesy the International Meteor Organization and Masahiro Koseki. The meteor showers listed above are the easiest to observe and provide the most activity. Particular attention should be noted to the time and moonlight conditions. All these showers are best seen after midnight. Some are not even visible until after midnight. Showers that peak with the moon’s age between 10 and 20 days will be affected by moonlight and difficult to observe this year. While the time each shower is best seen remains much the same year after year, the moonlight conditions change considerably from one year to the next. The time listed is not necessarily the peak time, but the time in which the radiant is best positioned in the sky. We will post upcoming details of each major shower that is free from moonlight well in advance of their peak activity. Information and Table Template Courtesy the International Meteor Organization and Masahiro Koseki. The meteor showers listed above range from 2 to 10 shower members per hour at maximum activity. These meteors can be detected by experienced observers but novice observers and the general public will have difficultly distinguishing these meteors from the major showers or sporadic (random) meteors. Information and Table Template Courtesy the International Meteor Organization. The meteor showers listed above produce strong activity on rare occasions. Most of the time only a few scattered remnants of these showers are observed with rates of one shower member per NIGHT. Note that most of these showers are best seen during the evening hours, a situation quite opposite most meteor showers. Information and Table Template Courtesy the International Meteor Organization and Masahiro Koseki. The meteor showers listed above rarely produce an average of more than two shower members per hour. In some cases these showers have been recently discovered by video means, being too weak for visual observers to pick out from the sporadic background. This list is being provided for the experienced observer in order to follow the activity of these weak showers. Good luck with your observations in 2024! Shower: named for the constellation or closest star within a constellation where the radiant is located at maximum activity. Activity Period: the dates when the shower is active and the observer can expect activity from this source. Maximum: the date on which the maximum activity is expected to occur. S.L.: the equivalent solar longitude of the date of maximum activity. Solar longitude is measured in degrees (0-359) with 0 occurring at the exact moment of the spring equinox, 90 at the summer solstice, 180 at the autumnal equinox, and 270 at the winter solstice. Scientists use this time measurement as it is independent of the calendar and its leap years. Radiant: the area in the sky where shower meteors seem to appear from. This position is given in right ascension (celestial longitude) and declination (celestial latitude). The radiant must be near or above the horizon in order to witness activity from a particular shower. Velocity: the velocity at which shower meteors strike the Earth’s atmosphere. The velocity depends on the angle meteoroids (meteors in space) intersect the Earth. Meteoroids orbiting in the opposite direction of the Earth and striking the atmosphere head-on are much faster than those orbiting in the same direction as the Earth. This velocity is measured in kilometers per second. r: The Population Index, An estimate of the ratio of the number of meteors in subsequent magnitude classes. Simply stated: the lower the “r” value, the resulting overall mean magnitude of each shower will be brighter. “r” usually ranges from 2.0 (bright) to 3.5 (faint). ZHR: Zenith Hourly Rate, the average maximum number of shower meteors visible per hour if the radiant is located exactly overhead and the limiting magnitude equals +6.5 (a very dark sky). Actual counts rarely reach this figure as the zenith angle of the radiant is usually less and the limiting magnitude is usually lower than +6.5. ZHR is a useful tool when comparing the actual observed rates between individual observers as it sets observing conditions for all to the same standards. Time: this is the time of night when meteors from each shower are best seen. Quite often the radiant will culminate after sunrise therefore the last dark hour before dawn will be listed. Daylight Saving Time (Summer Time) is used from March through October. These figures are also highly dependent on the latitude of the observer. The time listed is most precise for mid-northern latitudes. Moon: the age of the moon in days where 0 is new, 7 is first quarter, 15 is full, and 22 is last quarter. Meteor activity is best seen in the absence of moonlight so showers reaching maximum activity when the moon is less than 10 days old or more than 25 are much more favorably observed than those situated closer to the full moon. Class: A scale developed by Robert Lunsford to group meteor showers by their intensity: The American Meteor Society, Ltd. is a non-profit scientific organization founded in 1911 and established to inform, encourage, and support the research activities of both amateur and professional astronomers who are interested in the fascinating field of Meteor Astronomy.

                "title": "Nancy Pelosi - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Nancy Patricia Pelosi (/pəˈloʊsi/ pə-LOH-see; née D'Alesandro; born March 26, 1940) is an American politician who served as the 52nd speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 2007 to 2011 and again from 2019 to 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, she was the first woman elected as U.S. House Speaker and the first woman to lead a major political party in either chamber of Congress, leading the House Democrats from 2003 to 2023. A member of the House since 1987, Pelosi currently represents California's 11th congressional district, which includes most of San Francisco. She is the dean of California's congressional delegation. Pelosi was born and raised in Baltimore, and is the daughter of mayor and congressman Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. She graduated from Trinity College, Washington, in 1962 and married businessman Paul Pelosi the next year; the two had met while both were students. They moved to New York City before settling down in San Francisco with their children. Focused on raising her family, Pelosi stepped into politics as a volunteer for the Democratic Party in the 1960s. After years of party work, rising to chair the state party, she was first elected to Congress in a 1987 special election and is now in her 19th term. Pelosi steadily rose through the ranks of the House Democratic Caucus to be elected House minority whip in 2001[1] and elevated to House minority leader a year later,[2] becoming the first woman to hold each of those positions in either chamber of Congress. In the 2006 midterm elections, Pelosi led the Democrats to a majority in the House for the first time in 12 years and was subsequently elected Speaker, becoming the first woman to hold the office.[3] Until Kamala Harris became vice president in 2021, Pelosi was the highest-ranking woman in the presidential line of succession in U.S. history, as the speaker of the House is second in the line of succession. During her first speakership, Pelosi was a major opponent of the Iraq War as well as the Bush administration's attempts to partially privatize Social Security. She participated in the passage of the Obama administration's landmark bills, including the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and the 2010 Tax Relief Act. Pelosi lost the speakership after the Republican Party retook the majority in the 2010 midterm elections, but she retained her role as leader of the House Democrats and became House minority leader for a second time. In the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats regained majority control of the House, and Pelosi was again elected Speaker, becoming the first former speaker to reclaim the gavel since Sam Rayburn in 1955. During her second speakership, the House twice impeached President Donald Trump, first in December 2019 and again in January 2021; the Senate acquitted Trump both times. She participated in the passage of the Biden administration's landmark bills, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and the Respect for Marriage Act. In the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans narrowly regained control of the House for the new Congress, ending her tenure as speaker. She subsequently retired as House Democratic leader. On November 29, 2022, the Steering and Policy Committee of the House Democratic Caucus named Pelosi \"Speaker Emerita\". She was reelected in 2024 to her 20th term in the House upon the convening of the 119th Congress, which begins on January 3, 2025. Nancy Pelosi was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to an Italian-American family. She was the only daughter and the youngest of six children of Annunciata M. \"Nancy\" D'Alesandro (née Lombardi)[4] and Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.[5] Her mother was born in Fornelli, Isernia, Molise, in Southern Italy, and immigrated to the U.S. in 1912;[6] her father traced his Italian ancestry to Genoa, Venice and Abruzzo.[5] When Pelosi was born, her father was a Democratic congressman from Maryland. He became Baltimore mayor seven years later.[7][5][8] Pelosi's mother was also active in politics, organizing Democratic women and teaching her daughter political skills.[9] Pelosi's brother, Thomas D'Alesandro III, also a Democrat, was elected Baltimore City Council president and later served as mayor from 1967 to 1971.[7] Pelosi helped her father at his campaign events, and she attended President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address in January 1961.[5] In 1958, Pelosi graduated from the Institute of Notre Dame, an all-girls Catholic high school in Baltimore. In 1962, she graduated from Trinity College (now Trinity Washington University) in Washington, D.C., with a Bachelor of Arts in political science.[10] Pelosi interned for Senator Daniel Brewster (D-Maryland) in the 1960s alongside future House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.[11] After moving to San Francisco, Pelosi became friends with 5th district congressman Phillip Burton and began working her way up in Democratic politics.[12] In 1976, she was elected as a Democratic National Committee member from California, a position she would hold until 1996.[13] She was elected as party chair for Northern California in 1977, and four years later was selected to head the California Democratic Party, which she led until 1983. Subsequently, Pelosi served as the San Francisco Democratic National Convention Host Committee chairwoman in 1984, and then as Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee finance chair from 1985 to 1986.[14] Phillip Burton died in 1983 and his wife, Sala Burton, won a special election to fill the remainder of her husband's congressional term. She was then reelected to two more terms in her own right. Burton became ill with cancer in late 1986 and decided not to run for reelection in 1988. She wanted Pelosi to succeed her, guaranteeing Pelosi the support of the Burtons' contacts.[15] Burton died on February 1, 1987, one month after being sworn in for a second full term. Pelosi won the special election to succeed her, defeating Democratic San Francisco supervisor Harry Britt on April 7, 1987, and Republican Harriet Ross in a June 2 runoff. Pelosi took office a week later.[16][17] In the primary, Britt, a gay man, had courted San Francisco's sizable homosexual population by arguing that he would be better than Pelosi at addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic.[18] Pelosi had held many campaign events, amassed a large number of campaign volunteers, and fundraised prolifically for her campaign.[19] Pelosi has continued to represent approximately the same area of San Francisco for her entire congressional career, despite the boundaries shifting marginally in decennial post-reapportionment redistrictings. This area has been represented in the House by Democrats uninterruptedly since 1949, and is strongly Democratic-leaning (as of 2006, 13% of registered voters in the boundaries of Pelosi's district were Republican). It has not seen a serious Republican congressional contender since the early 1960s.[20] Pelosi has been reelected to the House 18 times[21] without any substantive opposition. Unlike in her 1987 campaign, Pelosi has not participated in candidates' debates in her reelection campaigns. In her first seven reelection campaigns (from 1988 through 2004), she won an average of 80% of the vote.[20] At the time that Pelosi entered office, there were only 23 women in the House.[22] When Pelosi entered office, the AIDS epidemic was at a dire point.[23] San Francisco was greatly affected; its large population of gay men was the epidemic's initial epicenter.[24] Beginning in her first term, Pelosi became a prominent congressional advocate on behalf of those impacted by HIV/AIDS.[23] Shortly after she took office, she hired a gay man as her congressional office's director of AIDS policy. In her first floor speech, Pelosi promised that she would be an advocate in the fight against what she called \"the crisis of AIDS.\" With great stigma around the subject, some in her party privately chastised her for publicly associating herself with it.[18] Pelosi co-authored the Ryan White CARE Act, which allocated funding dedicated to providing treatment and services for those impacted by HIV/AIDS.[23] President George H. W. Bush signed the bill into law in December 1990.[25] In March 1988, Pelosi voted for the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Ronald Reagan's veto).[26][27][28] Pelosi helped shape the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, working with California Senator Dianne Feinstein and New York Congressman Chuck Schumer. It became law in 1994.[19] Pelosi also held chairs on important committees, such as the House Appropriations Committee and the House Intelligence Committee.[19] In 2001, Pelosi was elected the House minority whip, second-in-command to Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. She was the first woman in U.S. history to hold that post.[29] Pelosi defeated John Lewis and Steny Hoyer for the position. A strong fundraiser, she used campaign contributions to help persuade other members of Congress to support her candidacy.[30] In 2002, Pelosi opposed the Iraq Resolution authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq, which passed the House on a 296–133 vote.[31][32] She said, \"unilateral use of force without first exhausting every diplomatic remedy and other remedies and making a case to the American people will be harmful to our war on terrorism.\"[33] In November 2002, after Gephardt resigned as House minority leader to seek the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election, Pelosi was elected to replace him, becoming the first woman to lead a major party in either chamber of Congress.[34] In the campaign to succeed Gephardt as the House Democratic Caucus's leader, Pelosi was challenged by Harold Ford Jr. and Marcy Kaptur. Kaptur withdrew her candidacy for the position before the November 15, 2002, caucus vote, and Pelosi defeated Ford 117–29 in the closed-door vote of caucus members.[35] Critics of Pelosi characterized her as too liberal to be a successful House leader.[36][37] As minority leader, Pelosi sharply criticized the handling of the Iraq War by President Bush and his administration, in 2004 saying Bush had demonstrated areas of \"incompetence\".[38] In a relative surprise, the Democratic Party lost three seats in the 2004 House elections, which coincided with Bush's reelection as president.[39] Focused on retaking the House majority in 2006, in her second term as minority leader Pelosi worked to criticize the Bush administration more effectively and to contrast the Democratic Party with it.[39][40] As part of this, Pelosi voiced even harsher criticism of Bush's handling of the Iraq War.[40] In November 2005, prominent congressional Democrat John Murtha proposed that the U.S. begin a withdrawal of troops from Iraq at the \"earliest predictable date\". Pelosi initially declined to commit to supporting Murtha's proposal.[41] Speaker Dennis Hastert soon brought to the floor a vote on a non-binding resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal of troops, seeking to trap Democrats into taking a more radical stance. Pelosi led Democrats in voting against the resolution, which failed in a 403–3 floor vote.[42] Roughly two weeks later, Pelosi held a press conference in which she endorsed Murtha's proposal.[43] Some critics believed that Pelosi's support for a troop withdrawal would prevent the Democrats from winning a House majority in the 2006 elections.[40] During her time as minority leader, Pelosi was not well known to much of the American public. Before the 2006 elections, Republicans made a concerted effort to taint public perception of her, running advertisements assailing her.[44] Advertisements demonizing Pelosi became a routine part of Republican advertising in subsequent elections.[45] For instance, during the 2022 election cycle, Republicans ran more than $50 million in ads that negatively characterized or invoked Pelosi, and in the 2010 cycle, they spent more than $65 million on such ads.[45][46] In the 2006 elections, the Democrats took control of the House, picking up 30 seats,[47] the party's largest House seat gain since the 1974 elections held in the wake of the Watergate scandal.[40] The party's House majority meant that as the party's incumbent House leader, Pelosi was widely expected to become speaker in the next Congress.[48][49] On November 16, 2006, the Democratic caucus unanimously nominated her for speaker.[50] Pelosi supported her longtime friend John Murtha for House majority leader, the second-ranking post in the House. His competitor was House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who had been Pelosi's second-in-command since 2003.[51] Hoyer was elected House majority leader over Murtha by a margin of 149–86.[52] On January 4, 2007, Pelosi defeated Republican John Boehner of Ohio, 233 votes to 202, in the election for speaker of the House.[53][54][55] Rahm Emanuel, the incoming chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, nominated Pelosi, and her longtime friend John Dingell swore her in, as the dean of the House of Representatives traditionally does.[56][57] Pelosi was the first woman, the first Californian, and the first Italian-American to hold the speakership. She was also the second speaker from a state west of the Rocky Mountains. The first was Washington's Tom Foley, the last Democrat to hold the post before Pelosi. During her speech, she discussed the historical importance of being the first woman to hold the position of Speaker: This is a historic moment—for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all men and women are created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the marble ceiling. For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them.[59] She also said Iraq was the major issue facing the 110th Congress while incorporating some Democratic Party beliefs: The election of 2006 was a call to change—not merely to change the control of Congress, but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people more clear about the need for a new direction than in Iraq. The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.[59] As speaker, Pelosi remained the leader of the House Democrats, as the speaker is considered the leader of the majority caucus. But by tradition, she did not normally participate in debate and almost never voted on the floor, though she had the right to do so as a member of the House. She was also not a member of any House committees, also in keeping with tradition. Pelosi was reelected speaker in 2009. During and after her first tenure as speaker, Pelosi was widely characterized as a polarizing political figure. Republican candidates often associated their Democratic opponents with her.[60][61] Pelosi became the focus of heavy disdain by \"mainstream\" Republicans and Tea Party Republicans alike,[62] as well as from the left.[63] As they had in 2006, Republicans continued to run advertisements that demonized Pelosi.[64] Before the 2010 House elections, the Republican National Committee prominently used a \"Fire Pelosi\" slogan in its efforts to recapture the House majority.[65][66] This slogan was rolled out hours after the House passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[67] Republicans spent $65 million ahead of the 2010 elections on anti-Pelosi advertisements.[46] Pelosi has continued to be a fixture of Republican attack.[68] Ads demonizing her have been credited with fostering intense right-wing ire toward her,[69] and have been seen as one of the top factors in her unpopularity with the public.[30] Shortly after being reelected in 2004, President Bush claimed a mandate for an ambitious second-term agenda and proposed reforming Social Security by allowing workers to redirect a portion of their Social Security withholding into stock and bond investments.[70] Pelosi strongly opposed the plan, saying there was no crisis, and as minority leader she imposed intense party discipline on her caucus, leading them to near-unanimous opposition to the proposal, which was defeated.[71] In the wake of Bush's 2004 reelection, several leading House Democrats believed they should pursue impeachment proceedings against him, asserting that he had misled Congress about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and violated Americans' civil liberties by authorizing warrantless wiretaps. In May 2006, with an eye on the upcoming midterm elections—which offered the possibility of Democrats taking back control of the House for the first time since 1994—Pelosi told colleagues that, while the Democrats would conduct vigorous oversight of Bush administration policy, an impeachment investigation was \"off the table\". A week earlier, she had told The Washington Post that although Democrats would not set out to impeach Bush, \"you never know where\" investigations might lead.[72] After becoming speaker in 2007, Pelosi held firm against impeachment, notwithstanding strong support for it among her constituents. In the 2008 election, she withstood a challenge for her seat by antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan, who ran as an independent primarily because of Pelosi's refusal to pursue impeachment.[73] Before the midterm elections, Pelosi announced that if Democrats gained a House majority, they would push through most of their agenda during the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress.[74][75] The \"first hundred hours\" was a play on President Franklin D. Roosevelt's promise for quick action to combat the Great Depression during his \"first hundred days\" in office. Newt Gingrich, who became speaker of the House in 1995, had a similar 100-day agenda to implement his Contract with America. On January 5, 2007, reacting to suggestions from Bush's confidants that he would increase troop levels in Iraq (which he announced in a speech a few days later), Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid condemned the plan. They sent Bush a letter reading: [T]here is no purely military solution in Iraq. There is only a political solution. Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain. ... Rather than deploy additional forces to Iraq, we believe the way forward is to begin the phased redeployment of our forces in the next four to six months while shifting the principal mission of our forces there from combat to training, logistics, force protection, and counter-terror.[76] Pelosi was named Permanent Chair of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.[77] Pelosi has been credited for spearheading Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act,[78] when it seemed doomed to defeat. After Republican Scott Brown won Democrat Ted Kennedy's former Senate seat in the January 2010 Massachusetts special election, costing Democrats their 60-seat filibuster-proof majority, Obama agreed with his then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel's idea to do smaller initiatives that could pass easily. But Pelosi dismissed Obama's compunction, mocking his scaled-back ideas as \"kiddie care\".[79] After convincing him that this was their only shot at health care reform because of the large Democratic majorities in Congress, she rallied her caucus as she began an \"unbelievable marathon\" of a two-month session to craft the bill, which passed the House 219–212. In Obama's remarks before signing the bill into law, he called Pelosi \"one of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had.\"[80][81][82][83] By early 2010, analysts were assessing Pelosi as possibly the most powerful woman in U.S. history and among the most powerful speakers of the previous 100 years.[84] In March 2010, Mark Shields wrote, In the last four months, [Pelosi] has not once, not twice but on three separate occasions done what none of her predecessors—including legendary giants [Tip O'Neill and Sam Rayburn]—could ever do: persuade the House of Representatives to pass national health-care reform. Pelosi has proved herself to be the most powerful woman in U.S. political history.[85] Later in 2010, Gail Russell Chaddock of The Christian Science Monitor opined that Pelosi was the \"most powerful House speaker since Sam Rayburn a half century ago\", adding that she had also been \"one of the most partisan\".[62] Scholars favorably assessed Pelosi's first speakership. In late 2010, Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, opined that despite polarized public opinion of Pelosi, \"she's going to rank quite high in the pantheon of modern speakers\", declaring that the only speaker of the previous 100 years he would rank higher than Pelosi was Sam Rayburn. Catholic University of America political scientist Matthew Green opined that the 111th Congress had \"been remarkable in its productivity—in both the number of bills enacted and their scope—and Pelosi shares much of the credit.\"[86] Green considered Pelosi's tenure as speaker to be among the greatest in U.S. history, highlighting the passage of the Affordable Care Act (\"a measure with far-reaching implications for our nation's health care policy\"). He also praised Pelosi for occasionally allowing House passage of measures that had majority overall House support but were opposed by the majority of the Democratic House Caucus. He noted that she had occasionally allowed bills to move forward in such fashion despite a high level of political polarization in the United States.[87] In November 2010, Brian Naylor of NPR opined that: During Nancy Pelosi's four years as speaker of the House, Congress approved the health care overhaul—widely considered the most significant piece of domestic legislation since Medicare—along with an $800 billion measure to stimulate the economy and a multi-billion-dollar rescue of the banks. It is a legislative legacy that rivals the accomplishments of any speaker in modern times.[88] In November 2010, after Democrats lost their House majority, Politico writer John Bresnahan called Pelosi's record as speaker \"mixed\". He opined that Pelosi had been a powerful speaker, describing her as wielding \"an iron fist in a Gucci glove\" and having held \"enormous power within the House Democratic Caucus\", but noting that she had a \"horrible approval rating with the rest of America\". Bresnahan wrote that Pelosi's leadership and the legislative agenda she advanced had significantly contributed to the party's loss of its House majority, citing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as an example of legislation that hurt the Democrats electorally in 2010. Bresnahan also believed that, ahead of the 2010 elections, Pelosi had \"disastrously\" misread public opinion, and that Pelosi had been a poor orator.[89] Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution opined in 2018 that Pelosi had been the \"strongest and most effective speaker of modern times\" during her first speakership.[90] In 2018, Robert Draper wrote for The New York Times Magazine: During Nancy Pelosi’s four years as speaker, there was no confusion as to who was in control. Pelosi used the tools at her disposal—committee assignments, campaign donations—to establish a balance among her party’s coalitions while also reminding everyone that her job was not simply to officiate and appease...But as Newt Gingrich learned the hard way two decades ago, an autocratic speaker is a short-lived one. Pelosi’s reign was successful because she understood the will of her caucus rather than bending it to hers.[30] Draper also wrote that \"for all her mastery of Washington's inside game, Pelosi has never been a deft public-facing politician,\" and called her a poor orator.[30] Though Pelosi was reelected by a comfortable margin in the 2010 elections, the Democrats lost 63 seats and control of the House of Representatives to the Republicans. After this setback, Pelosi sought to continue leading the House Democratic Caucus as minority leader, the office she held before becoming speaker. Intraparty opposition failed to pass a motion to delay the leadership vote,[91] though she faced a challenge from Representative Heath Shuler. Shuler lost to Pelosi, 150–43, in the caucus vote on November 17, 2010.[92] On the opening day of the 112th Congress, Pelosi was elected minority leader.[93] In November 2011, 60 Minutes alleged that Pelosi and several other members of Congress had used information they gleaned from closed sessions to make money on the stock market. The program cited her purchases of Visa Inc. stock while a bill that would limit credit card fees was in the House. Pelosi denied the allegations and called the report \"a right-wing smear\".[94][95][96] When the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (or STOCK Act) was introduced the next year, she voted for it and lauded its passing. Of representatives Louise Slaughter and Tim Walz, who drafted the bill, Pelosi said they \"shined a light on a gaping hole in our ethics laws and helped close it once and for all\".[97][98] On November 14, 2012, Pelosi announced that she intended to remain Democratic leader.[99] In August 2016, Pelosi said that her personal contact information had been posted online following a cyberattack against top Democratic campaign committees and she had received \"obscene and sick calls, voice mails and text messages\". She warned members of Congress to avoid letting children or family members answer phone calls or read text messages.[100] At times, centrists, progressive candidates and incumbent Democrats all expressed opposition to Pelosi's continued tenure as the party's House leader.[101] Prompted by colleagues after the 2016 presidential election, Tim Ryan of Ohio initiated a bid to replace Pelosi as House minority leader on November 17, 2016.[102] After Pelosi agreed to give more leadership opportunities to junior members,[103] she defeated Ryan by a vote of 134–63 on November 30.[104] In 2017, after Democrats lost four consecutive special elections in the House of Representatives, Pelosi's leadership was again called into question. In June 2017, Representative Kathleen Rice of New York and a small group of other House Democrats, including Congressional Black Caucus chairman Cedric Richmond, held a closed-door meeting to discuss potential new Democratic leadership.[105] Other House Democrats, including Ryan, Seth Moulton, and Filemon Vela, publicly called for new House leadership.[106] In an interview, Rice said, \"If you were talking about a company that was posting losing numbers, if you were talking about any sports team that was losing time and time again, changes would be made, right? The CEO out. The coach would be out and there would be a new strategy put in place.\"[106] In a press conference, Pelosi defended her leadership, saying, \"I respect any opinion that my members have but my decision about how long I stay is not up to them.\"[106] When asked specifically why she should stay on as House minority leader after numerous Democratic seats were lost, she responded, \"Well, I'm a master legislator. I am a strategic, politically astute leader. My leadership is recognized by many around the country, and that is why I'm able to attract the support that I do.\"[107] In November 2017, after Pelosi called for John Conyers's resignation over allegations of harassment, she convened the first in a series of planned meetings on strategies to address reforming workplace policies in the wake of national attention to sexual harassment. She said Congress had \"a moral duty to the brave women and men coming forward to seize this moment and demonstrate real, effective leadership to foster a climate of respect and dignity in the workplace\".[108] In February 2018, Pelosi sent a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan about the proposed public release of a memo prepared by Republican staff at the direction of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes. The memo attacked the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Pelosi said the FBI and the Department of Justice had warned Nunes and Ryan that the memo was inaccurate and that its release could threaten national security by disclosing federal surveillance methods. She added that Republicans were engaged in a \"cover-up campaign\" to protect Trump: \"House Republicans' pattern of obstruction and cover-up to hide the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal represents a threat to our intelligence and our national security. The GOP has led a partisan effort to distort intelligence and discredit the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence communities.\"[109] She charged Nunes with \"deliberately dishonest actions\" and called for his immediate removal from his position.[110] In February 2018, Pelosi broke the record for longest House speech using the \"magic minute\" custom when she spent more than eight hours recounting stories from DREAMers—people brought to the United States as minors by undocumented immigrants—to object to a budget deal that would raise spending caps without addressing the future of DACA recipients, who were at risk of deportation by the Trump administration.[111][112][113] In May 2018, after the White House invited two Republicans and no Democrats to a Department of Justice briefing on an FBI informant who had made contact with the Trump campaign,[114] Pelosi and Schumer sent a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI director Wray calling for \"a bipartisan Gang of Eight briefing that involves congressional leadership from both chambers\".[115] In August 2018, Pelosi called for Duncan D. Hunter's resignation after his indictment on charges of misusing at least $250,000 in campaign funds, saying the charges were \"evidence of the rampant culture of corruption among Republicans in Washington today\".[116] In April 2018, Peter Beinart wrote in The Atlantic that Pelosi had been \"the most effective congressional leader of modern times—and, not coincidentally, the most vilified.\"[90] In the 2018 elections, the Democrats recaptured a House majority, gaining 41 seats. This was the party's largest gain in the House since the 1974 post-Watergate elections.[117][118] On November 28, House Democrats nominated Pelosi to once again serve as speaker.[119] She was reelected to the speakership at the start of the 116th Congress on January 3, 2019. Pelosi \"clinched the speakership after weeks of whittling down opposition from some fellow Democrats seeking a new generation of leadership. The deal to win over holdouts put an expiration date on her tenure: she promised not to stay more than four years in the job\". 220 House Democrats voted for Pelosi as Speaker and 15 for someone else or no one.[120] On February 4, 2020, at the conclusion of Trump's State of the Union address, Pelosi tore up her official copy of it.[121] Her stated reason for doing so was \"because it was a courteous thing to do considering the alternatives. It was a such a dirty speech\".[122] Trump and other Republicans criticized her for this.[123][124] In December 2021, Pelosi announced her candidacy for reelection to the House in 2022.[125] In 2018, and again in 2020, she had agreed not to stay on as speaker beyond January 2023, but otherwise avoided questions about her future.[126] In 2022, Pelosi was reelected, but the Democratic Party lost the House majority.[127] Ten days later, she announced that she would not seek a Democratic leadership post in the next Congress.[128][129] At the start of the 116th Congress, Pelosi opposed Trump's attempts to use the 2018–2019 federal government shutdown (which she called a \"hostage-taking\" of civil servants) as leverage to build a substantial wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.[130] She declined to allow Trump to give the State of the Union Address in the House chamber while the shutdown was ongoing.[131][132] After several polls showed Trump's popularity sharply falling due to the shutdown, on January 25, 2019, Trump signed a stopgap bill to reopen the government without any concessions regarding a border wall for three weeks to allow negotiations on an appropriations bill. But he reiterated his demand for border wall funding and said he would shut the government down again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.[133] On February 15, Trump declared a national emergency in order to bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan bill that had passed the House and Senate the day before.[134] On September 29, 2019, Pelosi announced the launch of an impeachment inquiry against Trump.[135] On December 5, 2019, after the inquiry had taken place, Pelosi authorized the Judiciary Committee to begin drafting articles of impeachment.[136] After hearings were held,[137] two articles of impeachment were announced on December 10.[138] The House of Representatives approved both articles on December 18, thereby formally impeaching Trump.[139] The day after the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Pelosi demanded that Trump either resign or be removed from office through the clauses of section four the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, threatening impeachment if this did not happen.[140] On January 10, she issued a 24-hour ultimatum to Vice President Mike Pence, that if he did not invoke the 25th amendment, she would proceed with legislation to impeach Trump.[141] On January 13, the House voted to impeach Trump a second time.[142] Pelosi facilitated passage of the CARES Act.[143] She attracted controversy when footage emerged in early September 2020 of her visiting a hair salon in San Francisco. This was contrary to regulations enforced at that time preventing service indoors.[144] Criticized for hypocrisy by Trump and the owners of the salon, Pelosi described the situation as \"clearly a setup\". Her stylist and other Democrats defended her.[145] Pelosi played a key role in the 2021 passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The New York Times credited the legislation's passage to Pelosi's decision to adopt a Congressional Black Caucus proposal to pair together the final vote on the bill with a good-faith vote on the rules governing debate on a subsequent social safety net bill. The Times noted that Pelosi did not make herself the public face of this, instead having Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty persuade House Democratic Caucus members to accept the proposal. The New York Times wrote, \"in effect, the speaker had harnessed one faction of her unruly Democrats to win over two others.\"[146] Chris Cillizza of CNN wrote: Consider the challenge Pelosi faced with this infrastructure bill—starting with the fact that she had only a three-seat majority, meaning that even a handful of renegade Democrats could scuttle the entire thing. Then add in the total lack of trust not only between House liberals and Senate moderates but also the decided lack of trust between House liberals and House moderates. And sprinkle in the fact that the entire bill had been at an impasse for months as both sides of the party wrangled for leverage on the broader $1.75 trillion social safety net legislation.[146] During the 117th Congress, the CHIPS and Science Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 (PACT Act) were passed.[147] As with her first tenure, experts gave Pelosi's second tenure as speaker high marks, with many opining that during her two tenures as speaker she had been among the most effective individuals to hold the position. In June 2019, Brent Budowsky opined in The Hill that Pelosi had been \"the most important, consequential and effective Speaker since Tip O'Neill\" as well as \"one of the greatest Speakers who ever served.\"[148] In January 2020, on the eve of Trump's first impeachment trial before the U.S. Senate, Washington Post political writer Paul Kane called Pelosi the most powerful House speaker in at least 25 years, noting that some historians were comparing her influence to that of former speaker Sam Rayburn.[149] In 2021, former Republican speaker John Boehner opined that Pelosi had been the most powerful House speaker in U.S. history.[150] In November 2022, Chris Cillizza wrote that Pelosi was \"the most effective speaker ever.\"[146] Johnathan Bernstein opined for The Washington Post and Bloomberg News that Pelosi was \"the greatest speaker in history.\"[151] Jackie Calmes of the Los Angeles Times shared the same opinion.[152] Sarah Ferris of Politico called Pelosi \"a legislative giant regarded as one of the most powerful speakers in modern U.S. history.\"[153] Historian Lindsay M. Chervinsky wrote for NBC News that Pelosi was \"one of the most effective speakers in history\" and had been so while facing \"the double standards that apply to powerful women.\"[147] John Haduk wrote for the Brookings Institution: Whether you agree with her politics or not, it is undeniable that [Pelosi] has been a remarkably effective House leader. That success has come as both House Minority Leader and as Speaker of the House. As Speaker, she has worked with a majority as large as 81 seats in November and December 2009 (258–177) and one as small as 6 seats from April to May 2021 (218–212).[154] A number of progressive and liberal-leaning outlets published strong assessments of Pelosi's tenure. Harold Meyerson opined that Pelosi had been the greatest speaker in U.S. history in an article in The American Prospect.[155] Amanda Marcotte of Salon.com opined that Pelosi was the greatest speaker of all time, calling her \"both the most effective and most progressive House speaker of all time.\" Marcotte added that Pelosi had been effective \"both in terms of managing an unruly caucus and being able to push her party in more progressive directions.\"[156] On November 29, 2022, the Steering and Policy Committee of the House Democratic Caucus honorarily named Pelosi \"speaker emerita\" in the upcoming 118th U.S. Congress.[157][158] Her second speakership, and her participation in the House Democratic Party leadership, concluded on January 3, 2023, at the end of the 117th Congress.[159] Amid concerns about President Biden's reelection prospects in the 2024 presidential election, Pelosi played a key role in the effort to pressure him to withdraw his candidacy before the Democratic National Convention.[160] She personally warned Biden that she feared his faltering candidacy might not only result in Trump's victory but also have a coattail effect that could bring Democrats defeat in the coinciding House and Senate elections and give Republicans a government trifecta. When Democratic members of Congress privately sought her guidance on how to handle their concerns, Pelosi advised them \"speak their conscience\". On the July 10 edition of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Pelosi said the party encouraged Biden to make the decision because time was running out.[161] Later that day, Pelosi's office stated: \"Speaker Pelosi fully supports whatever President Biden decides to do. We must turn our attention to why this race is so important: Donald Trump would be a disaster for our country and our democracy.\"[162] The growing number of members of Congress calling for Biden to withdraw heightened the pressure on him.[163][164][165] Biden withdrew his candidacy on July 21 and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's presidential nominee.[166] Before Biden withdrew, Pelosi had expressed to other California congressional Democrats her belief that the possible selection of a new nominee should be done competitively through an \"open process\".[167] She briefly held off from endorsing Harris's candidacy[168] before doing so the next day.[169] Although Harris did not win any primary elections, Pelosi insisted that the process that led to Harris's nomination was a \"primary\". She told Semafor on September 18 that Harris earned her nomination because \"We had an open primary, and she won it. Nobody else got in the race.\"[170][171] After Harris lost to Trump, Pelosi blamed Biden's late exit from the race and the lack of an open Democratic primary.[172] In the House, Pelosi served on the Appropriations and Intelligence Committees and was the ranking member on the latter until her election as minority leader.[173] She is a member of the House Baltic Caucus and the Congressional Equality Caucus.[174][175] Early in her political career, Pelosi established herself as a prominent fundraiser in the party.[30] She was one of the party's most prolific fundraisers, transferring significant funds to committees for other candidates.[176][177] During the 2000 and 2002 election cycles, compared to other members of Congress, she contributed the most money to other congressional campaigns.[178] In 2006, Pelosi was the Democratic Party's third-largest fundraiser, behind former first couple Bill and Hillary Clinton.[44] From 2003 to 2014, Pelosi raised more than $400 million in campaign funds.[177] Pelosi was a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which she left in 2003 after being elected House minority leader.[179] She is still widely considered a liberal.[180][181] In 2001, she voted in favor of the USA Patriot Act, but voted against reauthorization of certain provisions in 2005.[182] She voted against a Constitutional amendment banning flag-burning.[183] Pelosi voted against the Secure Fence Act of 2006.[184] In June 2018, Pelosi visited a federal facility used to detain migrant children separated from their parents and subsequently called for the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.[185] In July, Pelosi characterized the compromise immigration bill by the Republicans as a \"deal with the devil\" and said she had not had conversations with House Speaker Ryan about a legislative solution to the separation of families at the southern border.[186] In April 2021, after southern border crossings peaked, House Republicans criticized Pelosi for saying that immigration under the Biden administration was \"on a good path\". U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that nearly 19,000 unaccompanied minors arrived in March.[187] Pelosi has long supported LGBT rights. In 1996, she voted against the Defense of Marriage Act,[188] and in 2004 and 2006, she voted against the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, which would amend the United States Constitution to define marriage federally as being between one man and one woman, thereby overriding states' individual rights to legalize same-sex marriage.[189][190][191] When the Supreme Court of California overturned the state's ban on marriage between same-sex couples in 2008, Pelosi released a statement welcoming the \"historic decision\". She also indirectly voiced her opposition to California Proposition 8, a successful 2008 state ballot initiative which defined marriage in California as a union between one man and one woman.[192] In 2012, Pelosi said her position on LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage grows from and reflects her Catholic faith; it also places her at odds with Catholic doctrine, which defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. She said: \"My religion compels me—and I love it for it—to be against discrimination of any kind in our country, and I consider [the ban on gay marriage] a form of discrimination. I think it's unconstitutional on top of that.\"[193] Pelosi supports the Equality Act, a bill that would expand the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2019, she spoke in Congress in favor of the bill and called for ending discrimination against LGBT people. Pelosi also opposed Trump's transgender military ban.[194] Pelosi supports reform in marijuana laws, although NORML's deputy director Paul Armentano said she and other members of Congress had not done anything to change the laws.[195] She also supports use of medical marijuana.[196] As of 2014, Pelosi supported the Bush/Obama NSA surveillance program PRISM.[197] Pelosi repeatedly criticized the fact that the United States Capitol exhibited artworks depicting people who in various capacities supported the Confederacy in the American Civil War.[198][199][200] In 2017, this included at least 10 statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection, either in the National Statuary Hall itself or some less prominent Capitol rooms.[199] Almost all the statues in that collection were selected and donated by the states (two from each state) and could only be exchanged for others by an ordered process involving the consent of the states' legislatures and governors, but the speaker of the House directly could influence their precise placement. During her first tenure as speaker, Pelosi moved the statue of Robert E. Lee from the National Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol to the Capitol crypt.[198] In August 2017, she supported an initiative by Senator Cory Booker to have Confederate monuments and memorials removed from the Capitol Building by means of legislation.[199] In June 2020, following the nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd, Pelosi pushed for the removal of all statues of Confederates from the Capitol. On June 18, Pelosi also ordered that four paintings of former Confederates in the Capitol Speaker's Gallery be taken down.[200] \"We didn't know about this until we were taking inventory of the statues and the curator told us that there were four paintings of Speakers in the Capitol of the United States, four Speakers who had served in the Confederacy\", Pelosi told reporters.[200] In 2002, while Pelosi was the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, she was briefed on the ongoing use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\", including waterboarding, authorized for a captured terrorist, Abu Zubaydah.[201][202][203] After the briefing, Pelosi said she \"was assured by lawyers with the CIA and the Department of Justice that the methods were legal\".[204] Two unnamed former Bush administration officials say the briefing was detailed and graphic, and at the time she did not raise substantial objections.[205] One unnamed U.S. official present during the early briefings said, \"In fairness, the environment was different then because we were closer to September 11 and people were still in a panic. But there was no objecting, no hand-wringing. The attitude was, 'We don't care what you do to those guys as long as you get the information you need to protect the American people.'\"[206] These techniques later became controversial, and in 2007 Pelosi's office said she had protested their use at the time, and she concurred with objections raised by Democratic colleague Jane Harman in a letter to the CIA in early 2003.[207] Subsequently, several leading Democratic lawmakers in the House signed a letter on June 26, 2009, alleging CIA Director Leon Panetta had asserted that the CIA misled Congress for a \"number of years\" spanning back to 2001, casting clouds on the controversy.[208] The letter, lawmakers and the CIA all providing no details, and the circumstances surrounding the allegations, make it hard to assess the claims and counterclaims of both sides.[209] Officials in Congress say her ability to challenge the practices may have been hampered by strict rules of secrecy that prohibited her from taking notes or consulting legal experts or members of her own staffs.[210] In an April 2009 press conference, Pelosi said: \"In that or any other briefing ... we were not, and I repeat, were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation techniques were used. What they did tell us is that they had some legislative counsel—the Office of Legislative Counsel opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And they further [...] the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time.\"[201][211] Pelosi voted against the 1995 Balanced Budget Proposed Constitutional Amendment, which passed the House by a 300–132 vote, but fell two votes short of the 2/3 supermajority required in the Senate (with 65 senators voting in favor).[212] As Speaker of the House, she spearheaded the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 as part of the 100-Hour Plan. The act raises the minimum wage in the United States and the territories of the Northern Marianas Islands and American Samoa. American Samoa was initially absent from the act, but it was included as part of HR 2206. One Republican congressman who voted against the initial bill accused Pelosi of unethically benefiting Del Monte Foods (headquartered in her district) by excluding the territory, where Del Monte's StarKist Tuna brand is a major employer.[213] Pelosi co-sponsored legislation that omitted American Samoa from a raise in the minimum wage as early as 1999, before Del Monte's acquisition of StarKist Tuna in 2002.[214] Pelosi opposed the welfare reform President Bush proposed as well as reforms proposed and passed under President Clinton.[215] She also opposed the tax reform signed by Trump in December 2017, calling it \"probably one of the worst bills in the history of the United States of America ... It robs from the future [and] it rewards the rich ... and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle-class families in our country.\"[216] She said \"this is Armageddon\" and argued that the tax bill increased the debt in a way that would adversely impact social insurance spending.[217] In January 2018, shortly after the tax bill passed, a reporter asked Pelosi to respond to statements by companies crediting the tax cuts with allowing them to raise wages and give bonuses. She said that, given the benefits corporations received from the tax bill, the benefits workers got were \"crumbs\".[218][219] Most companies that awarded bonuses gave out payments of hundreds of dollars, while some gave bonuses significantly over $1,000.[220] In November 2018, Pelosi said she had spoken with Trump about infrastructure development. Though he \"really didn't come through with it in his first two years in office\" while it was a topic during his campaign, the subject had not been a partisan matter in Congress. She mentioned potential bipartisan legislative initiatives that would \"create good paying jobs and will also generate other economic growth in their regions\".[221] On May 1, 2019, Pelosi and Schumer met with Trump about infrastructure funding.[222] In late May, a meeting to discuss an impending $2 trillion infrastructure plan was cut short when Trump abruptly left after only a few minutes.[223] In August 2018, after Trump signed an emergency declaration for federal aid in combating the Carr Fire in Northern California, Pelosi called the move \"an important first step\" but requested that Trump accede to California Governor Jerry Brown's request for further aid to other hard-hit areas in California. She called on the Trump administration to take \"real, urgent action to combat the threat of the climate crisis, which is making the wildfire season longer, more expensive and more destructive\".[224] In 1999, Pelosi voted against displaying the Ten Commandments in public buildings, including schools.[225] She voted for the No Child Left Behind Act,[226] which instituted testing to track students' progress and authorized an increase in overall education spending.[227][228] In 2019, Pelosi said climate change was \"the existential threat of our time\" and called for action to curb it.[229] She has supported the development of new technologies to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and remediate the adverse environmental effects of burning fossil fuels.[230] Pelosi has widely supported conservation programs and energy research appropriations. She has also voted to remove an amendment that would allow for oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[231][232] Pelosi has blocked efforts to revive offshore oil drilling in protected areas, reasoning that offshore drilling could lead to an increase in dependence on fossil fuels.[233] Pelosi was instrumental in passing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.[234] She was a key figure in convincing Obama to continue pushing for health-care reform after the election of Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown in a January special election—a defeat seen as potentially fatal to Democratic reform efforts.[81] After delivering 219 votes in the House for Obama's health-care package, Pelosi was both praised and heckled as she made her way to Capitol Hill.[235][83] Pelosi has voted to increase Medicare and Medicaid benefits.[236] She does not endorse Senator Bernie Sanders's bill for single-payer healthcare.[237][238] On March 10, 2017, Pelosi said Democrats would continue battling Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but would also be willing to form a compromise measure if Republicans reached out for support. She indicated her support for the Republican plan to expand Health Savings Accounts and said the question of Republicans' accepting an expansion of Medicaid was important.[239] In September, Pelosi sent a letter to Democrats praising Senator John McCain for announcing his opposition to the latest Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and called on lawmakers and advocacy groups alike to pressure Republicans in the health-care discussion. She said Democrats would be unified in putting \"a stake in the heart of this monstrous bill\".[240] In July 2018, during a speech at Independence First, Pelosi said Democrats' goal \"has always been to expand coverage and to do so in a way that improves benefits ... and we have to address the affordability issue that is so undermined by the Republicans.\"[241] In November 2018, after Democrats gained a majority in the House in the midterm elections, she said, \"I'm staying as Speaker to protect the Affordable Care Act. That's my main issue, because I think that's, again, about the health and financial health of the America's families, and if Hillary had won, I could go home.\" She added that Republicans had misrepresented their earlier position of opposition to covering people with preexisting conditions during the election cycle and called on them to join Democrats in \"removing all doubt that the preexisting medical condition is the law—the benefit—is the law of the land\".[242] Pelosi voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 and earlier attempts at similar bans, and voted against the criminalization of certain situations where a minor is transported across state lines for an abortion (HR 748, passed).[243] She has voted in favor of lifting the ban on privately funded abortions at overseas U.S. military facilities (HA 209, rejected); in favor of an amendment that would repeal a provision forbidding servicewomen and dependents from getting an abortion in overseas military hospitals (HA 722, rejected); and in favor of stripping the prohibition of funding for organizations working overseas that use their own funds to provide abortion services, or engage in advocacy related to abortion services (HA 997, rejected). She also voted in favor of the 1998 Abortion Funding Amendment, which would have allowed the use of district funds to promote abortion-related activities, but would have prohibited the use of federal funds.[243] In 2008, she was rebuked by Archbishop Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C., for being \"incorrect\" in comments she made to Tom Brokaw on Meet the Press concerning Church teaching on the subjects of abortion of when a human life begins. The archbishop's statement quoted Pelosi as saying the church has not been able to define when life begins. During the interview she said, \"over the history of the church, this [what constitutes the moment of conception] is an issue of controversy.\"[244] In February 2009, Pelosi met with her bishop, Archbishop George Hugh Niederauer of San Francisco, and with Pope Benedict XVI regarding the controversy. Pelosi opposed the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, calling it \"cruel\", \"outrageous\" and \"heart-wrenching\".[245] In a January 25, 2009, interview with George Stephanopoulos for ABC News, Pelosi said that one of the reasons she supported family planning services was that they would \"reduce costs to states and to the federal government.\"[246] Pelosi stands in favor of increased background checks for potential gun owners, as well as the banning of assault weapons. In February 2013, she called for the \"Boldest possible move\" on gun control, similar to a stance made just weeks earlier by former Representative, mass shooting victim, and fellow gun control advocate Gabby Giffords.[247] In 2012, she was given a 0% rating by Gun Owners of America and a 7% rating from the National Rifle Association of America for her stances on gun control.[248] In February 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Pelosi said Republicans' \"cowering\" to the gun lobby was \"an assault on our whole country\" and that the victims were \"paying the price for our inaction\".[249] She requested House Speaker Ryan and Republicans take action via consideration of legislation expanding background checks or authorizing researchers to use federal dollars to examine public health as it relates to gun violence. Pelosi also advocated for the creation of a special committee on gun violence and said Republicans had previously created committees to investigate Planned Parenthood and the 2012 Benghazi attack.[249] In November 2018, after the Thousand Oaks shooting, Pelosi released a statement saying Americans \"deserve real action to end the daily epidemic of gun violence that is stealing the lives of our children on campuses, in places of worship and on our streets\" and pledged that gun control would be a priority for House Democrats in the 116th United States Congress.[250] With regard to Representative Charles Rangel's (D-NY) plan to introduce legislation that would reinstate the draft, Pelosi said she did not support it.[251] In March 2009, conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch had obtained emails sent by Pelosi's staff requesting the United States Air Force (USAF) to provide specific aircraft—a Boeing 757—for Pelosi to use for taxpayer-funded travel.[252] Pelosi responded that the policy was initiated by President Bush due to post-9/11 security concerns (Pelosi was third in line for presidential succession), and was initially provided for the previous Speaker Dennis Hastert. The Sergeant at Arms requested—for security reasons—that the plane provided be capable of non-stop flight, requiring a larger aircraft. The Pentagon said \"no one has rendered judgment\" that Pelosi's use of aircraft \"is excessive\".[253] During the first Trump administration, Pelosi voted in line with the president's stated position 17.6% of the time.[254] During a news conference on June 9, 2017, after a reporter asked her about tweets by President Donald Trump lambasting former FBI director James Comey following Comey's testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said no one at the White House seemed courageous enough to tell Trump his tweets were beneath the dignity of the presidency and that she was worried about his fitness for office.[255] In November, when asked about Democrats beginning the impeachment process against Trump in the event they won a majority of seats in the 2018 elections, Pelosi said it would not be one of their legislative priorities but that the option could be considered if credible evidence appeared during the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.[256] In January 2018, Pelosi referred to Trump's 2018 State of the Union Address as a performance without serious policy ideas the parties could collaborate on. She questioned Trump's refusal to implement Russian sanctions after more than 500 members of Congress voted to approve them.[257] In February, after Trump blocked the release of a Democratic memo by the Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said the act was \"a stunningly brazen attempt to cover up the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal from the American people\" and \"part of a dangerous and desperate pattern of cover-up on the part of the president who has shown he had something to hide.\"[258] In March, Pelosi said she was \"more concerned about the president's policies which undermine the financial security of America's working families\" than the Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal. Pelosi did note the scandal as having highlighted a double standard of Republicans on issues of family values and expectations of presidential behavior, saying the party would be very involved if the event was happening to a Democrat.[259] In April, following Scooter Libby being pardoned by Trump, Pelosi released a statement saying the pardon \"sends a troubling signal to the president's allies that obstructing justice will be rewarded and that the idea of those who lie under oath being granted a pardon \"poses a threat to the integrity of the special counsel investigation, and to our democracy\".[260] On August 15, after Trump revoked the security clearance of former CIA director John Brennan, Pelosi said the move was \"a stunning abuse of power [and] a pathetic attempt to silence critics\", and an attempt by Trump to distract attention from other issues of his administration.[261] Pelosi and Charles E. Schumer met with Trump and Pence in December 2018 to discuss changes to be made when the new Democratic representatives takes office in 2019.[262] In January 2019 she supported President Trump in his decision to back the leader of the opposition Juan Guaidó during Venezuelan protests and constitutional crisis.[263] The Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in the November 2018 elections, and Pelosi took office as Speaker. Multiple House committees launched investigations into various actions by Trump and some of his cabinet members and requested or subpoenaed documents and information from the White House and the administration.[264] In April 2019, Trump vowed to defy \"all\" subpoenas from the House and to refuse to allow current or former administration officials to testify before House committees.[265] Pelosi initially resisted efforts by some fellow House Democrats to pursue Trump's impeachment,[266][267] but in September 2019, following revelations of the Trump–Ukraine scandal, announced the beginning of a formal House impeachment inquiry, saying \"The actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the Constitution\" and that Trump \"must be held accountable—no one is above the law.\"[268] Privately, Pelosi expressed concern that focusing on impeachment would imperil the Democrats' House majority; she preferred to focus on other legislation.[269] In May 2019, the White House intervened to halt former White House Counsel Don McGahn from complying with a subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee, instructing the committee to redirect its records requests to the White House. Pelosi, who had previously urged \"Democrats to focus on fact-finding rather than the prospect of any impeachment\",[270][271] described Trump's interference regarding McGahn's records as an obstruction of justice, saying that \"Trump is goading us to impeach him.\"[272][273] Later that month, as the Trump administration continued to ignore subpoenas, refuse to release documents, and encourage or order current and former officials not to testify in Congress, Pelosi declared: \"we believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.\"[274] Later that day, after learning of Pelosi's comments, Trump walked away from a scheduled White House meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, in which a $2 trillion infrastructure plan was supposed to be discussed. Trump told Pelosi and Schumer he could not work with them until they stopped investigating him. Later in the day, Pelosi accused Trump of \"obstructing justice\" and again said he \"is engaged in a cover-up\".[275] On June 5, 2019, during a meeting with senior Democrats about whether the House should launch impeachment proceeding against Trump, Pelosi said, \"I don't want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.\" According to multiple sources, rather than impeachment, she wanted to see Trump lose to a Democrat in the 2020 election, following which he could be prosecuted.[276] Eventually, under pressure from an alliance of left-wing Representatives led by Chair of the House Judiciary Committee Jerry Nadler, Pelosi backed an impeachment inquiry.[269] The House impeachment inquiry focused on efforts by Trump and Trump administration officials to pressure the government of Ukraine to smear former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival of Trump's, while withholding $400 million in U.S. military aid, and a White House visit, from Ukraine; the inquiry also examined Trump's request in a July 2019 phone call to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to \"do us a favor\" and investigate Biden.[277] On December 18, 2019, the House voted nearly along party lines to impeach Trump for abuse of power (230–197) and obstruction of Congress (229–198), making him the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. Pelosi said, when opening debate on the articles of impeachment, \"If we do not act now, we would be derelict in our duty. It is tragic that the president's reckless actions make impeachment necessary. He gave us no choice.\"[277] Pelosi initially did not transmit the articles of impeachment to the Republican-controlled Senate for trial, seeking to negotiate an agreement with Senate Majority Mitch McConnell for the Senate to hear witness testimony and other additional evidence as part of a bid for a \"full and fair\" trial. McConnell rejected these efforts, and the House transmitted the articles to the Senate on January 15, 2020, with Pelosi naming seven Democratic Representatives, led by Representative Adam Schiff, as the House managers to argue the impeachment case against Trump in the Senate.[278][279] As expected, the Senate ultimately acquitted Trump in a nearly-party line vote in which every Democrat voted for conviction and all but one Republican, Senator Mitt Romney, voting for acquittal.[280] Ahead of the Senate vote Pelosi said that, irrespective of the outcome, the president \"has been impeached forever\", that the impeachment process had successfully \"pulled back a veil of behavior totally unacceptable to our founders, and that the public will see this with a clearer eye, an unblurred eye.\"[281] Following the Senate vote, Pelosi criticized Trump and Senate Republicans, saying their actions had \"normalized lawlessness and rejected the system of checks and balances\".[282][283] Following the Senate vote, Trump claimed vindication and criticized Democrats, the FBI, and Pelosi. In a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump referred to Pelosi as \"a horrible person\", and questioned her religious faith; Pelosi said these remarks were \"particularly without class\".[284] Before Trump's February 4, 2020 State of the Union Address, the day before the Senate impeachment vote, Trump and Pelosi exchanged mutual snubs.[285][286] Trump refused to shake Pelosi's outstretched hand, and Pelosi tore up her copy of Trump's speech.[285][286] Her stated reason for doing so was \"because it was a courteous thing to do considering the alternatives. It was a such a dirty speech.\"[287] Pelosi also said Trump's speech \"had no contact with reality whatsoever\"[288] and suggested the president appeared \"a little sedated\" during the address.[284] Pelosi's action was criticized by Trump and others.[289][290] Days after the Senate impeachment vote, Trump fired two officials who had testified against him during the impeachment inquiry: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official. Pelosi called the firing of Vindman a \"shameful\" and \"clear and brazen act of retaliation that showcases the President's fear of the truth\", saying that \"History will remember Lieutenant Colonel Vindman as an American hero.\"[291] On October 8, 2020, Pelosi announced that legislation was being introduced in the House of Representatives to advance the creation of a commission to allow the use of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution to intervene and remove Trump from executive duties.[292] As of October 2022, Pelosi had voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 100% of the time.[293] After the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Pelosi sought to take a harsher position toward China than President George H.W. Bush.[294]: 210 With the support of Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, she took a lead role for the Democrats in criticizing Bush's China policy.[294]: 210 Pelosi's view was that Congress should oppose the annual presidential waiver for China under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, an amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 that required the president to inform Congress if he intended to waive the Act to have a most favored nation trading relationship with a non-market economy.[294]: 211 Pelosi said that if China's economy suffered, Chinese people would be unhappy with their government and this would serve to advance democracy in China.[294]: 223 As part of a Congressional delegation, Pelosi unfurled a banner in the square in 1991, provoking a confrontation with Chinese police.[295] She advocated for Chinese political prisoners and dissidents to be able to come to the U.S.[295] In 1999, ahead of Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the U.S. for talks over World Trade Organization admission for China, Pelosi called on President Clinton and Vice President Gore to ask Zhu to recognize the 1989 protests as a pro-democracy effort.[296] In 2008, after a meeting with the Dalai Lama and officials in the Tibetan government-in-exile, Pelosi criticized the People's Republic of China for its handling of the unrest in Tibet; addressing a crowd of thousands of Tibetans in Dharamsala, India, Pelosi called on \"freedom-loving people\" worldwide to denounce China for its human rights abuses in Tibet.[297] The same year, Pelosi commended the European Parliament for its \"bold decision\" to award the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Chinese dissident and human rights activist Hu Jia, and called upon the Chinese government \"to immediately and unconditionally release Hu Jia from prison and to respect the fundamental freedoms of all the people in China.\"[298] In 2010, Pelosi backed a bill naming China a currency manipulator, which would appease exporters.[299] Pelosi criticized the imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists in August 2017 for their roles in a protest at the Civic Square in front of the Central Government Complex in Hong Kong. She called the ruling an injustice that should \"shock the conscience of the world\".[300] Before the Trump administration took concrete measures against China in late March 2018, Pelosi and other Democratic leaders pressed Trump to focus more on China and impose real punishments, such as fulfilling his own campaign commitments to name China a currency manipulator and stop China from pressuring U.S. tech companies into giving up intellectual property rights. Pelosi urged Trump to take a strong stand against unfair market barriers in China.[301][302][303][304] In September 2019, Pelosi met with Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong on Capitol Hill; Chinese media responded by accusing Pelosi of \"backing and encouraging radical activists\".[305] On the eve of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Pelosi advised American athletes competing: \"I would say to our athletes, 'You're there to compete. Do not risk incurring the anger of the Chinese government, because they are ruthless'\".[306] On August 2, 2022, Pelosi became the highest-ranking U.S. government official to visit Taiwan in 25 years.[307][308][309] President Joe Biden discouraged but did not prevent Pelosi from traveling to Taiwan, and the White House later affirmed her right to visit.[310][311][312] Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and 25 Senate Republicans backed Pelosi's decision to visit,[313] issuing a joint statement that also supported the trip.[314] Her trip triggered a new round of hostilities in the already tense relationship between the U.S. and China.[315] During and after her visit, China undertook a series of retaliatory measures against Taiwan and the United States. Pelosi said her visit was a sign of the U.S. Congress's commitment to Taiwan.[315] During her visit, she met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen and called Taiwan one of the \"freest societies in the world\".[316] Pelosi publicly scolded Colombian president Álvaro Uribe during Uribe's May 2007 state visit to America. Pelosi met with Uribe and later released a statement that she and other members of Congress had \"expressed growing concerns about the serious allegations\" of links between paramilitary groups and Colombian government officials.[317] Pelosi also came out against the Colombian free-trade agreement.[318] In 2008, Pelosi said: \"For years, I have opposed the embargo on Cuba. I don't think it's been successful, and I think we have to remove the travel bans and have more exchanges—people to people exchanges with Cuba.\"[319] In 2015, Pelosi supported President Obama's Cuban Thaw, a rapprochement between the U.S. and Castro's regime in Cuba, and visited Havana for meetings with high-level officials.[320] Pelosi opposed U.S. intervention in the 1991 Gulf War.[215][321] In an interview on February 15, 2007, Pelosi said that Bush consistently said he supports a diplomatic resolution to differences with Iran \"and I take him at his word\". At the same time, she said, \"I do believe that Congress should assert itself, though, and make it very clear that there is no previous authority for the president, any president, to go into Iran\".[322] On January 12, 2007, Congressman Walter B. Jones of North Carolina introduced a resolution[323] requiring that—absent a national emergency created by an attack, or a demonstrably imminent attack, by Iran upon the United States or its armed forces—the president must consult with Congress and receive specific authorization prior to initiating any use of military force against Iran.[324] This resolution was removed from a military spending bill for the war in Iraq by Pelosi on March 13, 2007. In July 2015, Pelosi said she was convinced Obama would have enough votes to secure the Iran nuclear deal, crediting the president with having made a \"very strong and forceful presentation of his case supporting the nuclear agreement with Iran\" and called the deal \"a diplomatic masterpiece\".[325] In 2016, Pelosi argued against two bills that if enacted would block Iran's access to the dollar and impose sanctions for its ballistic missile program: \"Regardless of whether you supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), we all agree that Iran must not possess a nuclear weapon. At this time, the JCPOA is the best way to achieve this critical goal.\"[326] In May 2018, after Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, Pelosi said the decision was an abdication of American leadership and \"particularly senseless, disturbing & dangerous\".[327] In 2002, Pelosi opposed the Iraq Resolution authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq, which passed the House on a 296–133 vote.[31][32] Pelosi said that \"unilateral use of force without first exhausting every diplomatic remedy and other remedies and making a case to the American people will be harmful to our war on terrorism.\"[33] In explaining her opposition to the resolution, Pelosi said CIA Director George Tenet had told Congress the likelihood of Saddam Hussein's launching an attack on the U.S. using weapons of mass destruction was low, saying: \"This is about the Constitution It is about this Congress asserting its right to declare war when we are fully aware what the challenges are to us. It is about respecting the United Nations and a multilateral approach, which is safer for our troops.\"[32] Although Pelosi voted against the Iraq War, anti-war activists in San Francisco protested against her voting to continue funding the war. UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain said Pelosi had to balance the demands of her anti-war constituency against the moderate views of Democrats in tight races around the country in her role as minority leader.[328] Pelosi has never faced a serious challenger to her left in her district.[329] Pelosi has reaffirmed that \"America and Israel share an unbreakable bond: in peace and war; and in prosperity and in hardship\".[330] She has emphasized that \"a strong relationship between the United States and Israel has long been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. America's commitment to the safety and security of the State of Israel is unwavering ... [h]owever, the war in Iraq has made both America and Israel less safe.\" Pelosi's voting record shows consistent support for Israel. Pelosi voted in favor of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, which urged the federal government to relocate the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.[331] Before the 2006 elections in the Palestinian Authority, she voted for a Congressional initiative that disapproved of participation in the elections by Hamas and other organizations the legislation defined as terrorist. She agrees with the current U.S. stance in support of land-for-peace. She has applauded Israeli \"hopeful signs\" of offering land while criticizing Palestinian \"threats\" of not demonstrating peace in turn. Pelosi has said, \"If the Palestinians agree to coordinate with Israel on the evacuation, establish the rule of law, and demonstrate a capacity to govern, the world may be convinced that finally there is a real partner for peace\".[330] During the 2006 Lebanon War, Pelosi voted in favor of Resolution 921: \"... seizure of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah terrorists was an unprovoked attack and Israel has the right, and indeed the obligation, to respond.\" She argues that organizations and political bodies in the Mideast like Hamas and Hezbollah \"have a greater interest in maintaining a state of hostility with Israel than in improving the lives of the people they claim to represent\". Pelosi asserts that civilians on both sides of the border \"have been put at risk by the aggression of Hamas and Hezbollah\" in part for their use of \"civilians as shields by concealing weapons in civilian areas\".[332] In September 2008, Pelosi hosted a reception in Washington with Israeli Speaker of the Knesset Dalia Itzik, along with 20 members of Congress, where they toasted the \"strong friendship\" between Israel and the United States. During the ceremony, Pelosi held up replica dog tags of the three Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah and Hamas in 2006 and said she keeps them as a \"symbol of the sacrifices made, sacrifices far too great by the people of the state of Israel\".[333] Pelosi supported Israel in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[334] In March 2018 Pelosi said, \"There is no greater political accomplishment in the 20th Century than the establishment of the State of Israel.\"[335] Pelosi condemned Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota for posting controversial tweets related to Jews and Israel.[336] In March 2019, she said, \"Israel and America are connected now and forever. We will never allow anyone to make Israel a wedge issue.\"[337] In January 2017, Pelosi voted against a House resolution that would condemn the UN Security Council Resolution 2334. This UN Security Council Resolution called Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank a \"flagrant violation\" of international law and a major obstacle to peace.[338][339] She condemned the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement targeting Israel.[340] Pelosi has voiced heavy criticism over Israel's plan to annex parts of the West Bank and the Jordan Valley. She said Israeli annexation would undermine U.S. national security interests.[341] Pelosi said that Democrats are taking \"a great pride\" in Barack Obama's Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that Israel signed with the Obama administration in 2016, for a guarantee of $38 billion in defense assistance over a decade.[341] On January 28, 2024, Pelosi suggested that some pro-Palestinian protesters calling for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war could be connected to Russia and called on the FBI to investigate the possible connection.[342] Nancy Pelosi is one of the few members of Congress to have traveled to North Korea. She has expressed concern about the danger of nuclear proliferation from the North Korean regime, and the ongoing problems of hunger and oppression imposed by that country's leadership.[343][344] In August 2017, following Trump's warning that North Korea \"will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\" in the event of further threats to the United States, Pelosi said the comments were \"recklessly belligerent and demonstrate a grave lack of appreciation for the severity of the North Korean nuclear situation. His saber-rattling and provocative, impulsive rhetoric erode our credibility.\"[345] In November 2017, after the Pentagon sent a letter to lawmakers stating a ground invasion was the only way to destroy all North Korea's nuclear weapons without concern for having missed any, Pelosi said she was concerned about Pyongyang's selling nuclear technology to third parties and called for the United States to \"exhaust every other remedy\".[346] In June 2018, after Trump praised North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Pelosi said in a statement, \"In his haste to reach an agreement, President Trump elevated North Korea to the level of the United States while preserving the regime's status quo.\"[347] In December 2017, Pelosi wrote a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan advocating for the continued House investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election on the grounds that Americans deserved \"a comprehensive and fair investigation into Russia's attack\" and \"America's democracy and national security\" being at stake. Pelosi cited the need for Congress to \"fully investigate Russia's assault on our election systems to prevent future foreign attacks\".[348] In February 2018, after the release of a Republican report alleging surveillance abuses by the Justice Department, Pelosi accused Trump of siding with Russian president Vladimir Putin at the expense of preserving intelligence sources and methods.[349] In July, Pelosi asserted that Trump was afraid to mention the 12 indictments against people connected to the intelligence community in Russia during his meeting with Putin and questioned what intelligence the Russians had on Trump to cause his behavior.[350] She said Putin would not be welcomed by Congress even if he visited Washington as a result of his actions: \"Putin's ongoing attacks on our elections and on Western democracies and his illegal actions in Crimea and the rest of Ukraine deserve the fierce, unanimous condemnation of the international community, not a VIP ticket to our nation's capital.\" She called for House Speaker Ryan to \"make clear that there is not—and never will be—an invitation for a thug like Putin to address the United States Congress.\"[351] On multiple occasions, Pelosi said of Trump, \"With him, all roads lead to Putin,\" including with regard to the Trump-Ukraine scandal,[352] a lack of action against the alleged Russian bounty program,[353] and Trump's incitement of the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[354] Pelosi supports the Syria Accountability Act and Iran Freedom and Support Act. In a speech at the AIPAC 2005 annual conference, Pelosi said that \"for too long, leaders from both parties haven't done enough\" to put pressure on Russia and China who are providing Iran with technological information on nuclear issues and missiles. \"If evidence of participation by other nations in Iran's nuclear program is discovered, I will insist that the Administration use, rather than ignore, the evidence in determining how the U.S. deals with that nation or nations on other issues.\"[355] In April 2007, Pelosi visited Syria, where she met Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa and President Bashar Al-Assad, despite President Bush efforts to isolate Syria, because of militants crossing from Syria into Iraq, and supporting Hezbollah and Hamas.[356] During her visit, she conveyed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert message for peace, and toured in Al-Hamidiyah Souq,[357] and the Umayyad Mosque.[358] Pelosi supported the NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011.[359] She also favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[360] In January 2019, Pelosi criticized President Trump's planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. She called Trump's announcement a \"Christmas gift to Vladimir Putin\".[361] In an October 2019 letter to Democratic caucus members, Pelosi wrote that both parties were condemning President Trump's deserting the US's \"Kurdish allies in a foolish attempt to appease an authoritarian strongman\" Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey and opined that the decision \"poses a dire threat to regional security and stability, and sends a dangerous message to Iran and Russia, as well as our allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner\".[362] Later that month, she visited Jordan to discuss the Syrian situation with King Abdullah II.[363] Afterwards, she went to Afghanistan, where she met President Ashraf Ghani and chief executive officer Abdullah Abdullah, and she was also briefed by U.S. diplomats on reconciliation efforts with the Taliban.[364] In mid-October 2007, after the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi pledged to bring the measure to a vote.[365] The draft resolution prompted warnings from President Bush and fierce criticism from Turkey, with Turkey's Prime Minister saying that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.–Turkey relations.[366] After House support eroded, the measure's sponsors dropped their call for a vote, and in late October Pelosi agreed to set the matter aside.[367] The resolution was passed during Pelosi's second term as Speaker. The House voted 405 to 11 in October 2019 to confirm the resolution.[368] On April 30, 2022, Pelosi met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, to pledge U.S. support for Ukraine during the Russian invasion.[369][370] After the drone strikes on aid workers from World Central Kitchen in April 2024, Pelosi, Mark Pocan, James P. McGovern, Jan Schakowsky, and 36 other Congressional Democrats urged President Biden in an open letter to reconsider planned arms shipments to the Israeli military.[371][372] Pelosi has often been described as a polarizing figure, facing criticism from both the political right and left. Progressives have criticized her for her knowledge of waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques during the War on Terror, accusing her of not objecting strongly enough to these practices.[373] Conservatives and libertarians have taken issue with her positions on gun rights, viewing her advocacy for gun control as an infringement on Second Amendment rights.[374] They have also criticized her stance on taxation, particularly her support for higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations to fund social programs.[373] Pelosi's role in leading the House to impeach President Donald Trump twice has drawn significant criticism from Trump supporters and Republicans, who perceived the impeachments as politically motivated and divisive.[373][375] Pelosi has faced allegations of using her position for insider trading, particularly concerning stock transactions that critics claim were influenced by her legislative knowledge.[376] Critics have also depicted her as a symbol of liberal elitism, pointing to her strong opposition to populism and comments suggesting that some Americans reject Democratic policies due to their beliefs about \"guns, gays, [and] God\".[373][377] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Pelosi was accused of hypocrisy when she had her hair styled at a salon that was supposed to be closed for indoor appointments due to health restrictions, with critics alleging she used her position to receive preferential treatment.[378] Pelosi's only close race so far has been in the special election to succeed U.S. Representative Sala Burton after her death in February 1987. Pelosi defeated San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt in the Democratic primary with 36 percent of the vote to his 32 percent,[15][379] then Republican Harriet Ross by more than 2-to-1.[380] Since then, Pelosi has enjoyed overwhelming support in her political career, collecting 76 and 77 percent of the vote in California's 5th congressional district 1988 and 1990. In 1992, after the redistricting from the 1990 census, Pelosi ran in California's 8th congressional district, which now covered the San Francisco area. She has continued to post landslide victories since, dropping beneath 80 percent of the vote only three times in general elections. After redistricting from the 2010 census, Pelosi ran in California's 12th congressional district, which she represented for the next decade. Due to the 2020 United States redistricting cycle from the 2020 census, Pelosi now represents California's 11th congressional district, which covers San Francisco.[381] Nancy D'Alesandro met Paul Francis Pelosi while she was attending college.[382] They married in Baltimore at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen on September 7, 1963.[383] They then moved to New York, followed by a move to San Francisco in 1969, where her husband's brother Ronald Pelosi was a member of the City and County of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors.[384] Nancy and Paul Pelosi have five children, including Christine and Alexandra, and nine grandchildren.[385] Alexandra, a journalist, covered the Republican presidential campaigns in 2000 and made a film about the experience, Journeys with George. In 2007, Christine published a book, Campaign Boot Camp: Basic Training for Future Leaders.[386] Pelosi resides in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco.[387][388] Her 2016 financial disclosure report lists among her assets a combined home and vineyard in St. Helena, California, two commercial buildings in San Francisco, and a townhouse in Loomis, California.[389] In January 2021, her San Francisco home was vandalized with graffiti, messages of \"[c]ancel rent\" were left on her garage, along with fake blood and a severed pig's head.[390][391] Pelosi's husband, Paul, is a wealthy investor and the primary source of the couple's wealth.[392] In 2009, OpenSecrets estimated Pelosi's net worth at $58 million, making her the 13th-wealthiest member of Congress.[393] In 2014, OpenSecrets reported Pelosi's net worth had almost doubled, to about $101 million, making her the 8th-wealthiest.[394] Business Insider reported that Pelosi's net worth was $26.4 million in 2012 and made her the 13th-richest member of Congress.[395] In 2018, Roll Call estimated Pelosi's net worth at $16.0 million, making her the 30th-wealthiest member.[396] Roll Call said Pelosi's earnings are connected to her husband's heavy investments in stocks that include Apple, Disney, Comcast and Facebook. Roll Call reported that the couple have $13.46 million in liabilities including mortgages on seven properties. According to Roll Call, Pelosi and her husband hold properties \"worth at least $23 million, including a St. Helena vineyard in Napa Valley worth at least $5 million.\"[396] As of 2021, Pelosi's net worth was valued at $120 million, making her the 6th richest person in Congress. According to journalist Glenn Greenwald, the Pelosis have traded $33 million worth of tech stocks over the past two years, including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google stocks.[397] In May and June 2021, Pelosi's husband purchased stocks in tech companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple, netting a gain of $5.3 million. This occurred even while Speaker Pelosi was working on anti-trust legislation to better regulate the tech industry.[398] The CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, had called Pelosi to lobby her in opposition to the new regulations.[399] Pelosi opposes increasing regulations on stock trades by members of congress, stating that \"we're a free market economy\" and congresspeople \"should be able to participate in that\".[400] This comment drew strong criticism, including from Democrats who favor banning stock trades by members of Congress.[401] Pelosi is a board member of the National Organization of Italian American Women.[402] She served for 13 years as a board member of the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF). In 2007, she received the NIAF Special Achievement Award for Public Advocacy and remains involved in the foundation. Pelosi considers herself a devout Catholic, but she has had numerous disagreements with members of the church hierarchy over gay rights, abortion, contraception, and in vitro fertilization. She has said that her biggest disappointment was the church's lobbying against the Affordable Care Act because of contraception coverage.[22] Pelosi and Catholic bishops have also disagreed about abortion rights. Although she thought it was \"lovely\" that she had five children in a little over six years, she argued that \"It's a woman's right to make her own choices with her family, her God, her doctor.\"[22] On May 20, 2022, Salvatore Cordileone, archbishop of San Francisco, announced that Pelosi would be barred from receiving Holy Communion because of her support of pro-choice abortion policies.[403] Cordileone had communicated his concerns on April 7, 2022, writing, \"should you not publicly repudiate your advocacy for abortion 'rights' or else refrain from referring to your Catholic faith in public and receiving Holy Communion, I would have no choice but to make a declaration, in keeping with Canon 915, that you are not to be admitted to Holy Communion.\"[404] On June 29, 2022, Pelosi received Communion at a Papal Mass presided over by Pope Francis in Rome at St. Peter's Basilica.[405][406] In October 2022, while Pelosi was in Washington, D.C., an intruder entered her San Francisco home demanding to know her whereabouts, and attacked her husband, Paul Pelosi, with a hammer. Police arrested a suspect, 42-year-old David DePape, at the scene. He has been charged federally with attempting to kidnap Nancy Pelosi and assaulting a relative of a federal official, as well as six state charges.[407] In December 2024, Pelosi was hospitalized after sustaining an injury to her hip after a fall on stairs during an official trip to Luxembourg.[408][409][410]",

                "content": "Nancy Pelosi served as the 52nd Speaker of the House of Representatives, having made history in 2007 when she was elected the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House. She made history again in January 2019 when she regained her position second-in-line to the presidency – the first person to do so in more than six decades. Pelosi is the chief architect of generation-defining legislation under two Democratic administrations, including the Affordable Care Act and the American Rescue Plan. She led House Democrats for 20 years and previously served as House Democratic Whip. In 2013, she was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame at a ceremony in Seneca Falls, the birthplace of the American women’s rights movement. In 2024, she was awarded by President Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. Pelosi has represented San Francisco in Congress for 37 years. Currently serving as Speaker Emerita of the House and as the Representative for California’s 11th Congressional District, she is fighting For The People to lower costs, grow paychecks and create jobs. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, Speaker Pelosi led the House in crafting and enacting the American Rescue Plan. This life-saving legislation turned the tide of the pandemic: getting vaccines into hundreds of millions of Americans’ arms, delivering direct assistance to families in need, creating millions of new jobs, supporting teachers, police officers, firefighters, transit workers and other frontline heroes, and returning children safely to schools. Speaker Pelosi also engineered House passage of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which is strengthening roads, bridges, ports, water systems and broadband access in communities across the country while rebuilding America’s middle class. Her leadership on the House-passed Build Back Better Act paved the way for the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act: historic action to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, lower health care premiums, deliver the most consequential climate action in human history and pay down the federal deficit. Pelosi was a key negotiator in assembling the bipartisan and bicameral CHIPS and Science Act, which is powering America to world leader status in semiconductor production and scientific discovery, while building a diverse and inclusive STEM workforce in communities across the country. In the 111th Congress, Speaker Pelosi led the House passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to rescue the nation from the depths of the financial crisis, helping create or save millions of American jobs. Her leadership in enshrining the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law helped restore the ability of women to fight pay discrimination in the courts and ensure they too could participate in the economic recovery. Pelosi also led the Congress in enacting the historic Dodd-Frank reforms to rein in big banks and create strong protections for consumers, seniors and Servicemembers. Speaker Pelosi has long been a champion for families’ health care. Pelosi was the architect of the landmark Affordable Care Act, which has guaranteed protections for all Americans with pre-existing medical conditions, forbid insurers from treating being a woman as a pre-existing condition, ended annual and lifetime limits on health coverage, and provided affordable health coverage for tens of millions more Americans. As Democratic Leader in 2017, Pelosi led the charge to defend American families from Republicans’ monstrous “Trumpcare” legislation: mobilizing a massive nationwide campaign in support of the ACA and powering Democrats back into the Majority in 2018. For decades, Pelosi has also been a relentless leader on reducing the costs of prescription drugs by empowering the federal government to negotiate drug prices and capping out-of-pocket costs for seniors: action enshrined into law in the Inflation Reduction Act. Pelosi has made the climate crisis the flagship issue of her Speakership. In 2022, Speaker Pelosi delivered House passage of the Inflation Reduction Act – which contained the biggest, boldest climate action in history. This law included many House-crafted provisions to accelerate America’s transition to a clean energy future: putting the nation on a path to slash carbon pollution by 40 percent by 2030, while creating millions of new jobs and advancing environmental justice. This builds on progress from Pelosi’s first Speakership: in 2007, she enacted comprehensive energy legislation that raised vehicle fuel efficiency standards for the first time in three decades and made a game-changing commitment to America’s homegrown biofuels. In 2009, she led passage of the American Clean Energy and Security Act to create clean energy jobs, combat the climate crisis and transition America to a clean energy economy. A leader on conservation and the environment at home and abroad, Pelosi authored legislation to create the Presidio Trust and transform San Francisco’s former military post into an urban national park. She also secured passage of the “Pelosi Amendment” in 1989, now a global tool used to assess the potential environmental impacts of development. Speaker Pelosi has been a force for accountability, transparency and participation in government. Under her leadership, the House enacted the toughest ethics reform legislation in the history of the Congress – including the creation of an independent ethics panel. Pelosi also led an historic legislative campaign for voting rights, passing two once-in-a-generation pieces of legislation. The For The People Act would expand access to the ballot, clean up corruption in government, outlaw partisan gerrymandering and combat dark money in politics, and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would restore the federal government’s power to defend access to the ballot across the country. Speaker Pelosi is a steadfast defender of the Constitution and the rule of law. In 2019, after President Trump violated his oath of office by soliciting foreign intervention in the upcoming presidential election and withholding Congressionally appropriated assistance to Ukraine, the Democratic House launched an investigation that resulted in the third presidential impeachment in history. In 2021, after President Trump incited a violent insurrection targeting the U.S. Capitol and sought to overturn the results of the election, the House impeached Trump a second time. Speaker Pelosi then led the House in creating the bipartisan Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. Pelosi has been a staunch champion of America’s national security and a respected voice abroad in promoting democratic values. She is the longest-serving Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in history: serving from 1993-2003, including as Ranking Member from 2000-2003, and continues to serve in an ex officio capacity. As Speaker, she marshaled billions of dollars in security, economic and humanitarian assistance for the people of Ukraine after Russia’s unlawful invasion in February 2022. She orchestrated an overwhelmingly bipartisan and bicameral effort to impose swift and severe consequences on Russia, including a ban on the import of Russian energy and the revocation of normal trade relations. For decades, Pelosi has offered a powerful voice for human rights around the world – especially speaking out on behalf of Uyghur communities, the citizens of Hong Kong, the Tibetan people and all those oppressed by the government of China. In 2022, she became the first House Speaker and highest-ranking U.S. official to travel to Taiwan in a quarter-century: an historic visit that reaffirmed America’s unwavering support for the people of Taiwan. As Democratic Leader, she helped strengthen America’s security by securing the votes needed to defeat Republicans’ effort to disapprove of President Obama’s Iran Nuclear Agreement, a landmark policy that halted Iran’s progress toward a nuclear weapon. Speaker Pelosi has long been a leader in the fight for full equality. She spearheaded the historic repeal of the discriminatory “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, allowing gay and lesbian Americans to openly serve their country. She passed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a law advancing justice for the millions of Americans at risk of violence for being who they are. As Speaker, she twice passed the watershed Equality Act: ensuring justice for the LGBTQ community in the workplace and in every place. Pelosi also led the charge to fight back against the Trump Administration’s hateful ban on transgender Servicemembers. While serving as Democratic Leader, Pelosi’s strength at the negotiating table wrested critical legislative victories out of the GOP majority. In the 114th Congress, she achieved an historic bipartisan agreement to strengthen Medicare: ending the cycle of expensive “Doc Fix” patches and building a system that improves accuracy of payments and quality of care. She also delivered significant funding increases for key Democratic priorities, including the fight against the opioid epidemic, support for NIH medical research and permanent authorization of the World Trade Center Health Program. Negotiating directly with the Trump Administration, Speaker Pelosi was crucial to securing vital relief for families and small businesses in early COVID-19 pandemic relief laws. Additional key accomplishments signed into law during her four terms as Speaker include: landmark gun violence prevention measures; legislation to expand educational opportunities while reforming the financial aid system; legislation to provide health care for eleven million American children; new protections against hate crimes; an increase in the minimum wage for the first time in a decade; the largest college aid expansion since the GI bill; new funding to address PFAS forever chemicals; a new GI education bill for veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars; and increased services for veterans, caregivers and the Veterans Administration. With Speaker Pelosi at the helm, the House also advanced important legislation to ensure equal pay for equal work; save lives through a reinstatement of the Assault Weapons Ban and mandatory background checks for gun purchases; protect pregnant workers against discrimination; reform America’s broken immigration system and secure justice for Dreamers and farmworkers; care for veterans exposed to toxic chemicals in the line of duty; and protect borrowers from unfair lending practices. Pelosi comes from a strong family tradition of public service. Her late father, Thomas D’Alesandro Jr., served as Mayor of Baltimore for twelve years, after representing the city for five terms in Congress. Her brother, Thomas D’Alesandro III, also served as Mayor of Baltimore. She graduated from Trinity College in Washington, D.C. She and her husband, Paul Pelosi, a native of San Francisco, have five grown children and ten grandchildren.",

                "title": "Nancy Pelosi | Biography, Book, Age, & Facts | Britannica",
                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Nancy Pelosi (born March 26, 1940, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.) is an American Democratic politician who represents California in the U.S. House of Representatives (1987– ), where she served as the first female speaker (2007–11 and 2019–23). Her other notable posts have included House minority leader (2003–07 and 2011–19). During her career, Pelosi developed a reputation as a highly skillful legislator and is considered one of the most effective speakers in the history of the House. Nancy D’Alesandro—whose father, Thomas D’Alesandro, Jr., was a politician and New Deal Democrat—studied political science at Trinity College in Washington, D.C., graduating with a bachelor’s degree in 1962. The following year she married Paul Pelosi, and the couple moved to New York. Five children and six years later, the family settled in San Francisco, where Nancy Pelosi worked as a volunteer Democratic organizer. Earning a reputation as a highly effective fund-raiser, she rose through the ranks, serving on the Democratic National Committee and as chair of both the California Democratic Party (1981–83) and the host committee for the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. Along the way, Pelosi befriended longtime U.S. Rep. Phil Burton. Burton died in 1983 and was succeeded by his wife, Sala, who, shortly before her death in 1987, urged Pelosi to run for the seat. She narrowly won a special election and was reelected in 1988 to a full term. Pelosi easily won subsequent elections in her overwhelmingly Democratic district. Pelosi developed a reputation as a shrewd politician, and she steadily rose within the party, becoming minority whip in 2002. Later that year she was elected minority leader, and, when she took office in 2003, she became the first woman to lead a party in Congress. Using what she referred to as her “mother of five” voice, Pelosi began pushing for unity among the diverse factions within her party by embracing conservatives and moderates. Still, Pelosi continued to vote consistently in favor of such liberal causes as gun control and abortion rights, opposed welfare reform, and cast a vote against the Iraq War. Her criticism of Pres. George W. Bush could be harsh; she once characterized him as an “incompetent leader.” Her critics in turn claimed that her “left coast,” left-wing politics put her out of touch with most of the country. Following the midterm elections in November 2006, the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives. On January 4, 2007, Pelosi was elected speaker of the House of the 110th Congress. After Democrat Barack Obama assumed the presidency in 2009, Pelosi was a vocal supporter of many of his policies, helping to shepherd through Congress his $787 billion stimulus package in February 2009 and playing an instrumental role in the more-than-yearlong effort to secure health care reform, which ultimately passed in March 2010. The historic bill extended health care to some 30 million previously uninsured Americans and prohibited insurers from denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions. Pelosi’s popularity declined, however, as the economy continued to struggle and as opposition to legislation she had championed—notably health care reform and the stimulus package—increased. In the lead-up to the 2010 midterm elections, she became a target of Republican attacks and a rallying point for Tea Partiers, who were keen to turn the elections into a referendum on the Democratic agenda. The Democrats fared poorly in the November elections and lost control of the House. Despite calls for new party leadership, Pelosi was elected to serve as minority leader in the next Congress. She continued in that post as Democrats failed to regain control of the House in several subsequent elections. Their lackluster electoral performance, especially with working-class voters, led to unrest among House Democrats, and, after Republican Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, Tim Ryan from Ohio challenged Pelosi for minority leader. Pelosi ultimately prevailed. The 2018 midterm elections saw a massive resurgence for the Democrats as they regained control of the House. As calls continued for leadership changes, Pelosi made various concessions, notably accepting term limits, and in January 2019 she was officially elected speaker, becoming the first person in more than 60 years to serve nonconsecutive terms in the post. Pelosi’s political skills were also on display as she dealt with a government shutdown that had begun in late December. At issue was funding for a border wall, one of Trump’s key campaign pledges. Pelosi united her party in opposition to the president, who vowed to keep the government closed until he received billions for the proposed wall. Citing security concerns, Pelosi refused to allow Trump to hold the annual State of the Union address in the House chambers while the government was closed. In late January Trump finally agreed to end the shutdown, which was the longest to date, even though he had failed to secure the necessary funding. Pelosi drew particular praise for her handling of the situation. During this time Pelosi faced calls from within her party to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump. These escalated in March 2019 when special counsel Robert Mueller concluded his investigation into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Although Mueller reached no legal conclusions, critics of Trump believed that the findings supported impeachment, while the president’s supporters claimed that he had been exonerated. Pelosi was initially reluctant to move on impeachment, but in September 2019 it was publicly revealed that a whistleblower had filed a complaint alleging that Trump had withheld aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country into opening a corruption investigation into Joe Biden, a political rival. Later that month Pelosi opened a formal impeachment inquiry in the House. The investigation concluded in early December 2019, and several weeks later the House voted to impeach the president. However, Pelosi delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate until January. The move was seen as an attempt to secure certain conditions for the Senate trial, and its effect was debated. In February 2020 the Senate acquitted Trump. During this time the coronavirus was spreading around the world, eventually becoming a pandemic. In March 2020, as deaths in the United States began to mount, businesses and schools started to close, and the economy entered an economic downturn that soon rivaled the Great Depression. That month Pelosi helped secure the passage of a $2 trillion relief package, the largest stimulus bill in U.S. history. As the pandemic worsened in the country, she blamed the president—going so far as to call it the “Trump virus”—alleging that he had mishandled the government response. In the 2020 election Trump was defeated by Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, and the Democrats maintained a slim majority in the House. Pelosi was elected to another term as speaker in 2021. During this time Trump contested the results of the presidential election, repeatedly alleging voter fraud despite the lack of evidence to support his claims. On January 6, 2021, his supporters stormed the Capitol as Congress was in the process of certifying Biden’s victory. Many accused Trump of encouraging the attack, and Pelosi demanded his removal from office. To that end, she oversaw passage of a House resolution that called on Vice Pres. Mike Pence to invoke the Twenty-fifth Amendment. After he refused, Pelosi launched impeachment proceedings, charging Trump with “incitement of insurrection.” The House voted to impeach Trump on January 13, 2021, a week before the end of his term. However, the Senate subsequently acquitted him. After the majority of Senate Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, blocked the formation of a bipartisan independent commission to investigate the Capitol attack, Pelosi oversaw the formation of the House’s Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. When Pelosi refused to seat two of Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s five nominees for the committee—Representatives Jim Banks and Jim Jordan—because, she argued, they were too closely involved with Trump to participate credibly, McCarthy withdrew all five nominations. In their places Pelosi appointed Republicans Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who joined the seven Democrats on the committee, which began its investigation in July 2021. In the meantime, Pelosi shepherded House passage of a massive bill aimed at restoring and improving U.S. infrastructure despite the Senate’s failure to approve the Build Back Better Act. Pelosi had originally refused to allow the House vote on the infrastructure bill until after Senate passage of Biden’s ambitious plan for expanding the country’s social safety net and combating climate change. In August 2022 Pelosi became the highest-ranking elected U.S. official to visit Taiwan in some 25 years. The controversial visit by Pelosi, a longtime critic of the Chinese government, heightened tensions between the U.S. and China, which considers the self-ruling island to be its territory and viewed the presence of a U.S. official of the speaker’s stature as provocatively enhancing the international standing of Taiwan’s government. Following the November 2022 midterm elections, in which the Democratic Party narrowly lost control of the House to the Republicans, Pelosi announced that she would step down as leader of the House Democrats but would remain a member of Congress. In January Hakeem Jeffries succeeded her. However, Pelosi remained a hugely influential figure within Congress and the Democratic Party. In June 2024 concerns arose over the viability of Biden’s reelection campaign following a disastrous debate against the Republican nominee, Trump. Pelosi reportedly pushed to have Biden leave the race, which he did in July. Almost immediately thereafter, she endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee, and Harris ultimately was named the party’s candidate. In 2024 Pelosi won reelection against Republican challenger Bruce Lou. Pelosi is the recipient of numerous honors, including the Profile in Courage Award (2019) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2024). She also wrote the books Know Your Power: A Message to America’s Daughters (2008) and The Art of Power: My Story as America’s First Woman Speaker of the House (2024).",

                "content": "Nestor Cortés Jr. (born December 10, 1994), nicknamed \"Nasty Nestor\" and \"the Hialeah Kid\",[1] is a Cuban-American professional baseball pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the New York Yankees, Baltimore Orioles, and Seattle Mariners. The Yankees selected Cortés in the 36th round of the 2013 MLB draft. Taken by the Orioles in the Rule 5 draft after the 2017 season, he made his MLB debut with them in 2018 before returning to the Yankees. Cortés pitched for the Yankees in 2019 and the Mariners in 2020, rejoining the Yankees in 2021 and establishing himself in their starting rotation. Cortés was an MLB All-Star in 2022. Cortés was born in Surgidero de Batabanó, Cuba. When he was seven months old, his father, Nestor Cortés Sr., won the visa lottery, and they relocated to the United States in the city of Hialeah, Florida.[2] His father had been sentenced to one year in prison after a failed attempt to defect from Cuba in 1992. Nestor Sr. met his wife, Yuslaidy, the following year.[3] Nestor Sr. drove a forklift and his mother worked as a manicurist.[4] Cortés started playing baseball at the age of four.[2] His father took him to see the Florida Marlins of Major League Baseball (MLB) play at Pro Player Stadium in Miami Gardens.[3] Cortés attended Hialeah High School in Hialeah, Florida. He committed to play college baseball at Florida International University.[5] The New York Yankees selected Cortés in the 36th round of the 2013 MLB draft. He signed with the Yankees, receiving an $85,000 signing bonus,[4] and made his professional debut that year with the Gulf Coast Yankees of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, where he had a 0–1 win–loss record with a 4.42 earned run average (ERA) in 18+1⁄3 innings pitched. He returned there in 2014, going 1–2 with a 2.27 ERA in 11 games (two starts). Cortés spent 2015 with the Pulaski Yankees of the Rookie-level Appalachian League, where he compiled a 6–3 record with a 2.26 ERA in 12 games (ten starts). In 2016, he pitched for the Charleston RiverDogs of the Single–A South Atlantic League, Tampa Yankees of the High–A Florida State League, Trenton Thunder of the Double–A Eastern League, and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Triple–A International League, pitching to a combined 11–4 record with a 1.53 ERA in 21 games (12 starts). Cortés played 2017 with Tampa, Trenton, and the RailRiders.[6] He finished the season with a 2.06 ERA between the three levels.[7] The Baltimore Orioles selected Cortés from the Yankees organization in the 2017 Rule 5 draft.[8] During spring training with the Orioles, Cortés competed for a spot on the Orioles' Opening Day roster as either a starting pitcher or relief pitcher.[9][10][11] Cortés made the Orioles' Opening Day roster in 2018 as a relief pitcher,[12] and made his major league debut on March 31.[13] Cortés allowed a grand slam to Josh Reddick on April 3, and then a walk with the bases loaded to Curtis Granderson followed by a grand slam by Josh Donaldson on April 9.[14] The Orioles designated Cortés for assignment the next day.[15] He had allowed four runs on ten hits, including two home runs, in four games pitched.[7] On April 13, 2018, the Orioles returned Cortés to the Yankees.[16] He played in one game for Trenton before returning to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, combining for a 6–6 record and a lukewarm 3.68 ERA in 24 games.[17] After the regular season, Cortés played for the Estrellas Orientales of the Dominican Professional Baseball League, where he learned how to throw a cut fastball.[18] The Yankees invited Cortés to spring training as a non-roster player in 2019.[19] He did not make the team and was assigned to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. The Yankees promoted him to the major leagues on May 9. On June 15, he earned his first major league win, striking out seven batters, and allowing two earned runs in five innings.[20] The Yankees optioned him to Triple-A with Aaron Judge coming off the injured list on June 21;[21] he was promoted to the major league roster on June 23 when Cameron Maybin went on the injured list.[22] He was 5–1 with an ERA of 5.67 in 33 games.[23] On November 25, 2019, the Yankees traded Cortés to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for $28,300 of international bonus pool money.[7][24] He hurt his elbow in August, ending up on the injured list.[25] Working at the Mariners' alternate training site, a coach helped him to change the grip of his fastball, which helped him to add backspin to the pitch.[7] In 2020, Cortés gave up 13 runs over 7+2⁄3 innings pitched for the Mariners. On October 22, 2020, Cortés was outrighted off of the 40-man roster after he was activated from the 60-day injured list, and elected free agency.[26] On December 20, 2020, Cortés signed a minor league contract to return to the New York Yankees organization.[27] Cortés began the 2021 season with the RailRiders, and the Yankees promoted him to the major leagues on May 30.[28] Throughout the 2021 season, Cortés became a favorite of Yankees fans, as his signature mustache, along with his unique style of pitching and many productive appearances garnered him much praise, along with the moniker \"Nasty Nestor.\"[29] He finished the year with 93 innings pitched over 22 games (14 started) to go along with a 2.90 ERA and 103 strikeouts.[23] Cortés began the 2022 season in the Yankees starting rotation.[30] Cortés threw an immaculate inning against the Orioles on April 16.[31] Against the Texas Rangers on May 9, Cortés pitched 7+1⁄3 innings before allowing his first hit.[32] He was selected for the 2022 All-Star Game, where he registered two strikeouts, a hit by pitch, and a walk in 1 inning pitched.[33] He finished the regular season with a 12-4 record and a 2.44 ERA in 158+1⁄3 innings pitched in 28 games started.[34] In November 2022, Cortés announced his intention to represent the United States national baseball team in the 2023 World Baseball Classic, held in March 2023.[35] He withdrew from the tournament due to a hamstring injury.[36] Cortes began the 2023 season out of the Yankees' rotation, posting a 5.16 ERA across 11 starts. On June 8, 2023, he was placed on the injured list with a left rotator cuff strain.[37] He was transferred to the 60-day injured list on July 7.[38] Cortes was activated on August 5.[39] He made one start and returned to the injured list on August 11 due to the rotator cuff strain.[40] He was transferred to the 60–day injured list on September 12, officially ending his season, as the Yankees missed the postseason for the first time since 2016. In 12 starts, he logged a 5–2 record and a 4.97 ERA with 67 strikeouts in 63+1⁄3 innings pitched.[41] With Gerrit Cole beginning the 2024 season on the injured list, the Yankees chose Cortes as their starting pitcher for Opening Day.[42] Cortes was 9-10 with a 3.77 ERA in 31 games (30 starts) for the 2024 season, ranking second on the team in innings (174+1⁄3) and third in strikeouts (162). Cortes was sidelined to begin the Yankees' 2024 postseason run due to a left elbow flexor strain suffered on September 18. He was readded to the 26-man roster for the 2024 World Series. In the bottom of the 10th inning of Game 1, Cortes allowed a walk-off grand slam to Freddie Freeman, becoming the first pitcher in World Series history to do so.[43] On December 13, 2024, the Yankees traded Cortés and Caleb Durbin to the Milwaukee Brewers for Devin Williams.[44] Cortés throws a four-seam fastball that averages approximately 91 miles per hour (146 km/h). He also throws a cutter, slider, changeup, and a curveball.[45][46] His curveball has been registered as slow as 47 miles per hour (76 km/h).[6] Cortés hides the ball well in his wind-up, which helps to alleviate the problems presented by his shorter frame. When throwing a slider or curveball, his arm angle is slightly lower than his four-seam fastball.[citation needed] Cortés also employs trickery in his wind-up to throw hitters off. He sometimes varies his step timing and sometimes pauses and rocks back and forth in the middle of his wind-up, and occasionally abbreviates his wind-up and releases the ball quickly.[47] Cortés and his girlfriend, Alondra Esteras Russy, became engaged after the 2022 All-Star Game.[48] They married in November 2023.[49] Cortés is a fan of horse racing, attending races at the Hialeah Park Race Track when he was young. He partnered with an equipment manager of the Yankees to purchase a harness racing horse in 2023.[50]",

                "content": "By Richard Tovar Updated on December 13, 2024 10:24PM EDT Updated on December 13, 2024 10:24PM EDT By Richard Tovar Nestor Cortes’ time with the New York Yankees has officially come to an end. After a rough start to his career, the Cuban pitcher eventually became a key figure for the Bombers. However, in a trade to acquire Devin Williams from the Milwaukee Brewers, Cortes’ run in New York is now over. Williams joins the Yankees with the expectation of competing for the closer role alongside Luke Weaver, as GM Brian Cashman recently confirmed. Cortes heads to Milwaukee along with another player, and it’s expected the Yankees will also send some cash as part of the deal. Cortes’ journey with the Yankees began in 2019, with a brief detour to Seattle in 2020, before returning in 2021. Over his tenure, he appeared in 126 MLB games for the franchise, both as a reliever and starter. While Williams, at 30, is not far behind Cortes in age, the two have vastly different postseason experiences. Cortes has been a fixture in the postseason since his debut in 2018, while Williams has only made one appearance in the playoffs. LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA – OCTOBER 25: Nestor Cortes #65 of the New York Yankees leaves the field after giving up a walk-off grand slam to Freddie Freeman #5 of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the tenth inning during Game One of the 2024 World Series at Dodger Stadium on October 25, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images) According to Spotrac, Cortes earned $3.9 million in the 2024 season. He had been signing one-year deals with the Yankees since 2021. Over the course of his six years with the team, he earned a total of $8,627,990. While nothing is official yet, Spotrac estimates Cortes could make around $8.3 million on a one-year deal with the Brewers. His signing bonus is still unknown, but his last bonus with the Yankees was $85,000.

The makers of “Carry-On” seem to want viewers to just go along with the ride, and for those who put their minds in neutral, the film is satisfying. “Carry-On” is also keen to pay tribute to TSA employees, and the indignities and harassment these workers experience as they try to keep things “moving and safe” for passengers. “Carry-On” may not be a Christmas movie classic, like “Die Hard,” but it is undemanding entertainment. “Carry-On” is a decent little thriller that delivers enough action and suspense to keep folks engaged for two hours.

                "content": "Friday the 13th is considered an unlucky day in Western superstition. It occurs when the 13th day of the month in the Gregorian calendar falls on a Friday, which happens at least once every year but can occur up to three times in the same year. For example, 2015 had a Friday the 13th in February, March, and November, which will happen again in 2026. Leap years that begin on Sunday (i.e. that follow Dominical Letter AG) such as 2012 and 2040, also have three Friday the 13ths in January, April, and July. 2017 through 2020 had two Friday the 13ths, as did 2023; 2016, 2021, and 2022 had just one Friday the 13th, as will 2025, 2027, and 2028; 2024 will have two Friday the 13ths.[1] For a month to have a Friday the 13th, the 1st must be a Sunday. One source mentioned for the unlucky reputation of the number 13 is a Norse myth about twelve gods having a dinner party in Valhalla. The trickster god Loki, who was not invited, arrived as the thirteenth guest, and arranged for Höðr, the god of darkness, to shoot Balder, the god of joy and gladness, with a mistletoe-tipped arrow. Balder died, triggering much suffering in the world, which caused the number 13 to be considered unlucky.[2][3] The superstition seems to relate to various things, like the story of Jesus's Last Supper and crucifixion in which there were thirteen individuals present in the Upper Room on the thirteenth of Nisan Maundy Thursday, the night before his death on Good Friday.[a][b][6] While there is evidence of both Friday[7] and the number 13[8] being considered unlucky, there is no record of the two items being referred to as especially unlucky in conjunction before the 19th century.[9][10] The Knights Templar Some cite the arrest of the Knights Templar on Friday, October 13, 1307, by officers of King Philip IV of France as the origin of the Friday the 13th superstition, but it is agreed the origins remain murky.[11] In France, Friday 13th might have been associated with misfortune as early as the first half of the 19th century. A character in the 1834 play Les Finesses des Gribouilles states, \"I was born on a Friday, December 13th, 1813 from which come all of my misfortunes\".[12] An early documented reference in English occurs in H. S. Edwards' biography of Gioachino Rossini, who died on Friday 13th of November 1868: It is possible that the publication in 1907 of T. W. Lawson's popular novel Friday, the Thirteenth,[14] contributed to popularizing the superstition. In the novel, an unscrupulous broker takes advantage of the superstition to create a Wall Street panic on a Friday the 13th.[9] Similar dates are prevalent in many cultures, although it is unclear whether these similarities are in any way historically connected or only coincidental. In Hispanic countries, instead of Friday, Tuesday the 13th (martes trece) is considered a day of bad luck.[15] The Greeks also consider Tuesday (and especially the 13th) an unlucky day.[16] Tuesday is considered dominated by the influence of Ares, the god of war (or Mars, the Roman equivalent). The fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade occurred on Tuesday 13 April 1204, and the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans happened on Tuesday 29 May 1453, events that strengthen the superstition about Tuesday. In addition, in Greek the name of the day is Triti (Τρίτη) meaning the third (day of the week), adding weight to the superstition, since bad luck is said to \"come in threes\".[16] There is a Tuesday the 13th in months that begin on a Thursday. In Italian popular culture, Friday the 17th (and not the 13th) is considered a bad luck day.[17] The origin of this belief could be traced in the writing of the number 17, in Roman numerals: XVII. By shuffling the digits of the number one can get the Latin vīxī (\"I have lived\", implying death at present), an omen of bad luck.[18] In fact, in Italy, 13 is generally considered a lucky number,[19] although some people may consider 13 an unlucky number as well due to Americanization. The 2000 parody film Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth was released in Italy with the title Shriek – Hai impegni per venerdì 17? (\"Shriek – Do You Have Something to Do on Friday the 17th?\").[citation needed] According to the Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute in Asheville, North Carolina, an estimated 17–21 million people in the United States are affected by Paraskevidekatriaphobia (fear of Friday the 13th), making it the most feared day and date in history. Some people are so paralyzed by fear that they avoid their normal routines in doing business, taking flights or even getting out of bed. It has been estimated that US$ 800–900 million is lost in business on this day.[20] Despite this, representatives for both Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines (the latter now merged into United Airlines) have stated that their airlines do not suffer from any noticeable drop in travel on those Fridays.[21] In Finland, a consortium of governmental and nongovernmental organizations led by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health promotes the National Accident Day (kansallinen tapaturmapäivä) to raise awareness about automotive safety, which always falls on a Friday the 13th.[22] The event is coordinated by the Finnish Red Cross and has been held since 1995.[23] A study by Scanlon, Luben, Scanlon, & Singleton (1993)[24] attracted attention from popular science literature,[c][d] as it concluded that \"the risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52 percent on the 13th\";[24]: 1584 however, the authors clearly state that \"the numbers of admissions from accidents are too small to allow meaningful analysis\".[24]: 1586 Subsequent studies have disproved any correlation between Friday the 13th and the rate of accidents.[27][28] On 12 June 2008 the Dutch Centre for Insurance Statistics stated to the contrary, that \"fewer accidents and reports of fire and theft occur when the 13th of the month falls on a Friday than on other Fridays, because people are preventatively more careful or just stay home. Statistically speaking, driving is slightly safer on Friday the 13th, at least in the Netherlands; in the last two years, Dutch insurers received reports of an average 7,800 traffic accidents each Friday; but the average figure when the 13th fell on a Friday was just 7,500.\"[29][30] In recent years, Friday the 13th has emerged as a holiday for tattoo parlors and enthusiasts; with many shops running for 24 hours, and offering flash tattoos featuring the number 13 in the design.[31] Some claim that having a number 13 tattoo can be an antidote to bad luck. According to Oliver Peck: \"Bad luck would come your way, it would see the number 13, see that bad luck is already there, and it would pass on by.” [32] Each 400 year Gregorian solar cycle contains 146,097 days (with 97 leap days) or exactly 20,871 weeks. Each cycle contains the same pattern of days of the week and therefore the same pattern of Fridays that are on the 13th. The 13th day of the month is very slightly more likely to be a Friday than any other day of the week.[33][34][35] Any month that starts on a Sunday contains a Friday the 13th, and there is at least one Friday the 13th in every calendar year. The months with a Friday the 13th are determined by the Dominical letter (G, F, GF, etc.) of the year. Years which begin on the same day of the week and are of the same type (i.e. common year or leap year), will have a Friday the 13th in the same months. This sequence, given here for 1900–2099, follows a 28-year cycle from 1 March 1900 to 28 February 2100: Although there is always at least one Friday the 13th per calendar year, it can be as long as 14 months between two Friday the 13ths.[36] The longest period that occurs without a Friday the 13th is 14 months, either from July to September the following year being a common year starting on Tuesday (F) (e.g. 2001–02, 2012–13 and 2018–19), or from August to October the following year being a leap year starting on Saturday (BA) (e.g. 1999–2000 and 2027–28). The shortest period that occurs with a Friday the 13th is just one month, from February to March in a common year starting on Thursday (D) (e.g. 2009, 2015 and 2026). On average, there is a Friday the 13th once every 212.35 days. Friday the 13ths occurs with an average frequency of 1.7218 per year or about 3477 since the year 1 CE. There can be no more than three Friday the 13ths in a single calendar year; either in February, March, and November in a common year starting on Thursday (such as 2009, 2015, or 2026) (D), or January, April, and July in a leap year starting on Sunday (such as 1984, 2012, or 2040) (AG).[37] In the 2000s, there were three Friday the 13ths in 2009, and two Friday the 13ths in 2001, 2002, 2006, and 2007. In the 2010s, there were three Friday the 13ths in 2012 and 2015, and two in 2013, 2017, 2018, and 2019.[1] In the 2020s, there were two Friday the 13ths in 2020 and 2023. There will also be three Friday the 13ths in 2026, and two in 2024 and 2029.[1] The remaining years all have at least one Friday the 13th.[1] For the details see the table below; this table is for the Gregorian calendar and Jan/Feb for leap years:",

                "content": "By: History.com Editors Updated: August 10, 2021 | Original: October 10, 2017 Long considered a harbinger of bad luck, Friday the 13th has inspired a late 19th-century secret society, an early 20th-century novel, a horror film franchise and not one but two unwieldy terms—paraskavedekatriaphobia and friggatriskaidekaphobia—that describe fear of this supposedly unlucky day. Just like walking under a ladder, crossing paths with a black cat or breaking a mirror, many people hold fast to the belief that Friday the 13th brings bad luck. Though it’s uncertain exactly when this particular tradition began, negative superstitions have swirled around the number 13 for centuries. While Western cultures have historically associated the number 12 with completeness (there are 12 days of Christmas, 12 months and zodiac signs, 12 labors of Hercules, 12 gods of Olympus and 12 tribes of Israel, just to name a few examples), its successor 13 has a long history as a sign of bad luck. The ancient Code of Hammurabi, for example, reportedly omitted a 13th law from its list of legal rules. Though this was probably a clerical error, superstitious people sometimes point to this as proof of 13’s longstanding negative associations. Fear of the number 13 has even earned a psychological term: triskaidekaphobia. According to biblical tradition, 13 guests attended the Last Supper, held on Maundy Thursday, including Jesus and his 12 apostles (one of whom, Judas, betrayed him). The next day, of course, was Good Friday, the day of Jesus’ crucifixion. The seating arrangement at the Last Supper is believed to have given rise to a longstanding Christian superstition that having 13 guests at a table was a bad omen—specifically, that it was courting death. Though Friday’s negative associations are weaker, some have suggested they also have roots in Christian tradition: Just as Jesus was crucified on a Friday, Friday was also said to be the day Eve gave Adam the fateful apple from the Tree of Knowledge, as well as the day Cain killed his brother, Abel. In the late-19th century, a New Yorker named Captain William Fowler (1827-1897) sought to remove the enduring stigma surrounding the number 13—and particularly the unwritten rule about not having 13 guests at a dinner table—by founding an exclusive society called the Thirteen Club. The group dined regularly on the 13th day of the month in room 13 of the Knickerbocker Cottage, a popular watering hole Fowler owned from 1863 to 1883. Before sitting down for a 13-course dinner, members would pass beneath a ladder and a banner reading “Morituri te Salutamus,” Latin for “Those of us who are about to die salute you.” Four former U.S. presidents (Chester A. Arthur, Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison and Theodore Roosevelt) would join the Thirteen Club’s ranks at one time or another. The much‑feared day was the beginning of the end for the powerful warriors. The ancient Babylonian king ruled with military and diplomatic finesse—and he also knew a thing or two about self‑promotion. Symbols, amulets and other talismans from around the globe. An important milestone in the history of the Friday the 13th legend in particular (not just the number 13) occurred in 1907, with the publication of the novel Friday, the Thirteenth written by Thomas William Lawson. The book told the story of a New York City stockbroker who plays on superstitions about the date to create chaos on Wall Street, and make a killing on the market. The horror movie Friday the 13th, released in 1980, introduced the world to a hockey mask-wearing killer named Jason, and is perhaps the best-known example of the famous superstition in pop culture history. The movie spawned multiple sequels, as well as comic books, novellas, video games, related merchandise and countless terrifying Halloween costumes. On Friday, October 13, 1307, officers of King Philip IV of France arrested hundreds of the Knights Templar, a powerful religious and military order formed in the 12th century for the defense of the Holy Land. Imprisoned on charges of various illegal behaviors (but really because the king wanted access to their financial resources), many Templars were later executed. Some cite the link with the Templars as the origin of the Friday the 13th superstition, but like many legends involving the Templars and their history, the truth remains murky. In more recent times, a number of traumatic events have occurred on Friday the 13th, including the German bombing of Buckingham Palace (September 1940); the murder of Kitty Genovese in Queens, New York (March 1964); a cyclone that killed more than 300,000 people in Bangladesh (November 1970); the disappearance of a Chilean Air Force plane in the Andes (October 1972); the death of rapper Tupac Shakur (September 1996) and the crash of the Costa Concordia cruise ship off the coast of Italy, which killed 30 people (January 2012). “The Origins of Unlucky Friday the 13th,” Live Science.“Friday the 13th: why is it unlucky and other facts about the worst day in the calendar,” The Telegraph.“13 Freaky Things That Happened on Friday the 13th,” Live Science.“Here’s Why Friday the 13th is Considered Unlucky,” Time.“Friggatriskaidekaphobes Need Not Apply,” New-York Historical Society.

With the Geminids meteor shower illuminating the night sky, it’s a great opportunity to leave superstition behind and make a wish on a shooting star.

More:December to bring Geminid, Ursid meteor showers, naked eye view of Jupiter — how to view Friday the 13th’s reputation for bad luck largely originates from religious and cultural beliefs. In Christianity, it is associated with the Last Supper, where Judas, the 13th guest, betrayed Jesus, leading to his crucifixion on a Friday, according to USA TODAY. Norse mythology also contributes, with the 13th god, Loki, bringing chaos and death. This superstition deepened over time, particularly after the mass arrest of the Knights Templar on Friday, October 13th, 1307, further cementing the day’s unlucky status. Next year, the only Friday the 13th will fall in June.

                "content": "By Kaity Kline circa 1930: Members of Friday The Thirteenth Club walk under a ladder in single file at a meeting on the outskirts of Paris. The club meets every Friday 13th to do everything that superstitious people traditionally avoid. Hulton Archive/Keystone/Getty Images hide caption The superstition that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day has been around for the past 100 years. But it doesn't have the ancient origins that many might expect. It's hard to pinpoint exactly why Friday the 13th is considered an unlucky day. Experts can only speculate. \"The United States, we get it from England… it wasn't considered an unlucky day in England until the 20th century. The first recorded instance we have of that in print is 1913,\" said Moira Marsh, a folklore librarian at the University of Indiana Bloomington. \"People start to make references to it being unlucky without saying why they think it's unlucky. And because of that, typically what you get is all kinds of wild theories about why Friday the 13th is unlucky,\" said Stephen Winick, a folklore specialist at the American Folklife Center of The Library of Congress. Some speculate that Friday the 13th is unlucky because Judas was the 13th guest at the Last Supper, or that Knights Templar were condemned on a Friday the 13th. But Winick said experts don't know if any of those things are true. The first references Winick has seen saying Friday the 13th is unlucky are both from French writing and plays. A character in the 1834 play Les Finesses des Gribouilles says \"I was born on a Friday, December 13th, 1813 from which come all of my misfortunes.\" And in the French literary magazine Revue de Paris, Marquis de Salvo wrote about a father who killed his daughter on Friday the 13th, and said \"It is always Fridays and the number thirteen that bring back luck.\" While the combination of Friday and 13 is a relatively new invention, the idea that Fridays are unlucky is not. \"Fridays were considered unlucky days, and that's been true since the Middle Ages in the English speaking world and probably through most of Europe, because Friday was the day of crucifixion. And in the old Catholic tradition, every Friday was a day of penance. And that idea has persisted,\" said Marsh. Marsh said the idea that 13 is an unlucky number doesn't really show up until around the 17th century. \"Before that, it might have been considered a good number because it goes back to supposedly the 13 people who were at the Last Supper. Before reformation, Christians preferred to try and emulate that.\" After the Reformation came along, Marsh said ideas like that were forbidden as superstitious. And so what was considered a good number flipped to be considered a bad one. There's another idea about why the number 13 is unlucky. \"12 is a number that's very mathematically significant. It's divisible by many different numbers. And it's very useful mathematically for various things,\" said Winick. There are 12 months, 12 zodiac signs, 12 inches in a foot. \"And then 13 comes along and it's kind of a dud. It doesn't really help you out much mathematically.\" Marsh and Winick say that thanks to popular culture, like the movie Friday the 13th, the day is now pretty widespread in countries around the world. And journalists have had a hand in spreading the popularity of that idea. In Italy, Winick said, the unlucky day tends to be Friday the 17th. And then in Spanish speaking countries, the unlucky day tends to be Tuesday the 13th. \"People speculate that's because Tuesday is associated with the chaotic God of war. You know, Martes or Tuesday in Spanish is related to the God of war, Mars. Because of that, people think that may be the origin of Tuesday's being unlucky,\" said Winick. Marsh said a Greek nurse in the 1960s may be another source who found Tuesdays to be unlucky. According to this nurse, if a wedding ended on a Monday evening, the women of the family would keep the bridge close by so that her husband wouldn't touch her. Because if any child was conceived on a Monday evening, the beginning of Tuesday would be considered unlucky, and the baby would likely have birth defects. In Greece, Winick said they often link the potential origins back to ancient Greek culture. So they'll think about ancient Greek mathematics, which had ideas that the number 12 was a good number, and 13 was a bad number. \"We seek explanations for the chaotic experience of life. We want to explain to ourselves why things have happened in a certain way, why things didn't go our way… it gives us a sense of control even though we may not have control,\" said Winick.

            {
                "title": "Army–Navy Game - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Army–Navy Game is an American college football rivalry game between the Army Black Knights of the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York, and the Navy Midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy (USNA) at Annapolis, Maryland. The Black Knights, or Cadets, and Midshipmen each represent their service's oldest officer commissioning sources. As such, the game has come to embody the spirit of the interservice rivalry of the United States Armed Forces. The game marks the end of the college football regular season and the third and final game of the season's Commander-in-Chief's Trophy series, which also includes the Air Force Falcons of the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) near Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Army–Navy Game is one of the most traditional and enduring rivalries in college football. It has been frequently attended by the President of the United States.[1] The game has been nationally televised each year since 1945 on either ABC, CBS, or NBC. CBS has televised the game since 1996 and has the rights to the broadcast through 2038. The December 2024 announcement of CBS Sports' extension will also give their international channels rights in the United Kingdom and Australia.[2]. Instant replay made its American debut in the 1963 Army–Navy game.[3] Since 2009, the game has been held on the second Saturday of December and following FBS conference championship weekend.[4] The game has been primarily played in Philadelphia, but the game has also been held in multiple locations including the New York area, the Baltimore–Washington area, Chicago, Pasadena, California and the Boston area. The series has been uninterrupted since 1930. Through the 2023 meeting, Navy leads the series 62–55–7. The first game between Army and Navy was on November 29, 1890. Since then, the two academies have played annually in all but ten years, and have played in consecutive annual games every season since 1930. Throughout its history, the game has been played in several neutral locations, including New York City and Baltimore, but it is most commonly played in Philadelphia, which is roughly equidistant from the two academies. Historically played on the Saturday after Thanksgiving (a date on which most other major college football teams end their regular seasons), the game is now played on the second Saturday in December and is traditionally the last regular-season game played in NCAA Division I football. For much of the first two thirds of the 20th century, both Army and Navy were often national powers, and the game occasionally had national championship implications. However, as the level of play in college football increased, both academies' stringent admissions standards and height and weight limits made it difficult for them to compete. Since 1963, only the 1996, 2010, 2016, 2017, and 2024 games have seen both teams enter with winning records. Nonetheless, the game is considered a college football institution. The tradition associated with the game has kept it airing nationally on radio since 1930 and on television since 1945. It has remained an over-the-air broadcast even in the age of cable, satellite, and streaming. The game is especially emotional for the seniors, called \"first classmen\" by both academies, since it is typically the last competitive regular season football game they will ever play (though they sometimes play in a subsequent bowl game). However, some participants in the Army–Navy Game have gone on to professional football careers. For example, quarterback Roger Staubach (Navy, 1965) went on to a Hall of Fame career with the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys that included starting at quarterback in two Super Bowl victories (including being named the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl VI), and Alejandro Villanueva (Army, 2010) was later an offensive tackle with the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens.[5] The game is the last of three contests in the annual Commander-in-Chief's Trophy series, awarded to each season's winner of the triangular series among Army, Navy, and Air Force since 1972. The rivalries Army and Navy have with Air Force are much less intense than the Army–Navy rivalry, primarily due to the relative youth of the USAFA, established in 1954, and the physical distance between the USAFA and the other two schools. The Army–Air Force and Navy–Air Force games are usually played at the academies' regular home fields, although on occasion they have been held at a neutral field. Since 1901, there have been ten sitting presidents of the United States to attend the Army–Navy Game. The first was Theodore Roosevelt, who attended the game in 1901 and 1905. Harry S. Truman attended all but one edition during his eight years in office (1945–1952), missing the 1951 game due to vacation. George W. Bush and Donald Trump each attended three times; Bush in 2001, 2004, and 2008, and Trump in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Trump also attended a game as president-elect in 2016.[6][7] John F. Kennedy attended both games played during his presidency in 1961 and 1962; he was assassinated fifteen days before the 1963 game. Presidents who each attended once include Woodrow Wilson (1913), Calvin Coolidge (1924), Gerald Ford (1974), Bill Clinton (1996), and Barack Obama (2011).[8][7] On October 25, 2023, it was announced that Army would join Navy in the American Athletic Conference (AAC) in football effective in the 2024 season. As part of the arrangement, the Army–Navy Game will remain an out-of-conference date for both schools, and still be played on an annual basis. In the event that the teams possess the two highest win-loss records within the AAC, it is conceivable that they would contend in an AAC Championship game, potentially leading to the occurrence of consecutive Army–Navy Games.[9] The rivalry between Annapolis and West Point, while friendly, is intense. The phrases \"Beat Navy!\" and \"Beat Army!\" are ingrained in the respective institutions and have become a symbol of competitiveness, not just in the Army–Navy Game, but in the service of the country. The phrases are often used at the close of (informal) letters by graduates of both academies. A long-standing tradition at the Army–Navy football game is to conduct a formal \"prisoner exchange\" as part of the pre-game activities. The prisoners are the cadets and midshipmen currently spending the semester studying at the sister academy. After the exchange, students have a brief reprieve to enjoy the game with their comrades.[10] During the pre-game ceremony, the invocation is followed by the American national anthem sung by members of the USMA and USNA choirs.[11] At the end of the game, both teams' almae matres are performed. The winning team stands alongside the losing team and faces the losing academy's students; then the losing team accompanies the winning team, facing their students.[12] This is done in a show of mutual respect and solidarity. Since the winning team's alma mater is always played last, the phrase \"sing second\" has become synonymous with winning the rivalry game. Navy Midshipman (and later Admiral) Joseph Mason Reeves wore what is widely regarded as the first football helmet in the 1893 Army–Navy Game. He had been advised by a Navy doctor that another kick to his head would result in intellectual disability or even death, so he commissioned an Annapolis shoemaker to make him a helmet out of leather.[13] On November 27, 1926, the Army–Navy Game was held in Chicago for the National Dedication of Soldier Field as a monument to American servicemen who had fought in World War I. Navy came to the game undefeated, while Army had only lost to Notre Dame. Played before a crowd of over 100,000, the teams fought to a 21–21 tie, resulting in Navy being awarded a share of the national championship.[14][15] In both the 1944 and 1945 contests, Army and Navy entered the game ranked #1 and #2 respectively.[16] The 1945 game was labeled the \"game of the century\" before it was played. Army (9–0) defeated Navy (7-0-1) with a score of 32–13. Navy's tie was against Notre Dame.[17] In 1963, shortly after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy urged the academies to play after there had been talk of cancellation. Originally scheduled for November 30, 1963, the game was played on December 7, 1963, also coinciding with the 22nd anniversary of Pearl Harbor Day.[18] In front of a crowd of 102,000 people in Philadelphia's Municipal Stadium, later renamed John F. Kennedy Stadium, junior (second class midshipman) quarterback Roger Staubach led number two ranked Navy to victory which clinched a Cotton Bowl national championship matchup with Texas. Army was led by junior (second class cadet) quarterback Rollie Stichweh. Stichweh led off the game with a touchdown drive that featured the first use of instant replay.[19] Army nearly won the game after another touchdown and two point conversion, Stichweh recovered the onside kick and drove the ball to the Navy 2 yard line. On 4th down and no timeouts, crowd noise prevented Stichweh from calling a play and time expired with the 21–15 final score. Staubach won the Heisman Trophy that year and was bumped off the scheduled cover of Life magazine due to the coverage of the assassination. Stichweh and Staubach would meet again in 1964 as seniors where Stichweh's Army would defeat Staubach's Navy. In that game, Calvin Huey of Navy became the first African-American to play in the series.[20] Staubach went on to serve in the Navy and afterward became a Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback with the Dallas Cowboys. Stichweh served five years in Vietnam with the 173rd Airborne Brigade. Stichweh was inducted into the Army Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.[21][22] On December 10, 2016, Army defeated Navy for the first time since 2001 with a 21–17 victory, snapping its 14-game losing streak against Navy. In 2022, Army defeated Navy by a score of 20–17 in double overtime in the first overtime game in the series' history. Only seven games have ever been held on the campus of either academy, primarily because neither team has ever played at an on-campus stadium large enough to accommodate the large crowds that attend. The rivalry's first four games were hosted on the parade grounds of the respective academies. For all but three years since 1899, it has been held at a neutral site. Two were held on campus due to World War II travel restrictions (1942 at Navy's old Thompson Stadium and 1943 at Michie Stadium); and the 2020 game was held at Michie Stadium due to COVID-19 restrictions in Philadelphia. Philadelphia has been the traditional home of the Army–Navy game, due to the historic nature of the city and its location approximately halfway between West Point and Annapolis. Through the 2023 meeting, 90 of the 124 games in the series have been contested in Philadelphia, including every game from 1932 to 1982 except three games that were relocated due to World War II travel restrictions. For decades, the Pennsylvania Railroad and its successors offered game-day service to all Army–Navy games in Philadelphia using a sprawling temporary station constructed each year near Municipal Stadium on the railroad's Greenwich freight yard. The service, with more than 40 trains serving as many as 30,000 attendees, was the single largest concentrated passenger rail movement in the country.[23][24] All games contested in Philadelphia through 1935 were played at what is now Franklin Field, the home field of the University of Pennsylvania. From 1936 through 1979, all games contested in Philadelphia were held at Municipal Stadium, renamed John F. Kennedy Stadium in 1964. From 1980 to 2001, all games contested in Philadelphia took place at Veterans Stadium. Since 2003, all games contested in Philadelphia have been played at Lincoln Financial Field. Outside of Philadelphia, the New York area has been the most frequent Army–Navy site. The Polo Grounds holds the record for most games hosted outside of Philadelphia with nine. It was the location of all New York City games through 1927. Yankee Stadium was the site of the game in 1930 and 1931. Six games have been hosted in New Jersey: 1905 at Osborne Field at Princeton University, four games at Giants Stadium from 1989 to 2002, and 2021 at MetLife Stadium. A number of games throughout the history of the series have also been hosted in Maryland. In Baltimore, Municipal Stadium was the location of the 1924 and 1944 games. Four games were played at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore since 2000. In 2011, the game was played at FedExField in Landover, Maryland. The 2023 game was held at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. The Rose Bowl is the only site west of the Mississippi River where an Army–Navy game has been played, in 1983. Pasadena, California, home to the Rose Bowl, paid for the travel expenses of all the students and supporters of both academies, including 9,437 in all. The game was held at the Rose Bowl that year because there are a large number of military installations and servicemen and women, along with many retired military personnel, on the West Coast.[25] The game has been held one other time in a non-East Coast venue, at Chicago's Soldier Field, which hosted the 1926 game.

                "content": "Odell Cornelious Beckham Jr. (born November 5, 1992), commonly known by his initials OBJ,[1] is an American professional football wide receiver. He played college football for the LSU Tigers and was selected by the New York Giants in the first round of the 2014 NFL draft. Beckham started the 2012 BCS National Championship Game in his first year playing at LSU, and won the Paul Hornung Award following his junior season in 2013. In his first season with the New York Giants, Beckham broke numerous NFL rookie receiving records, despite missing the first four games of the season due to injury. Beckham became the first player to record more than 75 receptions, 1,100 yards, and ten touchdowns in a rookie season, and broke the rookie record for the most average receiving yards per game.[2] During Week 12 of his first season, Beckham came to national attention when he made a one-handed touchdown catch while falling backwards in a Sunday Night Football game against the Dallas Cowboys,[3] which numerous pundits and athletes called the greatest catch ever made.[4] Beckham won the 2014 Offensive Rookie of the Year award. In 2016, he became the fastest player in NFL history to reach both 200 career receptions and 4,000 career receiving yards. In 2016, he recorded his first 100-reception season and reached the NFL playoffs for the first time in his career, after helping the Giants to an 11–5 season record. Beckham was named to the Pro Bowl in each of his first three seasons and has been named a second-team All-Pro twice. After a stint with the Cleveland Browns, Beckham was signed by the Los Angeles Rams midway through the 2021 season. Beckham and the Rams went on to win Super Bowl LVI. He spent the 2022 season out of football while rehabbing an ACL injury he sustained in the Super Bowl before signing with the Baltimore Ravens in 2023. He left Baltimore for the Miami Dolphins in 2024 and mutually agreed to be released in December 2024. Beckham was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.[5] He attended Isidore Newman School in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he was a letterman in football, basketball, and track.[6] In football, he played wide receiver, quarterback, running back, and cornerback for the Greenies football team. As a junior, he caught 45 passes for 743 yards and 10 touchdowns, while also adding three more scores on the ground. As a senior, he hauled in 50 catches for 1,010 yards and 19 touchdowns, joining Cooper Manning as the only two players in school history to record 1,000 receiving yards in a season.[7] In addition, he rushed for 331 yards and six touchdowns, passed for 90 yards and a score and also averaged 30.0 yards per punt return.[8] He was named to the Times Picayune 2011 Blue-Chip list and to the Louisiana 2A All-State first-team as a wide receiver, while he also earned District 9-2A Offensive MVP honors and a spot on The Advocate's Super Dozen.[9] In basketball, Beckham lettered all four years and was an all-district selection his junior and senior years. As a standout track & field athlete, Beckham followed in his mother's footsteps to excel in the sprinting and jumping events while at Newman High. He took silver in the long jump event at the 2010 Newman Invitational, with a career-best leap of 6.83 meters.[10] At the 2010 LA 2A State Meet, he earned sixth-place finishes in both the 200-meter dash, with a PR time of 22.31 seconds, and in the long jump, with a leap of 6.71 meters (21 ft 11 in).[11] He was also a member of the Newman 4 × 100 m and 4 × 200 m relay teams. Beckham also played soccer growing up and considers English player David Beckham his childhood idol.[12] His soccer club coaches offered Beckham a chance to try out for a junior national team program, but he did not want to spend the required time overseas considering his talents in other sports at home.[12] Regarded as a four-star recruit by both Rivals.com and Scout.com, Beckham was rated as the No. 6 wide receiver and as the No. 40 player in the nation. He chose Louisiana State University (LSU) over scholarship offers from Ole Miss, Nebraska, Tulane, and Tulsa, among others.[13] He also played in the 2011 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.[14] As a true freshman at LSU in 2011, Beckham started nine of 14 games. He made his collegiate debut on September 3, 2011, against the #3 Oregon Ducks. Against the Ducks, he had two receptions for 10 yards in the 40–27 victory.[15] Against the #16 West Virginia Mountaineers on September 24, Beckham scored his first career collegiate touchdown, a 52-yard reception from Jarrett Lee, in the 47–21 victory.[16] In the SEC Championship against the #12 Georgia Bulldogs, Beckham was held without a catch but did have two punt returns in the 42–10 victory.[17] The Tigers finished with a 13–0 record and made the BCS National Championship game in Beckham's freshman season.[18] In the game, which was a rematch against the Alabama Crimson Tide, Beckham had five receptions for 38 yards in the 21–0 defeat.[19] Overall, in his freshman season, Beckham finished second on the team with 41 receptions for 475 yards and tied for third with two receiving touchdowns.[20] He was named a freshman All-SEC selection.[21] As a sophomore in 2012, Beckham started 12 of 13 games for the Tigers. In the season opener against the North Texas Mean Green, he had his first collegiate career punt return touchdown, a 70-yard return in the first quarter of the 41–14 victory.[22] On September 29, he had his first career collegiate game with over 100 yards against the Towson Tigers. He had five receptions for 128 yards and two touchdowns in the 38–22 victory over the Tigers.[23] On November 17, against SEC West rival Ole Miss, he was held to only two receptions for 13 yards, but he had an 89-yard punt return touchdown in the fourth quarter help tie the game late. The Tigers would end up beating the Rebels by a score of 41–35.[24] In the regular season finale against the Arkansas Razorbacks, he had four receptions for 112 receiving yards in the 20–13 victory.[25] LSU finished with a 10–2 record and qualified for the Chick-fil-A Bowl against Clemson.[26] Beckham had three receptions for 40 receiving yards as LSU lost 25–24 on a game-winning field goal by Clemson as time expired.[27] He finished first on the team in receiving yards with 713, second in receptions with 43, only behind Jarvis Landry's 56 receptions, and third on the team with two receiving touchdowns.[28] As a junior in 2013, he combined with Jarvis Landry to form one of the most productive wide receiver duos in college football.[29][30] On August 31, in the Tigers' regular season opener, he had five receptions for 118 receiving yards in the 37–27 victory over #20 TCU at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.[31] On September 7, in the game against UAB, Beckham had five receptions for 136 yards and three touchdowns in the 56–17 victory.[32] In the same game, he returned a failed field goal attempt for a record-long 109 yards and a touchdown, and this record would be tied by Auburn's Chris Davis later that year against the Alabama Crimson Tide.[33] On October 5, against SEC West rival Mississippi State, Beckham had nine receptions for a then-career high 179 receiving yards with two touchdowns in the 59–26 victory.[34] Against the Furman Paladins on October 26, Beckham had six receptions for a collegiate career-high 204 yards and two touchdowns in the 48–16 victory.[35] He was a first and second-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection.[36] In his role as a wide receiver and return specialist, Beckham was named the winner of the 2013 Paul Hornung Award, presented annually to the most versatile player in major college football.[37] He finished the 2013 season with 57 receptions for 1,117 yards and eight touchdowns.[38] He led the SEC with 32 kickoff returns for 845 net yards in the 2013 season.[39] After the season, he decided to forgo his senior season and entered the 2014 NFL draft.[40][41] Beckham was selected by the New York Giants with the 12th overall pick in the first round of the 2014 NFL draft.[44] He was the third wide receiver to be selected that year.[45] He signed a four-year contract with the Giants on May 19, 2014. The deal was for $10.4 million with a $5.88 million signing bonus.[46][47] After missing a majority of the training camp, preseason, and the first four games of the season because of a hamstring injury, Beckham made his debut on October 5, 2014, in Week 5 against the Atlanta Falcons recording four receptions for 44 yards and a touchdown in the 30–20 victory.[48] In his first Monday Night Football game against the Indianapolis Colts, Beckham caught eight passes for 156 yards in the 40–24 loss.[49] Against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 10, he caught seven passes for 108 yards in the 38–17 loss.[50] On November 23, 2014, during a game against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday Night Football, Beckham had 10 catches for 146 yards and two touchdowns, including a one-handed touchdown reception hailed as the \"catch of the year\", with Cris Collinsworth, Tony Dungy, Victor Cruz and LeBron James all saying that it was one of the best catches ever.[51][52][53][54][55] Beckham made this catch despite a pass interference penalty called on Dallas cornerback Brandon Carr while diving backwards with full extension of his right hand using only three fingers. The Giants still lost by a score of 31–28 due to a late fourth quarter touchdown throw from Tony Romo to Dez Bryant.[56] On December 8, 2014, the Pro Football Hall of Fame put Beckham's game-worn jersey from his famous one-handed catch game against Dallas on display.[57] Beckham finished November with 38 receptions, 593 receiving yards and two touchdowns.[58] He had at least 90 yards receiving in all five games in November, setting an NFL rookie record for a calendar month.[59] He also broke Bill Groman's and Randy Moss's rookie record for consecutive games with 90 or more receiving yards in a season.[60] In Week 14, Beckham extended his 90 receiving yard streak to 6 games, recording 11 receptions for 131 yards and a touchdown in a 36–7 victory over the Tennessee Titans. He also joined Bill Groman as the only rookies to have over 700 receiving yards in a six-game span.[61] On December 14, 2014, Beckham became the first NFL rookie with at least 12 catches, 140 yards, and three scores in a game racking up 143 receiving yards, 12 catches and three touchdowns.[62] With his 12 receptions, Beckham tied former Giants tight end Mark Bavaro for the most in a game by a Giants rookie; Bavaro had 12 catches against the Cincinnati Bengals on October 13, 1985. Beckham's 143 receiving yards marked the fifth time he topped 100 receiving yards during the 2014 season, extending his own Giants record and setting an NFL rookie record of over 90 receiving yards in seven straight games. With 61 catches over seven games, Beckham also set the record for most ever receptions by an NFL rookie in a seven-game span. On December 21, 2014, Beckham extended his streak of 90 or more receiving yards in game to 8 when he racked up 148 receiving yards on 8 receptions and also hauled in 2 touchdowns vs. St. Louis Rams, including an 80-yard score, the longest touchdown reception by a Giants rookie in franchise history.[63] He also extended his streak of games with 130+ receiving yards and at least one receiving touchdown to three.[64] In the regular season finale against the Philadelphia Eagles, Beckham had a career-high 185 receiving yards, which was the most in a game by a rookie in franchise history.[65] Mark Bavaro previously held the record when he had 176 receiving yards against the Cincinnati Bengals on October 13, 1985.[66] Beckham also had 12 receptions and a receiving touchdown against the Eagles, which tied Torry Holt for most games with at least ten receptions, 100 receiving yards, and one receiving touchdown in a season with four. Beckham finished his impressive rookie campaign with 91 receptions, 1,305 yards and 12 touchdowns in just 12 games. He's the fourth rookie in NFL history to have at least 1,300 receiving yards in a season, and the only rookie to have at least 90 receptions and 10 receiving touchdowns in a season.[67] Beckham was named a first-alternate for the 2015 Pro Bowl.[68] On January 7, 2015, Beckham replaced Calvin Johnson in Pro Bowl due to injury. He was the first Giants rookie wide receiver in franchise history and the first Giants rookie since Jeremy Shockey in 2002 to make the Pro Bowl.[69] He was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team.[70] Beckham revealed after the Pro Bowl game that during the 2014 season he suffered from two hamstring injuries before the season, one occurring in an early-offseason workout and another in a preseason game. Beckham stated, \"I was never fully healthy, I was just trying to manage it and maintain it, It's still not right. [I'm] still working on it.\"[71][72] Beckham earned numerous accolades after the season, which sportswriters hailed as one of the greatest ever by a rookie.[73][74] On January 31, 2015, Beckham was named Offensive Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press.[75] He was also awarded the 2014 Pro Football Writers Association Offensive Rookie of the Year Award.[76] On May 13, 2015, Beckham was voted to the cover of Madden NFL 16, beating out Rob Gronkowski of the New England Patriots.[77] Beckham is the youngest player ever to grace the cover of Madden.[78] Early in the season, Beckham had a strong game against the Falcons with seven receptions for 146 yards and one touchdown in the 24–20 defeat.[79] On October 11, against the San Francisco 49ers, he had seven receptions for 121 yards and a touchdown in the 30–27 victory.[80] In a 52–49 shootout with the New Orleans Saints in Week 8, Beckham had eight receptions for 130 yards and three touchdowns.[81] His performance against the Saints was the first of six consecutive games for him with at least 100 receiving yards. After recording 105 receiving yards against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the following game, he had 104 yards, which included an 87-yard receiving touchdown, in a 27–26 loss to the then-undefeated New England Patriots.[82][83] In the next game, against the Washington Redskins, he had nine receptions for 142 yards and a touchdown.[84] In the next game, a 23–20 loss to the New York Jets, he had six receptions for 149 yards and a touchdown.[85] Against the Miami Dolphins in Week 14, Beckham had a season-high 166 yards receiving and two touchdowns in the 31–24 victory.[86] During the Week 15 game against the Carolina Panthers, Beckham was involved in multiple confrontations with cornerback Josh Norman. During the matchup, Beckham was flagged for four penalties, including three personal foul penalties. Beckham was held to no receptions in the first half, but he finished the game with six receptions for 76 receiving yards, which included a game-tying touchdown as the Giants lost to the Panthers by a score of 38–35.[87][88] On December 21, 2015, the NFL Disciplinary Committee suspended Beckham one game without pay for multiple violations of safety-related playing rules.[89] He appealed the decision, but the suspension was upheld.[90] In 15 games, Beckham finished the season with career highs of 1,450 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns.[91] The Giants finished with a 6–10 record and missed the playoffs.[92] He was a Pro Bowl selection for a second year in a row and was ranked 10th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[93] Beckham entered the 2016 season with a new head coach, Ben McAdoo, after Tom Coughlin resigned from his position as the Giants' head coach.[94] On September 17, Beckham was fined $12,154 for a dance-celebration during Week 1 against the Cowboys.[95] On September 25, he was fined $36,000 for a blindside hit on safety Kenny Vaccaro in Week 2 against the Saints.[96] During Week 3 against the Redskins, featuring Josh Norman, Beckham became the fastest player to reach 200 receptions by doing so in only 30 games. He finished the game with seven receptions for 121 receiving yards as the Giants lost a close game 27–29.[97][98][99][100] In Week 6, Beckham caught eight passes for a career-high 222 yards with two touchdowns against the Baltimore Ravens, leading the Giants to a 27–23 victory.[101] In Week 13 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he had ten receptions for 100 receiving yards in the 24–14 loss.[102] In Week 16, against the Eagles, he had 11 receptions for 150 receiving yards in the 24–19 loss.[103] In 2016, Beckham started all 16 games for the first time in his career and finished with 101 receptions, which was a career-high, 1,367 receiving yards, and ten touchdowns.[104] He was a Pro Bowl selection for a third year in a row.[105] The Giants finished 11–5 in 2016, clinching a Wild Card spot, and returned to the playoffs for the first time since 2011, but lost 13–38 to the Green Bay Packers in the Wild Card Round. Beckham had four receptions for 28 yards in the loss.[106] After the game, a frustrated Beckham punched a hole in the wall in the visiting teams' locker room. The Giants agreed to pay for damages and repairs were done ten days later.[107] He was ranked eighth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[108] On April 24, 2017, the Giants exercised Beckham's fifth-year option.[109] In the preseason, Beckham suffered an ankle sprain against the Cleveland Browns.[110] Due to the injury, Beckham missed the regular season opener, but returned in Week 2 against the Detroit Lions, finishing with 36 receiving yards as the Giants lost 10–24.[111][112] In the next game against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had 79 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns,[113] and was fined $12,154 for a celebration.[114] During Week 5 against the Los Angeles Chargers, Beckham finished with 97 receiving yards and a touchdown until leaving the game with an apparent leg injury.[115] It was later revealed that he suffered a fractured left ankle.[116] Beckham underwent surgery to repair the fracture, keeping him out the remainder of the 2017 season after being placed on injured reserve.[117] In four games, Beckham finished the 2017 season with 25 receptions for 302 yards and three touchdowns.[118][119] Despite only playing four games, he was still ranked 77th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.[120] On August 27, 2018, Beckham signed a five-year, $95 million contract extension with the Giants with $41 million fully guaranteed with a total of $65 million in guarantees.[121] In his first game back from injury, he recorded 11 receptions for 111 yards in the season-opening 20–15 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.[122] After the Week 3 27–22 win over the Houston Texans, Beckham surpassed Lionel Taylor (319) for the most receptions by a player through his first 50 career games with 337 catches (he would be passed by Michael Thomas in 2019).[123][124] During Week 5 against the Panthers, Beckham threw a pass to rookie Saquon Barkley that went for a 57-yard touchdown.[125] In addition, Beckham finished with eight receptions for 131 receiving yards as the Giants lost 31–33.[126] He became the first player since David Patten in 2001 and only the fourth since 1950 to record a passing touchdown of at least 50 yards while having at least 100 receiving yards in the same game.[127] In Week 7, on Monday Night Football, he had eight receptions for 143 yards and a touchdown in the 23–20 loss to the Falcons.[128] He followed that up with eight receptions for 136 yards in a 20–13 loss to the Redskins.[129] In Week 10 against the 49ers, Beckham had four catches for 73 yards and two touchdowns in the 27–23 win.[130] In Week 13 against the Chicago Bears, Beckham had three catches for 35 yards and a touchdown. He also threw a 49-yard touchdown pass to Russell Shepard in the 30–27 win.[131] He became the first non-quarterback with multiple passing touchdowns in a season since Antwaan Randle El in 2010.[132] In addition, he became the first player to record multiple games with a touchdown pass and a receiving touchdown in a single season since Eddie Kaw and Benny Boynton accomplished the feat for the 1924 Buffalo Bisons.[133] Beckham was inactive for the final four games of the season due to a quad injury.[134] He finished the season with 77 receptions, 1,052 yards, six touchdowns, and threw two passes for touchdowns.[135] He was ranked 23rd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[136] On March 13, 2019, Beckham was acquired by the Browns, along with Olivier Vernon, in exchange for Jabrill Peppers, Kevin Zeitler, and the Browns' first- and third-round picks in the 2019 NFL draft.[137] In Beckham's first game with the Browns, he caught seven passes for 71 yards as the Browns lost at home to the Titans 43–13.[138] In Week 2 against the Jets, Beckham finished with 161 receiving yards, including a one-handed grab for 33 yards and later, an 89-yard touchdown as the Browns won 23–3 in his first game back at MetLife Stadium since being traded.[139] In Week 4 against the Ravens, Beckham was limited to only two receptions for 20 yards in the 40–25 win.[140] Late in the third quarter, Beckham threw a punch at Ravens' cornerback Marlon Humphrey who then responded by choking Beckham. After the game, Browns' head coach Freddie Kitchens was displeased with the fact that Humphrey was not ejected for choking Beckham and said that \"they get away with it because it's Odell,\" but the Ravens released a close-up video after the game that showed Humphrey had two fists full of jersey and did not touch Beckham Jr.'s neck.[141] After the game, Humphrey apologized to Beckham and said that his response to Beckham was not a brand of football he wanted to represent.[142] On October 5, 2019, Beckham was fined $14,037, as was Humphrey.[143] In Week 6 against the Seahawks, Beckham caught six passes for 101 yards in the 32–28 loss.[144] Days after the game, he was fined $14,037 by the NFL for uniform violation.[145] In Week 9, Beckham wore Joker-inspired cleats against the Denver Broncos, which violated the NFL's policy on cleat colors. He was required to change the cleats during halftime.[146][147] In Week 12 against the Dolphins, Beckham caught six passes for 84 yards and his second touchdown of the season in the 41–24 win.[148] On December 8, it was revealed that Beckham was battling with a sports hernia.[149] In Week 17 against the Bengals, Beckham caught three passes for 81 yards and a touchdown in the 33–23 loss. During the game, Beckham surpassed 1,000 receiving yards on the season for the fifth time in his career.[150] On January 21, 2020, Beckham underwent core muscle surgery.[151] He was ranked 59th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[152] In Week 2 against the Bengals, Beckham caught four passes for 74 yards and his first receiving touchdown of the season during the 35–30 win.[153] In Week 4, against the Cowboys, he had five receptions for 81 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns to go along with 73 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 49–38 victory, amassing 154 total yards and 3 touchdowns on the day.[154] The rushing touchdown occurred late in the fourth quarter as the Browns were trying to stop a furious comeback attempt by the Cowboys. The touchdown helped put the Browns up by 11, effectively sealing the game.[155] In Week 7 against the Bengals, Beckham left the game in the first quarter with a knee injury and did not return after trying to tackle Darius Phillips following an interception.[156][157][158] The next day, it was revealed that Beckham suffered a torn ACL, prematurely ending his season.[159][160] He was placed on injured reserve on October 27, 2020.[161] Beckham finished the 2020 season with 23 catches for 319 yards and three receiving touchdowns plus three rushes for 72 yards and a rushing touchdown in seven games played.[162] After being excused from two practices earlier in the week following outrage on social media by Beckham's father over the way Beckham was being used in the Browns offense, the Browns released a statement on November 5, 2021, saying that they would be releasing Beckham.[163] He was waived on November 8.[164] Beckham signed a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Rams on November 11, 2021.[165] Beckham played in eight regular season games for the Rams in 2021. He scored a touchdown in five of the games. He finished the season with 44 receptions for 537 receiving yards to go along with the five touchdowns.[166] Beckham scored his first career playoff touchdown on January 17, 2022, in the Wild Card Game against the Arizona Cardinals.[167] In the NFC Championship Game, Beckham caught nine passes for 113 yards in the 20–17 win against the 49ers, helping the Rams advance to Super Bowl LVI. Beckham had a key reception for a first down on the fourth-quarter drive to help set up the Rams' game-tying field goal.[168][169] In the Super Bowl against the Bengals, Beckham scored the game's first touchdown, a 17-yard reception.[170] However, Beckham left the game in the second quarter with a knee injury and did not return.[171] The Rams would hang on to win 23–20, earning Beckham his first career Super Bowl championship.[172] The next day, it was revealed that Beckham suffered a torn ACL, less than a year and a half since he first tore it with Cleveland in October 2020, coincidentally also against the Bengals.[173] He was ranked 90th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[174] Beckham spent the off-season recovering from his ACL injury, and there was significant speculation about whether he would re-sign with Los Angeles or sign with another team. Despite still being unsigned by a team, Beckham participated in the Rams' championship banner ceremony before their opening night game against the Buffalo Bills at SoFi Stadium on September 8, 2022.[175] Ultimately, Beckham did not sign with a team during the 2022 season.[176] On April 9, 2023, Beckham signed a one-year contract with the Baltimore Ravens.[177][178][179] He caught his first touchdown with the Ravens on his 31st birthday in a 37–3 Week 9 rout of the Seattle Seahawks.[180] In Week 11, he had four receptions for 116 yards, which was his first 100+ yard receiving game since 2021, in a 34–20 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.[181] In the 2023 season, he appeared in 14 games and started six. He recorded 35 receptions for 565 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns.[182] On March 13, 2024, Beckham was released by the Ravens.[183] On May 8, 2024, Beckham signed a one-year contract with the Miami Dolphins.[184] He was placed on the reserve/PUP list to begin the season after needing surgery to address an unspecified injury.[185] He was activated on October 5.[186] On December 13, Beckham and the Dolphins mutually agreed for Beckham to be waived.[187] Prior to his release, he played in nine games, totaling nine catches for 55 yards.[188] Beckham has a younger brother and a younger sister.[226][227] In 2024, Beckham’s brother, Kordell Beckham, became the winner of reality dating competition show Love Island USA season 6.[228] Beckham's father, Odell Beckham Sr., was a standout running back at Marshall High School in Marshall, Texas,[229] and played running back at LSU from 1989 to 1992. Beckham Sr. was also mentioned in Buzz Bissinger's 1990 book Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream.[230][231] Beckham's mother, Heather Van Norman, also attended LSU as a track runner.[232] In 1993, she ran for three national championship relay teams, winning the events of indoor and outdoor 4 × 400 m and the outdoor 4 × 100 m relay.[233] When Van Norman found out she was pregnant with Beckham in 1992, she was in the midst of training for the Olympic trials.[234] She later became the coach of the Nicholls State University track and field team. She resigned from this position on June 1, 2017.[235] After the NFL Combine, Beckham planned on challenging Van Norman to a race in the 40-yard dash.[236] Beckham is or has been friends with many celebrities, including David Beckham (no relation), James Corden, Beyoncé, LeBron James, Drake,[237] and David Alaba, who is also his favorite soccer player.[238] Beckham is a Christian.[239] In the summer of 2018, Beckham was baptized in the Jordan River.[240][241] On January 29, 2015, during a live ESPN broadcast from Glendale, Arizona, Beckham partnered with New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees to establish a new world record for the most one-handed catches made in a minute. He shattered the previous record of 10 as he caught 33 passes.[242] However, this achievement was short lived as CFL wide receiver Andy Fantuz recorded 50 one-handed catches in a minute to set the new world record.[243] On February 17, 2022 Beckham and his partner Lauren Wood's first child, a son, was born. [244] On November 27, 2022, Beckham refused to put on his seatbelt and was escorted off an American Airlines flight before it left Miami bound for Los Angeles. The crew tried to wake him up but said that he was unresponsive and \"appeared to be coming in and out of consciousness\". The plane returned to the gate, where he refused to deplane, whereupon all passengers were required to deplane and he was escorted off the plane by Miami-Dade Police. He was later banned from all future flights on American Airlines.[245] Beckham has raised money and awareness for several topics, including cancer research, feeding hungry Americans, damage done by Hurricane Harvey and severe floods, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. In May 2017, Beckham and Nike signed the largest endorsement contract in NFL history worth $25 million over five years. The contract includes incentives allowing Beckham to extend it to eight years and $48 million.[251] Beckham also has sponsorship deals with Head & Shoulders,[252] Foot Locker, Lenovo,[253] and Daniel Wellington.[254] Beckham has invested in a number of startups, including in the esports[255][256] and fintech industries.[257] In March 2021, Beckham became a strategic advisor to a SPAC sponsored by Tribe Capital.[258] Beckham has been involved with a number of television productions. In 2015, he was part of Catching Odell,[259] which was a TV movie that gave a behind-the-scenes point of view at his preparations and training for the upcoming season. In 2016, he made his television debut in Code Black.[260] In 2018, alongside his then-Giants teammate Brad Wing, he appeared in the music video for the Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande song \"Bed\".[261]",

He plays for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). He has also played for the New York Giants, Cleveland Browns, Baltimore ravens, and Los Angeles Rams. He played college football with the LSU Tigers. In 2022, he won Super Bowl LVI as a member of the Rams. They defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20. He was recruited out of Isidore Newman as a three-year recruit by ESPN and a four-star recruit by both Rivals.com and Scout.com.[1][2][3] Beckham started his career by playing college football at Louisiana State University for the Tigers. He caught his first college touchdown in a 47–21 against the West Virginia Mountaineers on September 24, 2011.[4] Beckham helped the Tigers defeat the Georgia Bulldogs 42–10 in the SEC Championship Game. The Tigers would go on to lose 21–0 against the Alabama Crimson Tide in the BCS National Championship game with Beckham earned 38 yards with five receptions.[5] He was awarded the Paul Hornung Award in 2013 as both a wide receiver and return specialist.[6] On January 5, 2014, Beckham said that he was going to enter the 2014 NFL Draft.[7] On May 8, 2014, the New York Giants drafted Beckham with the 12th pick in the first round of the 2014 NFL Draft.[8] On October 5, 2014, Beckham made his NFL debut in a 30–20 win against the Atlanta Falcons, scoring his first NFL touchdown in the game.[9] On November 23, 2014, during a game against the Dallas Cowboys, Beckham made a one-handed catch. It was called the catch of the year and is considered to be one of the greatest catches of all time.[10][11] On March 13, 2019, the Giants traded Beckham along with Olivier Vernon to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for Jabrill Peppers, Kevin Zeitler, and a first and third round pick from the Browns in the 2019 NFL Draft.[12] On November 11, 2021, Beckham signed with the Los Angeles Rams as a free agent.[13] On February 13, 2022, Beckham and the Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 to win Super Bowl LVI.[14] He left in the second quarter of the game because he tore his ACL for the second time in his career.[15] On April 9, 2023, Beckham signed a one-year; $18 million contract to play for the Baltimore Ravens.[16]",

                "content": "Senior News Writer Odell Beckham Jr. is on to the next opportunity. The Dolphins and the former Pro Bowl receiver mutually agreed to part ways, NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero reported Friday, per sources informed of the situation. Pelissero added that OBJ is hoping for more opportunities elsewhere, and the Dolphins are granting his release. Miami has since announced the news. \"Conversations led us to determining that it was the best for both parties,\" Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel told reporters Friday. \"I wish him the best and I'll be rooting for him.\" Beckham's release on Friday will keep him on waivers until Monday. He is owed roughly $200,000 for the balance of the season and is not close to the incentives in the deal. If he clears waivers, Beckham would be free to sign with any club. The 32-year-old signed a one-year contract in May worth $3 million to be the third threat behind Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle in the passing game. The production never materialized. Beckham started the season on the physically unable to perform list after offseason surgery. He was finally activated on Oct. 5. The wideout didn't have a catch in his first three games while playing just 33 snaps over that span. OBJ has nine catches for 55 yards on 18 targets with zero touchdowns for the season. He never seemed to fit as a third-fiddle in Miami, particularly with the increased usage of tight end Jonnu Smith. Moving on from Beckham clears the path for rookie Malik Washington to continue as the No. 3 receiver unimpeded. In the past four seasons, Beckham has played in 37 games, earning 88 total receptions for 1,157 yards and eight touchdowns. He missed the entire 2022 campaign due to a knee injury. His production and injury history don't suggest there is much left in the tank at this point. The last time he was consistently productive was the postseason run to Super Bowl LVI with Los Angeles, during which he suffered an ACL tear. One of his former clubs -- Rams, Ravens -- could take a flier on the receiver as they gear up for potential playoff runs. Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert (thigh/ankle) is off the team's injury report ahead of Sunday's Week 15 game against Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Kenneth Walker III (calf) is doubtful for Seattle's Week 15 date with the Green Bay Packers, meaning the Seahawks could need backup Zach Charbonnet to step up in a big way once again. San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan announced Friday the team has released De'Vondre Campbell one day after the linebacker refused to enter the game in the third quarter of the 49ers' 12-6 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow (right wrist/left knee) is off the team's injury report heading into the Week 15 matchup against the Tennessee Titans. Commanders cornerback Marshon Lattimore is set to make his debut with the team on Sunday after a midseason trade more than a month ago. Doing so in New Orleans, the Pro Bowler said it's \"extra motivation\" playing against the Saints, his former team.

The Broncos inked Garett Bolles to a four-year, $82 million contract extension with $42 million guaranteed. The contract keeps Bolles in Denver through the 2028 season, which would be his 12th NFL season. San Francisco 49ers receiver Deebo Samuel had a chance for a game-altering touchdown but dropped the ball. The Los Angeles Rams won their third consecutive game against NFC West rivals San Francisco on Thursday night in a 12-6 tussle. It marked the first time since 2018 that the Rams swept the season series. Linebacker De'Vondre Campbell refused to enter the game in the third quarter of the 49ers' 12-6 loss to the Rams, head coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters after the game, and the veteran's status on the team appears uncertain at best. It was the Rams' defense, aided by some splash plays from Puka Nacua and the foot of rookie kicker Joshua Karty, that kept L.A.'s postseason hopes alive with a victory over the 49ers on Thursday night.",

Also, btw, CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING NAMED TIME MAGAZINE'S PERSON OF THE YEAR FOR 2023! That's kind of never-been-done-before-vibes. For a 33-year-old! Tay, be so honest with me. Do you think I too can become a billionaire in the next 6 calendar years? And that's not even to mentionTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour concert movie which ALSO broke box office records for first-day ticket sales and grossing more than $200 million at the global box office.

But I'm sure you won't... you sneaky, secretive, little surprise girl! IDK but that seems like something you would do. Admit it! 🤭 If ANYONE has the power to do THAT particular thing, girl.... it's you. No offence. Because I was THERE when you spoke of it at the \"In Conversation With... Taylor Swift\" event at TIFF on Friday, September 9, 2022. And when I say \"I was there,\" I mean that I was absolutely outside, barred from entry, and screaming in the streets, waiting to catch even a glimpse of you. And you looked STUNISTA in that GOLDEN Oscar-statue-esque gown queen! Foreshadowing, perhaps? I know you don't go to that since *whispers*... buzzcut and bleach-blond hair era...

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Megan Cerullo Edited By Anne Marie Lee Updated on: December 13, 2024 / 4:22 PM EST / CBS News Macy's said it will close 65 stores this year, an increase from the 50 locations it previously announced it would shutter by the end of the fiscal year. The closures are part of its plan to eliminate roughly 150 underperforming stores over the next three years. The department store chain made the update public in its third quarter earnings call Wednesday. \"We now expect to close roughly 65 locations this year,\" Macy's CEO Tony Spring said on the call. \"In line with our typical cadence, closures will occur post holiday. Macy's had delayed reporting its third-quarter earnings after an employee hid up to $151 million in expenses related to delivering small packages. The retailer, which also owns Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, last month said it discovered the accounting issue on one of its accrual accounts while preparing its quarterly financial statements. The company revealed new details on the incident Wednesday, saying that an independent investigation found that \"a single employee with responsibility for small package delivery expense accounting intentionally made erroneous accounting accrual entries and falsified underlying documentation,\" according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Adrian Mitchel, chief operating officer and chief financial officer at Macy's, said the error \"was not theft\" and that \"there was no impact to revenues, and there was no impact to cash or inventories as all vendors were fully paid.\" The company said is overhauling its controls over financial reporting. Macy's isn't alone in shuttering brick-and-mortar locations. The retailer's acceleration of store closures comes as department stores struggle, with fewer shoppers visiting malls and more Americans making purchases online. U.S. retailers have announced more than 7,100 store closures through the end of November 2024. That represents a 69% jump from the same time last year, according to recent data from research firm CoreSight. Forty-five retailers have filed for bankruptcy protection so far this year, compared with 25 retail bankruptcies in all of 2023, the report found. Macy's, meanwhile, is betting on the success of its other brands, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. It plans to open 15 Bloomingdale's stores and 30 Bluemercury locations over the next three years, while also remodeling about 30 existing Bluemercury stores, the company said. Macy's stock has dropped roughly 20% over the past year.

                "content": "Macy’s has decided to expedite its planned store closures for this year as part of its efforts to revitalize its ailing business. The company remains committed to closing 150 stores over a three-year period as part of its strategic initiative called “A Bold New Chapter,” introduced in February. Here’s what’s happening with this iconic retailer: CEO Tony Spring announced that Macy’s now expects to close approximately 65 stores in 2024, exceeding the initial estimate of 50 announced earlier in the year. However, Spring clarified that these closures will take place after the holiday season. ALSO READ Tourism marketing trends in 2025: How will travel change? The company plans to reduce its store network to 350 locations once all scheduled closures are completed. Simultaneously, it intends to open around 45 new Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury locations, as these brands continue to experience growth in sales. Scheduled Store Closures for 2024: CFO Adrian Mitchell emphasized that the closures are focused exclusively on underperforming locations. The primary goal is to consolidate a network of stores capable of delivering sustainable and profitable growth for the company. Mitchell explained that these closures involve locations where customers have shifted their shopping to other centers, making them particularly challenging to operate. He also noted that only a small number of the closed stores are in single-store markets. This is significant, he added, because in a business model combining physical and digital operations, having both presences tends to enhance profitability. As part of its strategy, the company has prioritized the renovation of 50 key stores, known as the “First 50,” which will serve as a blueprint for the next generation of Macy’s stores. Adrian Mitchell highlighted the positive results from these stores, which saw a 1.9% increase in sales during the third quarter. Additionally, Macy’s plans to open nine new stores and renovate two more during the fourth quarter. Macy’s, a well-known department store chain with a presence across the United States, has been a trailblazer in the retail industry. The company made history by introducing innovations such as animated holiday window displays and installing the first escalator inside a department store. The company was founded in 1858 by Rowland Hussey Macy, a Massachusetts native. After his passing, the company changed ownership several times and was acquired by the Straus brothers in 1893. Macy’s operates an outlet store called Backstage, offering customers incredible deals and discounts. Macy’s, Inc. owns the department store chains Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, as well as Bluemercury, a beauty specialty chain, all of which have flagship locations in Manhattan. This department store offers a wide range of brands in categories like clothing, footwear, cosmetics, and more for the whole family. Some of the top brands available include: Affordable clothing can be purchased online from U.S. retailers such as Macy’s or GAP, which offer below-average prices and items with original designs. ⇒ SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CONTENT ON GOOGLE NEWS Cancela en cualquier momento Acceso exclusivo a rankings y radiografías.

                "title": "Macy's accelerates store closures, will shutter 65 stores this year",
                "content": "Macy's is closing more stores than it originally announced earlier this year. According to the company's third quarter earnings report, the department store chain is expected to close 65 locations by the end of the year, an increase from the 50 locations the company said it would close by the end of the fiscal year in February. \"We now expect to close roughly 65 locations this year,\" said Macy's CEO Tony Spring in the earnings call. \"In line with our typical cadence, closures will occur post holiday.\" The retail giant said in February that by 2026, it planned to shut down 150 \"unproductive\" stores, or roughly 30% of all its locations, while prioritizing investments in 350 \"go-forward\" stores. Macy's also said at the time the move, dubbed as \"A Bold New Chapter,\" will allow it to focus its resources and prioritize other stores. “A Bold New Chapter serves as a strong call to action. It challenges the status quo to create a more modern Macy’s, Inc,\" said Tony Spring, Macy’s CEO, in a statement in February. \"We are making the necessary moves to reinvigorate relationships with our customers through improved shopping experiences, relevant assortments and compelling value.\" Despite the planned shuttering of Macy's locations, the company says it also wants to expand Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury by 45 locations altogether, signaling increased investment in the luxury sector. The company announced earlier this year plans for about 15 Bloomingdale's stores and at least 30 Bluemercury locations in the next three years. About 30 Bluemercury stores are set for remodeling, as well. In the third quarter earnings report, the company says it has remodeled five Bluemercury locations and opened nine new locations so far this year. Latest on Macy's employee: Macy's says employee who allegedly hid $150 million in expenses had no major 'impact' Macy's third quarter earnings report also further addressed any potential impact on its financial performance after an employee allegedly hid $151 million in delivery expenses over a nearly three-year period. The company stated that after it completed an independent investigation into the matter, it was determined that there was \"no material impact to financial results for any historical annual or interim period.\" In late November, Macy's announced that an employee \"with responsibility for small package delivery expense accounting intentionally made erroneous accounting accrual entries\" to hide between $132 million to $154 million of total delivery expenses from the fourth quarter of 2021 through the fiscal quarter that ended Nov. 2, according to the department store chain's press release. Throughout the alleged conduct, Macy's recorded about $4.36 billion in delivery expenses, the company said, adding that there was no indication that \"the erroneous accounting accrual entries had any impact on the company’s cash management activities or vendor payments.\" The individual accused of hiding millions of dollars is no longer employed with the company, according to the release. Also, an independent investigation has not identified any other employee involved in the alleged misconduct, the retailer said. Julia is a trending reporter for USA TODAY.

                "content": "The department store chain announced that 50 locations will be shutting down by the end of this year alone. We've been independently researching and testing products for over 120 years. If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission. Learn more about our review process. It may be time to say goodbye to your local Macy's. The department store chain has announced plans to close approximately 150 stores across the country through 2026, including 50 locations this year alone. Macy's described the stores set to be shuttered as \"underproductive locations.\" While the brand has not yet released a full list of the Macy's stores that are closing, one of these locations has been confirmed by San Francisco Mayor London Breed's office as Macy's Union Square flagship store (though it will remain open indefinitely until the property is sold). In a statement released on February 27, Macy's revealed its new strategy — coined as \"A Bold New Chapter\" — will include closing the 150 stores and prioritizing investments in the remaining 350 locations. The strategy will also include opening new Bloomingdale's locations and Bluemercury stores, which are Macy's luxury brands. Macy's, Inc. is hoping this move will re-strengthen the company's brand, digital presence and relationship with customers. According to Macy's, the strategy aims to solidify Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury's positions in the luxury space by opening more physical locations and offering more immersive customer experiences. Tony Spring, who stepped into his position as the chief executive officer of Macy's in February, said in the statement: This isn't the first time Macy's has announced unfortunate news about store closings in recent years. The department store chain has closed roughly 300 stores since 2015, including closing 45 Macy's locations in 2021 and 28 locations in 2020. In January, Macy’s announced it was laying off about 3.5% of its workforce (around 2,350 employees) and closing five stores. The \"Bold New Chapter\" strategy includes focusing remaining resources on top-performing stores in order to improve customer shopping experiences and sales. The recent store closures and downsizing can be attributed to multiple factors (ahem, online shopping), but experts say the drop in the company's stock price most likely drove the plans to refocus on currently successful locations and luxury brands. Macy's stock price peaked at $73 a share in 2015, but nine years later it's dropped to $18 a share — that's a whopping 75% decrease. \"Our threshold to keep a store open has become more stringent,\" Spring said in a conference call with investors, per CBS News. \"In the past we may have continued to operate a store that was cash flow positive. Now the bar has been raised.\" Including the store closures announced in January, here is a list of the Macy's stores facing closure this year. Note: This list will be updated as more store closures are officially announced. Luckily for loyal shoppers, the remaining 350 Macy's locations will be reinvested in and improved upon — and if it turns out your local store is set to close and you're in need of a new dress or bottle of perfume, there's always Macys.com.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy A 'Barron's Roundtable' panel provides insight on investing in Macy's, Nordstrom and Gilead Sciences. Macy's, which launched a comprehensive strategy to revive its struggling business, on Wednesday announced that it is accelerating its planned store closures for the year. CEO Tony Spring told analysts during an earnings call that Macy’s now expects to close about 65 locations this year, up from its previous forecast of 50 announced at the start of the year. However, Spring added that the \"closures will occur post holiday.\" The company is still on track with its plans to close 150 locations over three years as part of its strategy dubbed, a \"Bold New Chapter,\" that was announced in February. MACY'S SAYS EMPLOYEE ‘INTENTIONALLY’ HID UP TO $154M IN EXPENSES The goal, according to Spring, is to get to a fleet that \"can provide sustainable, profitable growth for the enterprise.\" CFO Adrian Mitchell reiterated that the company is only closing under performing stores. A woman shops at Macy's Herald Square in New York City on Nov. 25, 2022. (Reuters/Brendan McDermid / Reuters Photos) \"These are places where the economics are not as favorable. These are places where customers have shifted away from those centers to shop. And these are stores that are just incredibly difficult to run. So I'll just start with that fundamental premise,\" Mitchell said. He continued, saying that \"very few of the stores are actually in single-store markets. And the reason that's important is because in an omni-business, we continue to see that when we have a physical presence and a digital presence, by far, we have the best economics.\" MACY'S WILL CLOSE THESE FIVE STORES FOLLOWING LAYOFFS OF MORE THAN 2,300 EMPLOYEES The company previously announced it would be down to 350 stores once all the planned closures are implemented. It also said it would simultaneously add approximately 45 Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury locations. Both brands have continued to show growth in sales. Part of the company's strategy includes revamping 50 key stores, also known as the \"First 50,\" which it aims to use as a model for the next generation of Macy’s locations. Mitchell said the company is already encouraged by the performance of the \"First 50\" stores. Sales at those stores rose 1.9% during the third quarter. On Wednesday, Spring said the company plans to open an additional nine new stores and remodel two more stores in the fourth quarter.

While the storm is taking longer to arrive in the state, meteorologist still expect widespread issues. It will be difficult to travel, particularly in central and northern Iowa due to accumulating ice. Wind chill forecasts will be in the single digits to mid-teens during Friday and get warmer as the weekend goes on, according to the National Weather Service. An ice storm warning means that ice accumulation of at least one-fourth of an inch is expected, according to the National Weather Service. It is one of three types of winter warnings issued by local offices. A freezing rain advisory means an ice accumulation of up to one-fourth of an inch is expected. Winter weather advisories are issued for three reasons one being freezing rain, according to NWS. An area stretching from Grinnell up to Waterloo and through the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City area will be under an ice storm warning. This area can expect an accumulation of around a quarter of an inch of ice. On Friday afternoon, the National Weather Service extended the warning father south, reaching to Ottumwa. The warning begins at 8 p.m. on Friday and continues until noon on Saturday. Portions of central to eastern Iowa can expect the most accumulation with totals in places like Grinnell, Cedar Rapids and Waterloo ranging from a quarter to half an inch of ice. Des Moines, Ames and most other areas can expect around 0.1 to 0.25 inches of ice accumulation. Des Moines is expected to accumulate up to 0.25 inches of ice Friday and into Saturday. It will hit the Des Moines metro around 7 p.m. Friday, according to NWS. Friday started with sub-zero wind chills in Des Moines. It is expected to gradually warm throughout the day, with wind chills around 14 degrees by 6 p.m. and 22 degrees at midnight. The storm has slowed down during the day on Friday, meaning Iowans will have more time to get home before freezing rain begins. The predicted ice rain is expected to start between 5 and 7 p.m. in southwestern Iowa. Meanwhile, central and northern Iowa will see freezing rain arriving after 7 p.m. Friday. The storm is expected to hit eastern Iowa around 10 p.m. Here's a look at the current central Iowa radar from the National Weather Service: Along with frozen rain, Iowa will see sub-zero wind chills throughout Friday morning and low temperatures during the day. Temperatures with wind chill will barely crack into single digits by noon in central Iowa and remain in the low double digits into the evening. Travel will become hazardous Friday night and into Saturday, according to NWS. Branches and power lines could become icy and winds up to 20 mph could cause icy tree limbs to break or power outages. More:How to check Iowa road conditions and DOT cameras when winter weather arrives The National Weather Service recommends avoiding exposure to the cold and dressing in warm layers to protect exposed skin. For those who are traveling, pack a winter safety kit and keep aware of the forecast as well as road conditions. Also, keep pets in warm shelters. Drivers should also check road conditions before heading out. The Iowa Department of Transportation reminded Iowans that ice forms most quickly on bridges and overpasses since they are exposed to cold air on all sides. Des Moines Public Schools won't host any evening activities on Friday due to the freezing rain forecast. The district is also rescheduling an ACT test session, it said on social media.

The criteria for this warning vary from state to state, but typically an ice storm warning will be issued any time more than 1⁄4 inch (6.4 mm) of ice at peak is expected to accumulate in an area, else a freezing rain or drizzle advisory is issued; in some areas, the criterion is 1⁄2 inch (13 mm) instead.[1] Prior to October 2017, a freezing rain advisory or freezing drizzle advisory was issued when a small amount of icing was possible.

                "content": "Hundreds of thousands of people across Iowa are braced for extremely icy weather as temperatures plummet. An \"Ice Storm Warning\" has been issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) for 12 counties across Iowa, with residents being warned not to travel due to \"significant icing.\" This warning affects Benton, Black Hawk, Buchanan, Cedar, Grundy, Iowa, Jasper, Johnson, Linn, Marshall, Poweshiek, and Tama counties. The warning comes into effect this evening, and will last into Saturday afternoon. The NWS Quad Cities office notes that this is the first Ice Storm Warning they have issued in 658 days. \"Significant icing expected. Total ice accumulations between two tenths and three tenths of an inch, and snow and sleet accumulations up to one inch,\" the National Weather Service Des Moines office said in the warning. An ice storm is defined by the NWS as weather where \"damaging accumulations of ice are expected during freezing rain situations,\" with an Ice Storm Warning being issued when \"more than 1/4\" of ice is expected to accumulate in an area.\" This icy and windy weather is feared to cause tree damage or power outages and residents are advised not to drive due to slippery roads. \"Travel could be nearly impossible as roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will become slick and hazardous tonight into Saturday morning,\" the National Weather Service Des Moines office said. \"Travel is strongly discouraged. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency.\" Travel impacts are expected Fri eve into Sat AM from freezing rain/drizzle. Ice amounts 0.10\" or less, but amounts up to 0.20\" are possible north of I-80. Freezing rain transitions to rain south to north as temps warm overnight into Sat AM. Impacts linger longest in N. IA on Sat. pic.twitter.com/Rf8FhDzKx9 The sidewalks may also be icy, so locals are warned to take care when walking outside. \"If you are going outside, watch your first few steps taken on stairs, sidewalks and driveways. These surfaces could be icy and slippery, increasing your risk of a fall and injury,\" the National Weather Service Des Moines office said. This ice storm is driven by changing wind directions and extremely cold temperatures. \"This trend toward more icing is driven by a slower arrival of above freezing surface temperatures and wet bulb temperatures that prolong the icing,\" the National Weather Service Des Moines office said in a forecast discussion. Freezing rain is expected to develop towards midnight late Friday night. It will change over to all rain from south to north between daybreak and noon Saturday. Icy conditions are expected. Allow extra time and check road conditions before driving. pic.twitter.com/UzjWNlNIQo A winter weather advisory has also been issued across the rest of Iowa, as well as parts of Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin. This is expected to bring heavy snow and ice to some areas—and may also make for risky travel. \"Plan on slippery road conditions,\" the National Weather Service La Crosse office in Wisconsin said. \"Slow down and use caution while traveling.\" Do you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

Polio vaccination has been part of the routine childhood immunization schedule in the United States for decades. It's still part of the routine childhood immunization schedule. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is the only polio vaccine that has been given in the United States since 2000. Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is used in other countries. There are two types of vaccines that protect against polio. Since 2000, only IPV has been used to eliminate the risk of polio variants that can occur with OPV. As part of routine childhood immunization, children in the United States should get IPV to protect against polio. IPV may sometimes be given in the same shot with other vaccines (also called combination vaccines). You can ask your child's doctor about this option. Children should get 4 doses total, one at each of the following ages: Children who are delayed in getting all recommended doses should finish their series by following the recommended catch-up schedule. Most adults have likely already been vaccinated against poliovirus during childhood. However, if you have never been vaccinated against polio you should get 3 doses of IPV: Anyone not fully vaccinated. If you have had 1 or 2 doses of polio vaccine before, you should get the remaining 1 or 2 doses. People at risk. If you are fully vaccinated but at increased risk of poliovirus exposure, you may receive 1 lifetime booster dose of IPV. Polio vaccination protects you child from: The risk of lifelong paralysis is very serious. Even children who seem to fully recover can later develop new muscle pain, weakness, or paralysis as adults. This can occur 15 to 40 years later. About 2 to 10 children out of 100 who have paralysis from polio die. This is because the virus affects the muscles that help them breathe. Thanks to a successful vaccination program, most people in the United States are protected from polio. However, people who are not vaccinated or who haven't received all recommended doses may be at risk of getting polio. The disease still occurs in other parts of the world. It only takes one person with polio traveling from another country to bring polio into the United States. Infants and children As part of routine childhood immunization, all children in the United States should get IPV to protect against polio. This includes children who have not started their polio vaccine series or who are delayed in getting all recommended doses. People who plan to travel internationally should make sure they and their children are fully vaccinated against polio before departure. Adults Most adults have likely already been vaccinated against poliovirus during childhood. However, if you know or suspect that you are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated you should receive polio vaccination. Situations that put adults at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus include: Check with your healthcare provider if your child has: People who are moderately or severely ill should wait to get the vaccine until they recover. These include infants with moderate or severe diarrhea or vomiting. If you have a mild illness, such as a cold, they can probably get the vaccine today. IPV protects against severe disease caused by poliovirus in almost everyone who has received all the recommended doses. There is a chance of side effects, but they are usually mild and go away on their own. Serious reactions are also possible. Some people get a sore spot where the shot was given. IPV has not been known to cause serious problems, and most people do not have any problems with it. Some problems that could happen after getting this vaccine: Your or your child’s doctor’s office is usually the best place to receive recommended vaccines. Vaccines may also be available at pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics, health departments, schools, or religious centers. There are a few ways to cover the cost of vaccines: Most health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. However, you may want to check with your insurance provider before going to a healthcare provider. Check for cost information and for a list of in-network vaccine providers. Your children may be able to get no-cost vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program. This program helps families of eligible children who may not be able to afford or have access to vaccines. All 50 states and DC have state laws that require children entering childcare or public schools to have certain vaccinations. There is no federal law that requires this. CDC recommends that all children get 4 doses of IPV before or at school entry. Students in school settings have a higher likelihood of spreading chickenpox because they are constantly in close contact with each other. Getting vaccinated means: Polio was once one of the most feared diseases in the United States. Thanks to the polio vaccine, wild poliovirus has been eliminated in this country.

                "content": "The polio vaccines protect against polio, an infection caused by a virus that can lead to permanent paralysis. The vaccines come in two forms: Children usually get IPV at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6–18 months, and 4–6 years. Sometimes IPV is given in a combination vaccine (in the same shot) with other vaccines. In this case, a child might get a fifth dose of IPV. This is safe. OPV doses given before April 2016 can count toward a child's U.S. polio vaccination requirements. Doses given after that will not count. Kids who will travel to a country with a high risk for infection can get the 4 shots in a shorter timeframe, with the first dose as early as 6 weeks of age. They still should get the final dose at age 4 or older (at least 6 months after the previous dose). The vaccine offers protection against polio, which can cause paralysis and death. Polio has been eliminated from the United States, but still happens in other countries and can be spread by people who travel. The vaccine can cause mild side effects, such as a fever; and pain, redness, or swelling in the area where the shot was given. As with any vaccine, there is a small risk of fainting, and a very small chance of an allergic reaction. Simple colds or other minor illnesses should not prevent vaccination, but your doctor might choose to reschedule the vaccine if your child has a more serious illness. Talk to your doctor about whether the vaccine is a good idea if your child ever had a serious allergic reaction, or any allergic reaction after an earlier IPV shot or to the antibiotics neomycin, streptomycin, or polymyxin B. For pain or fever, check with your doctor to see if you can give either acetaminophen or ibuprofen, and to find out the right dose. A warm, damp cloth or a heating pad on the site of the shot may help reduce soreness, as can moving or using the arm or leg.

                "content": "Polio vaccines are vaccines used to prevent poliomyelitis (polio).[2][3] Two types are used: an inactivated poliovirus given by injection (IPV) and a weakened poliovirus given by mouth (OPV).[2] The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends all children be fully vaccinated against polio.[2] The two vaccines have eliminated polio from most of the world,[4][5] and reduced the number of cases reported each year from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 to 33 in 2018.[6][7] The inactivated polio vaccines are very safe.[2] Mild redness or pain may occur at the site of injection.[2] Oral polio vaccines cause about three cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis per million doses given.[2] This compares with 5,000 cases per million who are paralysed following a polio infection.[8] Both types of vaccine are generally safe to give during pregnancy and in those who have HIV/AIDS but are otherwise well.[2] However, the emergence of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), a form of the vaccine virus that has reverted to causing poliomyelitis, has led to the development of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) which aims to make the vaccine safer and thus stop further outbreaks of cVDPV.[9] The first successful demonstration of a polio vaccine was by Hilary Koprowski in 1950, with a live attenuated virus which people drank.[10] The vaccine was not approved for use in the United States, but was used successfully elsewhere.[10] The success of an inactivated (killed) polio vaccine, developed by Jonas Salk, was announced in 1955.[2][11] Another attenuated live oral polio vaccine was developed by Albert Sabin and came into commercial use in 1961.[2][12] Polio vaccine is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[13] Interruption of person-to-person transmission of the virus by vaccination is important in global polio eradication,[14] since no long-term carrier state exists for poliovirus in individuals with normal immune function, polio viruses have no non-primate reservoir in nature,[15] and survival of the virus in the environment for an extended period of time appears to be remote. There are two types of vaccine: inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV). When the IPV (injection) is used, 90% or more of individuals develop protective antibodies to all three serotypes of polio virus after two doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), and at least 99% are immune to polio virus following three doses. The duration of immunity induced by IPV is not known with certainty, although a complete series is thought to provide protection for many years.[16] IPV replaced the oral vaccine in many developed countries in the 1990s mainly due to the (small) risk of vaccine-derived polio in the oral vaccine.[17][18] Oral polio vaccines were easier to administer than IPV, as it eliminated the need for sterile syringes and therefore was more suitable for mass vaccination campaigns. OPV also provided longer-lasting immunity than the Salk vaccine, as it provides both humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity.[19] One dose of trivalent OPV produces immunity to all three poliovirus serotypes in roughly 50% of recipients.[20] Three doses of live-attenuated OPV produce protective antibodies to all three poliovirus types in more than 95% of recipients. As with other live-virus vaccines, immunity initiated by OPV is probably lifelong.[16] OPV produces excellent immunity in the intestine, the primary site of wild poliovirus entry, which helps prevent infection with wild virus in areas where the virus is endemic.[21] The oral administration does not require special medical equipment or extensive training. Attenuated poliovirus derived from the oral polio vaccine is excreted for a few days after vaccination, potentially infecting and thus indirectly inducing immunity in unvaccinated individuals, and thus amplifying the effects of the doses delivered.[22] Taken together, these advantages have made it the favored vaccine of many countries, and it has long been preferred by the global eradication initiative.[23] The primary disadvantage of OPV derives from its inherent nature. As an attenuated but active virus, it can induce vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in approximately one individual per every 2.7 million doses administered.[23] The live virus can persist circulate in under-vaccinated populations (termed either variant poliovirus or circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, cVDPV) and over time can revert to a neurovirulent form causing paralytic polio.[23] This genetic reversal of the pathogen to a virulent form takes a considerable time and does not affect the person who was originally vaccinated. With wild polio cases at record lows, 2017 was the first year where more cases of cVDPV were recorded than the wild poliovirus.[24] Until recent times, a trivalent OPV containing all three virus strains was used, and had nearly eradicated polio infection worldwide.[25] With the complete eradication of wild poliovirus type 2[26] this was phased out in 2016 and replaced with bivalent vaccine containing just types 1 and 3, supplemented with monovalent type 2 OPV in regions where cVDPV type 2 was known to circulate.[23] The switch to the bivalent vaccine and associated missing immunity against type 2 strains, among other factors, led to outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), which increased from 2 cases in 2016 to 1037 cases in 2020.[27] A novel OPV2 vaccine (nOPV2) which has been genetically modified to reduce the likelihood of disease-causing activating mutations was granted emergency licencing in 2021, and subsequently full licensure in December 2023.[28] This has greater genetic stability than the traditional oral vaccine and is less likely to revert to a virulent form.[29][9] Genetically stabilised vaccines targeting poliovirus types 1 and 3 are in development, with the intention that these will eventually completely replace the Sabin vaccines.[30] In countries with endemic polio or where the risk of imported cases is high, the WHO recommends OPV vaccine at birth followed by a primary series of three OPV doses and at least one IPV dose starting at 6 weeks of age, with a minimum of 4 weeks between OPV doses. In countries with >90% immunization coverage and low risk of importation, the WHO recommends one or two IPV doses starting at 2 months of age followed by at least two OPV doses, with the doses separated by 4–8 weeks depending on the risk of exposure. In countries with the highest levels of coverage and the lowest risks of importation and transmission, the WHO recommends a primary series of three IPV injections, with a booster dose after an interval of six months or more if the first dose was administered before 2 months of age.[2] The inactivated polio vaccines are very safe. Mild redness or pain may occur at the site of injection. They are generally safe to be given to pregnant women and those who have HIV/AIDS but are otherwise well.[2] Inactivated polio vaccine can cause an allergic reaction in a few people since the vaccine contains trace amounts of antibiotics, streptomycin, polymyxin B, and neomycin. It should not be given to anyone who has an allergic reaction to these medicines. Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction, which usually appear within minutes or a few hours after receiving the injected vaccine, include breathing difficulties, weakness, hoarseness or wheezing, heart rate fluctuations, skin rash and dizziness.[32] A potential adverse effect of the Sabin OPV is caused by its known potential to recombine to a form that causes neurological infection and paralysis.[33] The Sabin OPV results in vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in approximately one individual per every 2.7 million doses administered, with symptoms identical to wild polio.[23] Due to its improved genetic stability, the novel OPV (nOPV) has a reduced risk of this occurring.[34] In 1960, the rhesus monkey kidney cells used to prepare the poliovirus vaccines were determined to be infected with the simian virus-40 (SV40),[35] which was also discovered in 1960 and is a naturally occurring virus that infects monkeys. In 1961, SV40 was found to cause tumors in rodents.[36] More recently, the virus was found in certain forms of cancer in humans, for instance brain and bone tumors, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, and some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.[37][38] However, SV40 has not been determined to cause these cancers.[39] SV40 was found to be present in stocks of the injected form of the IPV in use between 1955 and 1963.[35] It is not found in the OPV form.[35] Over 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine between 1955 and 1963 when a proportion of vaccine was contaminated with SV40; an estimated 10–30 million Americans may have received a dose of vaccine contaminated with SV40.[35] Later analysis suggested that vaccines produced by the former Soviet bloc countries until 1980, and used in the USSR, China, Japan, and several African countries, may have been contaminated, meaning hundreds of millions more may have been exposed to SV40.[40] In 1998, the National Cancer Institute undertook a large study, using cancer case information from the institute's SEER database. The published findings from the study revealed no increased incidence of cancer in persons who may have received vaccine containing SV40.[41] Another large study in Sweden examined cancer rates of 700,000 individuals who had received potentially contaminated polio vaccine as late as 1957; the study again revealed no increased cancer incidence between persons who received polio vaccines containing SV40 and those who did not.[42] The question of whether SV40 causes cancer in humans remains controversial, however, and the development of improved assays for detection of SV40 in human tissues will be needed to resolve the controversy.[39] During the race to develop an oral polio vaccine, several large-scale human trials were undertaken. By 1958, the National Institutes of Health had determined that OPV produced using the Sabin strains were the safest.[43] Between 1957 and 1960, however, Hilary Koprowski continued to administer his vaccine around the world. In Africa, the vaccines were administered to roughly one million people in the Belgian territories (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi).[44][45] The results of these human trials have been controversial,[46] and unfounded accusations in the 1990s arose that the vaccine had created the conditions necessary for transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus from chimpanzees to humans, causing HIV/AIDS. These hypotheses, however, have been conclusively refuted.[44] By 2004, cases of poliomyelitis in Africa had been reduced to just a small number of isolated regions in the western portion of the continent, with sporadic cases elsewhere. Recent local opposition to vaccination campaigns have evolved due to lack of adequate information,[47][48] often relating to fears that the vaccine might induce sterility.[49] The disease has since resurged in Nigeria and in several other African nations without necessary information, which epidemiologists believe is due to refusals by certain local populations to allow their children to receive the polio vaccine.[50] The Salk vaccine, IPV, is based on three wild, virulent reference strains, Mahoney (type 1 poliovirus), MEF-1 (type 2 poliovirus), and Saukett (type 3 poliovirus), grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture (Vero cell line), which are then inactivated with formalin.[51] The injected Salk vaccine confers IgG-mediated immunity in the bloodstream, which prevents polio infection from progressing to viremia and protects the motor neurons, thus eliminating the risk of bulbar polio and post-polio syndrome. In the United States, vaccine is administered along with the tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccines (DTaP) and a pediatric dose of hepatitis B vaccine.[20] In the UK, IPV is combined with tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines.[52] OPV is an attenuated vaccine, produced by the passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at a subphysiological temperature, which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome.[53] Oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups, one of which was led by Albert Sabin. Other groups, led by Hilary Koprowski and H.R. Cox, developed their own attenuated vaccine strains. In 1958, the National Institutes of Health created a special committee on live polio vaccines. The various vaccines were carefully evaluated for their ability to induce immunity to polio, while retaining a low incidence of neuropathogenicity in monkeys. Large-scale clinical trials performed in the Soviet Union in late 1950s to early 1960s by Mikhail Chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy of the vaccine.[54][55] Based on these results, the Sabin strains were chosen for worldwide distribution.[43] Fifty-seven nucleotide substitutions distinguish the attenuated Sabin 1 strain from its virulent parent (the Mahoney serotype), two nucleotide substitutions attenuate the Sabin 2 strain, and 10 substitutions are involved in attenuating the Sabin 3 strain.[51] The primary attenuating factor common to all three Sabin vaccines is a mutation located in the virus's internal ribosome entry site,[56] which alters stem-loop structures and reduces the ability of poliovirus to translate its RNA template within the host cell.[57] The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of infection and replication, but is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue. In 1961, type 1 and 2 monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine (MOPV) was licensed, and in 1962, type 3 MOPV was licensed. In 1963, trivalent OPV (TOPV) was licensed, and became the vaccine of choice in the United States and most other countries of the world, largely replacing the inactivated polio vaccine.[58] A second wave of mass immunizations led to a further dramatic decline in the number of polio cases. Between 1962 and 1965, about 100 million Americans (roughly 56% of the population at that time) received the Sabin vaccine. The result was a substantial reduction in the number of poliomyelitis cases, even from the much-reduced levels following the introduction of the Salk vaccine.[59] OPV is usually provided in vials containing 10–20 doses of vaccine. A single dose of oral polio vaccine (usually two drops) contains 1,000,000 infectious units of Sabin 1 (effective against PV1), 100,000 infectious units of the Sabin 2 strain, and 600,000 infectious units of Sabin 3. The vaccine contains small traces of antibiotics—neomycin and streptomycin—but does not contain preservatives.[60] In a generic sense, vaccination works by priming the immune system with an 'immunogen'. Stimulating immune response, by use of an infectious agent, is known as immunization. The development of immunity to polio efficiently blocks person-to-person transmission of wild poliovirus, thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients and the wider community.[14] The development of two polio vaccines led to the first modern mass inoculations. The last cases of paralytic poliomyelitis caused by endemic transmission of wild virus in the United States occurred in 1979, with an outbreak among the Amish in several Midwest states.[20] In the 1930s, poliovirus was perceived as especially terrifying, as little was known of how the disease was transmitted or how it could be prevented. This virus was also notable for primarily impacting affluent children, making it a prime target for vaccine development, despite its relatively low mortality and morbidity.[61] Despite this, the community of researchers in the field thus far had largely observed an informal moratorium on any vaccine development as it was perceived to present too high a risk for too little likelihood of success.[62][63] This shifted in the early 1930s when American groups took up the challenge: Maurice Brodie led a team from the public health laboratory of the city of New York and John A. Kolmer collaborated with the Research Institute of Cutaneous Medicine in Philadelphia. The rivalry between these two researchers lent itself to a race-like mentality which, combined with a lack of oversight of medical studies, was reflected in the methodology and outcomes of each of these early vaccine development ventures.[64][65][61] Kolmer began his vaccine development project in 1932 and ultimately focused on producing an attenuated or live virus vaccine. Inspired by the success of vaccines for rabies and yellow fever, he hoped to use a similar process to denature the polio virus.[64] In order to go about attenuating his polio vaccine, he repeatedly passed the virus through monkeys.[66] Using methods of production that were later described as \"hair-raisingly amateurish, the therapeutic equivalent of bath-tub gin,\"[67] Kolmer ground the spinal cords of his infected monkeys and soaked them in a salt solution. He then filtered the solution through mesh, treated it with ricinolate, and refrigerated the product for 14 days[64] to ultimately create what would later be prominently critiqued as a \"veritable witches brew\".[68] In keeping with the norms of the time, Kolmer completed a relatively small animal trial with 42 monkeys before proceeding to self experimentation in 1934.[63] He tested his vaccine upon himself, his two children, and his assistant.[63] He gave his vaccine to just 23 more children before declaring it safe and sending it out to doctors and health departments for a larger test of efficacy.[63] By April 1935, he was able to report having tested the vaccine on 100 children without ill effect.[69] Kolmer's first formal presentation of results would not come about until November 1935 where he presented the results of 446 children and adults he had vaccinated with his attenuated vaccine.[69] He also reported that together the Research Institute of Cutaneous Medicine and the Merrell Company of Cincinnati (the manufacturer who held the patent for his ricinoleating process) had distributed 12,000 doses of vaccine to some 700 physicians across the United States and Canada.[69] Kolmer did not describe any monitoring of this experimental vaccination program nor did he provide these physicians with instructions in how to administer the vaccine or how to report side effects.[69] Kolmer dedicated the bulk of his publications thereafter to explaining what he believed to be the cause of the 10+ reported cases of paralytic polio following vaccination, in many cases in towns where no polio outbreak had occurred.[69][70] Six of these cases had been fatal.[69] Kolmer had no control group but asserted that many more children would have gotten sick.[70] At nearly the same time as Kolmer's project, Maurice Brodie had joined immunologist William H. Park at the New York City Health Department where they worked together on poliovirus. With the aid of grant funding from the President's Birthday Ball Commission (a predecessor to what would become the March of Dimes), Brodie was able to pursue development of an inactivated or \"killed virus\" vaccine. Brodie's process also began by grinding the spinal cords of infectious monkeys and then treating the cords with various germicides,[71] ultimately finding a solution of formaldehyde to be the most effective. By 1 June 1934, Brodie was able to publish his first scholarly article describing his successful induction of immunity in three monkeys with inactivated polio virus.[72][73] Through continued study on an additional 26 monkeys, Brodie ultimately concluded that administration of live virus vaccine tended to result in humoral immunity while administration of killed virus vaccine tended to result in tissue immunity.[69] Soon after, following a similar protocol to Kolmer, Brodie proceeded with self experimentation upon himself and his co-workers at the NYC Health Department laboratory.[63] Brodie's progress was eagerly covered by popular press as the public hoped for a successful vaccine to become available.[73] Such reporting did not make mention of the 12 children in a New York City Asylum who were subjected to early safety trials.[63] As none of the subjects experienced ill effects, Park, described by contemporaries as \"never one to let grass grow under his feet,\"[74] declared the vaccine safe.[66] When a severe polio outbreak overwhelmed Kern County, California it became the first trial site for the new vaccine on very short notice. Between November 1934 - May 1935, over 1,500 doses of the vaccine were administered in Kern County. While initial results were very promising, insufficient staffing and poor protocol design left Brodie open to criticism when he published the California results in August 1935.[73][69] Through private physicians, Brodie also conducted a broader field study, including 9,000 children who received the vaccine and 4,500 age- and location-matched controls who did not receive a vaccine. Again, results were promising. Of those who received the vaccine, only a few went on to develop polio. Most had been exposed prior to vaccination and none had received the full series of vaccine doses being studied.[69] Additionally, a polio epidemic in Raleigh, North Carolina provided an opportunity for the U.S. Public Health Service to conduct a highly structured trial of the Brodie vaccine using funding from the Birthday Ball Commission.[66][69] While their work was ongoing, the larger community of bacteriologists began to raise concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of the new poliovirus vaccines.[62] At this time there was very little oversight of medical studies, and ethical treatment of study participants largely relied upon moral pressure from peer academic scientists.[64] Brodie's inactivated vaccines faced scrutiny from many who felt killed virus vaccines could not be efficacious. While researchers were able to replicate the tissue immunity he had produced in his animal trials, prevailing wisdom was that humoral immunity was essential for an efficacious vaccine.[69] Kolmer directly questioned the killed virus approach in scholarly journals.[71] Kolmer's studies however had raised even more concern with increasing reports of children becoming paralysed following vaccination with his live virus vaccine and notably, with paralysis beginning at the arm rather than the foot in many cases.[75] Both Kolmer and Brodie were called to present their research at the Annual Meeting of the American Public Health Association in Milwaukee WI in October 1935.[62] Additionally, Thomas M. Rivers was asked to discuss each of the presented papers as a prominent critic of the vaccine development effort.[62] This resulted in the APHA arranging a Symposium on Poliomyelitis to be delivered at the Annual Meeting of their Southern Branch the following month.[62] It was during the discussion at this meeting that James Leake of the U.S. Public Health Service stood to immediately present clinical evidence that the Kolmer vaccine had caused several deaths and then allegedly accused Kolmer of being a murderer.[62] As Rivers recalled in his oral history, \"All hell broke loose, and it seemed as if everybody was trying to talk at the same time....Jimmy Leake used the strongest language that I have ever heard used at a scientific meeting.\"[62] In response to the attacks from all sides, Brodie was reported to have stood up and stated, \"It looks as though, according to Dr. Rivers, my vaccine is no good, and, according to Dr. Leake, Dr Kolmer's is dangerous.\"[62] Kolmer simply responded by stating, \"Gentlemen, this is one time I wish the floor would open up and swallow me.\"[62] Ultimately, Kolmer's live vaccine was undoubtedly shown to be dangerous and had already been withdrawn in September 1935 prior to the Milwaukee meeting.[75][70][69] While the consensus of the symposium was largely skeptical of the efficacy of Brodie's vaccine, its safety was not in question and the recommendation was for a much larger well-controlled trial.[75] However, when three children became ill with paralytic polio following a dose of the vaccine, the directors of the Warm Springs Foundation in Georgia (acting as the primary funders for the project) requested it be withdrawn in December 1935.[75] Following its withdrawal, the previously observed moratorium on human poliomyelitis vaccine development resumed and there would not be another attempt for nearly 20 years.[69][70] While Brodie had arguably made the most progress in the pursuit of a poliovirus vaccine, he suffered the most significant career repercussions due to his status as a less widely known researcher.[73] Modern researchers recognize that Brodie may well have developed an effective polio vaccine, however the basic science and technology of the time was insufficient to understand and utilize this breakthrough.[69] Brodie's work using formalin-inactivated virus would later become the basis for the Salk vaccine, but he would not live to see this success.[69] Brodie was fired from his position within three months of the symposium's publication.[69] While he was able to find another laboratory position, he died of a heart attack only three years later at age 36.[69][73] By contrast, Park, who was believed in the community to be reaching senility at this point in his older age, was able to retire from his position with honors[62] prior to his death in 1939.[66] Kolmer, already an established and well respected researcher, returned to Temple University as a professor of medicine.[69] Kolmer had a very productive career, receiving multiple awards, and publishing countless papers, articles, and textbooks up until his retirement in 1957.[66][62][70][76] A breakthrough came in 1948 when a research group headed by John Enders at the Children's Hospital Boston successfully cultivated the poliovirus in human tissue in the laboratory.[77] This group had recently successfully grown mumps in cell culture. In March 1948, Thomas H. Weller was attempting to grow varicella virus in embryonic lung tissue. He had inoculated the planned number of tubes when he noticed that there were a few unused tubes. He retrieved a sample of mouse brain infected with poliovirus and added it to the remaining test tubes, on the off chance that the virus might grow. The varicella cultures failed to grow, but the polio cultures were successful. This development greatly facilitated vaccine research and ultimately allowed for the development of vaccines against polio. Enders and his colleagues, Thomas H. Weller and Frederick C. Robbins, were recognized in 1954 for their efforts with a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[78] Other important advances that led to the development of polio vaccines were: the identification of three poliovirus serotypes (Poliovirus type 1 – PV1, or Mahoney; PV2, Lansing; and PV3, Leon); the finding that prior to paralysis, the virus must be present in the blood; and the demonstration that administration of antibodies in the form of gamma globulin protects against paralytic polio.[62][51][79] During the early 1950s, polio rates in the U.S. were above 25,000 annually; in 1952 and 1953, the U.S. experienced an outbreak of 58,000 and 35,000 polio cases, respectively, up from a typical number of some 20,000 a year, with deaths in those years numbering 3,200 and 1,400.[80] Amid this U.S. polio epidemic, millions of dollars were invested in finding and marketing a polio vaccine by commercial interests, including Lederle Laboratories in New York under the direction of H. R. Cox. Also working at Lederle was Polish-born virologist and immunologist Hilary Koprowski of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, who tested the first successful polio vaccine, in 1950.[10][45] His vaccine, however, being a live attenuated virus taken orally, was still in the research stage and would not be ready for use until five years after Jonas Salk's polio vaccine (a dead-virus injectable vaccine) had reached the market. Koprowski's attenuated vaccine was prepared by successive passages through the brains of Swiss albino mice. By the seventh passage, the vaccine strains could no longer infect nervous tissue or cause paralysis. After one to three further passages on rats, the vaccine was deemed safe for human use.[43][81] On 27 February 1950, Koprowski's live, attenuated vaccine was tested for the first time on an 8-year-old boy living at Letchworth Village, an institution for physically and mentally disabled people located in New York. After the child had no side effects, Koprowski enlarged his experiment to include 19 other children.[43][82] The first effective polio vaccine was developed in 1952 by Jonas Salk and a team at the University of Pittsburgh that included Julius Youngner, Byron Bennett, L. James Lewis, and Lorraine Friedman, which required years of subsequent testing. Salk went on CBS radio to report a successful test on a small group of adults and children on 26 March 1953; two days later, the results were published in JAMA.[70] Leone N. Farrell invented a key laboratory technique that enabled the mass production of the vaccine by a team she led in Toronto.[83][84] Beginning 23 February 1954, the vaccine was tested at Arsenal Elementary School and the Watson Home for Children in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[85] Salk's vaccine was then used in a test called the Francis Field Trial, led by Thomas Francis, the largest medical experiment in history at that time. The test began with about 4,000 children at Franklin Sherman Elementary School in McLean, Virginia,[86][87] and eventually involved 1.8 million children, in 44 states from Maine to California.[88] By the conclusion of the study, roughly 440,000 received one or more injections of the vaccine, about 210,000 children received a placebo, consisting of harmless culture media, and 1.2 million children received no vaccination and served as a control group, who would then be observed to see if any contracted polio.[43] The results of the field trial were announced 12 April 1955 (the tenth anniversary of the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose paralytic illness was generally believed to have been caused by polio). The Salk vaccine had been 60–70% effective against PV1 (poliovirus type 1), over 90% effective against PV2 and PV3, and 94% effective against the development of bulbar polio.[89] Soon after Salk's vaccine was licensed in 1955, children's vaccination campaigns were launched. In the U.S., following a mass immunization campaign promoted by the March of Dimes, the annual number of polio cases fell from 35,000 in 1953 to 5,600 by 1957.[90] By 1961 only 161 cases were recorded in the United States.[91] A week before the announcement of the Francis Field Trial results in April 1955, Pierre Lépine at the Pasteur Institute in Paris had also announced an effective polio vaccine.[92][93] In April 1955, soon after mass polio vaccination began in the US, the Surgeon General began to receive reports of patients who contracted paralytic polio about a week after being vaccinated with Salk polio vaccine from the Cutter pharmaceutical company, with the paralysis starting in the limb the vaccine was injected into.[94] The Cutter vaccine had been used in vaccinating 409,000 children in the western and midwestern United States.[95] Later investigations showed that the Cutter vaccine had caused 260 cases of polio, killing 11.[94] In response, the Surgeon General pulled all polio vaccines made by Cutter Laboratories from the market, but not before 260 cases of paralytic illness had occurred. Eli Lilly, Parke-Davis, Pitman-Moore and Wyeth polio vaccines were also reported to have paralyzed numerous children. It was soon discovered that some lots of Salk polio vaccine made by Cutter, Wyeth, and the other labs had not been properly inactivated, allowing live poliovirus into more than 100,000 doses of vaccine. In May 1955, the National Institutes of Health and Public Health Services established a Technical Committee on Poliomyelitis Vaccine to test and review all polio vaccine lots and advise the Public Health Service as to which lots should be released for public use. These incidents reduced public confidence in polio vaccine, leading to a drop in vaccination rates.[96] At the same time that Salk was testing his vaccine, both Albert Sabin and Hilary Koprowski continued working on developing a vaccine using live virus. During a meeting in Stockholm to discuss polio vaccines in November 1955, Sabin presented results obtained on a group of 80 volunteers, while Koprowski read a paper detailing the findings of a trial enrolling 150 people.[43] Sabin and Koprowski both eventually succeeded in developing vaccines. Because of the commitment to the Salk vaccine in America, Sabin and Koprowski both did their testing outside the United States, Sabin in Mexico[53] and the Soviet Union,[97] Koprowski in the Congo and Poland.[45] In 1957, Sabin developed a trivalent vaccine containing attenuated strains of all three types of poliovirus.[97] In 1959, ten million children in the Soviet Union received the Sabin oral vaccine. For this work, Sabin was given the medal of the Order of Friendship of Peoples, described as the Soviet Union's highest civilian honor.[98] Sabin's oral vaccine using live virus came into commercial use in 1961.[2] Once Sabin's oral vaccine became widely available, it supplanted Salk's injected vaccine, which had been tarnished in the public's opinion by the Cutter incident of 1955, in which Salk vaccines improperly prepared by one company resulted in several children dying or becoming paralyzed.[70] An enhanced-potency IPV was licensed in the United States in November 1987, and is currently the vaccine of choice there.[20] The first dose of polio vaccine is given shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 months of age, and a second dose is given at 4 months of age.[20] The timing of the third dose depends on the vaccine formulation, but should be given between 6 and 18 months of age.[52] A booster vaccination is given at 4 to 6 years of age, for a total of four doses at or before school entry.[21] In some countries, a fifth vaccination is given during adolescence.[52] Routine vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries.[20] In 2002, a pentavalent (five-component) combination vaccine (called Pediarix)[99][100] containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.[101][100] A global effort to eradicate polio, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF,[102] and the Rotary Foundation, began in 1988, and has relied largely on the oral polio vaccine developed by Albert Sabin and Mikhail Chumakov (Sabin-Chumakov vaccine).[103] Polio was eliminated in the Americas by 1994.[104] The disease was officially eliminated in 36 Western Pacific countries, including China and Australia, in 2000.[105][106] Europe was declared polio-free in 2002.[107] Since January 2011, no cases of the disease have been reported in India, hence in February 2012, the country was taken off the WHO list of polio-endemic countries. In March 2014, India was declared a polio-free country.[108][109][110] Although poliovirus transmission has been interrupted in much of the world, transmission of wild poliovirus does continue and creates an ongoing risk for the importation of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free regions. If importations of poliovirus occur, outbreaks of poliomyelitis may develop, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage and poor sanitation. As a result, high levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained.[104] In November 2013, the WHO announced a polio outbreak in Syria. In response, the Armenian government put out a notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine.[111] As of 2014, polio virus had spread to 10 countries, mainly in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, with Pakistan, Syria, and Cameroon advising vaccinations to outbound travellers.[112] Polio vaccination programs have been resisted by some people in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria - the three countries as of 2017 with remaining polio cases. Almost all Muslim religious and political leaders have endorsed the vaccine,[113] but a fringe minority believes that the vaccines are secretly being used for sterilization of Muslims.[50] The fact that the CIA organized a fake vaccination program in 2011 to help find Osama bin Laden is an additional cause of distrust.[114] In 2015, the WHO announced a deal with the Taliban to encourage them to distribute the vaccine in areas they control.[115] However, the Pakistani Taliban was not supportive. On 11 September 2016, two unidentified gunmen associated with the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, shot Zakaullah Khan, a doctor who was administering polio vaccines in Pakistan. The leader of the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the shooting and stated that the group would continue this type of attack. Such resistance to and skepticism of vaccinations has consequently slowed down the polio eradication process within the two remaining endemic countries.[114] Travellers who wish to enter or leave certain countries must be vaccinated against polio, usually at most 12 months and at least 4 weeks before crossing the border, and be able to present a vaccination record/certificate at the border checks.[116]: 25–27 Most requirements apply only to travel to or from so-called 'polio-endemic', 'polio-affected', 'polio-exporting', 'polio-transmission', or 'high-risk' countries.[117] As of August 2020, Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only polio-endemic countries in the world (where wild polio has not yet been eradicated).[118] Several countries have additional precautionary polio vaccination travel requirements, for example to and from 'key at-risk countries', which as of December 2020 include China, Indonesia, Mozambique, Myanmar, and Papua New Guinea.[117][119] As of 2015[update], the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization supplies the inactivated vaccine to developing countries for as little as €0.75 (about US$0.89) per dose in 10-dose vials.[143] A misconception has been present in Pakistan that polio vaccine contained haram ingredients and could cause impotence and infertility in male children, leading some parents not to have their children vaccinated. This belief is most common in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the FATA region. Attacks on polio vaccination teams have also occurred, thereby hampering international efforts to eradicate polio in Pakistan and globally.[144][145]",

                "content": "Polio is a highly infectious disease, mostly affecting young children, that attacks the nervous system and can lead to spinal and respiratory paralysis, and in some cases death. Polio has existed since prehistoric times – ancient Egyptian images show children walking with canes, with withered limbs characteristic of the disease. While it affected children around the world for millennia, the first known clinical description of polio, by British doctor Michael Underwood, was not until 1789, and it was formally recognized as a condition in 1840 by German physician Jakob Heine. Share In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, frequent epidemics saw polio become the most feared disease in the world. A major outbreak in New York City in 1916 killed over 2000 people, and the worst recorded US outbreak in 1952 killed over 3000. Many who survived the disease faced lifelong consequences. Deformed limbs meant they needed leg braces, crutches or wheelchairs, and some needed to use breathing devices like the iron lung, an artificial respirator invented for treatment of polio patients. By the mid-20th century, the poliovirus could be found all over the world and killed or paralysed over half a million people every year. With no cure, and epidemics on the rise, there was an urgent need for a vaccine. A breakthrough occurred in 1949, when poliovirus was successfully cultivated in human tissue by John Enders, Thomas Weller and Frederick Robbins at Boston Children’s Hospital. Their pioneering work was recognized with the 1954 Nobel Prize. Not long afterwards, in the early 1950s, the first successful vaccine was created by US physician Jonas Salk. Salk tested his experimental killed-virus vaccine on himself and his family in 1953, and a year later on 1.6 million children in Canada, Finland and the USA. The results were announced on 12 April 1955, and Salk’s inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was licensed on the same day. By 1957, annual cases dropped from 58 000 to 5600, and by 1961, only 161 cases remained. Salk was committed to equitable access to his vaccine, and understood that elimination efforts would not work without universal low- or no-cost vaccination. Six pharmaceutical companies were licensed to produce IPV, and Salk did not profit from sharing the formulation or production processes. In a 1955 interview, when asked who owned the patent for IPV, he replied: “Well, the people, I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?” A second type of polio vaccine, the oral polio vaccine (OPV) was developed by physician and microbiologist Albert Sabin. Sabin’s vaccine was live-attenuated (using the virus in weakened form) and could be given orally, as drops or on a sugar cube. With the Salk vaccine in wide use by the late 1950s, United States interest in testing this new kind of vaccine was low. Hilary Koprowski had carried out the first test of a live-attenuated vaccine on humans in 1950, and further trials took place in what was then the Belgian Congo (a territory now largely covered by the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Like Salk, Sabin tested his experimental vaccine on himself and his family; but he had to go further afield for larger-scale trials. After a team of Russian virologists visited his lab in 1956, Sabin travelled to Leningrad and Moscow to work with them later that year. He struck up a longstanding collaboration with Mikhail P Chumakov, who was also responsible for tests of the Salk vaccine in the Soviet Union, and Chumakov carried out initial tests of the live-attenuated vaccine using a seed virus that Sabin had provided. Trials carried out in the Soviet Union, on 20 000 children in 1958 and 10 million children in 1959, and in Czechoslovakia, on over 110 000 children from 1958 to 1959, proved the vaccine was safe and effective. Independent review of the trials for the World Health Organization by United States specialist Dorothy Horstmann endorsed their findings – a crucial validation in the time of the Cold War. The ease of administering the oral vaccine made it the ideal candidate for mass vaccination campaigns. Hungary began to use it in December 1959 and Czechoslovakia in early 1960, becoming the first country in the world to eliminate polio. In 1962, Cuba began to administer the OPV in nationwide immunization programmes. OPV had an added benefit that paved the road to eradication. While IPV protected the vaccinated child, it did not stop the poliovirus from spreading between children. OPV, on the other hand, interrupted the chain of transmission, meaning that this was a powerful vaccine to stop polio outbreaks in their tracks. In 1979 Rotary International started a multi-year project to immunize 6 million children in the Philippines. In 1988, the World Health Assembly passed a resolution to eradicate polio – to achieve its permanent reduction to zero, with no risk of reintroduction – and in the same year, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was launched. The Assembly’s work towards this milestone was complemented by the efforts of Rotary International, who wanted to keep the momentum of smallpox eradication going to ensure that no child was unnecessarily paralysed for life ever again. Immense contributions by individual countries were combined with international initiative and assistance, with WHO working to support the global collaboration. With WHO’s assistance, vaccine production was also expanded globally, with significant capacity developed in countries including India and Indonesia. In 1995, mass vaccination campaigns took place in China and India. National Immunization Days were coordinated in 19 European and Mediterranean countries in 1995, and in 23 African countries in 2004. By 1994, polio had been eliminated from the Americas, and by 2000 the Western Pacific was polio free. By 2003, polio remained endemic in only 6 countries – and by 2006, that number had dropped to 4. The 21st century saw further advances, with cases brought down by more than 99% worldwide in less than 2 decades. WHO’s South-East Asia region was certified polio-free in 2014, the African region in 2020, and the Eastern Mediterranean region has restricted the virus’s reach to just a handful of districts. As at July 2021, only 2 cases of wild poliovirus have been recorded globally this year to date: one each in Afghanistan and Pakistan. But alongside the success of the OPV comes a disadvantage: continued use of the vaccine poses a risk to wiping out the disease. While OPV is safe and effective, in areas where vaccination coverage is low, the weakened vaccine virus originally contained in OPV can begin to circulate in undervaccinated communities. When this happens, if it is allowed to circulate for sufficiently long enough time, it may genetically revert to a ‘strong’ virus, able to cause paralysis, resulting in what is known as circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs). If a population is adequately immunized, it will be protected against both wild and vaccine-derived polioviruses.

A spiritual sequel to the romantic action film Arya (2004), he played the role of Arya, an orphan who is behaviourally sick in that he is consumed with possessiveness for his friend Ajay (Navdeep), who never accepts him. The film revolved around the complexities of love–hate relationships and love triangles.[48] His character in the film had shades of grey.[49] Sify wrote that \"Allu Arjun is full of energy as the guy caught in the powerful current of love. Though he plays the part with negative shades, his characterization could evoke a lot of sympathy from the audiences. His dances are mind-blowing and he excels in emotional scenes.\"[50] Oneindia appreciated his dance moves and acting performances, especially the comedy scenes.[51] He received his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film. He had two releases in 2010. The first was Gunasekhar's Varudu, in which he starred alongside Arya and Bhanu Sri Mehra.[52] The filmreceived mixed reviews from critics and was a box-office bomb.[53][54] His second release of the year was the highly acclaimed hyperlink anthology film Vedam.

Vinayak's action film Badrinath (2011), in which he played the role of Badri, a modern-day Indian samurai who is assigned to protect the Badrinath Temple by his Guru (Prakash Raj), to whom he is very loyal.[62] Allu Arjun undertook intensive martial arts and sword fighting training in Vietnam[63][64] and marks his first pairing with Tamannaah.[65] He grew his hair out for his look as a warrior in the film.[citation needed] It his second A-rated film in India after Vedam (2010), on the account of graphic action violence.[66] The film completed a 50-day run in 187 cinemas.[67] His performance and character received mixed reviews.[68][69] A critic of The Times of India wrote that \"Arjun hardly has any scope to emote as he was mostly pushed into action scenes and song sequences.\"[70] After Badrinath, he signed Trivikram Srinivas's action comedy film Julayi in 2011.[71] It was released in 2012, in which he played the role of Ravindra Narayan, a street-smart yet spoilt brat whose life takes a drastic turn after he becomes the witness of a huge bank robbery. A critic wrote that \"Allu Arjun puts in a confident performance as the loveable rogue. It's a role that is right up his alley and he carries it off with a characteristic panache. He lights up the screen with his dancing in particular, pulling off some pretty challenging dance moves.\"[72] Riya Chakravarty of NDTV, in her review, stated that \"Arjun has delivered an outstanding performance.\"[73] He was nominated for the SIIMA Award for Best Actor – Telugu, for his performance in the film. The next year, he starred in Puri Jagannadh's action thriller Iddarammayilatho, playing Sanju Reddy, a guitarist with a dark past, alongside Amala Paul and Catherine Tresa. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu praised his performance in the action sequences and dance moves in various songs in the film, adding \"Allu Arjun uses his agility to his advantage in dances and stunt episodes\".[74] Another critic wrote that \"True to his tag of \"stylish star\", Allu Arjun looks trendier than ever before. His character of a guitarist, who is a street performer in Barcelona, was at its best sketchy, and looks completely different from his previous films. He once again proves that he is a good actor and probably because of the action director's meticulous planning, he makes perfect expressions in all the fight scenes.\"[75][76] The film marks his second and last collaboration, with Puri Jagannadh after Desamuduru (2007). In 2014, he appeared in a cameo role in Vamsi Paidipally's action thriller film Yevadu, alongside Kajal Aggarwal.[77][78] Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu, in her review, wrote that \"Allu Arjun shows what an actor can do even in a short role, in the few minutes he packs his experience, internalises the character and makes an impressive exit even as he loses his identity.\"[79] His next film was Surender Reddy's Race Gurram, in which he played Allu Lakshman \"Lucky\" Prasad, a carefree guy.[80] He joined the production of the film in May 2013.[81] The film was successful at the box office, with the film being Allu's first ₹100 crore grosser.[82] Writing to Deccan Chronicle, Suresh Kavirayani felt that Allu Arjun steals the show with his energetic performance and also praised his dancing skills in the film.[83] Ranjani Rajendra too praised his dance moves, comic acting and performance in the action sequences, but felt that the story is predictable and routine.[84] For his performance, he won his third Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu[85] and was nominated for the SIIMA Award for Best Actor – Telugu for the second time after Julayi. Allu Arjun produced and acted in a short film I Am That Change, which was released in August 2014. The film was directed by Sukumar,[86] to spread awareness on individual social responsibility. Upon its release, the short film received viral response online and was acclaimed by many including celebrities for its concept and execution.[87] It was screened in theaters across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.[88] Allu Arjun next appeared in Trivikram Srinivas's S/O Satyamurthy (2015), which was released on 9 April 2015.[89] The film was a commercial success, with critics praising his performance.[90][91] His performance in the film earned him his seventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.

He also won three other awards for his performance, including Nandi Award for Best Character Actor. In 2016, he acted in Sarrainodu, directed by Boyapati Srinu.[98] Although the film received negative reviews for the screenplay and story,[99][100] it was a major commercial success at the box office, grossing over ₹127.6 crore.[101] Allu Arjun called it as a \"landmark film\" in his career.[102] His performance in the action scenes and dance numbers was praised.[103] HIs performance in the film won him the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor – Telugu, in addition to his eighth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. The same year, in June, he announced his next film with producer Dil Raju for the third time for DJ: Duvvada Jagannadham. Released in 2017,[104] the film directed by Harish Shankar,[105] in which he played the role of Duvvada Jagannadham \"DJ\" Shastri, alongside Pooja Hegde, Rao Ramesh and Subbaraju.[106] He appears as a caterer, who is an undercover cop. Firstpost's Hemanth Kumar praised his dance and wrote that \"look beyond Allu Arjun's classy moves in Seeti Maar and Asmaika Yoga, all you find is a story that struggles to find its rhythm.\"[107] India Today too lauded his dance but criticised the film's screenplay and called it \"Boring-ah, bore-asya, bore-obiah\".[108] The next year, in May, his film under the direction of writer turned director Vakkantham Vamsi, Naa Peru Surya was released. He played Surya, an Indian Army soldier who has anger management issues.[109] Allu Arjun spent considerable time learning the tricks and stunt sequences from professionals, especially for the dance numbers and action sequences.[110] Upon release, the film received mixed reviews and was successful at the box office. A critic called his performance as Allu Arjun's \"career-best\" and cited it as the \"biggest strength to the film\".[111] Vyas of The Hans India stated that \"Allu Arjun is supremely talented and has delivered an energetic performance in the movie.\"[112] Hindustan Times's Priyanka Sundar opined that \"Allu Arjun tries to do his best in the shoes of a soldier, but at places we see that it looks forced.\"[113] In December 2018, his next project Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo was announced, with Trivikram Srinivas as the director.[114] Pooja Hegde was selected to play the female lead role,[115] thus marking his second collaboration with Hegde after DJ: Duvvada Jagannadham.[116] He joined the production of the film in April 2019.[117] Produced jointly by Allu Aravind and S. Radha Krishna, the film marks the third collaboration of Allu Arjun and Trivikram after Julayi (2012) and S/O Satyamurthy (2015).[118] The film was released in January 2020.[119] Allu Arjun's performance received highly positive reviews. A review posted by Rohit Mohan on Koimoi said that \"Be it comedy, action, emotions, style and of course dance, the star actor nails it in the film, as 'Bunny' made to audience groove to his tunes with his act.\"[120] Film Companion felt that Allu Arjun's performance in the board-room scene was the highlight of the film.[121] Bhavana Sharma of International Business Times, opined that Allu Arjun went into the skin of the character.[122] The film his career's highest grosser and stands among the highest-grossing Telugu films. Allu Arjun's dance performance in the song \"Butta Bomma\" received wide response.[123] In 2021, he re-united with Sukumar, after nearly a decade, for Pushpa: The Rise.[124] The film is based on the red sanders smuggling in the Seshachalam Hills in Andhra Pradesh and Allu Arjun plays Pushpa Raj, a coolie-turned-smuggler, alongside Fahadh Faasil and Rashmika Mandanna.[125] The film was released in December 2021 to mixed reviews but his performance was praised.[126] A reviewer from The Indian Express wrote, \"Allu Arjun walks away with the film with his strong performance. He embraces his deglamorized look and delivers a memorable performance.\"[127] The Times of India critic Neeshita Nyayapati stated: \"Pushpa: The Rise is Allu Arjun's show all the way. He shines in playing this rustic character that is hard on the surface but vulnerable in ways that others don't see.\"[128] The film proved to be a major commercial success, grossing over ₹350 crore and emerged as the highest grossing Indian film in 2021.[129] He won his fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu alongside National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance, of which the latter became a first for a Telugu film actor.[130][131][132] Allu Arjun's performance along with one of the dialogues from the film, \"Thaggede Le\" achieved the cult status and made a huge impact in the Indian pop culture scene.[133][134] A sequel titled Pushpa 2: The Rule [135] was released on 5 December 2024.[136] His popularity was documented in two Telugu music videos. The first one is a rap song, composed by S. Thaman and performed by Roll Rida and Harika Narayan with the lyrics written by Roll Rida and The Hyderabad Nawabs.[137][138] The music video titled \"Allu Arjun Rap Song\" was released in January 2021, through Aditya Music label.[139][140] The other one is titled \"Thaggedhe Le\" was performed and written by Roll Rida, with the music composed by Pravin Lakkaraju. It was released in April 2021 with the title being adapted from Allu Arjun's popular dialogue from his film Pushpa: The Rise.[141][142] Allu Arjun was featured in the GQ in their listing of the most influential young Indians of 2020.[143][144] He is the 'Most Searched Male Celebrity' in 2020 on Yahoo! India.[2][145] Allu Arjun was the most searched Telugu film actor on Google Search, for several times.[146][147] Arjun became the 19th most searched Asian on Google Mid Year 2022.[148] He is referred to as \"Icon Star\", or as \"Bunny\", in the media.[149][150] Post the continuous success of his films in Kerala, since Arya (2004), he has been called as \"Mallu Arjun\".[151][152] Even, the media in Kerala, mostly refers him with the same name.[153] In 2021, the Kerala Police used few scenes featuring him from the film Race Gurram (2014), in their advertisement, to raise awareness about SOS and promote their newly launched app.[154][155][156] Allu Arjun is the celebrity endorser for a number of brands and products, including Hero MotoCorp,[157][158] RedBus, Hotstar,[159] Frooti,[160] OLX, Colgate, 7 Up, Coca-Cola, Joyalukkas and Lot Mobiles.[13] He has been as a celebrity ambassador for India's premier Kabaddi tournament Pro Kabaddi League.[13] He is an active promoter and a celebrity brand ambassador for his father Allu Aravind-founded over-the-top media service, Aha.[14][15] In 2021, he played the role of Guru in the Dream Vault Media-produced advertising campaign video, for Rapido.[161] On being part of the ad film, Allu Arjun said that \"I like to consider myself as a person who knows how to tackle a situation with the best possible solution. That's why I was excited when they approached me for the role of Guru, which resembles me\".[162] Following the release of the ad film, the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation sent a legal notice to both the actor and the Rapido company, for showing TSRTC in a bad-light.[163][164] Soon after, the company has edited the video (ad film).[165] Allu Arjun is also a charcoal artist.[166] He started a campaign against the smoking of tobacco, in 2021. He said that \"I wanted to draw people's attention towards the ill-effects of smoking. We have constructed very incorrect notions of what's cool and hep. I want to effect a change, no matter how small it is.\"[167] In 2021, Allu Arjun became the brand ambassador of Sri Chaitanya Educational Institutions.[168] On 6 March 2011, Allu Arjun married Sneha Reddy in Hyderabad.[169][170] They have two children—a son, Ayaan and a daughter, Arha.[169][171] Allu Arha made her debut in the film Shaakuntalam in the role of Prince Bharata.[172] In 2016, he started a nightclub named 800 Jubilee in collaboration with M Kitchens and Buffalo Wild Wings.[173] In 2019, Allu Arjun celebrated Sankranthi in his native town Palakollu, Andhra Pradesh and announced ₹20 lakh for the development and renovation works of the Ksheera Ramalingeswara Temple, one of the five Pancharama Kshetras.[174] The temple management has constructed Rathasala, Vahanasala, Gosala, and renovated the temple chariot with the funds provided.[175][176] He also campaigned for his uncle Pawan Kalyan's Jana Sena Party in Palakollu in the 2019 general elections.[177][178] For Pushpa: The Rise, Arjun won the National Film Award for Best Actor. Arjun has received four Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for the films - Parugu, Vedam, Race Gurram and Pushpa: The Rise.[179] On 30 November 2024, a FIR was filed against Allu Arjun by Srinivas Goud for his comments during the Mumbai press event, where he (Allu Arjun) referred to his fans as an \"army.\" Goud found this comparison disrespectful, arguing that using the term \"army\" in this context belittles the sacrifices made by the armed forces.[180][181] A woman lost her life and her young son was critically injured due to the stampede occurred during the screening of Pushpa 2: The Rule at the Sandhya movie theater in RTC X Roads, Hyderabad on 4 December 2024.[182] A case was later filed under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita on the film's unit, lead actor Allu Arjun, the owner of the movie theatre and Allu Arjun’s security team.[183][184] Allu Arjun was arrested by the Hyderabad City Police on 13 December 2024, due to the Sandhya movie theatre stampede tragedy and death of a women.[185] However, few hours later he was granted an interim bail by the Telangana High Court.[186]",

He has won five Filmfare Awards South and three Nandi Awards.[4][5] He made his debut in Gangotri (2003). Allu appeared in Arya (2004). It was directed by Sukumar. He won the Nandi Special Jury Award for his role.[6] In next years, he acted in movies like Bunny (2005), Happy (2006) and Desamuduru (2007). Allu won his first Filmfare Awards South as Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. He won the award for Parugu (2008).[7] His later movies, Arya 2 (2009), Vedam (2010), Varudu (2010) and Badrinath (2011), were a flop at the box office.[8][9] He acted as Gona Ganna Reddy in Rudhramadevi (2015). He won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor and Nandi Award for Best Character Actor for his role.[10][11] He achieved success with movies like Race Gurram (2014), Sarrainodu (2016) and Duvvada Jagannadham (2017). Each movie earned more than ₹100 crore at the box office.[12] He worked with director Trivikram Srinivas three times. Allu worked with him in Julayi (2012), S/O Satyamurthy (2015) and Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo (2020). All three are successful. The last movie earned more than ₹262 crore at the box office.[13][14] The trailer launch of Pushpa 2[15] in Patna has bridged the North-South divide in Indian cinema. By choosing a non-South Indian city for the event, the film's team has highlighted the growing pan-India appeal of Telugu cinema, challenging regional boundaries and further unifying India's diverse film industries. Allu Arjun was born on 8 April 1983[16][17] in Madras (present-day Chennai). His father Allu Aravind is a movie producer.

                "content": "The Montana State Bobcats football program competes in the Big Sky Conference of the NCAA's Division I Football Championship Subdivision for Montana State University. The program began in 1897 and has won three national championships (1956, 1976, and 1984). It is the only college football program in the nation to win national championships on three different levels of competition, NAIA, NCAA Division II, and NCAA Division I-AA (now FCS). Through the 2022 season, the Bobcats had played in 1,049 games with an all-time record of 525–492–32.[3] The first championship came in Montana State's last season in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference, which moved to NAIA in 1952. The national championship was the first ever for the RMAC and was also the first time the NAIA had a football champion. The Bobcats were members of the RMAC from 1917 to 1956, after being an independent from 1897 to 1916. MSC rejoined the NCAA (College Division) in 1957, and had one of its most successful runs as an independent from 1957 to 1962 with six straight winning seasons, including an 8–2 mark in 1957 and 8–1 in 1958. In 1963, Montana State became a charter member of the Big Sky Conference and has since won two national championships.[4] Montana State has won 21 conference titles, including 16 in the Big Sky Conference and five in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference. The Bobcats have won conference titles in eight of the past nine decades and have won multiple conference titles in seven of the last eight decades. MSU finished the 1926 season undefeated in RMAC conference games, but was not awarded a conference title. They have qualified for the NCAA playoffs thirteen times, once (1976) as a Division II member and twelve times (1984, 2002, 2003, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023) as a Division I-AA/FCS member. Through the 2023 season, the Bobcats are 18–13–2 in postseason play.[5] Their primary rival are the Montana Grizzlies, whom they meet in the annual Brawl of the Wild, more commonly referred to as the Cat-Griz game by MSU students, alumni and supporters.[6] Before World War II, Montana State football tasted success often, but in small doses. The Bobcats did not record a winning season between 1931 and 1941, MSC's last pre-war squad. The 'Cats were 1–10 in that stretch against Montana, and were shut out for eight consecutive years. In 1946, however, things began to change. Composed of war-hardened veterans, Clyde Carpenter and the Bobcats rolled up a 5–3–1 regular season record, impressive enough to land the team its first-ever bowl bid. The Bobcats tied New Mexico, 13–13. Although it would be seven more seasons until Montana State would again win more than it lost, that season helped chart the course into what would become an unbelievably successful period in Montana State's football history as the Bobcats would take 22 of the next 30 games from 1956 to 1985 from the Grizzlies and would win all three of their national championships during that same span.[citation needed] The 1946 team was special for more than its accomplishments, however. When it reassembled following World War II, its special mission was to carry the Bobcat banner after 14 members of Montana State's previous team, the 1941 squad, were killed during World War II. The only pre-war regular to play in the Harbor Bowl was Bill Zupan, whose brother Al was among those 'Cat gridders making the ultimate sacrifice. Others were Orin Beller, Newell Berg,[7][8] Dana Bradford, John Burke, Bernard Cluzen, William Coey, Karl Fye, John Hall, Joseph McGeever, John Phelan, Richard Roman, Wendell Scabad and Alton Zempel, according to the outstanding centennial history of MSU, \"In the People's Interest\". In 1956, the Bobcats, led by freshman captain and two-way (center and middle linebacker) starter Sonny Holland, won a share of the NAIA title at the Aluminum Bowl in Little Rock, Arkansas, playing to a scoreless tie with the Pumas of St. Joseph's College from Rensselaer, Indiana. The game was nationally aired on CBS television and radio. It was played on a rain-soaked field that thwarted MSU's offense, which had run for an average of 323.1 yards rushing and 31.2 points per game. The championship was the first for the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference and the 1956 Montana State football team is a member of the RMAC Hall of Fame. The 1956 Bobcats of head coach Tony Storti were the fourth, and last, Montana State football team to go undefeated. The game is the only blemish on the record of the team as it finished at 9–0–1.[citation needed] Behind head coach Jim Sweeney in 1964, Montana State won the NCAA Western Regional College Division Championship, which existed from 1964 to 1972, with a 28–7 win over Sacramento State in what was also known as the Camellia Bowl. The NCAA Western Regional was one of four regionals that led up to the selection of the NCAA College Division champion by poll. However, neither MSU nor any of the other regional winners—Northern Iowa (Midwest), Middle Tennessee State (Mideast), or East Carolina (East)—were awarded the national championship. That distinction went in split fashion to Los Angeles State (UPI/Coaches) and Wittenberg (AP). Upon the establishment of Division II in 1973, a full playoff system was introduced to determine the national champion. MSU is one of three Big Sky Conference schools, along with Boise State and North Dakota, to win a Camellia Bowl game. The Bobcats finished the 1964 season at 7–4.[citation needed] Montana State won the 1976 NCAA Division II championship at the Pioneer Bowl in Wichita Falls, Texas, beating the Akron Zips 24–13. The Bobcats were led by head coach Sonny Holland and sophomore quarterback Paul Dennehy. MSU led 17–0 in the third quarter before Akron cut the lead to 17–13. Running back Tom Kostrba scored from seven yards out in the fourth quarter to seal the win.[9] The Bobcats advanced to the championship game with a 17–16 quarterfinal win over the New Hampshire in Bozeman. The extra-point attempt to tie the game with seven minutes remaining missed wide right, and the remainder of the game was scoreless.[10] That was followed by a 10–3 semifinal win in the Grantland Rice Bowl over North Dakota State, after trailing 3–0 at halftime on the road in Fargo.[11] Kostrba ran for 100 yards in both playoff games and Don Ueland ran for 94 in the championship game. Montana State finished the 1976 season with ten consecutive wins and a 12–1 record; the lone loss at Fresno State came in September. Eight years later, the Bobcats defeated Louisiana Tech 19–6 in the Division I-AA Championship Game in Charleston, South Carolina, for their third national championship. Led by second-year head coach Dave Arnold, MSU was seeded third in the twelve-team playoffs, which meant a first-round bye and a home game in the quarterfinals, in which the Bobcats rallied from a 0–14 deficit to eliminate Arkansas State 31–14. In the semifinals, also in Bozeman, Montana State trailed second-seeded Rhode Island 12–20 entering the fourth quarter, then scored twenty unanswered points to win 32–20. MSU took the lead on a 97-yard interception return for a touchdown by safety Joe Roberts Jr. Quarterback Kelly Bradley threw for over 300 yards in each playoff game and had eight touchdown passes in the postseason. Tight end Joe Bignell hauled in 10 passes for 130 yards and two touchdowns in the championship game.[12] After a 2–2 start, the Bobcats won ten straight to end at 12–2 in 1984,[13] which followed a 1–10 season in 1983,[14] and preceded a 2–9 record in 1985. Montana State holds the distinction of being the only college football program with national championships in three levels of college football.[15] The Bobcats of head coach Tony Storti claimed a share of the 1956 NAIA title when it finished in a scoreless tie with St. Joseph's (Indiana). In 1976, Sonny Holland's MSU team downed Akron 24–13 for the NCAA Division II championship, and the Bobcats won the NCAA Division I-AA (FCS) championship in 1984 under Dave Arnold with a 19–6 win over Louisiana Tech.[16][17] In the history of college football, including the NAIA, there have been just 11 quarterbacks that have gone over 10,000 yards passing and 1,000 yards rushing for their career. Two of those quarterbacks were produced by Montana State. Travis Lulay accomplished the feat in 2005 when he finished with 10,746 passing and 1,459 rushing. DeNarius McGhee hit those milestones on consecutive weeks in 2013 when he went over 1,000 rushing against Northern Arizona, then hit 10,000 passing against Weber State. He finished his career with 1,133 yards rushing and 11,203 yards passing.[18] Both quarterbacks began playing their freshman season at Montana State. Lulay started the sixth game of his freshman year against Idaho State. After a 2–4 start, he led the Bobcats to the Big Sky regular season championship and their first trip to the playoffs in 18 years. McGhee started the first game of his frosh season and has only missed two games – both in his senior year. He led MSU to Big Sky titles and the FCS playoffs the first three years of his career. MSU is one of just three schools to have repeat winners of the Buck Buchanan Award, which is given out annually by The Sports Network to the most outstanding defensive player in the Football Championship Subdivision.[citation needed] In 2012 Caleb Schreibeis became the first Bobcat to win the award followed by Brad Daly in 2013. Both players manned the defensive end (Bandit) position for MSU and racked up big numbers playing in defensive line coach Bo Beck's system. The two players took completely different routes to the award as Schreibeis, a walk-on out of Billings West, didn't get on the list until the last week of the season and Daly, a highly touted prospect out of Helena Capital, was on the list all season.[citation needed] On November 17, 2018, at approximately 3:19 in the afternoon at Washington-Grizzly Stadium in Missoula with Montana State clinging to a 29–25 lead after rallying from a 22–0 deficit and rival Montana sitting within one foot of the Bobcats goal line with 14 seconds to play, defensive tackle Tucker Yates of Colstrip, Mont. jarred the ball loose from UM's Adam Eastwood and Grant Collins of Bozeman, Mont. sent the ball rolling into the UM backfield where Derek Marks of Belgrade, Mont. pounced on the ball to seal the win for the Bobcats. MSU's other defensive tackle Chase Benson of Helena, Mont. knocked his man so far into the UM backfield that Eastwood had to alter his course causing him to collide with Yates. Bobcat fans have since referred to the play as The Stuff or The Montana Stuff in reference to the four Montana natives who played key roles in the play. Earlier in the quarter Collins had forced and recovered a fumble in UM territory to set up the go-ahead touchdown. The Bobcats trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter and outscored the Grizzlies 29–3 after falling behind 22–0. The overall comeback is the greatest in Cat-Griz Game history and the fourth quarter comeback matched the comeback from a 24–9 deficit by the 1968 Bobcats, which ended in a 29–24 win over UM. Montana State has won 22 (five in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (per RMAC website); 17 in the Big Sky Conference) conference championships through the 2024 season.[19] † Co-champions ‡ Montana and Montana State tied for the 2011 championship, which Montana subsequently vacated[20] NCAA Division I FCS playoff results (known as \"Division I-AA\" from 1978 through 2005) Montana State is 15–12 all time in the FCS playoffs and has won the national championship once, in 1984. The Brawl of the Wild is the game between MSU and their primary rival, the University of Montana Grizzlies. Both teams play for The Great Divide Trophy. As of 2016, Montana holds a healthy 73–42–5 lead in the series, but the series has been tight since 1956 with UM holding just a 33–32 lead; however, there was a notable losing record in the 1990s where MSU failed to win a single game. The series has three distinct periods. From 1897 to 1916 the teams didn't belong to a conference and at times would play twice per year. Early seasons had seven games or less with one season seeing the Grizzlies play just one game. Four of the five ties in the series came during this era. Montana won 12 games to Montana State's 7. In 1917 Montana State joined the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference and in 1924 Montana joined the Pacific Coast Conference, the predecessor of today's Pac-12. The RMAC included several teams that would become Mountain West members. When MSU joined the RMAC it included Colorado, Colorado State, Utah, Utah State, and Brigham Young. The RMAC would drop down to the small college division of NCAA football in 1939 and remained there until 1952 when it joined the NAIA. UM joined the PCC after spending 22 years as part of the Northwest Intercollegiate Athletic Association with league members Washington, Oregon, Washington State, Oregon State, Idaho and Wittman College in 1924. By then the PCC included Stanford, California, UCLA, USC, Oregon, Oregon State, Washington, Washington State, and Idaho. The Bobcats remained in the RMAC through 1956, while the Grizzlies continued in the PCC through 1949 and joined the Skyline (aka Mountain States) Conference, which also competed in the NCAA University (large) Division, from 1951 to 1961. MSU was a NAIA independent from 1957 to 1962 and UM was an NCAA University Division (large) independent in 1950 and 1962. During this period UM enjoyed a 30–8–1 edge in Cat-Griz games. Both schools entered the Big Sky Conference as charter members in 1963 with Montana holding a 42–15–2 series lead, but the Bobcats winning five of the previous seven. From 1963 to 1985 Montana State enjoyed its most successful period of the Cat-Griz rivalry. MSU won 17 games to just six for UM. Following that Montana started \"The Streak\" when it won 16 straight games from 1986 to 2001. MSU ended the drought by winning three of four, MSU (as of 2022) leads the series 10–9 * after \"The Streak.\" The Big Sky era shows Montana with a 31–28 lead. Since MSU won its first national championship in 1956, the series shows UM with a 33–32 edge. Prior to that UM had a 40–10–5 advantage. The Bobcats play their home games at Bobcat Stadium, located at the south end of campus in Bozeman. The stadium and area around the stadium have been under vast renovations and improvements with approximately $14.3 million invested over the past five years. In 2013, the stadium's parking lots were paved, landscaped, and had lighting installed to enhance the pre-game tailgating experience. During and following the 2011 season, stadium lighting was added and its first night game was in 2012 against Chadron State on Thursday, August 30. MSU renovated the south end zone in 2011, adding 5,277 seats to bring the official seating capacity to 17,777. The Cat-Griz game against Montana in 2022 set a stadium record with an attendance of 22,047. The new end zone seating holds over 7,200 fans. Included in the 2011 upgrades were an 18' x 37' LED video board, two scoreboards, and sound system. In 2008, the natural grass playing surface was replaced with FieldTurf. In the late fall of 2011, Montana State raised funds for stadium lighting in order to extend the hours it can practice and play night games. Seven light standards were erected around the stadium. MSU currently has plans to renovate the east grandstand to include matching sky suites of the west grandstand and erect seating in the north end zone. These additions would increase seating capacity to approximately 24,000. Fund-raising isn't expected to go public until 2015. Prior to the 2011 addition, Bobcat Stadium was renovated in 1997 when the west grandstand was removed and replaced with a new grandstand with luxury sky suites, indoor stadium seating, press box, and club room. The north bleachers were also removed at this time and replaced with locker rooms for visitors, game officials, and an auxiliary locker room for the Bobcats. The name of the stadium was changed from Reno H. Sales Stadium to Bobcat Stadium at this time. The stadium capacity dropped from 15,000 to 12,500 due to the reconfiguration. Reno H. Sales Stadium was erected in 1973 and replaced Gatton Field. Through the 1971 football season, the Bobcats played home games for four decades at Gatton Field. It was located directly south of the Romney Gym, across Grant Street and northeast of the Brick Breeden Fieldhouse, which opened in 1957. The playing field ran east–west and had lighting as far back as the 1940s.[21] It was razed in early 1972 and is the site of the Marga Hosaeus Fitness Center, opened in 1973. Bobcat Stadium is approximately a half mile (0.8 km) due south. The field was named for Cyrus J. Gatton (1894–1918), a former Montana State football player from 1913 to 1916. A native of Iowa who was raised in Bozeman, Gatton enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I and was killed while flying for the French on November 4, 1918, just a week before the Armistice. The class of 1917 voted in 1920 that when the school built a new football field it should be named for Cyrus Gatton, and the request was honored ten years later. MSU played its 1972 season at Bozeman High School's Van Winkle Stadium, with expanded temporary seating.[22] Despite the temporary relocation, the Bobcats still won the Big Sky Conference title that season. Montana State has seen 29 players receive First Team All-America recognition, with 22 of those earning consensus All-America status based on being selected to the first team of three or more recognized All-America teams. In 1954, Jim Argeris became the first player selected as a first team All-America. Center Sonny Holland is the only three-time honoree and running back Don Hass the only two-time honoree. MSU had seven first team selections from 2009 to 2012, which is the most of any four-year span in school history. In 2012 quarterback DeNarius McGhee, outside linebacker Jody Owens, and defensive end Caleb Schreibeis were selected to one or more of the various 2012 All-America first teams. McGhee is the first quarterback, Owens is the third linebacker, and Schreibeis the fifth defensive end in MSU history to receive the honor. 2012 marked the second time that MSU has had three All-America selections in one season. The other time it occurred was when 1984's national championship team saw defensive end Mark Fellows, punter Dirk Nelson, and offensive tackle Bill Schmidt selected. In 2013, Brad Daly became the seventh defensive lineman to earn All-America status. Daly joined Bill Kollar, Les Leininger, Mark Fellows, Neal Smith, Dane Fletcher, and Caleb Schreibeis. Daly also joined punter Matthew Peot as the only unanimous All-America selections in school history. (*)unanimous selection Sonny Holland is considered the greatest Bobcat football player in school history. The Butte native joined the program in 1956, and starting at center as a true freshman, helped lead Montana State to its first national title when it tied St. Joseph's in the first NAIA championship game 0–0. He would earn first team All-America honors in 1957, 1958 and 1959 and is the only MSU player to do so three times. As a player, his teams never lost to rival Montana beating the Grizzlies 33–14, 22–13, 20–6, and 40–6, with Holland manning both the center and middle linebacker positions in most of those games. Holland returned to MSU as an assistant coach and became the head coach in 1971. After a disappointing 2–7–1 first season that included his only loss to Montana as a player or head coach, he went on to finish .500 or better in each of the next six years, and set a school record with 47 wins. After a humiliating 30–0 loss to UM in 1971, Holland's teams rattled off wins of 21–3, 33–7, 43–29, 20–3, 21–12, and 24–19 against their rivals. The highlight of his coaching career was the 1976 team, which won the NCAA Division II national championship with a 24–13 victory over the Akron Zips. In 11 games against Montana as a player and head coach Holland went 10–1 outscoring the Grizzlies 277–142. Holland's No. 52 football jersey is one of four retired by Montana State University. A running back from 1964 to 1967 nicknamed the Iron Tumbleweed, Don Hass is one of only two players in MSU history to receive first team All-America status twice, and is the only MSU player to be named a first team NCAA All-America twice. Hass set the game (298), season (1,460), and career (2,954) rushing records for the Bobcats during his four years. His 298 yards in a single game in 1966 against Weber State is still the top single game performance in school history. While that game stands out, his best performances were against the Grizzlies. He led them to wins in 1965 and 1966. In 1965, he ran for 100 yards for the first time in his career, and finished with 129 yards in a 24–7 win. In 1966 he ran for 142 yards in a 38–0 rout in Missoula. He ran for a Cat-Griz record 209 yards against Montana in 1967, leading the Bobcats to a 14–8 win. All told he had 480 yards rushing in three games against Montana, all wins. The Montana State football jersey with number 21 is retired in his honor and hangs inside Bobcat Stadium. Dennis Erickson was a MSU quarterback from 1966 to 1968. He was also a head coach in college and professional football from 1982 to 2011. In 1968, Erickson engineered the greatest comeback, in what is considered by many as the most exciting game in the Cat-Griz series. In all, 34 points were scored in the final quarter. Erickson, flanker Ron Bain, and running back Paul Schafer led the comeback, as the Bobcats clinched a tie for the Big Sky championship—their third straight. Bain's brother, Doug of the Grizzlies, gave Montana a 17–9 lead early in the quarter on a pass from Ray Brum. After another UM touchdown made the score 24–9 with just over 10 minutes to go it looked as if the Grizzlies would win going away, but the Bobcats weren't done. Schaefer scored on a short run with 8:15 to play and Erickson hit Bain for a touchdown with five minutes left cutting the lead to two at 24–22. The Grizzlies appeared to have the winning drive stopped at the MSU 32, but a facemask penalty gave the Cats new life on the 17. Scoring 20 points in the last nine minutes, Montana State won 29–24 when Schafer, who had 58 carries for 234 yards in the game, dove into the end zone with 12 seconds left. After Schafer's go-ahead touchdown with 12 seconds to play, the Grizzlies nearly spoiled things for MSU. After a touchback on the kickoff, UM takes over at the 20 with speedy receiver Ron Baines at quarterback. He gains 15, and another 15 are tacked on by an unnecessary roughness penalty to stop the clock with three seconds to go. Baines then makes a circus run of 37 yards from midfield before he's dragged down at the MSU 13 after time expires. Bobcat QB Dennis Erickson was the difference. \"Erickson killed us,\" UM head coach Jack Swarthout said. Erickson led Montana State to three straight (1966, 1967, 1968) Big Sky Conference championships, and a spot in the 1966 College Division Western Regional (Camellia Bowl), where the Bobcats lost to the San Diego State Aztecs 28–7. He went on to coach the Miami Hurricanes to two NCAA Division I-A national championships. He also had college head coaching stints with the Idaho Vandals, Wyoming Cowboys, Washington State Cougars, Oregon State Beavers and Arizona State Sun Devils. Professionally, he was the head coach of the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers. One Montana State Bobcat has been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Jan Stenerud. After coming to MSU from Norway on a ski jumping scholarship, Stenerud starred on the varsity team, having a then-NCAA record 59-yard field goal against rival Montana in 1965. Stenerud scored 82 points as a senior in 1965. He was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round of the AFL's 1966 draft. In 1970, he kicked a then-Super Bowl record 48-yard field goal in Kansas City's 23–7 Super Bowl IV win. He would later go on to play for the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings earning seven All-Pro and three All-AFL selections, and four trips to the Pro Bowl in his 19 seasons as a professional. He was inducted in 1991 as the first pure kicker in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Stenerud's name is in the Kansas City Chiefs' ring of honor, and he is one of just four MSU players to have his number, \"78\" retired. Six Montana State graduates have played in a Super Bowl. The most recent is Mike Person. Dane Fletcher, who was a linebacker for the New England Patriots, in Super Bowl XLVI. The first was Stenerud in Super Bowl IV, followed by Ron East, who played defensive tackle the following year in Super Bowl V for the Dallas Cowboys. Sam McCullum was a wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IX against the Oakland Raiders. Running back Tony Boddie played in Super Bowl XXII for the Denver Broncos. Travis Jonsen earned a Super Bowl ring as a practice squad player for Tampa Bay. In 2011, quarterback Travis Lulay was named the Most Outstanding Player in the Canadian Football League and led the British Columbia Lions to the Grey Cup title, garnering the game's Most Valuable Player award in the 34–23 win over Winnipeg. The Lions started the season 0–5 before winning 13 of their last 15 games to win the championship. Lulay threw for a league-high 32 touchdowns and passed for 4,815 yards to finish with the second best passer rating in the CFL. He also ran for 391 yards (8.3 per carry), which was good for 12th in the CFL and was the most by a quarterback. Lulay was the quarterback at MSU from 2002 to 2005 leading the Bobcats to three Big Sky Conference titles and two NCAA Division I-AA playoff appearances. All three Big Sky Conference championships were taken in the last game of the season with wins over rival Montana. As a true freshman, Lulay engineered MSU's 10–7 win over the Grizzlies in Missoula, ending UM's 16-game winning streak over the Bobcats, and was named the Big Sky Conference's Newcomer of the Year. Lulay led Montana State in rushing his senior year with 611 yards. He left with school records for career passing yards (10,746–11th in NCAA Division I-AA history), single-season total offense, and total offense in a career. He graduated with a 3.91 GPA. He played briefly for the Seattle Seahawks and New Orleans Saints of the NFL and also played in the NFL Europa for two seasons. In 1974 Kollar became the first small college (non-FBS) player to win the Senior Bowl MVP, and is one of only two (Portland State's Neil Lomax being the other) small college players to win the award in that game's history. Kollar became one of just four Big Sky Conference players ever selected as an NFL first round draft choice when he was taken by the Cincinnati Bengals in 1974. He went on to play eight seasons in the NFL, including five with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He has been an NFL defensive line coach since 1990 and currently coaches in that capacity for the Denver Broncos. He is a member of the Senior Bowl and MSU Hall of Fames, and his number \"77\" is one of only four football numbers retired by MSU. Don Haas, Holland and Stenerud are the others. Following the completion of the 2012 NCAA FCS regular season, Schreibeis was named the winner of Buck Buchanan Award given annually by The Sports Network to the most outstanding defensive player in the FCS. It was the first such distinction for a Montana State player. He was also a consensus All-America in 2012, the 20th Bobcat to attain that status. Schreibeis came to Montana State as a walk-on in 2008, and after red-shirting for one season, eventually worked his way into a starting position for one game as a sophomore in 2010. He became a full-time starter in 2011 and was selected as an honorable mention to the All-Big Sky team. The 2012 season was a breakout campaign for Schreibeis. In 10 regular-season games, the team captain collected 51 tackles and led the Big Sky with 12 sacks. He ranked first on his team in tackles for loss (14.5), quarterback hurries (seven) and forced fumbles (seven), which was also the top mark in the nation. The Bobcats also won their third straight Big Sky Conference title that season. Brad Daly garnered the 2013 Buck Buchanan Award and the FCS Athletics Directors Association Award, and is perhaps the best pure pass rusher in MSU history. Along with the two defensive player of the year awards, he was also a finalist for the Ted Hendricks Award, given to the best defensive end in all divisions of college football. He finished fifth in the final voting. He made an immediate impact as a true-freshman, despite playing sparingly, as he recorded two sacks and blocked two kicks, leaving observers to speculate that he would have a great career. Daly left football after that season, only to return a year later with a renewed vigor. In his sophomore year, he proved his worth by leading the Big Sky Conference with 12.5 sacks as a situational pass rusher. As a junior he became a full-time defensive end, but suffered a severely sprained ankle, and dropped to just 5.5 sacks. A year later he bounced back, despite nagging injuries, to lead the nation in sacks with 14 sacks and 20.5 tackles for loss. For his career Daly finished with 34 sacks. He was also a unanimous first team All-America selection and the Big Sky Conference defensive player of the year as a senior. He was voted a team captain prior to his senior season, joining his father J and brother Bobby as MSU team captains and All-Americans. Bobby Daly was sixth in the 2007 Buck Buchanan Award voting. Two Montana State Bobcats have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame; Jan Stenerud. After coming to MSU from Norway on a ski jumping scholarship, Stenerud starred on the varsity team with a then-NCAA record 59-yard field goal against rival Montana and 82 points scored as a senior in 1965. He was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round of the AFL's 1966 draft. Stenerud scored 11 points, including a then-Super Bowl record 48-yard field goal, in Kansas City's 23–7 Super Bowl IV win in 1970. He would later go on to play for the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings earning four trips to the Pro Bowl in his 19 seasons as a professional. He was inducted in 1991 and is one of only two pure kickers in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the other being Morten Andersen. Stenerud's name is in the Kansas City Chiefs' ring of honor and he is one of just four MSU players to have his number \"78\" retired. William Wallace \"Bill\" Kollar. Wilson was elected to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame on September 20, 1997, following a long career as an offensive lineman with the British Columbia Lions. The guard and center was awarded All-Western All-Star and All-Canadian All-Star honors for seven years, 1975–81. He was voted the Schenley Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman in 1977. He played in two Grey Cup games (1983 and 1985), and was a key member of B.C.'s 1985 championship team. Wylie was elected to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame on May 24, 1980. The former Bobcat All-America was a standout defensive back and kick return specialist for nine years with Calgary. He played for the Calgary Stampeders from 1956 to 1964, and for five straight years was an All-Western All-Star and twice was an All-Canadian All-Star.

                "title": "Joel Embiid - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Joel Hans Embiid (/dʒoʊˈɛl ɛmˈbiːd/ joh-EL em-BEED;[1][2] born 16 March 1994) is a Cameroonian-American[a] professional basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). After one year of college basketball with the Kansas Jayhawks, he was drafted third overall by the 76ers in the 2014 NBA draft. The 7-foot (2.13 m) Embiid is a seven-time NBA All-Star, a five-time member of the All-NBA Team, a three-time member of the All-Defensive Team, and a two-time NBA scoring champion. He was named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2023. Embiid also won a gold medal on the 2024 U.S. Olympic team. Multiple foot and knee injuries delayed Embiid's debut for two seasons until 2016–17 when he was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team despite playing only 31 games. He has nicknamed himself \"the Process\" as an embrace of the era in 76ers history with the same name he played in early in his career.[3][4][5][6] Embiid led the NBA in scoring during the 2021–22 and 2022–23 seasons, becoming the first center to do so since Shaquille O'Neal (2000), and was also the first center since Moses Malone (1982) to average over 30 points per game, while also being the first foreign player to lead the NBA in scoring. Embiid was born in Yaoundé, Cameroon, to military officer Thomas Embiid[7] and his wife, Christine.[8] He played volleyball and soccer[9] in childhood and originally planned to play professional volleyball in Europe[10] but started playing basketball at age 15, modeling his game after NBA Hall of Fame center Hakeem Olajuwon.[7][10] Embiid was discovered at a basketball camp by Luc Mbah a Moute, a fellow native of Yaoundé and an NBA player.[10][11] With Mbah a Moute as his mentor, Embiid moved to the United States at age 16 to devote himself to becoming a professional basketball player.[12] Embiid enrolled at Montverde Academy, Mbah a Moute's alma mater, but transferred after his first year due to a lack of playing time.[10][13] He then attended The Rock School, a Christian academy, in Gainesville, Florida.[13] As a senior, he led their team to a 33–4 record and state championship, averaging 13.0 points, 9.7 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game. Embiid was a five-star recruit according to Rivals.com[14][15] and committed to Kansas in November 2012.[12] Embiid attended the University of Kansas for one year alongside notable teammate Andrew Wiggins. On 13 February 2014, he was named one of the 30 finalists for the Naismith College Player of the Year.[16] In 2013–14, he played 28 games, averaging 11.2 points, 8.1 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 2.6 blocks in 23.1 minutes per game.[17] He had over 15 points in seven games and over 5 blocks in six games. He subsequently earned Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year honors and was named second-team All-Big 12. Embiid suffered a stress fracture in his back in March 2014.[18] He missed that year's Big 12 tournament and NCAA tournament. Kansas lost in the second round (round of 32) of the NCAA tournament. On 9 April 2014, Embiid declared for the 2014 NBA draft, forgoing his final three years of college eligibility.[19] On 20 June 2014, he underwent surgery on a broken navicular bone in his right foot, and was subsequently ruled out for four to six months.[20] Six days later, he was selected with the third overall pick by the Philadelphia 76ers.[21] That selection made him the third Cameroonian-born NBA player after Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje and Luc Mbah a Moute, as well as the highest selected player from Cameroon.[7] On 26 August 2014, Embiid signed his rookie scale contract with the 76ers.[22][23] He was later ruled unlikely to play at all in the 2014–15 season due to the broken navicular bone in his foot.[24] After missing the entire 2014–15 season, it was announced on 13 June 2015 that Embiid had suffered a setback in his recovery after a CT scan revealed less healing than anticipated.[25] It was later determined that Embiid's chances of playing in the 2015–16 season were slim following a second round of surgery on his right foot on 18 August 2015.[26][27] He missed the entire 2015–16 season. On 4 October 2016, Embiid started at center in the 76ers' first preseason game against the Boston Celtics.[28] In his first action, he recorded six points, four rebounds and two blocks in 13 minutes en route to a 92–89 victory.[29] On 26 October 2016, Embiid made his long-awaited NBA regular-season debut in the 76ers' season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

In addition, the previous 35 times someone scored at least 44 for the 76ers, it was Iverson.[54] On 18 January, he was named a starter for the 2018 NBA All-Star Game, becoming the first Philadelphia player selected as an All-Star starter since Allen Iverson in the 2009–10 season, and the first Sixers All-Star since Jrue Holiday in 2013.[56] Later that day, he scored 26 points and matched a then-career best with 16 rebounds in an 89–80 win over the Boston Celtics.[56] He was subsequently named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played between Monday, 15 January and Sunday, 21 January.[57] On 10 February, he had 29 points and tied a then-career high with 16 rebounds in a 112–98 win over the Los Angeles Clippers.[58] Two days later, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played between Monday, 5 February and Sunday, 11 February.[59] On 15 March, he scored 29 points in a 118–110 win over the New York Knicks, becoming the first Sixers player to notch 40 20-point performances in a season since Andre Iguodala in 2007–08.[60] A day later, on his 24th birthday, Embiid had 24 points and a then-career high 19 rebounds in a 120–116 win over the Brooklyn Nets.[61] On 28 March against the Knicks, Embiid suffered an orbital fracture of his left eye.[62] He underwent surgery three days later, with a two-week return date the likely outcome.[63] After missing the first two games of the 76ers' first-round playoff series against the Miami Heat with the left eye injury, Embiid made his playoff debut in Game 3 on 19 April.

I want to play with my brothers in the league. I want to play for my fans because they’ve been incredible since the day I came here. But most of all, I want to honor my son who was born in the US. I want my boy to know I played my first Olympics for him.[168] During the Olympics, Embiid was frequently booed by French fans over his decision to play for the United States.[169][170] He helped Team USA win the gold medal, and in five games, he averaged 11.2 points, 3.8 rebounds, 1.4 assists and a block per game while shooting 56.8% from the field.[171] Embiid has not ruled out playing for Cameroon in the future.

I know corny dudes are always saying that because they bought like an SUV or whatever, but I swear I can say it for real. I’ll prove it to you like this…. This is a real story. Hand to God. When I came over from Cameroon at 16, I didn’t know any English, didn’t know a single person in America, didn’t really understand the culture except for like basic hip-hop. And I know people sort of know my story, but I don’t think they really understand how crazy it is. Because I had just started playing basketball literally — literally — three months before I got an offer to come play high school ball in Florida. I could dunk, but I had no handle. So I went to the practice on the first day, and I was so bad that the coach kicked me out of the gym. I didn’t know what I was doing. I was so skinny, so soft. But the worst part was that all my own teammates were seriously pointing and laughing at me, like the asshole kids in the movies about high school. It was crazy. I’m looking at these dudes, not really understanding what they’re even saying, like, Damn guys, come on, let’s just trust the process here. And they’re just like, “LOL NAH YOU SUCK.” Man, I went back to my dorm and cried. I was like, This is crazy. What am I even doing here? I can’t play. I’m going home. But then I was sitting in my room listening to Lil Wayne or something, in my feelings, thinking about these dudes making fun of me, and suddenly my competitive side took over. I got really, really motivated. Whenever people say I can’t do something, I actually love it. It makes me want to prove them wrong so bad. So I said to myself, Alright, I’m literally just going to work and work in the gym until I’m good. KOBE. I got better and better, especially around the rim, but I still couldn’t shoot. So I started working out with one of my teammates, Michael Frazier II. Remember him? This dude was a shooter. Like, killing it. He hit 11 threes in a game once for Florida. So after practice, I’d do these three-point drills with him, and of course, he’s smashing me. I have no form, no fundamentals. I’m jacking shit up. But I just can’t take losing to this dude every day. I’m so competitive that I’m like, I gotta beat this guy. I gotta find a way. Young Joel Embiid in 2011 when I came over to the states ha #SwagWasAss #NoHairline #iWasAbout150Pounds #MyBestFriendWasVideoGames #DidntKnowEnglish #BasketballWasMyWorstNightmareCuzISucked A post shared by Joel \"The Process\" Embiid (@joelembiid) on Apr 25, 2015 at 6:56pm PDT So I’m chilling one night, and I go on YouTube, and I’m thinking I’m about to figure this shooting thing out. I go to the search box like…. HOW TO SHOOT 3 POINTERS. Nah. HOW TO SHOOT GOOD FORM Nah. Then the light bulb went off, man. I typed in the magic words. WHITE PEOPLE SHOOTING 3 POINTERS. Listen, I know it’s a stereotype, but have you ever seen a normal, 30-year-old white guy shoot a three-pointer? That elbow is tucked, man. The knees are bent. The follow-through is perfect. Always. You know how in America, there’s always an older guy wearing like EVERLAST sweat-shorts at the court? That guy is always a problem. His J is always wet. Those are the guys I learned from on YouTube. Just random people shooting threes with perfect form. Me and Michael would play after practice for hours, and I’d just try to imitate how they shot the ball, and I started being able to compete. It was crazy, because getting some range changed my whole game. Teams couldn’t play off me anymore, and I started doing a lot better. I know people are going to think I’m exaggerating, but that’s a real story. I didn’t even really know who J.J. Redick was at that point. I barely knew anything about the NBA because I could never watch it in Cameroon. And no, I don’t mean that like we were too poor and we didn’t have a TV. We had a TV. We had a pretty normal life. Americans have crazy ideas about Africa, like its all one big country. WHITE PEOPLE SHOOTING 3 POINTERS. No, the reason I couldn’t watch the NBA is because my mom was super, super strict about school. She didn’t play around. I could never stay up to watch the games. Every single day it was: Wake up, eat, go to school from seven to five, run home and take a nap, wake up and eat dinner, then study until like midnight. I’m telling you — school is too easy in America, man. In Cameroon, it’s crazy. Elementary school is like college. I didn’t even have any friends because all I ever did was sleep and do homework. I remember when Cameroon had the Golden Generation at the 2002 World Cup, I was eight years old, so I was begging my mom and dad to let me play soccer. But they weren’t having it. So when I got to be older, I got a little more rebellious, and I’d sneak out of the house to play. There was like an hour window after school when my mom wasn’t home yet, and the soccer field was right next to our house, so I had this whole scheme. I’d run home after school and put my bookbag by the kitchen table and then I’d open up a science book or whatever. And I’d have that thing all highlighted and everything, like I was really grinding. Papers and pens everywhere. Then once that was all set up, I’d run back out to the field. I literally got so good that I could hear the specific sound of my mom’s car coming down the street. If I was at the other end of the field and I was too far away, whoever was playing keeper would see her car coming and be yelling like, “Joel! Joellllllllllll! Your mom’s coming, bro! Run!” And I’d sprint into the back of our house, hide my shoes and sit down at the table, like sweating. Like I was thinking so hard about science that I was about to pass out. I had like 25 seconds before my mom parked her car, took off her shoes and got inside to make sure I was studying. I’d be sitting there with a glass of juice or whatever, like, “Hello, Mom. It’s me, Your Good Son.” The first time I ever watched an NBA game was the 2009 Finals. Lakers vs. Magic. Dwight. Pau. Odom. KOBE. I had never seen anything like that. I was watching those dudes shoot like 100% from the floor. Everything was going in. The way they moved, and the athleticism, I thought it was the coolest thing in the world. I had that moment like, I just wanna do that. I begged my mom and dad. I begged for a year. My dad was like, “Nobody in Cameroon plays basketball. You can play volleyball.” I’m like, “Yo, volleyball?” By that time, I had started hearing some American hip-hop on the internet, and I’d be trying to sing the words to look cool, even though I didn’t know any English. I’d be walking around school singing that Lil’ Bow Wow and Ciara song. Remember that? All I could say in English was like “Hello, good morning,” and then “I AIN’T NEVER HAD NOBODY DO ME LIKE YOU.” That was my exposure to American culture — Bow Wow, Kanye and Kobe. Sometimes I’d go to this court by my house where guys would play pickup, and every time I’d shoot the ball, I’d literally yell out, “KOBE!” Imagine it. I’m out there shooting bricks, yelling out Kobe, on a busted hoop in Cameroon. Seven years later, I was playing Kobe. It’s a movie. It’s really a movie. Even when people hear the story, they think like, “Oh, they discovered this crazy talent in Africa, and this guy came over and started killing it. Kansas. NBA. Boom.” Nah. You don’t even understand. When I was 16, Luc Mbah a Moute invited me to come to the basketball camp that he puts on every summer in Cameroon, and the only reason was because I was like 6 foot 10. I was so nervous that I didn’t even show up the first day. The second day, I showed up, they put me in the game and I dunked on somebody. I think I was so scared that my adrenaline took over or something. Straight away, first game. And I mean — not just dunked. Dunked on somebody. I was like, OH SHIT. I mean, I was still terrible, but it was enough. They could see something in me. I got a spot at the Basketball Without Borders camp in South Africa. Two months later, I was on a plane to Florida to go to high school in America. A year later, I committed to Kansas. I didn’t even know what March Madness was. I didn’t know who the good teams were. The only reason I chose Kansas was because Luc told me, “Kansas is the best. You should go to Kansas.” So I went to Kansas. And this is another true story … hand to God. My very first scrimmage at Kansas, I got dunked on so hard by Tarik Black that I almost quit. Tarik dunked on me so hard that I was looking at plane tickets home. This guy was a senior. He was a grown man. I didn’t know what was going on. He got his own rebound and dunked over me so hard that everything went in slow motion. He dunked the ball off my head, for real. But I didn’t even tell you the worst part. The worst part was that the entire Kansas women’s hoops team was sitting in the bleachers watching the scrimmage. The whole gym was laughing at me. It was crazy. Seriously, it was like a WORLDSTAR situation. So I went straight to Bill Self’s office afterward and I said, “I can’t do this. You have to redshirt me. I can’t play with these guys.” And Bill was like, “What? Are you serious? In two years, you’re going to be the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft.” The thing was, I had been told that all these college coaches lie. So I really thought he was trying to be slick with me. In my head, I was like, Alright, I’m just going to keep showing up and at least I’ll get a degree out of this. That will make my mom happy. The only thing that kept me going was the way that I was raised by my parents. They always told us to keep working, no matter what. I had this DVD that my coach in Cameroon had mailed to me when I first came to America. It was an hour-long tape of Hakeem Olajuwon and some other legendary big men. I probably watched that DVD every single day for three years. I would study the way Hakeem moved, and I would go out and try to imitate him. I did it in high school, and I did it at Kansas. I was basically just imagining that I was a good basketball player. The power of the mind is kind of amazing. I mean, I sucked. But somehow, I convinced myself that I was Hakeem. And I started getting better and better. And then I sort of started killing it. I pretended my way to the NBA. I seriously got to the league by watching YouTube and living in the gym. There’s no other way to explain it. Remember when KG won the title with the Celtics, and he was acting all crazy, screaming out, “ANYTHING IS POSSIBLLLLLLLLLLLLLE!!!!!!!!!!!!” That speaks to me. That’s my life. It happened so fast that it doesn’t even make sense. The most surreal moment was when Kobe was retiring, and he played his last game in Philly. After the game, they set up a little room for us to talk for a minute. He walked in, and I shook his hand and I told him, “Man, I know you probably hear this a lot, but I literally started playing basketball because of you seven years ago. Whenever I’d be shooting the ball at the park, I’d be yelling out, ‘KOBEEEEEE!’” He laughed and we talked for a minute, and then before he left he said the most Kobe thing. To most people, it wouldn’t mean anything. But to me, it was surreal. It was like I was in a video game or something. He said, in the most Kobe way, “O.K., young fella. Keep working. Keep working.” Thank you, Kobe. Thank you, Hakeem. Thank you, Mom and Dad. Thank you, Kansas. Thank you, Philly. Thank you, Lil’ Bow Wow. Thank you, Random White People. It’s a movie, I swear. I won’t try to define who I’ve become, over these last 17 years, in a single letter ... I can say this for sure: I have the Spurs and I have San Antonio to than Life is always about hard work and caring about the people close to you. Caring about your community. The real payoff isn’t money or anything material. Four years before I was on that plane with Hakeem telling me we’re going shopping for cashmere suits together, I was on the corner, selling drugs outside the Ch © 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved",

                "content": "4 min read basketball-2 joel-embid sixers nba success-story Joel Embiid hit the genetic lottery. By the time he was 17 he was 6 foot 10 and was freakishly athletic. He was a candidate for the Cameroon National Volleyball team, and basketball was only an afterthought, but a man named Joe Touomou had other plans. Word had got around about the kid who was abnormally tall and agile on his feet. Joe Touomou, the first D1 basketball player out of Cameroon, saw the insane amount of potential that Embiid had. He even went down to see Embiid in person. Ex-Georgetown guard & Cameroon native Joe Touomou has accepted a job with NBA Academy Africa in Thies, Senegal as a Player Development Coach Shocked by Embid's stature, Joe invited Embiid to the Nba players, Luc Mbah a Moute's camp in Cameroon. Before the camp began, Embiid had a lot of work to do. Before this encounter, Embiid's basketball experience consisted of him going to the local park and imitating the late great Kobe Bryant's moves against the Magic in 2009. Every time he would shoot, he would yell \"KOBE.\" Due to this lack of experience, Embiid trained under Coach Moudio 3 months before camp. He had to sharpen up his skills as quickly as possible if he wanted any chance at taking this basketball pipe dream to the next level. 3 months later, it was finally time for Embiid to attend the camp he had worked so hard for. Embiid was anxious, but there was nothing he could do now. It was time for him to step up and show Luc Mbah a Moute that he deserves a shot. Unfortunately, Embiid's anxiousness got the better of him. On day 1 of the camp, Joel Embid did not show up and his coach had noticed his unusual absence. The next morning, Coach Moudio, went to Embid's house and found him playing video games with his little brother. Making sure Embid did not miss another day of the camp, Coach Moudio escorted Embid personally. Still anxious, it was time for Embid to go out and just play basketball. He had already missed a day, but it did not matter. In one play, a young Embid caught an off-target pass in the post and pulled off a Hakeem Olajuwon esque post-move. He did a quick dribble, then drop stepped past the defender, and exploded to the hoop. Luc Mbah a Moute was left in awe and even said that he knew people in the Nba that could not pull off that move. It’s National Mentoring month and @Sixers rookie stud @JoelEmbiid gets some sage advice from Hall of Famer Hakeem @DR34M Olajuwon! pic.twitter.com/1QrGYdKYQi After his performance at the camp, Embid got invited to the Basketball Without Borders Camp. He once again showed out and was sent to the US to play at the Montverde Academy in Florida, which is where Luc Mbah a Moute went just 8 years ago. When he was leaving Cameroon, Embid's little brother was devastated. He did not know when he would see his beloved older brother again, but Embid had to leave for a chance at a better life for his family. Embid's rise to NBA superstardom was just starting here. When arriving at Montverde, Embid did not know a lick of English. The only words he knew were \"Good Morning.\" He learned English by listening to comedians and rappers, but the day finally came where Embid stepped on the basketball court. At his first few practices, he made a complete fool of himself. He could not catch a ball, barely could dribble, and sometimes would miss layups. He was completely out of his element, and it would not help that his teammates would make fun of him constantly. This is where Embid's high school coach, Kevin Boyle dropped a legendary quote, \"'You laugh now, but in five years you are all going to go to Joel to borrow money because he's going to be rich.\" Fast-forwarding a year, Embid had completely rounded out his game. He was a much more polished and explosive player. He had also grown to 7 feet tall, which definitely improved his odds. Scouts were pouring in from all around the nation to watch the explosive 7-foot teenager from Cameroon. While he was doing this, he would constantly communicate with his family back home. He would always tell them he was fine, even though he was desperately missing them. Now it was finally time for Embid to pick a college that he wanted to attend. The good news, almost every school in the nation wanted Embid on their roster, but the bad news, Embid did not even know what the NCAA was. Thankfully, Embid had Luc Mbah a Moute to guide him through the whole process. In the end, he decided to go to Kansas where he would only spend one year. Once again, Embid did not believe in himself in the beginning. He finds himself full of anxiety, just like Luc Mbah a Moute's camp a few years ago. After the first practice at Kansas, he went to the coach said, \"I don't belong here.\" The coach was flabbergasted and told Embid, \" \"Are you kidding? You will be the No. 1 pick in the NBA in two years.\" Embid did not believe him at first, but after a dominant freshman collegiate season, Embid entered the draft as a one and done prospect. The coach was a little off, but Embid was picked by the Philadelphia 76ers with the third pick in the draft and the rest is history.
