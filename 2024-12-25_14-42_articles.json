                "title": "Home Alone - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Home Alone is a 1990 American comedy film directed by Chris Columbus, and written and produced by John Hughes. The first film in the Home Alone franchise, the film stars Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister, an eight-year old boy who defends his Chicago home from a home invasion by a pair of robbers after his family accidentally leave him behind on their Christmas vacation to Paris. The cast also features Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard, and Catherine O'Hara. Hughes conceived Home Alone while on vacation, with Warner Bros. being originally intended to finance and distribute the film. However, Warner Bros. shut down the production after it exceeded its assigned budget. 20th Century Fox assumed responsibilities following meetings with Hughes. Columbus and Culkin were hired soon afterwards. Filming took place between February and May 1990 on location across Illinois. Home Alone had a sneak preview across 1,000 theaters on November 10, 1990, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 16. While the film's reception was initially mixed, in later years reception has been generally positive, with praise for its cast, humor, and music. Home Alone grossed $476.7 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 1990. It made Culkin a child star, and was the highest-grossing live-action comedy for two decades. It was nominated for two Academy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. Home Alone has since been considered one of the best Christmas films. In 2023, Home Alone was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". A sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, was released in 1992. The McCallister family prepares to spend Christmas in Paris, gathering at Kate and Peter's home in a Chicago suburb on the night before their departure. Kate and Peter's youngest son Kevin is ridiculed by his siblings and cousins due to his immaturity. Kevin inadvertently ruins the family dinner after a scuffle with his oldest brother Buzz, resulting in Kate sending him up to the attic. Kevin berates his mother for allowing the rest of the family to pick on him and wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds create a power outage, disabling the alarm clocks and causing the family to oversleep. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport, Kevin is accidentally left behind. Kevin wakes to find the house empty and the family cars still in the garage, unaware that they had rented vans to take them to the airport. Thinking that his wish has come true, he is overjoyed with his newfound freedom. Later, Kevin becomes frightened by his eccentric next-door neighbor, \"Old Man\" Marley, rumored to be a serial killer nicknamed the \"South-Bend Shovel Slayer\" who murdered his own family. The McCallister home is soon stalked by the \"Wet Bandits\", Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars who have been breaking into other vacant houses in the neighborhood. Kevin tricks them into thinking that his family is still home, forcing them to postpone their plans to rob the McCallister house. Kate realizes mid-flight that Kevin was left behind, and upon arrival in Paris, the family discovers that all flights for the next two days are booked, and that the phone lines are still down back home in Chicago. Peter and the rest of the family stay at his brother Rob’s apartment in Paris while Kate stays at the airport. Unable to book a flight to Chicago, Kate convinces a couple to trade tickets with her. When she eventually arrives in the US, she meets Gus Polinski, the lead member of a traveling polka band, who offers to let her travel with them to Chicago in a moving van on the way to Milwaukee. On Christmas Eve, Harry and Marv finally realize that only Kevin is in the McCallister home, and Kevin overhears them discussing plans to break into the house that night. Kevin starts to miss his family and asks the local Santa Claus impersonator if he could bring them back for Christmas. He goes to church and watches a choir perform, eventually re-encountering Marley, who proves the rumors about him are false. Marley points out his granddaughter in the choir and mentions he has never met her since she is the daughter of his estranged son. Kevin suggests Marley should reconcile with his son. Kevin returns home and rigs the house with handmade booby traps. Harry and Marv break in, spring the traps, and suffer various injuries. Kevin calls the police and lures the duo into a vacant neighboring house that they had previously broken into. Harry and Marv ambush Kevin and prepare to get their revenge, but Marley intervenes and knocks them out with his snow shovel. The police arrive and arrest Harry and Marv, having identified all the houses that they broke into due to their habit of flooding them. On Christmas Day, Kevin is initially disappointed to find that his family is still gone. However, Kate arrives home and they reconcile. The rest of the family then returns after waiting in Paris for a direct flight to Chicago. Kevin keeps silent about his encounter with Harry and Marv, although Peter finds Harry's knocked-out gold tooth. Kevin then happily watches Marley reuniting with his son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter. Credits adapted from American Film Institute.[4] Writer and producer John Hughes conceived Home Alone while preparing to go on vacation. He said: \"I was going away on vacation, and making a list of everything I didn't want to forget. I thought, 'Well, I'd better not forget my kids.' Then I thought, 'What if I left my 10-year-old son at home? What would he do?'\"[5] Hughes wrote eight pages of notes that developed into the screenplay.[5] Imagining that children are naturally most scared of robbers, Hughes also worked that aspect into the plot of the film.[5] Home Alone was initially set to be financed and distributed by Warner Bros. Hughes promised that he could make the movie for less than $10 million, considerably less than most feature film production budgets of that era. Concerned that the film might exceed that amount, Hughes met secretly with 20th Century Fox before production to see if they would fund the project if Warner proved inflexible. According to executive producer Scott Rosenfelt, a copy of the script was \"clandestinely\" delivered to Fox, bypassing the legal restrictions that would have otherwise prevented Fox from seeing it until the project was in turnaround.[6] Early in production, the budget grew to $14.7 million. Warner demanded that it be cut by $1.2 million; the producers responded with a memo arguing that the budget could not be cut any further. Unconvinced, Warner shut down production the next day, but it quickly resumed when Fox took up Hughes on his offer. The final budget grew to $18 million.[6] Hughes had asked Patrick Read Johnson to direct, but he was committed to directing Spaced Invaders (1990).[7] He turned to Chris Columbus, who had left National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989) before shooting started because of a personality clash with starring actor Chevy Chase, who Columbus said treated him \"like dirt\".[8] Hughes gave him the scripts for both Home Alone and Reach the Rock (1998); Columbus chose to direct Home Alone, as he found it funnier and liked the Christmas theme.[9][10] Columbus did an uncredited rewrite of the script; among his contributions was the character of Old Man Marley, which he created to give the story a more serious layer, as well as a more emotional, happier ending.[11] Hughes suggested to Columbus that they cast Macaulay Culkin as Kevin, because of his experience while shooting Uncle Buck (1989). Columbus met with 200 other actors for the part, as he felt it was his \"directorial responsibility\".[10][12] John Mulaney was asked to audition for the role of Kevin after being scouted in a children's sketch comedy group, but his parents refused the opportunity.[13] Columbus finally met with Culkin and agreed he was the right choice.[10] After Robert De Niro and Jon Lovitz turned down the role of Harry, Joe Pesci accepted it.[14] The role of Uncle Frank was written for Kelsey Grammer, but was given to Gerry Bamman when Grammer was unavailable.[15][16] Daniel Stern was cast as Marv, but before shooting started, he was told that the production schedule had been extended from six weeks to eight. He dropped out after as he would not be paid more for the extended schedule. Daniel Roebuck was hired to replace him, but after two days of rehearsal, Columbus felt he was lacking chemistry with Pesci and brought back Stern.[6] Roebuck later said that, although he was upset to be fired from the production, he now believed the experience was \"a little blip of unimportance\".[17] Chris Farley auditioned for the role of the Santa Claus impersonator, but he failed to impress Columbus.[18] John Candy was available for only one day to film his scenes, which took 23 hours to shoot. He was paid only $414, since he did the film as a favor to Hughes. In return, he was the only actor Hughes allowed to go off-script; according to Columbus, all his dialogue was improvised.[6] Principal photography took place from February 14, 1990, to May 8, 1990, over a course of 83 days on an $18.3 million budget.[19][20][21] The house exterior scenes were filmed on location at a three-story single-family house located at 671 Lincoln Avenue[22] in the North Shore village of Winnetka, Illinois, where many of Hughes' previous films had also been shot,[23] but at different houses. The only interiors of the house used for filming that made it to the finished film were the main staircase, attic and most of the first floor landing,[24] while all the other interiors of the house were duplicated on a sound stage to allow more room for equipment and crew. These sets were built in the then-disused gym of New Trier High School's west campus, previously used by Hughes for Uncle Buck and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, where the production company had already set up its offices.[6] 671 Lincoln Avenue later became a tourist attraction.[25] The tree house in the backyard was built specifically for the film and dismantled after filming ended.[14] Kevin runs away from his third encounter with Marley in Hubbard Woods Park in Winnetka.[26] In addition, the scene where Kevin wades in his neighbor's flooded basement was shot at the empty swimming pool of the aforementioned campus of New Trier High School, with the American Airlines DC-10 first class cabin interiors done on the basketball courts. The church exteriors were shot at Trinity United Methodist Church in Wilmette, Illinois, while the interiors were shot at Grace Episcopal Church in Oak Park, Illinois.[27] Filming also took place over four sixteen-hour days at O'Hare International Airport, which served for both itself and Orly Airport in Paris. John Candy filmed his cameo appearance for the film over the course of one day at Meigs Field.[19] For the film within a film, Angels with Filthy Souls (the title of which parodies the 1938 crime film Angels with Dirty Faces), shooting took only one day, on the final \"test day\" prior to the official start of principal photography. To create the illusion that the film was an authentic 1940s gangster film, the scene was filmed on black-and-white negative film, and Johnny's office featured props from that era. Like much of the film, most of the sequence was shot with low, wide angles that, according to journalist Darryn King, \"capture the action as if a child were perceiving it\".[28] Originally, Ralph Foody was to play Snakes and Michael Guido was to play Johnny, but since Foody had recently undergone knee replacement surgery, he was unable to do the death scene where Snakes drops to his knees, leading to the roles being switched.[29] Cinematographer Julio Macat recalled that Pesci was more difficult to work with than Culkin. The older actor believed some of the dialogue was not of a quality commensurate with his acting ability. He also resented the early unit calls, since they prevented him from starting his day with nine holes of golf as he preferred to do.[6] After he took the assistant director by the collar one day to complain about this, daily call times were moved back from 7 to 9 a.m. to accommodate his rounds.[30] On the other end of the schedule, the crew had limited time to film the many nighttime scenes, since Culkin could not work any later than 10 p.m. due to his age.[10] Pesci said in a 2022 interview with People of working with Culkin, \"I intentionally limited my interactions with him to preserve the dynamic\" and made sure not \"to come across on the screen that we were in any way friendly\" in order to \"maintain the integrity of the adversarial relationship\".[31] On the set, Pesci and Stern both had difficulty refraining from cursing, which became annoying to Pesci, since Culkin was on set as well. In fact, the only curse words that made it into the film were \"shit\", accidentally said by Daniel Stern when his shoe fell through the pet door, and \"hell\", which was said by both Pesci and Stern after their characters encounter one another after going through Kevin's booby traps and by Johnny to the character of Snakes in Angels with Filthy Souls.[32][12] Pesci's use of \"cartoon cursing\", or menacing gibberish, garnered comparisons to Looney Tunes character Yosemite Sam.[33] The film's stunts also created tension for the crew during shooting. Columbus said, \"Every time the stunt guys did one of those stunts it wasn't funny. We'd watch it, and I would just pray that the guys were alive.\"[10][34] Stunts were originally prepared with safety harnesses, but because of their visibility on camera, the film's final stunts were performed without them.[10] Troy Brown and Leon Delaney were stuntmen for Pesci and Stern, respectively.[35] An injury had occurred between Pesci and Culkin during one of the rehearsals for the scene in which Harry tries to bite off Kevin's finger; Culkin still has the scar.[12] The tarantula that walks on Stern's face was real.[35] Senta Moses, who played Tracy, recalled in 2020 that one of the most difficult scenes to shoot was the family's run through O'Hare International Airport to catch their flight. While it does not last long, it required several days to film. \"There were thousands of extras, all expertly choreographed so none of us would be in danger running at full speed through the American Airlines terminal\", she told The Hollywood Reporter. \"And we ran at full speed. Sometimes we'd bump into each other, like a multi-car pileup on the expressway, and just crack up laughing ... There were so many setups and narrowly missed moments of disaster, but to my knowledge, no one got hurt.\"[36] Columbus initially hoped to have Bruce Broughton score the film, and early posters listed him as the composer. However, Broughton was busy with The Rescuers Down Under (1990), and he had to cancel at the last minute.[10] Columbus was later able to get in touch with Steven Spielberg, who helped him contact John Williams to produce the final score.[10] Traditional Christmas songs, such as \"O Holy Night\" and \"Carol of the Bells\", are featured prominently in the film, as well as the film's theme song \"Somewhere in My Memory\". The soundtrack was released by Sony Classical Records on cassette on December 4, 1990,[37] and on CD on May 27, 2015.[38] Home Alone had a sneak preview screening for about 1,000 theaters on November 10, 1990. The advanced screening proved successful, with 5% of the preview audience returning for its official release the following week. Originally scheduled to be released on Thanksgiving weekend, it's opening date was brought forward to avoid direct competition with Three Men and a Little Lady.[39] It was given a wide release on November 16, 1990.[40] Home Alone was first released by Fox Video on VHS and LaserDisc in the United States on August 22, 1991,[41] their first video to go direct to sell-through rather than to the video rental market first.[42] It sold 11 million copies, generating Fox revenue of $150 million[43] making it, along with E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, the highest-selling video of all time at that point.[42] Due to the sales, the film did not perform as well in the rental market.[42] It was later released on DVD on October 5, 1999, as a basic package.[44] The film was released on Blu-ray on December 2, 2008, titled Family Fun Edition,[45] and was released alongside Home Alone 2: Lost in New York in a collection pack on October 5, 2010.[46] The film was reissued again on DVD and Blu-ray on October 6, 2015, alongside all four of its sequels in a box set titled Home Alone: 25th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Christmas Edition.[47] On September 15, 2020, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment and 20th Century Studios Home Entertainment released Home Alone on Ultra HD Blu-ray in time for its 30th anniversary in the United States.[48] Home Alone grossed $285.8 million in the United States and Canada and $190.9 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $476.7 million, against a production budget of $18 million.[3] In its opening weekend, Home Alone grossed $17 million from 1,202 theaters, averaging $14,211 per site and just 6% of the final total and added screens over the next six weeks, with a peak screen count of 2,174 during its eighth weekend at the start of January 1991.[49] Home Alone was the number-one film at the box office for 12 consecutive weeks, from its release weekend of November 16–18, 1990, through the weekend of February 1–3, 1991.[50][49] It was removed from the top spot when Sleeping with the Enemy opened with $13 million.[49] It remained in the top ten until the weekend of April 26, well past Easter weekend. It made two more appearances in the top ten (the weekend of May 31 – June 2 and the weekend of June 14–16) before finally falling out of the top ten.[51] After over nine months into its run, the film had earned 16x its debut weekend and ended up making a final gross of $285,761,243, the top-grossing film of its year in North America.[52] The film is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-grossing live-action comedy ever[53] and held the record until it was overtaken by The Hangover Part II in 2011.[54] By the time the film had run its course in theaters, Home Alone was the third-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide, as well as in the United States and Canada, behind only Star Wars ($322 million at the time) and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ($399 million at the time), according to the home video box. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 67.7 million tickets in the United States.[3] It was also the highest-grossing Christmas film until it was surpassed by Dr. Seuss' The Grinch in 2018.[55][56] The film made Culkin a child star.[57] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Home Alone holds an approval rating of 66% based on 116 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Home Alone's uneven but frequently funny premise stretched unreasonably thin is buoyed by Macaulay Culkin's cute performance and strong supporting stars.\"[58] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on nine critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[59] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[60] Variety magazine praised the film for its cast.[61] Jeanne Cooper of The Washington Post praised the film for its comedic approach.[62] Hal Hinson, also of The Washington Post, praised Columbus's direction and Culkin's performance.[63] Although Caryn James of The New York Times complained that the film's first half is \"flat and unsurprising as its cute little premise suggests\", she praised the second half for its slapstick humor. She also praised the dialogue between Kevin and Marley, as well as the film's final scenes.[64] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a 2+1⁄2 out of a 4-star rating. He compared the elaborate booby-traps in the film to Rube Goldberg machines, writing \"they're the kinds of traps that any 8-year-old could devise, if he had a budget of tens of thousands of dollars and the assistance of a crew of movie special effects people\" and criticized the plot as \"so implausible that it makes it hard for [him] to really care about the plight of the kid [Kevin]\". However, he praised Culkin's performance.[65] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly magazine gave the film a \"D\" grade, criticizing the film for its \"sadistic festival of adult-bashing\". Gleiberman said that John Hughes \"is pulling our strings as though he'd never learn to do anything else\".[66] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film three out of five and praised Culkin's \"vivid screen presence, almost incandescent with confidence\". However, he criticized his acting, calling it \"a bit broad and mannered\".[57] Ali Barclay of the BBC wrote, \"Culkin walks a fine line between annoyance and endearment throughout the film.\" He also called Home Alone \"a film which manages to capture some of the best qualities of Christmas\".[67] Naomi Barnwell of Roobla said that \"Home Alone has all the ingredients that make for a great kids' film\".[68] Adrian Turner of Radio Times called the movie \"a celebration of enterprise that captured the heart and wickedness of every child on the planet.\"[69] According to TV Guide, \"[Home Alone]'s slapstick falls flat and only the pain remains.\"[70] Marielle Sabbag of Vocal wrote \"Everything about [Home Alone] is beautiful and has a realistic quality.\"[71] Peter Rainer of the Los Angeles Times criticized the gags, writing they leave \"a source aftertaste\". He added \"this film plays better as a trailer than as a full-length film\" when a trailer lets viewers appreciate those \"without having to fight off a lot of unsettling associations\".[72] Home Alone gradually became a Christmas classic.[73][74][75][76] It was praised for its quotable phrases,[77] traps,[78] and main character.[79] Hannah-Rose Yee of Stylist called the ending \"very sweet\" and praised the score from John Williams, calling it \"fantastic\".[80] Christopher Hooton of The Independent also praised the film, calling the film-within-a-film Angels with Filthy Souls \"a fond footnote in cinema history\".[81] Matt Talbot from Simcoe.com said that the Wet Bandits were \"fantastic\" and \"never [got] old\" on \"repeat viewings\".[82] Michael Walsh of Nerdist noted the church scene as \"One of the best, most touching scenes [in the film]\".[83] Home Alone remains a highly popular Christmas movie in Poland, when it is played on Polsat every Christmas Eve. In 2010, Polsat did not play Home Alone, which caused over 90,000 people to protest on Facebook.[84] In 2016, over 4.44 million Poles tuned in to Polsat to watch Home Alone. Since the 2010s, its TV trailers even include a tagline that acknowledges this popularity: \"Christmas without him? It's absolutely impossible!\".[85] The movie is also highly popular in Romania, being played by Pro TV since 1995, except 2021 when the movie was played by Antena 1. In 2014, over 2.7 million Romanians watched the movie on Pro TV.[citation needed] Julio Macat, the film's cinematographer, considers Home Alone his favorite film out of all the projects he has shot. It was the favorite film of former U.S. President Gerald Ford.[86] At the 12th Youth in Film Awards, Macaulay Culkin won Best Young Actor Starring in a Motion Picture.[87] The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, one for Best Original Score, which was written by John Williams, and the other for Best Original Song for \"Somewhere in My Memory\", music by Williams and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse, but lost to Dances with Wolves and Dick Tracy respectively.[88][89] The 1989 French horror thriller film 3615 code Père Noël, which is about a young boy who is home alone with his elderly grandfather and has to fend off a home invader dressed up as Santa Claus, has been noted for its plot similarities to Home Alone.[99] 3615 code Père Noël director René Manzor threatened the producers of Home Alone with legal action on the grounds of plagiarism, alleging that Home Alone was a remake of his film.[100][101] 3615 code Père Noël was not released in the United States during its original theatrical run in January 1990 and did not become widely available there until 2018.[102][103] The music video for Snoop Dogg's 1994 song \"Gin and Juice\" opens with a gag where, after a teenaged Snoop's parents have left him to watch the house in their absence, he places his hands to his face and yells in the manner of Kevin McCallister in the first film, while a title comes on screen reading \"Home Boy Alone\".[104] In December 2015, Culkin reprised his role as an adult Kevin McCallister in the inaugural episode of the Jack Dishel web series DRYVRS in which a visibly disturbed McCallister recounts his experiences from the events of the first film and subsequently uses his signature tactics against a gunman.[105] In response, Daniel Stern posted a short video reprising his role as Marv, released in conjunction with Stern's Reddit AMA, pleading for support from Harry against McCallister's traps.[106] The 2016 Christmas-set horror film Better Watch Out includes a scene where a character who is obsessed with the Home Alone films demonstrates how, in real life, it would be deadly for someone to be hit in the face with a paint can swung from a distance.[107] The season 13 episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia \"Charlie's Home Alone\" is intended to be a direct parody of the first Home Alone film. In the episode, Charlie Kelly is accidentally forgotten while the rest of \"the gang\" attend Super Bowl LII. Charlie mistakenly believes he must protect the bar by setting up traps, only for himself to accidentally activate said traps, nearly preventing from performing his Super Bowl \"rituals\".[108] On December 15, 2018, Culkin made a guest appearance as himself in an episode of Angry Video Game Nerd to review multiple video game adaptations of the first two Home Alone films, as well as a gameplay session of The Pagemaster with James Rolfe and Mike Matei in the days following that episode's release.[109] On December 19, 2018, Culkin again reprised his role as McCallister in a 60-second advertisement for Google Assistant titled Home Alone Again, which parodies the original film. The commercial contains shot-for-shot remakes of several scenes from the film in which McCallister uses several of the product's functions. The concluding scene involves a command sequence intended to make the house look active, parodying the original \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" scene.[110] The 2022 action comedy film Violent Night references Home Alone several times, with character Trudy Lightston, a fan of the film, emulating Kevin McCallister's fighting tactics against the burglars who take her family hostage.[111] Films such as Home Alone and Die Hard (1988) are very popular at Christmas time in Poland, because they were some of the first Western movies to be released in Poland since the end of communist rule.[112][113][114] However, the Polish premiere of Home Alone took place not during the Christmas season but on May 22, 1992.[115] Three years later, on Christmas Day 1995, at 20:10 CET on TVP1, the Polish television premiere of the film took place. Then three times on December 26, 1997, and December 24 and 25, 1999, the film was broadcast on television TVN.[116] In December 2000, 8.9 million Poles were watching Home Alone on Christmas Eve;[117] by 2017, about four million people (11.6% of Poland's population) were watching it on Christmas Eve and in 2018 again on the same day the film recorded the highest viewership, with 4.51 million viewers.[118] Home Alone (ISBN 0-590-55066-7) was novelized by Todd Strasser and published by Scholastic in 1990 to coincide with the film.[119] On October 6, 2015, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the movie, an illustrated book (ISBN 1-594-74858-6) by Kim Smith and Quirk Books was released.[120][121] The film was followed by a commercially successful sequel in 1992, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, which brought back most of the first film's cast. Culkin was paid $4.5 million to appear in the sequel, compared to $110,000 for the original.[122] The film within a film, Angels with Filthy Souls, had a sequel in Home Alone 2, Angels with Even Filthier Souls. Both Angels meta-films featured character actor Ralph Foody as stereotypical 1930s mobster Johnny.[123] A third film, Home Alone 3, was released in 1997; it has entirely different actors and characters as well as a different storyline, with Hughes writing the screenplay.[124] A television film followed in 2002: Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House. The movie features some of the same characters who were in the first two films, but with a new cast and a storyline.[125] The fifth film, The Holiday Heist, premiered during ABC Family's Countdown to 25 Days of Christmas programming event on November 25, 2012.[126] Similarly to the third film, it does not focus on the McCallister family.[127] Chris Columbus later revealed that there had been discussions on a sequel starring Kevin's son: \"This was talked about maybe 10 years ago – I don't know, we were just having fun with it – and we said, 'What if Kevin is an adult and he has a kid?' But it was still Pesci and Stern – Pesci and Stern are still obsessed with this kid. They're going to get this kid.\"[128] Another idea that was once discussed involved an adult Kevin attempting revenge on Harry and Marv, who have reformed in the years since they last met. The studio declined to make the film despite Columbus & Culkin's interest in the idea.[129] A sixth film was released digitally on Disney+ on November 12, 2021, titled Home Sweet Home Alone.[130] Devin Ratray, who played Buzz McCallister in the first two films, reprised his role in the film.[130]",

It commemorates the victory of the Maccabees over the Syrian Greek army, and the subsequent miracle of rededicating the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and restoring its menorah, or lamp. Help us keep Jewish knowledge accessible to millions of people around the world. Your donation to My Jewish Learning fuels endless journeys of Jewish discovery. With your help, My Jewish Learning can continue to provide nonstop opportunities for learning, connection and growth. The miracle of Hanukkah is that only one vial of oil was found with just enough oil to illuminate the Temple lamp for one day, and yet it lasted for eight full days. We celebrate Hanukkah at home by lighting the menorah (each night we light one additional candle to the number from the previous night), playing dreidel, and eating special foods unique to Hanukkah. Some people also sing Hanukkah songs or exchange gifts after lighting the menorah, which is also called a hanukkiah. Many people host and attend Hanukkah parties. Download a printable PDF of the Hanukkah candle blessings here. Many Hanukkah foods are deep-fried in oil, symbolizing the oil from the menorah used in the Temple. These include latkes, or potato pancakes, and jelly doughnuts. Other favorites include the Sephardic delicacy bimuelos and use, of course, applesauce as a latke topping.

Home » Holidays & Events » Jewish Holidays Hanukkah 2024 begins at sundown on Wednesday, December 25 and ends the evening of Thursday, January 2, 2025 (8 nights). Hanukkah means “dedication” and is a holiday that honors and celebrates one of the first recorded fights for religious freedom and the success of this fight. It commemorates the re-dedication of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem following the Jewish victory over the Syrian-Greeks in 165 BCE. Once the Jewish people regained their temple, they wanted to purify it by burning ritual oil for 8 days, but they only had enough oil for one night. The miracle of this holiday was that the oil lasted for the full 8 days, thus burning candles and celebrating for 8 days is part of this holiday. Hanukkah’s dates vary because it is always on the 25th day of the month of Kislev in the Hebrew calendar, a lunar calendar. These dates don’t always line up with our Gregorian calendar, but usually occur anywhere from late November to late December. Fun fact: The last time Christmas and the first day of Hanukkah aligned on December 25 was in 2005. Before that, according to our friends at NorthJersey.com, “the overlap occurred in 1959 and 1921. It will happen next in 2035.” The Hebrew calendar is largely used to determine the dates of Jewish holidays and which sections of the Torah should be read. For many, the holiday season is all about family and food. If you celebrate Hanukkah, these are the traditional recipes served. It seems potato latkes, or pancakes, have become tastefully ubiquitous! And though found in savory and even sweet variations throughout the world in such places as Austria, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Russia, Sweden, and Germany (topped with blueberries, sugar and cinnamon), the latke tradition has long been associated with the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. The Jewish holiday commemorates a military victory over the Greeks, celebrating their right to practice Judaism. When the Jews entered their desecrated temple in order to rededicate it, they found they only had enough oil to keep the Eternal Light lit for one day. The story goes that the oil miraculously lasted 8 days until they were able to press more oil. Therefore, the holiday is 8 days long and we eat foods that are fried in oil, like latkes and doughnuts. While there is still debate everywhere, over which they should be served with, applesauce vs. sour cream, there is no denying that latkes are an essential part of a Hanukkah tradition. Ingredients: 3 medium Russet potatoes (1 lb.)—the best choice of potato for latkes!3 beaten eggs1/4 cup matzo meal1/4 shredded onion1/4 cup vegetable oilApplesauce and/or sour cream as garnish Directions: Peel and coarsely shred potatoes (should have 3 cups). As you work, put shredded potatoes in a bowl of cold water to prevent darkening and to ensure a crispy latke. Drain. Rinse and drain again thoroughly. Make sure the shredded potatoes and onions are very dry before mixing. In a mixing bowl, stir together eggs, potatoes, matzo meal, onion, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. In a 12″ skillet heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat. Work in batches: For each latke, drop 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture into the hot oil. Press to flatten slightly. Fry 2 – 3 minutes or till edges are crisp; turn. Fry 2 – 3 minutes more (or longer depending on your desired doneness). Drain on paper towels. Cover; keep warm. Repeat with remaining mixture, adding oil to skillet as needed. Serve warm with applesauce and/or sour cream. Makes 24 latkes. Ingredients: 1 ½ lbs. sweet potatoes (orange flesh variety) 1 medium onion 2 large eggs 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper 5 tablespoons flour 1/2 cup vegetable oil (approximately) Directions: Peel sweet potatoes and grate using grating disc of food processor or large holes of hand grater. As in the recipe above for basic potato latkes, squeeze out all possible liquid in towel. Grate onion and add to sweet potatoes. Transfer to large bowl. Beat eggs with salt and pepper and add to potato mixture. Add flour and mix well. Heat 1/4 cup oil in a heavy 10- to 12-inch skillet, preferably non-stick. Fill 1/4-cup measure with sweet potato mixture, pressing to compact. Turn out in mound into skillet. Quickly form 3 more mounds. Flatten each with back of spoon so each cake is about 2 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter, pressing to compact. Fry over medium heat for 3 minutes. Turn carefully with 2 slotted spatulas and fry the second side for about 2 and 1/2 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels. Stir the potato mixture before frying each new batch and add a little more oil to the pan. Serve hot. Makes 4 servings. In Israel, sufganiyot—or little donuts—are said to have become even more popular than traditional latkes, sold street side and made or served with jelly, chocolate sauce, or honey to sweeten the holiday even more. Ingredients: 1 package dry yeast 4 tablespoons sugar 3/4 cup lukewarm milk 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour pinch of salt 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 eggs, separated 2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened apricot or strawberry preserves vegetable oil sugar for coating Directions: Mix together yeast, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, and the milk. Let sit to make sure it bubbles. Sift the flour and mix it with the remaining sugar, salt, cinnamon, egg yolks, and the yeast mixture. Knead the dough until it forms a ball. Add butter or margarine. Knead some more until the butter is well absorbed. Cover with a towel and let rise overnight in the refrigerator. The next day, roll out dough to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Cut dough into 24 rounds with a juice glass, or any object about 2 inches in diameter. Take 1/2 teaspoon of preserves and place in center of 12 rounds. Top with the other 12. Press down at edges, sealing with egg whites. Crimping with the thumb and second finger is best. Let rise for about 30 minutes. Heat 2 inches of oil to about 375 degrees F. Drop the doughnuts into the hot oil, about 5 at a time. Turn to brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels. Roll in sugar. Known as mohn kichlach (or kichelach, which means “cookies” in Yiddish), they date back to 16th century Eastern Europe where they were a staple in Jewish homes. Traditionally, poppy seed cookies are served any time of year, but most make them for Hanukka celebrations. They’re perfect with coffee, tea, or a tall glass of cold milk. Enjoy! Ingredients: 1 cup melted butter or margarine, cooled slightly 1 cup sugar 2 eggs 3 cups flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon vanilla 1/2 cup poppy seeds 1 teaspoon almond extract Directions:Preheat oven to 350ºF. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat melted butter or margarine and sugar together in a large mixing bowl. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each one. Add baking powder and 1 cup of the flour, beating until smooth. Then, using a wooden spoon, stir in 1 cup flour and vanilla, and mix well. Then add the remaining cup of flour and rest of ingredients, mixing well. Chill dough in the refrigerator in wax paper at least 2 hours. Then divide dough into 4 parts. Roll out each piece of dough one at a time between 2 pieces of wax paper, approximately 1/8″ thick. Use cookie cutters to cut out shapes—traditional dreidel, Star of David, or Chanukah-themed cookie shapes make them festive. Gather up scraps of dough and re-cool in the refrigerator, then roll out scraps and continue cutting out cookies until you’ve used up all the dough. Carefully transfer cookies to a greased cookie sheet or one lined with parchment paper, leaving some space in between, and bake for 12-15 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool, slightly, then transfer to a wire rack. The cookies will harden as they cool. Cookies may be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for the 8 days of Chanukah, if they last that long! Or freeze them, well wrapped, for up to 2 months.

                "content": "The holidays are extra special this year. Not only is Dec. 25 Christmas, but it marks the beginning of Hanukkah. This particular alignment of the holidays is rare. In fact, it has only occurred four other times since 1900, according to USA Today. Here's what to know: Beginning at sundown on Wednesday, Dec. 25, Hanukkah will be celebrated until Thursday, Jan. 2, 2025, according to Chabad.org. Occurring in the wintertime, Hanukkah is an eight-day festival of lights, which is celebrated with nightly menorah lightings, special prayers and fried foods, according to Chabad.org. One candle is lit each night on the menorah, which is placed in a doorway or window, each night, until all candles are lit on the eighth night. Special blessings are recited before the lighting and traditional songs are sung afterwards. The ninth flame on the menorah is called the shamash, which is often positioned higher or lower and used to light the other lights. The word is pronounced kha-nu-kah, according to Chabad-Lubavitch of Wisconsin. In 2025, Hanukkah begins on Sunday, Dec. 14 and goes until Monday, Dec. 22, according to Chabad.org. According to Reader's Digest, Hanukkah can begin as early as Nov. 28 or as late as Dec. 27 depending on the year. The holiday seems to change dates annually since it's based on the Hebrew calendar, which is a lunisolar calendar. Hanukkah falling on Christmas — sometimes dubbed \"Christmukkah\" — occurs rarely. Christmas and the first day of Hanukkah have occurred simultaneously four times since 1900, according to Hebcal, a Hebrew calendar tracking website. The next time it will happen is in 2035.

It commemorates the victory of the Maccabees over the Syrian Greek army, and the subsequent miracle of rededicating the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and restoring its menorah, or lamp. The miracle of Hanukkah is that only one vial of oil was found with just enough oil to illuminate the Temple lamp for one day, and yet it lasted for eight full days. When is Hanukkah 2024?

Hanukkah, or the Festival of Rededication, celebrates the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem after its defilement by the Syrian Greeks in 164 BCE. Although it is a late addition to the Jewish liturgical calendar, the eight-day festival of Hanukkah has become a beloved and joyous holiday. It is also known as the Festival of Lights and usually takes place in December, at the time of year when the days are shortest in the northern hemisphere. We celebrate Hanukkah at home by lighting the menorah (each night we light one additional candle to the number from the previous night), playing dreidel, and eating special foods unique to Hanukkah. Some people also sing Hanukkah songs or exchange gifts after lighting the menorah, which is also called a hanukkiah. Many people host and attend Hanukkah parties. Download a printable PDF of the Hanukkah candle blessings here. Many Hanukkah foods are deep-fried in oil, symbolizing the oil from the menorah used in the Temple. These include latkes, or potato pancakes, and jelly doughnuts. Other favorites include the Sephardic delicacy bimuelos and use, of course, applesauce as a latke topping. Chocolate gelt, a candy that gets its name from the Yiddish word for money, is another popular Hanukkah treat.

                "content": "A Christmas Story A True Story By Jay Frankston (Summary: A Jewish man, longing for the joy of Christmas he missed in his childhood, becomes Santa for his own children. Eventually, he discovers letters from needy children, delivering toys and hope. Over the years, he spreads happiness, emphasizing the spirit of giving. In his final act as Santa, he brings joy to a little Jewish girl.) There’s nothing so beautiful as a child’s dream of Santa Claus. I know, I often had that dream. But I was Jewish and we didn’t celebrate Christmas. It was everyone else’s holiday and I felt left out, like a big party I wasn’t invited to. It wasn’t the toys I missed, it was Santa Claus and a Christmas tree. So when I got married and had kids I decided to make up for it. I started with a seven-foot tree, all decked out with lights and tinsel, and a Star of David on top to soothe those whose Jewish feelings were frayed by the display and, for them, it was a Hanukah bush. And it warmed my heart to see the glitter, because now the party was at my house and everyone was invited. But something was missing, something big and round and jolly, with jingle bells and a ho! ho! ho! So I bought a bolt of bright red cloth and strips of white fur and my wife made me a costume. Inflatable pillows rounded out my skinny frame, but no amount of makeup could turn my face into merry old Santa. I went around looking at department store impersonations sitting on their thrones with children on their laps and flash-bulbs going off, and I wasn’t satisfied with the way they looked either. After much effort I located a mask maker and he had just the thing for me, a rubberized Santa mask, complete with whiskers and flowing white hair. It was not the real thing but it looked genuine enough to live up to a child’s dream of St. Nick. When I tried it on something happened. I looked in the mirror and there he was, big as life, the Santa of my childhood. There he was . . . and it was me. I felt like Santa, like I became Santa. My posture changed. I leaned back and pushed out my false stomach. My head tilted to the side and my voice got deeper and richer and a “MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE.” For two years I played Santa for my children to their mixed feelings of fright and delight and to my total enjoyment. And when the third year rolled around, the Santa in me had grown into a personality of his own and he needed more room than I had given him. So I sought to accommodate him by letting him do his thing for other children. I called up orphanages and children’s hospitals and offered his services free. But, “We don’t need Santa, we have all sorts of donations from foundations and . . . thank you for calling.” And the Santa in me felt lonely and useless. Then, one late November afternoon, I went to the mailbox on the corner of the street to mail a letter and saw this pretty little girl trying to reach for the slot. She was maybe six years old. “Mommy, are you sure Santa will get my letter?” she asked. “Well, you addressed it to Santa Claus, North Pole, so he should get it,” the mother said and lifted her little girl so she could stuff the letter into the box. My mind began to whirl. All those thousands of children who wrote to Santa Claus at Christmas time, whatever became of their letters? One phone call to the main post office answered my question. They told me that, as of the last week of November, an entire floor of the post office was needed to store those letters in huge sacks that came from different sections of the city. The Santa in me went ho! ho! ho! and we headed down to the post office. And there they were, thousands upon thousands of letters, with or without stamps, addressed to Santi Claus, or St. Nick, or Kris Kringle, scribbled on wrapping paper or neatly written on pretty stationary. And I rummaged through them and laughed. Most of them were gimme, gimme, gimme letters, like “I want a pair of roller skates, and a Nintendo, and a GI Joe, and a personal computer, and a small portable TV, and whatever else you can think of.” Many of them had the price alongside each item . . . with or without sales tax. Then there were the funny ones like: “Dear Santa, I’ve been a good boy all of last year, but if I don’t get what I want, I’ll be a bad boy all of next.” And I became a little flustered at the demands and the greed of so many spoiled children. But the Santa in me heard a voice from inside the mail sack and I continued going through the letters, one after the other, until I came upon one which jarred and unsettled me. It was neatly written on plain white paper and it said: “Dear Santa, I hope you get my letter. I am eleven years old and I have two little brothers and a baby sister. My father died last year and my mother is sick. I know there are many who are poorer than we are and I want nothing for myself, but could you send us a blanket, cause mommy’s cold at night.“ It was signed Suzy. And a chill went up my spine and the Santa in me cried, “I hear you Suzy, I hear you.” And I dug deeper into those sacks and came up with another eight such letters, all of them calling out from the depth of poverty. I took them with me and went straight to the nearest Western Union office and sent each child a telegram: “GOT YOUR LETTER. WILL BE AT YOUR HOUSE ON CHRISTMAS DAY. WAIT FOR ME. SANTA.” I knew I could not possibly fill the need of all those children and it wasn’t my purpose to do so. But if I could bring them hope. If I could make them feel that their cries did not go unheard and that someone out there was listening . . . So I budgeted a sum of money and went out and bought toys. I wasn’t content with the five-and-ten cent variety. I wanted something substantial, something these children could only dream of, like an electric train, or a microscope, or a huge doll of the kind they saw advertised on TV. And on Christmas Day I took out my sleigh and let Santa do his thing. Well, it wasn’t exactly a sleigh, it was a car and my wife drove me around because with all those pillows and toys I barely managed to get in the back seat. It had graciously snowed the night before and the streets were thick with fresh powder. My first call took me to the outskirts of the city. The letter had been from a Peter Barsky and all it said was: “Dear Santa, I am ten years old and I am an only child. We’ve just moved to this house a few months ago and I have no friends yet. I’m not sad because I’m poor but because I’m lonely. I know you have many things to do and people to see and you probably have no time for me. So I don’t ask you to come to my house or bring anything. But could you send me a letter so I know you exist.” My telegram read: “DEAR PETER, NOT ONLY DO I EXIST BUT I’LL BE THERE ON CHRISTMAS DAY. WAIT FOR ME. SANTA.” We spotted the house and drove past it and parked around the corner. Then Santa got out with his big bag of toys slung over his shoulder and tramped through the snow. The house was wedged in between two tall buildings. The roof was of corrugated metal and it was more of a shack than a house. I walked through the gate, up the front steps and rang the bell. A man opened the door. He was in his undershirt and his stomach bulged out of his pants. “Boje moy ” he exclaimed in astonishment. That’s Polish, by the way, and his hand went to his face. “P-p-please . . .” he stuttered, “p-please . . .de boy . . . de boy . . . at mass . . . church. I go get him. Please, please wait.” And he threw a coat over his bare shoulders and, assured that I would wait, he ran down the street in the snow. So I stood in front of the house feeling good, and on the opposite side of the street was this other shack, and through the window I could see these shiny little black faces peering at me and waving. Then the door opened shyly and some voices called out to me “Hya Santa” . . . “Hya Santa”. And I ho! ho! hoed my way over there and this woman asked if I would come in and I did. And there were these five young kids from one to seven years old. And I sat and spoke to them of Santa and the spirit of love which is the spirit of Christmas. Then, since they were not on my list, but assuming from the torn Christmas wrappings that they had gotten their presents, I asked if they liked what Santa had brought them during the night. And each in turn thanked me for . . . the woolen socks, and the sweater, and the warm new underwear. And I looked at them and asked: “Didn’t I bring you kids any toys?” And they shook their heads sadly. “Ho! ho! ho! I slipped up,” I said “We’ll have to fix that.” I told them to wait, I’d be back in a few minutes, then trudged heavily through the snow to the corner. And when I was out of their sight, I ran as fast as I could to the car. We had extra toys in the trunk and my wife quickly filled up the bag, and I trotted back to the house and gave each child a brand new toy. There was joy and laughter and the woman asked if she could take a picture of Santa with the kids and I said, sure, why not? And when Santa got ready to leave, I noticed that this five-year-old little girl was crying. She was as cute as a button. I bent down and asked her “What’s the matter, child?” And she sobbed, “Oh! Santa, I’m so happy.” And the tears rolled from my eyes under the rubber mask. As I stepped out on the street, “Pan, pan, proche . . .please come . . . come,” I heard this man Barsky across the way. And Santa crossed and walked into the house. The boy Peter just stood there and looked at me. “You came,” he said. “I wrote and . . . you came”. He turned to his parents. “I wrote . . . and he came.” And he repeated it over and over again. “I wrote . . . and he came.” And when he recovered, I spoke with him about loneliness and friendship, and gave him a chemistry set, which seemed to be what he would go for, and a basketball. And he thanked me profusely. And his mother, a heavy-set Slavic-looking woman, asked something of her husband in Polish. My parents were Polish so I speak a little and understand a lot. “From the North Pole,” I said in Polish. She looked at me in astonishment. “You speak Polish?” she asked. “Of course,” I said. “Santa speaks all languages.” And I left them in joy and wonder. And I did this for twelve years, going through the letters to Santa at the post office, listening for the cries of children muffled in unopened envelopes. In time I learned all that Santa has to know to handle any situation. Like the big kid who would stop Santa on the street and ask: “Hey, Santa, where’s your sleigh?” And I’d say, “How old are you son?” And he’d say, “Thirteen.” And I’d say, “Well, you’re a big fellow and you ought to know better. Santa used to come in a sleigh many years ago, but these are modern times. I come in a car now.” And I’d hop in the back seat and my wife would drive off. Or the kid who would look at me closely and come out with, “That’s a mask,” pointing a finger. And you never lie to children so I’d say, “Sure, son, of course. If everybody knew what Santa really looks like they’d bother me all year long and I couldn’t get my things ready for Christmas.” Or the mother who would whisper so her young son couldn’t hear, “Where do you come from?” I’d turn to the child and say, “Your mom wants to know where I come from Willy.” And he’d say, “From the North Pole, Mommy,” with absolute certainty. And she’d nudge me and whisper, “You don’t understand. Who sent you? I mean, how do you come to this house?” I’d turn to the boy and say, “Hey, Willy, your mom wants to know why I came to see you.” And he’d say, “Cause I wrote him a letter, Mommy.” And I’d pull out the letter and she knows she mailed it, and she’s confused and bewildered and I’d leave her like that. As time went on, the word got out about Santa Claus and me, and I insisted on anonymity, but toy manufacturers would send me huge cartons of toys as a contribution to the Christmas spirit. So I started with 18 or 20 children and wound up with 120, door to door, from one end of the city to the other, from Christmas Eve through Christmas Day. And on my last call, a number of years ago, I knew there were four children in the family and I came prepared. The house was small and sparsely furnished. The kids had been waiting all day, staring at the telegram and repeating to their skeptical mother, “He’ll come, Mommy, he’ll come.” And as I rang the door bell the house lit up with joy and laughter and “He’s here . . . he’s here!” And the door swings open and they all reach for my hands and hold on. “Hya, Santa . . . Hya, Santa. We just knew you’d come.” And these poor kids are all beaming with happiness. And I take each one of them on my lap and speak to them of rainbows and snowflakes, and tell them stories of hope and waiting, and give them each a toy. And all the while there’s this fifth child standing in the corner, a cute little girl with blond hair and blue eyes. And when I’m through with the others, I turn to her and say: “You’re not part of this family, are you?” And she shakes her head sadly and whispers, “No.” “Come closer, child,” I say, and she comes a little closer. “What’s your name?” I ask. “Lisa.” “How old are you?” “Seven.” “Come, sit on my lap,” and she hesitates but she comes over and I lift her up and sit her on my lap. “Did you get any toys for Christmas?” I ask.. “No,” she says with puckered lips. So I take out this big beautiful doll and, “Here, do you want this doll?” “No,” she says. And she leans over to me and whispers in my ear, “I’m Jewish.” And I nudge her and whisper in her ear, “I’m Jewish too. Do you want this doll?” And she’s grinning from ear to ear and nods with wanting and desire, and takes the doll and hugs it and runs out. It’s been a long time since I last put on my Santa suit. But I feel that Santa has lived with me and given me a great deal of happiness all those years. And now, when Christmas rolls around, he comes out of hiding long enough to say, “Ho! ho! ho! A Merry Christmas to you, my friend.” And I say to you now, MERRY CHRISTMAS MY FRIENDS.” Δ © 2024 Christmas Stories Blog at WordPress.com.",

                "content": "Long ago, about 2000 years, when King Herod ruled Judea (now part of Israel), God sent the angel Gabriel to a young woman who lived in the northern town of Nazareth. The girl's name was Mary and she was engaged to marry Joseph. The angel Gabriel said to Mary: 'Peace be with you! God has blessed you and is pleased with you.' Mary was very surprised by this and wondered what the angel meant. The angel said to her 'Don't be afraid, God has been very kind to you. You will become pregnant by the Holy Spirit and give birth to a baby boy and you will call him Jesus. He will be God's own Son and his kingdom will never end.' Mary was very afraid but she trusted God. 'Let it happen as God chooses.' she replied to the angel. Gabriel also told Mary that her cousin Elizabeth, who everyone thought was too old to have children, would have a baby boy whom God had chosen to prepare the way for Jesus. Mary said goodbye to her family and friends and went to visit her cousin Elizabeth and her husband Zechariah. Elizabeth was very happy to see Mary. She knew that Mary had been chosen by God to be the mother of his Son. An angel had already told Zechariah that Elizabeth's baby would prepare people to welcome Jesus. He was to be called John. Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then returned home to Nazareth. Joseph was worried when he found out that Mary was expecting a baby before their marriage had taken place. He wondered if he should put off the wedding altogether. Then an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream and said: 'Don't be afraid to have Mary as your wife.' The angel explained that Mary had been chosen by God to be the mother of his Son and told Joseph that the baby would be named Jesus which means 'Saviour' because he would save people. When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel had told him to do and took Mary as his wife. At this time, the land where Mary and Joseph lived was part of the Roman Empire. The Roman Emperor Augustus wanted to have a list of all the people in the empire, to make sure they paid their taxes. He ordered everyone to return to the town where their families originally came from, and enter their names in a register (or census) there. Mary and Joseph traveled a long way (about 70 miles) from Nazareth to Bethlehem, because that is where Joseph's family came from. Most people walked but some lucky people had a donkey to help carry the goods needed for the journey. Joseph and Mary traveled very slowly because Mary's baby was due to be born soon. When they reached Bethlehem they had problems finding somewhere to stay. So many people had come to register their names in the census, that every house was full and every bed was taken in all of the guest rooms. The only place to stay that they could find was with the animals. People often kept animals in the house, especially at night, and used them like 'central heating'! People normally slept on a raised/upper level with the animals below to give them extra warmth. So in the place where the animals slept, Mary gave birth to Jesus, the Son of God. In those days it was the custom to wrap newborn babies tightly in a long cloth called 'swaddling clothes'. Jesus' bed was the manger that the animals ate their hay from. In the hills and fields outside Bethlehem, shepherds looked after their sheep through the long night. As the new day began, suddenly an angel appeared before them and the glory of God shone around them. The shepherds were very, very scared, but the angel said, 'Don't be afraid. I have good news for you and everyone. Today in Bethlehem a Saviour has been born for you. You will find the baby lying in a manger.'. Then many more angels appeared, lighting up the sky. The shepherds heard them praising God singing: 'Glory to God in highest, and peace to everyone on earth.' When the angels had gone the shepherds said to one another, 'Let's go to Bethlehem to see what has happened.' So the shepherds went to Bethlehem and found Mary and Joseph. The baby Jesus was lying in a manger as they had been told. When they saw him, they told everyone what the angel had said and everyone who heard the story were astonished. Then the shepherds returned to their sheep, praising God for sending his Son to be their Saviour. When Jesus was born, a brand new bright star appeared in sky. Some Wise Men in faraway countries saw the star and guessed what it meant. They were very clever men that studied the stars and had read in very old writings that a new star would appear when a great king was born. They set out to find the new king and bring him gifts. The Wise Men followed the star towards the country of Judea and when they got to the capital called Jerusalem they began to ask people: 'Where is the child who is born to be king of the Jews?' Herod, the king of Judea, heard this and it made him very angry to think that someone might be going to take his place as king. Herod sent for the Wise Men to come to him. He told them to go on following the star until they had found the baby king. He said: 'When you have found him, let me know where he is, so that I can go and worship him.'. But Herod did not tell them that he really had an evil plan in mind to kill the new king. The Wise Men followed the star towards Bethlehem (where it said that the king would be born in the old writings). It seemed to stop and shine directly down upon the place where Jesus was. The Wise Men entered the house where they now lived and found Jesus with Mary, they bowed down and worshipped him. The Wise Men spread the gifts they had brought before Jesus. The gifts were gold, frankincense and myrrh. The Wise Men were warned in a dream, by God, not to go back to Herod. So they returned home to their countries in the East by a different way. When the Wise Men had gone, an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream. 'Get up,' the angel said, 'take Jesus and Mary and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for Jesus to kill him.' So Joseph got up, took Jesus and Mary, and during the night they left for Egypt, where he stayed until Herod died. When Herod realized that he had been tricked by the Wise Men, he was furious and he gave orders to kill all the boys aged two or younger in Bethlehem and the surrounding area. This was to try and kill the new King, as his plan to find the location of the new king from the Wise Men had failed. After Herod had died, Joseph had another dream in which an angel appeared to him. The angel said, 'Get up, take Jesus and Mary and go back to Israel, for those who were trying kill Jesus are dead.' So Joseph got up, took Jesus and Mary and they went back to Israel. But when he heard that Herod's son was now king of Judea, he was afraid to go there. So instead they went to Galilee, and lived in their old town of Nazareth.

                "content": "A Christmas Story is a 1983 Christmas comedy film directed by Bob Clark and based on the 1966 book In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash by Jean Shepherd, with some elements from his 1971 book Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories and Other Disasters. It stars Melinda Dillon, Darren McGavin, and Peter Billingsley, and follows a young boy and his family's misadventures during Christmas time in December 1939. It is the third installment in the Parker Family Saga. A Christmas Story was released on November 18, 1983, and received positive reviews from critics. Filmed partly in Canada, the film earned two Canadian Genie Awards in 1984. Widely considered a holiday classic in the United States and Canada, it has been shown in a marathon annually on TNT since 1997 and on TBS since 2004 titled \"24 Hours of A Christmas Story\", consisting of 12 consecutive airings of the film from the evening of Christmas Eve to the evening of Christmas Day.[3] In 2012, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[4][5][6] The film spawned three sequels. The first, My Summer Story (originally released as It Runs in the Family), also directed by Clark, was released in 1994. The second, entitled A Christmas Story 2, was released straight to DVD in 2012. A third sequel, entitled A Christmas Story Christmas, was released on HBO Max in 2022 and features most of the original cast returning. The film is presented in a series of vignettes, with narration provided by the adult Ralphie Parker. As a 9-year-old boy in December 1940, all Ralphie wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-shot Range Model air rifle. Ralphie's desire is continuously rejected, first by his mother, who tells him \"You'll shoot your eye out.\" He is later assigned a theme for school about what he wants for Christmas, and he writes about the BB gun, but he gets it back with a poor grade, and the same warning. Finally, on Christmas Eve, Ralphie sees a disgruntled Santa at Higbee's Department Store, and he expresses his desire, only to be hurriedly brushed off with the same warning. On Christmas morning, Ralphie receives some presents that he enjoys but is disappointed not to find the rifle among them. Ralphie's father (\"The Old Man\") directs him to one last box hidden in the corner, which proves to contain the rifle. Ralphie eagerly hurries outside to try it out, but when he shoots at the metal target he has set up, the BB ricochets and knocks off his glasses. Ralphie accidentally steps on and breaks the glasses while trying to find them; he makes up a cover story about an icicle falling from the roof of the garage and hitting his eye, which fools his mom and keeps him from getting in trouble. That night, Ralphie goes to sleep with the gun by his side, as his adult self reflects that it was the best Christmas present he had ever received or would ever receive. Interspersed with the main story are several loosely related vignettes involving the Parkers: The basis of the screenplay is a series of monologues written and performed by Jean Shepherd on the radio. Shepherd wrote the adaptation with Bob Clark and Leigh Brown. Several subplots are incorporated into the body of the film, based on other separate short stories by Shepherd. Shepherd provides the film's narration from the perspective of an adult Ralphie, a narrative style later used in the comedy-drama television series The Wonder Years and the sitcom Young Sheldon. Shepherd, Brown, and Clark have cameo appearances in the film: Shepherd plays the man who directs Ralphie and Randy to the back of the Santa line at the department store; Brown – Shepherd's wife in real life – plays the woman in the Santa line with Shepherd; Clark plays Swede, the neighbor the Old Man talks to outside during the Leg Lamp scene.[14] In the DVD commentary, director Bob Clark mentions that Jack Nicholson was considered for the role of the Old Man; Clark expresses gratitude that he ended up with Darren McGavin instead, who later appeared in several other Clark films.[15] James Broderick, who had portrayed the role in the television films, had died the year prior.[16] He cast Melinda Dillon on the basis of her similar role in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Some 8,000 actors auditioned for the role of Ralphie, among the 8,000 actors were Keith Coogan, Sean Astin and Wil Wheaton;[17][18] \"He walked in, and he had us from the beginning\", Clark later recalled of Peter Billingsley who was already a successful actor in commercials[14] and from co-hosting the TV series Real People. Clark initially wanted him for the role of Ralphie but decided he was \"too obvious\" a choice and auditioned many other young actors before realizing that Billingsley was the right choice after all.[19] Ian Petrella was cast immediately before filming began. Tedde Moore had previously appeared in Clark's film Murder by Decree and was the only onscreen character from A Christmas Story who was played by the same actor in the sequel, My Summer Story. Jeff Gillen was an old friend of Clark's who had been in one of his earliest films.[20] The schoolyard bully, Scut Farkus, was played by Zack Ward, now an actor, writer and director, who had actually been bullied himself while in elementary school. In 2017, he said he was surprised at the impact his role had over the years: \"I saw that I was ranked – as Christmas villains go – higher than the Grinch. That's amazing.\"[21] The screenplay for A Christmas Story is based on material from author Jean Shepherd's collection of short stories, In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash. Three of the semi-autobiographical short stories on which the film is based were originally published in Playboy magazine between 1964 and 1966.[22] Shepherd later read \"Duel in the Snow, or Red Ryder nails the Cleveland Street Kid\" and told the otherwise unpublished story \"Flick's Tongue\" on his WOR Radio talk show, as can be heard in one of the DVD extras.[23] Bob Clark stated on the DVD commentary that he became interested in Shepherd's work when he heard \"Flick's Tongue\" on the radio in 1968. Additional source material for the film, according to Clark, came from unpublished anecdotes that Shepherd told live audiences \"on the college circuit\".[20] While shooting scenes in Cleveland in early 1983, Clark told a reporter that it had taken him a considerable number of years to get the film into production.[24] Shepherd envisioned his stories as \"Dickens's Christmas Carol as retold by Scrooge\", although Clark would soften it for the film; the two did not particularly get along, as Clark did not admire Shepherd's attempts at trying to guide the actors with ideas about how the characters should be played, to the point where he had him barred from the set.[25][26] The film is set in Hohman, Indiana, a fictionalized version of Shepherd's hometown of Hammond, the only Hoosier city to border Chicago. The name is derived from Hohman Avenue, a major street in downtown Hammond.[27] Local references in the film include Warren G. Harding Elementary School and Cleveland Street (where Shepherd spent his childhood). Other local references include mention of a person \"swallowing a yo-yo\" in nearby Griffith,[27] the Old Man being one of the fiercest \"furnace fighters in Northern Indiana\" and that his obscenities were \"hanging in space over Lake Michigan\", a mention of the Indianapolis 500, and the line to Santa Claus \"stretching all the way to Terre Haute\". The Old Man is also revealed to be a fan of the Bears (whom he jokingly calls the \"Chicago Chipmunks\") and White Sox, consistent with living in northwest Indiana. In commemoration of the setting, the City of Hammond holds an annual exhibit regarding the film in November and December, including a statue recreating the scene where Ralphie's friend Flick freezes his tongue to a flagpole.[28] Director Bob Clark reportedly sent scouts to twenty cities before selecting Cleveland for exterior filming. Cleveland was chosen because of Higbee's Department Store in downtown Cleveland. Since Higbee's was exclusive to northeast Ohio,[29] the department store referred to in Shepherd's book and the film is most likely Goldblatt's, located in downtown Hammond (with the Cam-Lan Chinese Restaurant three doors down on Sibley Avenue). Until they connected with Higbee's, location scouts had been unsuccessful in finding a department store that was willing to be part of the film. Higbee's vice president Bruce Campbell agreed to take part in the project on the condition he be allowed to edit the script for cursing. Ultimately, Higbee's was the stage for three scenes in the film: In addition to the scenes involving Higbee's, the exterior shots (and select interior shots where Ralphie lived, including the opening of the leg lamp) of the house and neighborhood, were filmed in the Tremont section of Cleveland's West Side. The house used as the Parker home in these scenes has been restored, reconfigured inside to match the soundstage interiors, and opened to the public as \"A Christmas Story House\". Appropriately, the fictional boyhood home of Ralphie Parker is on Cleveland Street, the name of the actual street where Shepherd grew up. Several other locations were used. The school scenes were shot at the Victoria School in St. Catharines, Ontario.[30] The Christmas tree-purchasing scene was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, as was the sound stage filming of interior shots of the Parker home.[31][32] The \"...only I didn't say fudge\" scene was filmed at the foot of Cherry Street in Toronto; several lake freighters are visible in the background spending the winter at Toronto's port, which lends authenticity to the time of year when the film was produced. In 2008, two Canadian fans released a documentary that visits every location. Their film, Road Trip for Ralphie, was shot over two years and includes footage of the filmmakers saving Miss Shields' blackboard from the garbage bin on the day the old Victoria School was gutted for renovation, discovering the antique fire truck that saved Flick, locating original costumes from the film, and tracking down the location of the film's Chop Suey Palace in Toronto.[33] The \"Red Ryder\" model BB Gun was manufactured in Plymouth, Michigan, by Daisy, beginning in 1938; it was never manufactured in the exact configuration mentioned in the film. The Daisy \"Buck Jones\" model did have a compass and a sundial in the stock, but these features were not included in the Red Ryder model.[34] The compass and sundial were placed on Ralphie's BB gun, but on the opposite side of the stock due to Peter Billingsley being left-handed.[35] Director Bob Clark stated in the film's DVD commentary that both he and author Shepherd wished for the film to be seen as \"amorphously late-'30s, early-'40s\".[36] A specific year is never explicitly mentioned in the film. While the Lionel streamline model passenger train in Higbee's window is a prewar item, the freight train in the same window is of postwar manufacture. The two songs by Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters used in the film, \"Jingle Bells\" and \"Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town\" were recorded in 1943, and the Crosby version of \"It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas\" also heard in the film, dates from 1951. Look magazine that Ralphie hides the Red Ryder ad in, is the December 1937 cover with Shirley Temple and Santa. Ralphie's Little Orphan Annie Secret Society Decoder Pin bears the date 1940 (and is the real-life decoder pin released to society members that year, though by that time Ovaltine had ceased its sponsorship and Quaker was the primary sponsor of the series), the parade in front of Higbee's features characters from MGM's version of The Wizard of Oz, which was released in 1939, a 1939 calendar is seen in one scene,[37] and World War II, which the United States entered in December 1941, is never mentioned. The \"Old Man's\" treasured Oldsmobile 6 is a 1937 Oldsmobile F-Series Touring Sedan. Although the director and author have said that the year has been obfuscated, some sources, including The New York Times and CBS News, have dated the film to 1940 or the early 1940s.[38][39][40][41] The real Shepherd was several years older than Ralphie; Shepherd was intentionally dishonest about many of the details of his own life and regularly obscured the line between fact and fiction in his writings.[42] A teacher called \"Miss Shields\" was Shepherd's second-grade teacher at Warren G. Harding Elementary School in 1928.[43] By 1939, Shepherd had already graduated from high school.[44] Initially overlooked as a sleeper film,[45] A Christmas Story was released a week before Thanksgiving 1983 to moderate success, earning about $2 million in its first weekend.[46] Film critics generally supported the film. Leonard Maltin proclaimed it \"a top screen comedy\".[47] Gene Siskel gave it 31⁄2 stars, calling it a \"delightful motion picture\", with \"delightful characters and performances\", but opined that it was \"doomed to box office failure\" for being released too early in the holiday season.[48] Roger Ebert initially gave the film three stars out of four,[47][49] but later awarded the film four stars and added the film to his \"Great Movies\" list. He suggested that the film only experienced modest success because holiday-themed films were not popular at the time.[50] Vincent Canby's mostly negative The New York Times review complained that \"the movie's big comic pieces tend only to be exceedingly busy. Though Mr. Billingsley, Mr. Gavin [sic], Miss Dillon and the actress who plays Ralphie's school teacher (Tedde Moore) are all very able, they are less funny than actors in a television situation comedy\".[38] In Canada, the film would go on to win two categories in the 5th Genie Awards, for Director Bob Clark and Best Original Screenplay for the work of Leigh Brown, Bob Clark and Jean Shepherd.[51] By Christmas 1983, the film was no longer playing at most venues but remained in about a hundred theatres until January 1984.[20] Gross earnings were just over $19.2 million.[46] In December 1984, the film was re-released for a brief second theatrical run, coinciding with its home video release.[52][53] Writer Glenn Lovell of Knight Ridder noted that after a year had passed, the film had \"caught on with critics and the public\",[54] and rather than unload the film to cable TV, MGM saw enough interest budding for a second run during the holiday season - this time much closer to and through the week of Christmas.[55] Over the years, the film's critical reputation has grown considerably and it is regarded by some as one of the best films of 1983.[56] By the late 1980s, it was already considered a classic.[57][58][59] Based on 61 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall approval rating from critics of 89%, with an average score of 8.4/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Both warmly nostalgic and darkly humorous, A Christmas Story deserves its status as a holiday perennial.\"[60] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 77 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[61] In his movie guide, Leonard Maltin awarded the film a four-star rating, calling the film \"delightful\" and \"truly funny for kids and grown-ups alike\" with \"wonderful period flavor\".[62] Due to television airings and home video release, A Christmas Story has become widely popular and is now an annual Christmas special. The film was produced and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). The rights to the film were acquired by Turner Entertainment Co. after Ted Turner's purchase of MGM's pre-1986 film library. Subsequently, Time Warner purchased Turner Entertainment in 1996 and currently holds rights to the film as Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). On December 24, 2007, AOL ranked the film their #1 Christmas film of all time.[63] IGN ranked the film the top holiday-themed film of all time.[64] In 2012, a Marist Poll named the film the favorite holiday film in the US.[65] In 2019, a poll commissioned by Tubitv and conducted by Onepoll also ranked the film Best Holiday Movie Ever.[66] A Christmas Story received a nomination for Best Digital – Comedy, and won Best Digital – Animation/Family at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards.[67][68] In August 2011, Zack Ward, who played Scut Farkus in the film, sued Warner Bros. and Enesco over merchandising for the film after the company authorized a figure resembling his character from the film without his permission.[69] It was revealed that when he signed on to play that character, he did not receive any merchandising rights because of a mishap with his contract.[69] The lawsuit was dropped in January 2012 after Warner Bros. revealed that the figurine showed a \"generic face\" that has been used on them since 2006 and that the statute of limitations had run out.[70] In December 2012, Ward sued Warner Bros. again over his image after attending the annual Christmas Story charity fundraiser convention in Cleveland in November 2010, where a fan handed him a Christmas Story board game, playing cards, and calendar showing his face.[71] The lawsuit was settled three days later.[72] The film first aired on television on premium cable networks The Movie Channel,[73] HBO,[74] and Showtime,[75] as early as December 1985, followed by Cinemax in 1986.[76] It was, however, reportedly rejected by the major networks NBC, CBS, and ABC for various reasons.[77] As a result, it was instead offered to and aired by local stations in 1986–1987,[78][79] and the film quickly began to attract a following. On December 16, 1987, the film premiered on SuperStation WTBS.[80][81][82] In 1989[83] and 1990,[84] TBS Superstation showed it on Thanksgiving night, while in 1991[85] and 1992,[86] they aired it the night after. Turner Broadcasting (as both an independent company and, from 1996 onward, as a subsidiary of the company presently operating as Warner Bros. Discovery) has maintained ownership of the broadcast rights, and since the mid-1990s, they have continued to air the film increasingly on both TBS and TNT throughout the holiday season annually. Turner Classic Movies has also aired the film many times, as has The CW in recent years. By 1995, it was aired on the three Turner networks a combined six times on December 24–26,[87][88] and in 1996, it was aired eight times over four days, not including separate local channel airings.[89] Due to the increasing popularity of the film, in 1997, TNT began airing a 24-hour marathon dubbed \"24 Hours of A Christmas Story\", consisting of twelve consecutive showings of the film running from 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Christmas Eve until 8:00 p.m. on Christmas Day.[90] This was in addition to various other airings on the network earlier in the month of December. In 2004, after TNT switched to a predominantly drama-centered programming format, sister network TBS, under its comedy-based \"Very Funny\" moniker, took over carriage of the marathon. Clark stated that, in 2002, an estimated 38.4 million people tuned into the marathon at one point or another, nearly one sixth of the country.[20] TBS reported 45.4 million viewers in 2005,[91] and 45.5 million in 2006.[92] In 2007, new all-time ratings records were set,[93] with the highest single showing (8:00 p.m. Christmas Eve) drawing 4.4 million viewers.[93] Viewership increased again in 2008, with the 8:00 p.m. airing on Christmas Eve drawing 4.5 million viewers, the 10:00 p.m. airing drawing 4.3 million,[94] and total viewership topping at 54.4 million.[95] As of 2009, the film had been shown 250 times on the Turner family of networks.[95] In 2007, the marathon continued, and the original tradition was revived. TNT also aired the film twice the Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend (November 25). In 2009, the 24-hour marathon continued on TBS, for the 13th overall year, starting at 8:00 p.m. ET on Christmas Eve.[96] In 2009, the film aired on TBS during a 24-hour marathon on Christmas Eve. The first viewing at 8:00 p.m. ET on December 24 earned a 1.6 rating (18–49) and beat the major broadcast networks (NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox).[97] In 2010, the marathon averaged 3 million viewers, up 2% from the previous year, ranking TBS as the top cable network for the 24-hour period. The 10:00 a.m. airing on December 25 was seen by 4.4 million viewers, and the 8:00 p.m. airing on December 24 was close behind with 4.3 million viewers.[98] The marathons in 2011[99] and 2012[100] continued to see increases in ratings. Beginning with the 2014 edition of the marathon, Turner elected to simulcast it on both TNT and TBS, marking the first time since 2003 that TNT aired it as well as the first time the marathon was aired on multiple networks. The two networks staggered their airings one hour apart, with the TBS marathon beginning at 8:00 p.m. ET and the TNT marathon beginning at 9:00 p.m. ET.[101][102] Both networks have run 24-hour marathons with the one-hour offset format from 2014 annually, making it a new tradition for both TBS and TNT networks.[3] For 2019, a majority of the most-watched programs—13 out of the top 25—broadcast on cable Christmas Day were A Christmas Story.[103] The PBS series American Playhouse produced two subsequent television film adaptations featuring the same characters, also with Shepherd narrating: The Star-Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski and Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss. The latter of these was set in the early 1950s with a now-teenaged Ralphie and his friends and family. Shepherd had previously created The Phantom of the Open Hearth and The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disasters for the same network.[104] A theatrical sequel involving Ralphie and his family, titled It Runs in the Family, was made in 1994. With the exceptions of Tedde Moore as Miss Shields (Ralphie's teacher) and Jean Shepherd as the narrator (the voice of the adult Ralphie), it features an entirely different cast. It received a limited release before being retitled My Summer Story for home video and television release.[105] A Christmas Story 2 is a direct sequel to the film, which ignores the references and events of My Summer Story and was released direct-to-video in 2012[106] and directed by Brian Levant. It was filmed in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada.[107] Another sequel to the film, which ignores all previous sequels[108][109] and is entitled A Christmas Story Christmas, was released in 2022. The film is directed by The Christmas Chronicles director Clay Kaytis and written by The Mule writer Nick Schenk (who is also executive producer of the film).[110] Peter Billingsley reprised his role as Ralphie Parker, in addition serving as the film's producer. The film was released via streaming on HBO Max by Warner Bros. Discovery Global Streaming & Interactive Entertainment.[111] It takes place in the 1970s following an adult Ralphie catching up with his old childhood friends.[112][113] Ian Petrella, Scott Schwartz, R. D. Robb, and Zack Ward reprised their roles of Randy Parker, Flick, Schwartz, and Scut Farkus, respectively.[114] Erinn Hayes, River Drosche, and Julianna Layne played Ralphie's wife and his kids while Julie Hagerty played Mrs. Parker in a role originated by Melinda Dillon (who would die less than two months after the film was released in 2023) in the original film.[115] The film is dedicated to the memory of Darren McGavin (who played \"The Old Man\" in the original film), who died on February 25, 2006.[116] In 2000, a stage play adaptation of A Christmas Story was written by Philip Grecian.[117] In November 2012, A Christmas Story: The Musical, based on the film, opened on Broadway. Written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (music and lyrics) and Joseph Robinette (book), the musical opened to positive reviews.[118] The run ended on December 30 the same year.[119] The musical was directed by John Rando with choreography by Warren Carlyle and featured Dan Lauria as Jean Shepherd.[120] The musical received Tony Award nominations for Best Musical, Best Book of a Musical (Robinette), and Best Original Score (Music or Lyrics) Written for the Theatre.[121] The musical was then adapted for television as the three hour A Christmas Story Live!, which aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 17, 2017.[122] Reviews were mixed; on Rotten Tomatoes, the production received a 46% rating based on 13 critics' reviews.[123]",

                "content": "It's a Wonderful Life is a 1946 American Christmas supernatural drama film produced and directed by Frank Capra. It is based on the short story and booklet \"The Greatest Gift\", self-published by Philip Van Doren Stern in 1943, which itself is loosely based on the 1843 Charles Dickens novella A Christmas Carol.[4] The film stars James Stewart as George Bailey, a man who has given up his personal dreams in order to help others in his community and whose thoughts of suicide on Christmas Eve bring about the intervention of his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody.[4] Clarence shows George all the lives he touched and what the world would be like if he had not existed. Although it was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, It's a Wonderful Life initially received mixed reviews and was unsuccessful at the box office. Theatrically, the film's break-even point was $6.3 million, about twice the production cost, a figure it did not come close to achieving on its initial release. Because of the film's disappointing sales, Capra was seen by some studios as having lost his ability to produce popular, financially successful films.[5] Its copyright in the U.S. expired in 1974 following a lack of renewal and it entered the public domain, allowing it to be broadcast without licensing or royalty fees, at which point it became a Christmas classic.[6] It's a Wonderful Life is now considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and among the best Christmas films.[7] It has been recognized by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 best American films ever made.[8] It was No. 11 on the American Film Institute's 1998 greatest movie list, No. 20 on its 2007 greatest movie list, No. 8 on its list of greatest love stories, and No. 1 on its list of the most inspirational American films of all time.[9] In 1990, It's a Wonderful Life was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being deemed as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Capra revealed that it was his favorite among the films he directed and that he screened it for his family every Christmas season. It was one of Stewart's favorite films.[10] A modern remake of the film, written and directed by Kenya Barris, is in development at Paramount Pictures as of January 2024.[11] On Christmas Eve 1945, in Bedford Falls, New York, George Bailey contemplates suicide. The prayers of his family and friends reach Heaven, where guardian angel second class Clarence Odbody is assigned to save George in order to earn his wings. Clarence is shown flashbacks of George's life. He watches 12-year-old George rescue his younger brother Harry from drowning in 1919, but the coldness of the water leaves George with an ear infection and, subsequently, deafness in his left ear. George later saves the pharmacist, Mr. Gower, from accidentally poisoning a customer. In 1928, George plans a world grand tour before college. He is reintroduced to Mary Hatch, who has loved him since childhood. When his father dies from a sudden stroke, George postpones his travel to settle the family business, Bailey Brothers Building and Loan. Avaricious board member Henry Potter, who owns the bank and most of the town, seeks to dissolve the company, but the board of directors votes to keep it open on condition that George run it. George acquiesces and works alongside his uncle Billy, giving his tuition savings to Harry with the understanding that Harry will take over when he graduates. However, Harry returns from college married and with a job offer from his father-in-law, and George resigns himself to running the building and loan. George and Mary rekindle their relationship and marry, and use their honeymoon savings to keep the company solvent during a run on the bank. Under George, the company establishes Bailey Park, a housing development surpassing Potter's overpriced slums. Potter entices George with a high-paying job, but George rebuffs him when he realizes that Potter's true intention is to close the building and loan. On Christmas Eve, the town prepares a hero's welcome for Harry, a Navy fighter pilot awarded the Medal of Honor for preventing a kamikaze attack on a troopship in World War II. Billy goes to Potter's bank to deposit $8,000 of the building and loan's money (equivalent to $135,394 in 2023). He taunts Potter with a newspaper headline about Harry, then absentmindedly wraps the cash in Potter's newspaper. Potter finds and keeps the money, while Billy cannot recall how he misplaced it. With a bank examiner reviewing the company's records, George fruitlessly retraces Billy's steps. Frustrated and angered by Billy's blunder, which may lead to scandal and jail, George resents the sacrifices he has made and the family that has kept him trapped in Bedford Falls. He appeals to Potter for a loan, offering his meager life insurance policy as collateral. Potter scoffs that George is worth more dead than alive, refuses to help, and phones the police. George flees Potter's office, gets drunk at a bar, and prays for help. Contemplating suicide, he goes to a nearby bridge. Before George can jump, Clarence dives into the freezing river so he rescues him. When George wishes he had never been born, Clarence shows George a timeline in which he never existed. Bedford Falls is now Pottersville, an unsavory town occupied by sleazy entertainment venues and callous people. Mr. Gower was jailed for manslaughter because George was not there to stop him from poisoning the customer. George's mother does not know him. Uncle Billy was institutionalized after the building and loan failed. Bailey Park is a cemetery, where George discovers Harry's grave: Without George, Harry had drowned as a child, and without Harry to save them, the troops aboard the transport ship were killed. George finds that Mary is an \"old maid\" librarian. When he grabs her and declares to be her husband, she screams and runs away. George races back to the bridge and begs for his life back. With his wish granted, he rushes home to await his arrest. Meanwhile, Mary and Billy have rallied the townspeople, who donate more than enough to replace the missing money. Harry arrives and toasts George as \"the richest man in town.\" Among the donations George finds a copy of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, a gift from Clarence inscribed, \"Remember, no man is a failure who has friends. Thanks for the wings!\" When a bell on the Christmas tree rings, George's youngest daughter, Zuzu, explains that \"every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings\", while the people are singing \"Auld Lang Syne\". Uncredited cast members include: The original story, \"The Greatest Gift\", was written by Philip Van Doren Stern in November 1939. After it was rejected by several publishers, he had it printed as a 24-page pamphlet and mailed to 200 family members and friends for Christmas 1943.[14][N 2][16] The story came to the attention of either Cary Grant or RKO producer David Hempstead, who showed it to Grant's agent. In April 1944, RKO Pictures bought the rights to the story for $10,000, hoping to turn it into a vehicle for Grant.[17] Dalton Trumbo, Clifford Odets, and Marc Connelly each worked on versions of the screenplay before RKO shelved the project. In Trumbo's draft, George Bailey is an idealistic politician who grows more cynical as the story progresses, then tries to end his life after losing an election. The angel shows him Bedford Falls not as it would be if he had never been born, but if he had gone into business instead of politics.[18] Grant went on to make another Christmas movie staple, The Bishop's Wife.[N 3][20] RKO studio chief Charles Koerner urged Frank Capra to read \"The Greatest Gift\". Capra's new production company, Liberty Films, had a nine-film distribution agreement with RKO. Capra immediately saw its potential, and wanted it for his first Hollywood film after making documentaries and training films during the war. RKO sold Capra the rights for $10,000 and threw in the three earlier scripts for free. (Capra claimed the rights and the scripts cost him $50,000.)[21][14][22] Capra salvaged a few scenes from Odets' earlier screenplay[23] and worked with writers Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, Jo Swerling, Michael Wilson, and Dorothy Parker (brought in to \"polish\" the script),[24] on many drafts of the screenplay. It was not a harmonious collaboration. Goodrich called Capra \"that horrid man\" and recalled, \"He couldn't wait to get writing it himself.\" Her husband, Albert Hackett, said, \"We told him what we were going to do, and he said 'That sounds fine.' We were trying to move the story along and work it out, and then somebody told us that [Capra] and Jo Swerling were working on it together, and that sort of took the guts out of it. Jo Swerling was a very close friend of ours, and when we heard he was doing this we felt rather bad about it. We were getting near the end and word came that Capra wanted to know how soon we'd be finished. So my wife said, 'We're finished right now.' We quickly wrote out the last scene and we never saw him again after that. He's a very arrogant son of a bitch.\"[25] Later, a dispute ensued over the writing credits. The final screenplay, renamed by Capra It's a Wonderful Life,[14][26] was credited to Goodrich, Hackett, and Capra, with \"additional scenes\" by Jo Swerling. Capra said, \"The Screen Writers' Arbitration committee decided that Hackett and Goodrich and I should get the credit for the writing. Jo Swerling hasn't talked to me since. That was five years ago.\"[25] Some in Seneca Falls, New York, believe Capra was inspired to model Bedford Falls after the town following a visit in 1945. The town has an annual \"It's a Wonderful Life Festival\" on the second weekend in December.[27] On December 10, 2010, the \"It's a Wonderful Life\" Museum opened in Seneca Falls, with Karolyn Grimes, who played Zuzu in the movie, cutting the ribbon.[28] However, film historian Jeanine Basinger, curator of the Frank Capra archives at Wesleyan University and author of The 'It's A Wonderful Life' Book, has said no evidence exists for Seneca Falls' claim. \"I have been through every piece of paper in Frank Capra's diaries, his archives, everything. There's no evidence of any sort whatsoever to support this. That doesn't mean it isn't true, but no one is ever going to prove it.\" Basinger said that Capra always described Bedford Falls as an \"Everytown\".[29] Philip Van Doren Stern said in a 1946 interview, \"Incidentally, the movie takes place in Westchester County. Actually, the town I had in mind was Califon, N.J.\" The historic iron bridge in Califon is similar to the bridge that George Bailey considered jumping from in the movie.[16] In his autobiography, Capra recalled: \"Of all actors' roles I believe the most difficult is the role of a Good Sam who doesn't know that he is a Good Sam. I knew one man who could play it ... James Stewart. ... I spoke to Lew Wasserman, the MCA agent who handled Jimmy, told him I wanted to tell Jimmy the story. Wasserman said Stewart would gladly play the part without hearing the story.\"[30] Stewart and Capra had previously collaborated on You Can't Take It with You (1938) and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939). Henry Fonda, Stewart's best friend, was also considered.[31][32] Both actors had returned from the war with no employment prospects. Fonda, however, was cast in John Ford's My Darling Clementine (1946), which was filmed at the same time that Capra shot It's a Wonderful Life. For 17 supporting roles[33] in the film, Capra considered more than 170 established actors. Jean Arthur, Stewart's co-star in You Can't Take It With You and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, was first offered the role of Mary, but had recently dropped out of the Broadway show Born Yesterday from exhaustion shortly before its premiere. Capra next considered Olivia de Havilland, Martha Scott, Ann Dvorak, and Ginger Rogers before borrowing Donna Reed from MGM. Rogers turned it down because she considered it \"too bland.\"[34] In chapter 26 of her autobiography Ginger: My Story, she questioned her decision by asking her readers: \"Foolish, you say?\" A long list of actors was considered for the role of Potter (originally named Herbert Potter): Edward Arnold, Charles Bickford, Edgar Buchanan, Louis Calhern, Victor Jory, Raymond Massey, Thomas Mitchell, and Vincent Price.[32] Lionel Barrymore, who eventually was cast, was a famous Ebenezer Scrooge in radio dramatizations of A Christmas Carol at the time, and was a natural choice for the role. Barrymore had also worked with Capra and Stewart on Capra's 1938 Best Picture Oscar winner, You Can't Take It with You. Before Capra decided on Ward Bond as Bert,[33] he also considered Sam Levene, Barton MacLane, Robert Mitchum, John Alexander and Irving Bacon for the role. Before Capra cast Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy, he also considered Walter Brennan and W. C. Fields for the role.[35]: 8 H. B. Warner, who was cast as Mr. Gower, the pharmacist, had studied medicine before going into acting. He was also in some of Capra's other films, including Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, Lost Horizon, You Can't Take It with You, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.[36] In the silent era, he had played the role of Jesus Christ in Cecil B. DeMille's The King of Kings (1927). The name Gower came from Capra's employer Columbia Pictures, which had been located on Gower Street for many years. Also on Gower Street was a drugstore that was a favorite for the studio's employees.[37] Charles Williams, who was cast as Eustace Bailey, and Mary Treen, who was cast as Matilda \"Tilly\" Bailey, were both B-list actors, having appeared in 90 films each before It's a Wonderful Life.[38] Jimmy the raven (Uncle Billy's pet) appeared in You Can't Take It with You and each subsequent Capra film.[31][39] It's a Wonderful Life was shot at RKO Radio Pictures Studios in Culver City, California, and the 89-acre RKO movie ranch in Encino,[40] where \"Bedford Falls\" was adapted from Oscar-winning sets originally designed by art director Max Ree for the 1931 epic film Cimarron. Covering 4 acres (1.6 ha), the town consisted of a main street stretching 300 yards (three city blocks) with 75 stores and buildings, and a residential neighborhood.[41] Capra added a tree-lined center parkway, built a working bank set, and planted 20 full-grown oak trees.[42] Pigeons, cats, and dogs were allowed to roam the mammoth set to give the \"town\" a lived-in feel.[39] Due to the requirements of filming in an \"alternate reality,\" as well as different seasons, the exterior set was extremely adaptable. RKO studio's head of special effects, Russell Shearman, developed a new compound using water, soap flakes, foamite, and sugar to create \"chemical snow\" for the film. Before then, movie snow was usually made from untoasted cornflakes, which were so loud when stepped on that dialogue had to be redubbed afterwards.[43][44] Filming started on April 15, 1946, and wrapped on July 27, 1946, exactly on deadline for the 90-day principal photography schedule.[19] Only two locations from the film survive. The first, the swimming pool that was unveiled during the high-school dance sequence, is located in the gymnasium at Beverly Hills High School and is still in use as of December 2023[update]. The second is the \"Martini home\" in La Cañada Flintridge, California.[45] RKO's movie ranch in Encino was razed in 1954.[N 4] The scene where young George saves his brother Harry from drowning was different in an early draft of the script. The boys play ice hockey on the river (which is on Potter's property) as Potter watches with disdain. George shoots the puck, but it goes astray and breaks the \"No Trespassing\" sign and lands in Potter's yard. Potter becomes irate and his gardener releases attack dogs, which cause the boys to flee. Harry falls in the ice and George saves him with the same results.[47] In another draft, after he unsuccessfully attempts to consult his father about Mr. Gower and the pills, George considers asking Uncle Billy, but he is on the phone with the bank examiner. Billy lights his cigar and throws his match in the wastebasket. George turns to Tilly (who, along with Eustace, are his cousins, although not Billy's kids), but she is on the phone with her friend, Martha. She says, \"Potter's here, the bank examiner's coming. It's a day of judgment.\" The wastebasket suddenly catches fire and Billy cries for help. Tilly runs in and puts the fire out with a pot of coffee. George decides to deal with the Gower situation by himself.[48] According to Bobbie Anderson, in the confrontation between Mr. Gower and young George, H. B. Warner, who was drunk at the time of the drug store scene, slapped him for real and made his ear bleed, reducing him to tears. Warner hugged him after the scene was shot.[49] Composer Dimitri Tiomkin had written \"Death Telegram\" and \"Gower's Deliverance\" for the drugstore sequence, but Capra elected to forgo music in those scenes. Tiomkin had worked on many of Capra's previous films, but those changes, and others, led to a falling out between the two men. Tiomkin felt as though his work was being seen as a mere suggestion. In his autobiography Please Don't Hate Me, he called the incident, \"an all around scissors job.\"[48] In the scene where Uncle Billy gets drunk at Harry and Ruth's welcome home/newlyweds' party and staggers away off camera, a crash is heard off screen. Mitchell, as Uncle Billy, yells, \"I'm all right! I'm all right!\", implying that Uncle Billy had knocked into some trash cans. A technician had actually knocked over some equipment; Capra left in Mitchell's impromptu ad lib and rewarded the technician with $10 (equal to $141.84 in 2021), thanking him for his 'sound improvement.' According to rare stills that have been unearthed, several sequences were filmed but subsequently cut.[50] Alternative endings were also considered. Capra's first script had Bailey fall to his knees to recite \"The Lord's Prayer\" (the script also called for an opening scene with the townspeople in prayer). Feeling that an overly religious tone undermined the emotional impact of the family and friends rushing to George's rescue, the closing scenes were rewritten.[51][52][53] Capra found the film's original cinematographer Victor Milner slow and pretentious, and when Milner became ill, Capra borrowed Joseph Walker from Columbia.[54] Walker had lensed 19 previous Capra films. But when Rosalind Russell demanded that Walker return to Columbia Pictures to shoot her next film,[55] Walker trained veteran camera operator Joseph Biroc to be his replacement. Although working with three cinematographers was difficult for Capra, in Walker's opinion it turned out very well because the scenes each cinematographer shot were so different that they did not have to match each other's visual styles.[56] According to a 2006 book, \"A spate of movies appeared just after the ending of the Second World War, including It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and Stairway to Heaven (1946), perhaps tapping into so many people's experience of loss of loved ones and offering a kind of consolation.\"[57] It's a Wonderful Life premiered at the Globe Theatre in New York City on December 20, 1946, to mixed reviews.[19] While Capra thought the contemporary critical reviews were either universally negative, or at best dismissive,[58] Time said, \"It's a Wonderful Life is a pretty wonderful movie. It has only one formidable rival (Goldwyn's The Best Years of Our Lives) as Hollywood's best picture of the year. Director Capra's inventiveness, humor, and affection for human beings keep it glowing with life and excitement.\"[59] In his review for Variety, Bert Briller wrote, \"It’s a Wonderful Life will enjoy just that at the b.o. [box office], and eminently deserves to do so.\" He added: \"Capra may not have taken here the stride forward in film-making technique he achieved in “It Happened One Night, but no past Capra celluloid possessed any greater or more genuine qualities of effectiveness.\" Briller praised Reed's performance, writing, \"In femme lead, Donna Reed will reach full-fledged stardom with this effort.\"[60] Bosley Crowther, writing for The New York Times, complimented some of the actors, including Stewart and Reed, but concluded, \"the weakness of this picture, from this reviewer's point of view, is the sentimentality of it—its illusory concept of life. Mr. Capra's nice people are charming, his small town is a quite beguiling place and his pattern for solving problems is most optimistic and facile. But somehow, they all resemble theatrical attitudes, rather than average realities.\"[61] The film, which went into general release on January 7, 1947, placed 26th ($3.3 million) in box-office revenues for 1947[3] (out of more than 400 features released),[62] one place ahead of another Christmas film, Miracle on 34th Street. The film was supposed to be released in January 1947, but was moved up to December 1946 to make it eligible for the 19th Academy Awards held in March 1947. This move was seen as worse for the film, as 1947 did not have quite the stiff competition as 1946. If it had entered the 1947 awards, its strongest competitor would have been Miracle on 34th Street. The number-one grossing movie of 1947, The Best Years of Our Lives, made $11.5 million.[3] The film recorded a loss of $525,000 at the box office for RKO.[63] On May 26, 1947, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a memo stating, \"With regard to the picture It's a Wonderful Life, [redacted] stated in substance that the film represented rather obvious attempts to discredit bankers by casting Lionel Barrymore as a 'scrooge-type' so that he would be the most hated man in the picture. This, according to these sources, is a common trick used by Communists. [In] addition, [redacted] stated that, in his opinion, this picture deliberately maligned the upper class, attempting to show the people who had money were mean and despicable characters.\"[64] Film historian Andrew Sarris observed as \"curious\" that \"the censors never noticed that the villainous Mr. Potter gets away with robbery without being caught or punished in any way\".[65] In 1990, It's a Wonderful Life was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry.[66][67][68] In 2002, Channel 4 in the United Kingdom ranked It's a Wonderful Life as the seventh-greatest film ever made in its poll \"The 100 Greatest Films\". The channel airs the film to British viewers annually on Christmas Eve.[69] In June 2008, AFI revealed its 10 Top 10, the best 10 films in 10 \"classic\" American film genres, after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. It's a Wonderful Life was acknowledged as the third-best film in the fantasy genre.[70][71] Somewhat more iconoclastic views of the film and its contents are occasionally expressed. In his review for The New Republic in 1947, film critic Manny Farber wrote, \"To make his points, [Capra] always takes an easy, simple-minded path that doesn't give much credit to the intelligence of the audience\", and adds that it has only a \"few unsentimental moments here and there\".[72][N 5] Wendell Jamieson, in a 2008 article for The New York Times which was generally positive in its analysis of the film, observed that far from being simply a sweetly sentimental tale, It's a Wonderful Life \"is a terrifying, asphyxiating story about growing up and relinquishing your dreams, of seeing your father driven to the grave before his time, of living among bitter, small-minded people. It is a story of being trapped, of compromising, of watching others move ahead and away, of becoming so filled with rage that you verbally abuse your children, their teacher, and your oppressively perfect wife.\"[73] ... one of the most profoundly pessimistic tales of human existence ever to achieve a lasting popularity. In a 2010 essay for Salon, Richard Cohen described It's a Wonderful Life as \"the most terrifying Hollywood film ever made\". In the \"Pottersville\" sequence, he wrote, George Bailey is not seeing the world that would exist had he never been born, but rather \"the world as it does exist, in his time and also in our own\".[74] Nine years earlier, another Salon writer, Gary Kamiya, had expressed the opposing view that \"Pottersville rocks!\", adding: \"The gauzy, Currier-and-Ives veil Capra drapes over Bedford Falls has prevented viewers from grasping what a tiresome and, frankly, toxic environment it is ... We all live in Pottersville now.\"[75] The film's elevation to the status of a beloved classic came three decades after its initial release, when it became a television staple during Christmas season in 1976.[76] This came as a welcome surprise to Frank Capra and others involved with its production. \"It's the damnedest thing I've ever seen\", Capra told The Wall Street Journal in 1984. \"The film has a life of its own now, and I can look at it like I had nothing to do with it. I'm like a parent whose kid grows up to be President. I'm proud ... but it's the kid who did the work. I didn't even think of it as a Christmas story when I first ran across it. I just liked the idea.\"[77] In a 1946 interview, Capra described the film's theme as \"the individual's belief in himself\" and that he made it \"to combat a modern trend toward atheism\".[77] It ranked 283rd among critics, and 107th among directors, in the 2012 Sight & Sound polls of the greatest films ever made.[78] The film's positive reception has continued. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on 97 reviews, with an average rating of 9.0/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The holiday classic to define all holiday classics, It's a Wonderful Life is one of a handful of films worth an annual viewing.\"[79] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a score 89 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[80] Many filmmakers have praised the film, including Steven Spielberg, Akira Kurosawa, Frank Darabont and David Lynch.[81] Spielberg once said of the film: \"It’s a Wonderful Life shows that every human being on this Earth matters -- and that’s a very powerful message.\"[82] Orson Welles played Mr. Potter in the made-for-television remake It Happened One Christmas; when asked by Henry Jaglom what he thought of the movie, Welles said, \"There's no way of hating that movie.\"[83] Prior to its Los Angeles release, Liberty Films mounted an extensive promotional campaign that included a daily advertisement highlighting one of the film's players, along with comments from reviewers. Jimmy Starr wrote, \"If I were an Oscar, I'd elope with It's a Wonderful Life lock, stock and barrel on the night of the Academy Awards\". The New York Daily Times published an editorial that declared the film and James Stewart's performance to be worthy of Academy Award consideration.[84] It's a Wonderful Life received five Academy Award nominations:[85] The Best Years of Our Lives, a drama about servicemen attempting to return to their pre-World War II lives, won most of the awards that year, including four of the five for which It's a Wonderful Life was nominated. (The award for \"Best Sound Recording\" was won by The Jolson Story.) The Best Years of Our Lives, directed by William Wyler, Capra's business partner along with George Stevens in Liberty Films, was also an outstanding commercial success, ultimately becoming the highest-grossing film of the decade, in contrast to the more modest initial box-office returns of It's a Wonderful Life.[86] It's a Wonderful Life received a Golden Globe Award for Capra as Best Motion Picture Director. He also won a \"CEC Award\" from the Cinema Writers Circle in Spain, for Mejor Película Extranjera (Best Foreign Film). Jimmy Hawkins won a \"Former Child Star Lifetime Achievement Award\" from the Young Artist Awards in 1994; the award recognized his role as Tommy Bailey as igniting his career, which lasted until the mid-1960s.[87] The film was included by the Vatican in a list of important films compiled in 1995, under the category of \"Values\".[88] Liberty Films was purchased by Paramount Pictures, and remained a subsidiary until 1951. In 1955, M. & A. Alexander purchased the movie. This included key rights to the original television syndication, the original nitrate film elements, the music score, and the film rights to the story on which the film is based, The Greatest Gift.[N 6] National Telefilm Associates took over the rights to the film soon thereafter. A clerical error at NTA prevented the copyright from being renewed properly in 1974.[91][92] Despite the lapsed copyright, television stations that aired it still had to pay royalties because—though the film's images had entered the public domain—the film's story was still restricted as a derivative work of the published story The Greatest Gift, whose copyright Philip Van Doren Stern had renewed in 1971.[93][94][N 7] The film became a perennial holiday favorite in the 1980s, possibly due to its repeated showings each holiday season on hundreds of local television stations. It was mentioned during the deliberations on the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998.[93][95] In 1993, Republic Pictures, which was the successor to NTA, relied on the 1990 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Stewart v. Abend (which involved another Stewart film, Rear Window) to enforce its claim to the copyright. While the film's copyright had not been renewed, Republic still owned the film rights to The Greatest Gift; thus, the plaintiffs were able to argue its status as a derivative work of a work still under copyright.[93][96] That year, Republic made a deal with Turner Broadcasting System, authorizing only three airings of the movie, all on cable's TNT and TBS. However, the studio's attempt to reassert control was widely ignored since there were still some existing distribution deals that Republic had to honor. In 1994, the studio sold exclusive television rights to NBC. \"We're thrilled that we will have the opportunity to broadcast this picture,\" said NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield at the time. \"We will broadcast the original director's cut in black and white, full-length, the way Frank Capra intended this picture to be seen.\" NBC traditionally shows the film on Christmas Eve. It had, for a time in the late 1990s, aired the film on Thanksgiving but removed that airing due to low ratings and began airing the National Dog Show instead.[97] Paramount (via parent company Viacom's 1998 acquisition of Republic's then-parent, Spelling Entertainment) once again has distribution rights for the first time since 1955.[93][98] Due to all the above actions, this is one of the few RKO films not controlled by Turner Entertainment/Warner Bros. in the US. It is also one of two Capra films Paramount owns despite not having originally released it—the other is Broadway Bill (originally from Columbia, remade by Paramount as Riding High in 1950).[93] Director Capra met with Wilson Markle about having Colorization Inc. colorize It's a Wonderful Life based on an enthusiastic response to the colorization of Topper from actor Cary Grant.[99] The company's art director, Brian Holmes, prepared 10 minutes of colorized footage from It's a Wonderful Life for Capra to view, which resulted in Capra signing a contract with Colorization Inc., and his \"enthusiastic agree[ment] to pay half the $260,000 cost of colorizing the movie and to share any profits\" and giving \"preliminary approval to making similar color versions of two of his other black-and-white films, Meet John Doe (1941) and Lady for a Day (1933)\".[99] However, the film was believed to be in the public domain at the time, and as a result, Markle and Holmes responded by returning Capra's initial investment, eliminating his financial participation, and refusing outright to allow the director to exercise artistic control over the colorization of his films, leading Capra to join in the campaign against the process.[99] Three colorized versions have been produced. The first was released by Hal Roach Studios in 1986. The second was authorized and produced by the film's permanent owner, Republic Pictures, in 1989. Both Capra and Stewart took a critical stand on the colorized editions.[100] The Hal Roach color version was re-released in 1989 to VHS via Video Treasures. A third, computer-colorized version was produced by Legend Films in 2007 and has been released on DVD, Blu-ray, and streaming services. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, when the film was still thought to be public domain, It's a Wonderful Life was released on VHS by a variety of home video companies. Among the companies that released the film on home video before Republic Pictures stepped in were Meda Video (which would later become Media Home Entertainment), Kartes Video Communications (under its Video Film Classics label), GoodTimes Home Video, and Video Treasures (now Anchor Bay Entertainment). After Republic reclaimed the rights to the film, all unofficial VHS copies of the film still in the hands of video distributors were supposed to have been destroyed.[96] Artisan Entertainment (under license from Republic) took over home video rights in the mid-1990s. Artisan was later sold to Lions Gate Entertainment, which continued to hold US home video rights until late 2005, when they reverted to Paramount, which also owns video rights throughout Region 4 (Latin America and Australia) and in France. Video rights in the rest of the world are held by different companies; for example, the UK rights were once with Universal Studios, but have since reverted to Paramount. In 1993, due in part to the confusion of the ownership and copyright issues, Kinesoft Development, with the support of Republic Pictures, released It's a Wonderful Life as one of the first commercial feature-length films on CD-ROM for the Windows PC (Windows 3.1). Antedating commercial DVDs by several years, it included such features as the ability to follow along with the complete shooting script as the film was playing.[101][102][N 8] Given the state of video playback on the PC at the time of its release, It's a Wonderful Life for Windows represented another milestone, as the longest-running video on a computer. Prior to its release, Windows could play back only about 32,000 frames of video, or about 35 minutes at 15 frames per second.[citation needed] Working with Microsoft, Kinesoft was able to enhance the video features of Windows to allow for the complete playback of the entire film—all of this on a PC with a 486SX processor and 8 MB of RAM.[103] Computer Gaming World said in April 1994, \"The picture quality still has a way to go before it reaches television standards\", but was \"a noble effort\" that would \"please fans of the film\".[104] The film has seen multiple DVD releases since the availability of the format. In the autumn of 2001, Republic issued the film twice, once in August, and again with different packaging in September of that same year. On October 31, 2006, Paramount released a newly remastered \"60th Anniversary Edition\". On November 13, 2007, Paramount released a two-disc \"special edition\" DVD of the film that contained both the original theatrical black-and-white version, and a new, third colorized version, produced by Legend Films using the latest colorization technology. On November 3, 2009, Paramount re-released the previous DVD set as a \"Collector's Edition\" and debuted a Blu-ray edition, also containing both versions of the film. In 2017, the film was restored in 4K resolution, available via streaming services and DCP.[105] On October 29, 2019, the film was released for the first time on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, along with a digital copy featuring a new Dolby Vision transfer.[106] The film was twice adapted for radio in 1947, first on Lux Radio Theater (March 10) and then on the Screen Guild Theater (December 29), then again on the Screen Guild Theater broadcast of March 15, 1951. James Stewart and Donna Reed reprised their roles for all three radio productions. Stewart also starred in the May 8, 1949, radio adaptation presented on the Screen Directors Playhouse. A musical stage adaptation of the film, titled A Wonderful Life, was written by Sheldon Harnick and Joe Raposo. This version was first performed at the University of Michigan in 1986, but a planned professional production was stalled by legal wrangling with the estate of Philip Van Doren Stern. It was eventually performed in Washington, D.C., by Arena Stage in 1991, and had revivals in the 21st century, including a staged concert version in New York City in 2005 and several productions by regional theatres. Another musical stage adaptation of the film, titled It's a Wonderful Life – The Musical, was written by Bruce Greer and Keith Ferguson. This version premiered at the Majestic Theatre, Dallas, Texas, in 1998. It was an annual Christmas show at the theater for five years. It has since been performed at venues all around the United States.[107] In July 2019, it was revealed that another stage musical adaptation was in development with music and lyrics by Paul McCartney (making his musical theatre debut), lyrics and book by Lee Hall and produced by Bill Kenwright. The musical was set to debut late 2020, but is still yet to premiere.[108] In 1997, PBS aired Merry Christmas, George Bailey, taped from a live performance of the 1947 Lux Radio Theatre script at the Pasadena Playhouse. The presentation, which benefited the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, featured an all-star cast, including Bill Pullman as George, Nathan Lane as Clarence, Martin Landau as Mr. Potter, Penelope Ann Miller as Mary, and Sally Field as Mother Bailey.[109] The Last Temptation of Clarence Odbody is a 2011 novel written by John Pierson. The novel imagines the future lives of various characters if George had not survived his jump into the river.[110] A new \"cinematic audio\" adaptation by David Ossman of the Firesign Theatre was produced and directed by Ossman and his wife Judith Walcutt of Otherworld Media in December 2019 at the Whidbey Island Center for the Arts. Their version combined elements of traditional and radio theatre, with costumes, sets, makeup, and lighting effects, as well as live music, live sound effects, and over 20 microphones.[111] It Happened One Christmas was a 1977 television movie remake of the classic film, whose screenplay Lionel Chetwynd based on both the original Van Doren Stern short story and the 1946 screenplay. This remake employed gender-reversal, with Marlo Thomas as the protagonist Mary Bailey, Wayne Rogers as George Hatch, and Cloris Leachman as the angel Clara Oddbody.[N 9] Leachman received her tenth Emmy nomination for this role. In a significant departure from his earlier roles, Orson Welles was cast as Mr. Potter.[N 10] Following initial positive reviews, the made-for-television film was rebroadcast twice in 1978 and 1979, but has not been shown since on national re-broadcasts or issued to home media.[N 11][112] Merry Christmas, George Bailey was a 1997 PBS television movie adaptation of the film directed by Matthew Diamond and starring Bill Pullman as George Bailey, Penelope Ann Miller as Mary, Nathan Lane as Clarence and Martin Landau as Potter.[113][114][115][116] The Christmas Spirit was a retelling of the movie starring Nicollette Sheridan as Charlotte Hart. This was a made-for-TV film aired on December 1, 2013, on the Hallmark Channel executive produced by Sheridan under her company, Wyke Lane Productions, and Brad Krevoy Television. The film was directed and written by Jack Angelo. Spirit was set in the present day, with the Hart character working to save a \"quiet New England town from a ruthless real estate developer\". The film was planned to kick off a film series about the Hart character.[117] The film had 3.372 million viewers overall.[118] A 1986 skit on Saturday Night Live features William Shatner introducing the \"lost ending\" of It's a Wonderful Life in which George Bailey (Dana Carvey) and the citizens of Bedford Falls discover that Mr. Potter (Jon Lovitz) has stolen George's money and take turns attacking him in his office. In 1992, the final episode of Tiny Toon Adventures parodied It's A Wonderful Life entitled \"It's A Wonderful Tiny Toon Christmas\". In it, Buster Bunny feels sad after the failure of his play and wishes he had never become a Tiny Toon, so a guardian angel shows Buster what life would have been like without him. In 2002, the television film It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie premiered on NBC. The film is a homage to It's a Wonderful Life. In the film, Kermit the Frog wishes that he had never been born.[119] \"The Greatest Gift\", the 2011 Warehouse 13 season 3 Christmas episode, tells a similar story after agent Pete Lattimer touches Stern's brush.[120][121] In 1990, the made-for-television film Clarence stars Robert Carradine in a new tale of the helpful angel, Clarence Odbody.[122][123] A purported sequel was in development for a 2015 release, and was to be called It's a Wonderful Life: The Rest of the Story. It was to be written by Bob Farnsworth and Martha Bolton and follow the angel of George Bailey's daughter Zuzu (played once again by Karolyn Grimes), as she teaches Bailey's evil grandson how different the world would have been if he had never been born. Producers were considering directors and hoped to shoot the film with a $25–$35 million budget in Louisiana early in 2014.[124] The film had been announced as being produced by Star Partners and Hummingbird Productions, neither of which are affiliated with Paramount, owners of the original film (Farnsworth claimed that It's a Wonderful Life was in the public domain). Later, a Paramount spokesperson claimed that they were not granting permission to make the film; \"To date, these individuals have not obtained any of the necessary rights, and we would take all appropriate steps to protect those rights\", the spokesperson said.[125] On January 19, 2024, it was announced that Kenya Barris will write and direct a modern remake of the film for Paramount, with the intention to cast a person of color in the role of George Bailey. On the announcement, Barris remarked: \"I feel like Christmas movies are amazing and I think the idea of taking something that has that long of a history and a tale behind it and putting an amazing piece of talent to tell that story ... It's a guy who’s trying to help out his community and things are going to turn around on him. I think that’s the perfect story to tell for a person of color — Black or brown — to get into that because our communities have some issues and someone trying to help that community out. I think that’s the perfect vehicle to tell that story from.\"[11] It is commonly believed that the characters of Bert and Ernie on Sesame Street were named after Bert the cop and Ernie the cab driver. However, in a correction for the 1999 \"Annual Xmas Quiz\" in the San Francisco Chronicle, which made this claim, series writer Jerry Juhl confirmed that, per producer Jon Stone, the shared names were merely a coincidence.[126] Despite this, the 1996 holiday special Elmo Saves Christmas references the rumor, during a scene where Bert and Ernie walk by a TV set, which is playing the movie.

                "content": "This is an accepted version of this page Die Hard is a 1988 American action film directed by John McTiernan and written by Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza based on the 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp. It stars Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Alexander Godunov, and Bonnie Bedelia, with Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Paul Gleason, and Hart Bochner in supporting roles. Die Hard follows New York City police detective John McClane (Willis) who is caught up in a terrorist takeover of a Los Angeles skyscraper while visiting his estranged wife during a Christmas Eve party. Stuart was hired by 20th Century Fox to adapt Thorp's novel in 1987. His first draft was greenlit immediately, as the studio was eager for a summer blockbuster the following year. The role of McClane was turned down by a host of the decade's most popular actors, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. Known mainly for work on television, Willis was paid $5 million for his involvement, placing him among Hollywood's highest-paid actors. The deal was seen as a poor investment by industry professionals and attracted significant controversy towards the film prior to its release. Filming took place between November 1987 and March 1988, on a $25 million to $35 million budget and almost entirely on location in and around Fox Plaza in Los Angeles. Expectations for Die Hard were low; some marketing materials omitted Willis's image, ostensibly because the publicity team determined that the setting was as important as McClane. Upon its release in July 1988, initial reviews were mixed: criticism focused on its violence, plot, and Willis's performance, while McTiernan's direction and Rickman's charismatic portrayal of the villain Hans Gruber were praised. Defying predictions, Die Hard grossed approximately $140 million, becoming the year's tenth-highest-grossing film and the highest-grossing action film. Receiving four Academy Award nominations, it elevated Willis to leading-man status and made Rickman a celebrity. Die Hard has been critically re-evaluated and is now considered one of the greatest action films of all time. It is considered to have revitalized the action genre, largely due to its depiction of McClane as a vulnerable and fallible protagonist, in contrast to the muscle-bound and invincible heroes of other films of the period. Retrospective commentators also identified and analyzed its thematic concerns, including vengeance, masculinity, gender roles, and American anxieties over foreign influences. Due to its Christmas setting, Die Hard is often named one of the best Christmas films of all time, although its status as a Christmas film is disputed. The film produced a host of imitators; the term \"Die Hard\" became a shorthand for plots featuring overwhelming odds in a restricted environment, such as \"Die Hard on a bus\" in relation to Speed. It created a franchise comprising the sequels Die Hard 2 (1990), Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), Live Free or Die Hard (2007), and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013), plus video games, comics, and other merchandise. Deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress, Die Hard was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2017. On Christmas Eve, New York City Police Department (NYPD) Detective John McClane arrives in Los Angeles, hoping to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly, at a party held by her employer, the Nakatomi Corporation. He is driven to Nakatomi Plaza by a limo driver, Argyle, who offers to wait for McClane in the garage. While McClane washes himself, the tower is seized by the German radical Hans Gruber and his heavily armed team, including Karl and Theo. Everyone in the tower is taken hostage except for McClane, who slips away, and Argyle, who remains oblivious to events. Gruber is posing as a terrorist to steal the $640 million in untraceable bearer bonds in the building's vault.[a] He kills executive Joseph Takagi after failing to extract the access code from him and tasks Theo with breaking into the vault. The terrorists are alerted to McClane's presence, and Karl's brother, Tony, is sent after him. McClane kills Tony and takes his weapon and radio, which he uses to contact the skeptical Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Sergeant Al Powell is sent to investigate. Meanwhile, McClane kills more terrorists and recovers their bag of C-4 and detonators. Realizing Powell is about to leave, having found nothing amiss, McClane drops a terrorist's corpse onto his car. After Powell calls for backup, a SWAT team attempts to storm the building but is counterattacked by the terrorists. McClane throws some C-4 down an elevator shaft, causing an explosion that kills some of the terrorists and ends the counterattack. Holly's co-worker Harry Ellis attempts to negotiate on Gruber's behalf but is killed by Gruber when McClane refuses to surrender. While checking the explosives on the roof, Gruber encounters McClane and pretends to be an escaped hostage; McClane gives Gruber a gun. Gruber attempts to shoot McClane but finds the weapon is unloaded, and he is saved only by the intervention of other terrorists. McClane escapes but is injured by shattered glass and loses the detonators. Outside, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents take control. They order the power to be shut off, which, as Gruber had anticipated, disables the final vault lock so his team can collect the bonds. The FBI agrees to Gruber's demand for a helicopter, intending to send helicopter gunships to eliminate the group. McClane realizes Gruber plans to blow the roof to kill the hostages and fake his team's deaths. Karl, enraged by Tony's death, attacks McClane and is seemingly killed. Gruber sees a news report by Richard Thornburg on McClane's children and deduces that he is Holly's husband. The hostages are taken to the roof while Gruber keeps Holly with him. McClane drives the hostages from the roof just before Gruber detonates it and destroys the approaching FBI helicopters. Meanwhile, Theo retrieves an escape vehicle from the parking garage but is knocked out by Argyle, who has been following events on the limo's CB radio. A weary and battered McClane finds Holly with Gruber and his remaining henchman. McClane surrenders to Gruber and is about to be shot but grabs his concealed service pistol taped to his back and uses his last two bullets to wound Gruber and kill his accomplice. Gruber crashes through a window but grabs onto Holly's wristwatch and makes a last-ditch attempt to kill the pair. McClane unclasps the watch, and Gruber falls to his death. Outside, Karl ambushes McClane and Holly; Karl is shot dead by Powell. Holly punches Thornburg when he attempts to interview McClane. Argyle crashes through the parking garage door in the limo and drives McClane and Holly away together. Other cast members include Gruber's henchmen: Bruno Doyon as Franco, Andreas Wisniewski as Tony, Joey Plewa as Alexander, Lorenzo Caccialanza as Marco, Gerard Bonn as Kristoff, Dennis Hayden as Eddie, Al Leong as Uli, Gary Roberts as Heinrich, Hans Buhringer as Fritz, and Wilhelm von Homburg as James. Robert Davi and Grand L. Bush appear as FBI Special Agents Big Johnson and Little Johnson, respectively, Tracy Reiner appears as Thornburg's assistant, and Taylor Fry and Noah Land make minor appearances as McClane's children Lucy McClane and John Jr.[10] The development of Die Hard began in 1987, when screenwriter Jeb Stuart was in dire financial straits. His script purchased by Columbia Pictures had been abandoned and a contract at Walt Disney Pictures was not providing him with sufficient income. Stuart had six weeks between contracted work so his agent Jeremy Zimmer contacted Lloyd Levin, the head of development at the Gordon Company, a producing arm of 20th Century Fox.[11] Levin asked Stuart to work on an adaptation of the 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever written by former private investigator Roderick Thorp.[11][12] Thorp had been inspired to write Nothing Lasts Forever by a dream he had—in which armed assailants chase a man through a building—after watching the 1974 disaster film The Towering Inferno.[11][13][14] Fox had adapted the book's 1966 predecessor, The Detective, for the 1968 film starring Frank Sinatra as NYPD detective Joe Leland, and purchased the sequel rights before Nothing Lasts Forever had been written.[11][13] Levin gave Stuart creative freedom as long as he retained the Christmas-in-Los-Angeles setting; the concept, he considered, would provide an interesting aesthetic.[11] The film was pitched as \"Rambo in an office building\", referring to the successful Rambo film series.[15] Producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver hired director John McTiernan because of his work with them on the successful 1987 action film Predator.[16][17][18] McTiernan agreed to direct on the condition that the film would have \"some joy\" and not simply contain \"mean, nasty acts\", seen in other terrorist films.[13] Stuart began working 18-hour days at his office at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, which left him exhausted and \"on edge\".[11] After an argument with his wife, he went for a drive and saw a box in his lane; unable to avoid it, he was forced to drive over it and discovered it to be empty. According to Stuart, he pulled over on the side of the freeway, his \"heart pounding\". From this, Stuart conceived a central theme of the story of a man who should have apologized to his wife before a catastrophe. He returned home to reconcile with his wife and wrote 35 pages that night.[11] To shape the McClanes' relationship, Stuart also drew upon the marital problems of his peers, including divorces and ex-wives reverting to use their maiden name.[11] John McClane was named John Ford initially, but 20th Century Fox felt this was disrespectful to the deceased director of the same name. Stuart chose McClane as a \"good strong Scottish name\", based on his own Celtic heritage. He described the character as a flawed hero who learns a lesson in the worst possible situation and becomes a better, but not a different, person.[11] Having no experience writing action films, Stuart drew on his experience writing thrillers, focusing on making the audience care about McClane, Holly, and their reconciliation.[11] As Stuart pitched his story to executives, Gordon interrupted him, told him to complete a draft, and left the meeting. Stuart finished his first draft just under six weeks later.[11] Stuart credits Levin for helping him understand Nothing Lasts Forever.[11] He adapted many sequences faithfully, including a C-4 charge being thrown down an elevator shaft and the book's central character, Joe Leland, leaping from the roof. However, the novel is told entirely from Leland's perspective, and events he is not present for are not detailed.[11][19][20] Its tone is also more cynical and nihilistic: Leland visits his drug-addicted daughter at the Klaxon building, and she dies having fallen from the building alongside villain Anton Gruber, who is using naïve male and female guerrilla soldiers to rob the building because of Klaxon's support for a dictatorial government. This made their motivations less clear and Leland more conflicted about killing them, especially the women. Leland is written as an experienced older man working as a high-powered security consultant.[11][18][20] Stuart rejected the novel's tone for being \"too sad\", and believed an older action hero—Leland being over 60—was nonsensical. Stuart created new material for scenes when McClane is not present, expanding upon or introducing characters: he gave Powell a wife and children, allowing him to relate more closely to McClane; and Argyle, whose novel counterpart disappears early in the story, is present throughout Stuart's draft, supporting McClane by broadcasting rap music over the terrorists' radios. Among the script's original characters is the unscrupulous journalist Richard Thornburg.[11] A fan of prominent Western film actor John Wayne, Stuart was inspired to carry a Western motif throughout the script, including cowboy lingo. He befriended a construction superintendent at the under-construction Fox Plaza in Los Angeles, allowing him access to the building to gain ideas on how to lay out the characters and scenes. He delivered the finished screenplay in June 1987. It was greenlit the following day, in part because 20th Century Fox needed a summer blockbuster for 1988.[11] As Die Hard was based on the novel sequel to the film adaptation of The Detective, the studio was contractually obliged to offer Frank Sinatra the role. Sinatra, who was 70 at the time, declined.[12][13][18] The role was offered to various major stars including Sylvester Stallone, Richard Gere, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford,[17][21] Burt Reynolds,[22] Nick Nolte, Mel Gibson, Don Johnson, Richard Dean Anderson,[12] Paul Newman,[23] James Caan,[24] and Al Pacino.[25] The prevailing action archetype of the era was a muscle-bound, invincible macho man like Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was offered the role, but he wanted to branch out into comedy and turned it down to star in Twins (1988).[12] Willis was known mainly for his comedic role in the romantic comedy television series Moonlighting, starring opposite Cybill Shepherd. He declined the role because of his contractual obligations to Moonlighting, but when Shepherd became pregnant, the show's production was stopped for eleven weeks, giving Willis enough time to take the role.[12] McTiernan's girlfriend had a chance meeting with a representative of CinemaScore and asked them for analysis of Willis as the star. Their analysis showed that casting Willis would not have a negative impact; his participation was confirmed two weeks later.[26] The choice was controversial as Willis had only starred in one other film, the moderately successful comedy Blind Date (1987).[12][27] At the time, there was also a clear distinction between film and television actors. Though films like Ghostbusters (1984) had demonstrated that television stars could lead a blockbuster film, other television actors like Shelley Long and Bill Cosby had failed in their recent attempts to make the transition.[17][28] Willis received $5 million for the role, giving him a salary comparable to more successful, established film actors like Dustin Hoffman, Warren Beatty, and Robert Redford.[16] 20th Century Fox president Leonard Goldberg justified the figure by saying Die Hard needed an actor of Willis's potential,[16] and Gordon said that Willis's everyman persona was essential to conveying the idea that the hero could actually fail.[29] Other Fox sources were reported as saying the studio was desperate for a star after being turned down by so many popular actors.[30] Willis said, \"They paid me what they thought I was worth for the film, and for them.\"[31] He described the character as unlike the larger-than-life characters portrayed by Stallone or Schwarzenegger, saying \"even though he's a hero, he is just a regular guy. He's an ordinary guy who's been thrown into extraordinary circumstances\".[27] Willis drew upon his working-class upbringing in South Jersey for the character, including \"that attitude and disrespect for authority, that gallows sense of humor, the reluctant hero\".[12] Rickman was already in his early 40s as he made his screen debut as Hans Gruber. He was cast by Silver, who had seen him perform in a Broadway version of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, playing the villainous Vicomte de Valmont.[12][32] Bedelia was cast at Willis's suggestion after he saw her in the 1983 biographical film Heart Like a Wheel.[33] VelJohnson appeared as Al Powell in his first major film role at the suggestion of casting director Jackie Burch, with whom he had worked previously. Robert Duvall, Gene Hackman, Laurence Fishburne, and Wesley Snipes were considered for the role.[34][35][36] Ellis is portrayed by Hart Bochner, an acquaintance of Silver. His role was shot in chronological order over three weeks. McTiernan had wanted the character to be suave like actor Cary Grant, but Bochner conceived of the character's motivations coming from cocaine use and insecurity. McTiernan hated the performance initially until he noticed Gordon and Silver were entertained by Bochner's antics.[37] Screenwriter Steven E. de Souza rewrote Stuart's script because he had experience in blending action and comedy.[38] He approached the story as if Gruber were the protagonist. He said, \"If [Gruber] had not planned the robbery and put it together, [McClane] would have just gone to the party and reconciled or not with his wife. You should sometimes think about looking at your movie through the point of view of the villain who is really driving the narrative.\"[19] De Souza used blueprints of Fox Plaza to help him lay out the story and character locations within the building.[38] The script continued to undergo changes up to and during filming. Several subplots and traits for characters other than McClane were created during the first few weeks of filming because Willis was still working on Moonlighting. He would film the show for up to ten hours and then work on Die Hard at night. McTiernan gave Willis time off to rest and tasked De Souza with adding the new scenes. These included scenes with Holly's housekeeper, Holly confronting Gruber following Takagi's death, an introductory scene for Thornburg, and more moments between Powell and his fellow officers.[38] Silver wanted a scene between McClane and Gruber before the film's denouement, but De Souza could not think of a plausible scenario until he happened to overhear Rickman affecting an American accent. He realized this would allow Gruber to disguise himself when he met McClane, and the earlier scene of Takagi's murder was reworked to conceal Gruber's identity from McClane. Due to the addition of the Gruber/McClane meeting scene, a different one in which McClane kills Theo was excised.[38] In Stuart's original script, Die Hard took place over three days, but McTiernan was inspired to have it take place over a single night like Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. He did not want to use terrorists as the villains, as he considered them to be \"too mean\", and avoided focusing on the terrorists' politics in favor of making them thieves driven by monetary pursuits; he felt this would make it more suitable summer entertainment.[39] McClane's character was not fully realized until almost halfway through production. McTiernan and Willis had determined that McClane is a man who does not like himself much but is doing the best he can in a bad situation.[39] McClane's catchphrase, \"Yipee-ki-yay, motherfucker\", was inspired by old cowboy lingo, including cowboy actor Roy Rogers's own \"Yippee-ki-yah, kids\", to emphasize his all-American character.[12][19] There was a debate over whether to use \"Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker\" or \"yippee-ti-yay, motherfucker\"; Willis endorsed the former.[12] Principal photography began in November 1987, and concluded by early March 1988, with an approximate $25–$35 million budget.[b][c] Filming took place almost entirely in and around Fox Plaza in Century City, situated on the Avenue of the Stars.[18][44][45] The location was chosen late in production by production designer Jackson De Govia.[39] A mostly unoccupied building was needed which the under-construction Fox Plaza offered;[44] it was secured with two main conditions: no filming during the day and no damage from explosions.[18] Cinematographer Jan de Bont said the building's design was distinct, making it a character on its own, and clear views of the building were available from a distance, enabling establishing shots as McClane approaches it. The surrounding city could be seen from within the building, enhancing the realism.[44] De Bont frequently used handheld cameras to film closer to the characters, creating a more cinematic \"intimacy\". Very little of the film was storyboarded beforehand because De Bont believed intricate storyboarding made his job redundant. Instead, he and McTiernan would discuss that day's filming in detail, and the feeling or sensation they wanted to convey. De Bont was more concerned with creating a dramatic rather than an attractive shot. He cited the use of real flares in the film that generated unpredictable smoke and sometimes obscured the image.[44] Willis's first day on set was on November 2, 1987. He came straight from filming Moonlighting to shoot one of his most pivotal scenes, where McClane leaps from a rooftop as it explodes behind him, saved only by a length of firehose.[12] Willis found acting in Die Hard difficult because it differed from previous experiences in that he was often alone, not having any personal encounters with others.[31] He did not spend much time with the rest of the cast between takes, opting to spend it with his new partner, Demi Moore. In contrast to their on-screen dynamics, Bedelia and VelJohnson spent most of their time between scenes with Rickman.[46][47] When asked to throw Holly to the floor, Rickman refused because he believed it was not a fitting action for the \"civilized\" Gruber and that Holly, \"a self-possessed career woman\", would not have let him.[48] The film's ending had not been finalized when filming began. In the finished film, Theo retrieves an ambulance from the truck the terrorists arrived in to use as an escape vehicle, but as this was a late addition, the truck the terrorists had been filmed arriving in was too small to hold an ambulance. Another scene, showing the terrorists synchronizing their TAG Heuer watches, also showed the truck was empty; this scene had to be deleted, leading to other necessary changes. As scripted, McClane realizes that the American hostage he encounters is Gruber because of the distinctive TAG Heuer watch he observed on the other terrorists; the watches were no longer an established plot point.[39][49] It necessitated the introduction of a heroic scene for Argyle, who gets to stop Theo's escape. De'voreaux actually punched Gilyard during the scene, which was added in only in the last 10 days of filming.[38][47] There was flexibility with some roles, depending on the actors' performances, meaning some characters were kept in the film longer and others killed off sooner.[38] The actors were also given some room to improvise, like Theo's line, \"The quarterback is toast\", Bochner's \"Hans, bubby, I'm your white knight\", and the henchman Uli stealing a chocolate bar during the SWAT assault.[37][47] McTiernan took stylistic influence from French New Wave cinema when editing the film. He recruited Frank J. Urioste and John F. Link to edit scenes together while in mid-motion, contrary to the mainstream style of editing used at the time.[50] Before hiring composer Michael Kamen, McTiernan knew he wanted to include Beethoven's 9th Symphony (commonly known as \"Ode to Joy\"), having heard it in Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (1971).[51] Kamen objected to \"tarnishing\" the piece in an action film and offered to misuse German composer Richard Wagner's music instead.[51][52] Once McTiernan explained how the 9th Symphony had been used in A Clockwork Orange to highlight the ultra-violence, Kamen had a better understanding of McTiernan's intentions.[51] In exchange, Kamen insisted that they also license the use of \"Singin' in the Rain\" (1952) (also used in A Clockwork Orange) and \"Winter Wonderland\" (1934).[52] He mixed the melodies of \"Ode to Joy\", \"Winter Wonderland\", and \"Singin' in the Rain\" into his score, mainly to underscore the villains.[50][53][52] The samples of \"Ode to Joy\" are played in slightly lower keys to sound more menacing; the references build to a performance of the symphony when Gruber finally accesses the Nakatomi vault.[52][54] The score also references \"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\".[55][56][53] Kamen initially saw a mostly incomplete version of Die Hard and was unimpressed.[52] He saw the film as primarily about a \"phenomenal bad guy\" who made McClane seem less important.[52] Kamen was dismissive of film scores, believing they could not stand alone from the film.[57] His original score incorporates pizzicato and arco strings, brass, woodwinds and sleigh bells added during moments of menace to counter their festive meaning.[56][54] There are other uses of classical diegetic music in the film; the musicians at the party play Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 by Johann Sebastian Bach.[54] McTiernan did not like a piece created for the final scene in which Karl attempts to kill McClane, and decided to use a temporary track that was already in place: a piece of James Horner's unused score for Aliens (1986). Cues are also used from the 1987 action film Man on Fire.[39][55] Die Hard also features \"Christmas in Hollis\" by Run-DMC, which would go on to be considered a Christmas classic, in part because of its use in the film.[58] The perception of film stunts changed shortly before production of Die Hard following a fatal accident on the set of Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), and a push was made to prioritize a film's crew over the film itself.[59] Even so, Willis insisted on performing many of his own stunts, including rolling down steps and standing on top of an active elevator.[12][44] The first scene he shot was his leap from the top of Nakatomi Plaza with a firehose wrapped around his waist. The stunt involved a 25-foot (7.6 m) leap from a five-story parking garage ledge onto an airbag as a 60-foot (18 m) wall of flame exploded behind him. He considered it to be one of his toughest stunts.[12][27] The explosive force pushed him towards the edge of the airbag and the crew was concerned he had died.[12] Stuntman Ken Bates stood in for Willis when his character is hanging from the building.[60] A set was used for the following scene where McClane shoots out a window to re-enter the building. It was shot approximately halfway into the filming schedule so that all involved had gained more stunt experience. The window was made of fragile sugar glass that took two hours to set up, and there were only a few takes for this reason. Instead of a hoist, a team of stuntmen positioned below the window dragged the hose and pulled Willis towards the edge, as they could better control Willis's fall if he went over.[59] Editor Frank Urioste kept the scene where McClane falls down a ventilation shaft and catches onto a lower opening; Willis's stuntman accidentally fell further than intended.[39] During a scene where McClane shoots a terrorist through a table, Willis suffered a permanent two-thirds hearing loss in his left ear caused by firing loud blank cartridges close to his head.[61][62] For Gruber's fall from Nakatomi Plaza, Rickman was dropped between 20 and 70 feet (6 and 21 m); reports are inconsistent.[39][44][63] He was suspended on a raised platform and dropped onto a blue screen airbag.[39][63] This allowed the background behind him to be composited with footage taken from Fox Plaza and falling confetti that looked like bearer bonds. Rickman had to fall backward onto the bag, something stuntmen avoid to control their fall.[63] McTiernan convinced Rickman by demonstrating the stunt himself and falling onto a pile of cardboard boxes.[59] Rickman was told he would be dropped on a count of three, but he was let go earlier to elicit a genuine look of surprise. McTiernan said, \"there's no way he could fake that\".[39][59] The first take was used, but McTiernan convinced Rickman to perform a second one as backup.[63] Capturing the stunt was difficult because it was impossible for a human operator to refocus the camera fast enough to prevent the image from blurring as Rickman fell away.[59] Supervised by visual effects producer Richard Edlund, Boss Film Studios engineered an automated system using a computer that rapidly refocused the camera via a motor on its focus ring.[63] A wide-angle lens camera shooting at 270 frames per second was used, creating footage that played 10 times slower than normal. Despite these innovations, the camera struggled to keep Rickman entirely in focus during his 1.5-second fall; the scene cuts away from Rickman as the usable footage runs out. To complete Gruber's fatal descent, Bates was lowered 318 feet (97 m) from Fox Plaza in a harness that slowed his fall as he neared the ground.[59][63][64] Some of the Fox Plaza residents, frustrated by the debris and destruction around the building, refused to turn off their office lights for exterior shots of the Plaza.[64] Months of negotiations took place for permission to drive a SWAT vehicle up the steps of Fox Plaza. A railing knocked over during shooting was never replaced.[39][45] Small explosives moving along a guidewire were disguised as the terrorist rockets, giving the appearance of them striking the vehicle. In the scene where McClane throws C4 down the elevator shaft to stop the assault, the effects team unwittingly blew out every window on one floor of the building.[44] The final helicopter scene took six months of preparation, and only two hours were set aside to film it. It took three attempts above Fox Plaza, and nine camera crews filming with twenty-four different cameras.[39][44] De Bont said the different angles enhanced the on-location realism.[44] Mortar-like devices filled with propane were used for explosions. They took ten minutes to install and offered a six-second burst of flame.[59] The explosion of the Nakatomi rooftop was created using a miniature model; this was the only miniature used in the film.[44] Because Hans Buhringer (Fritz) was an inexperienced actor and filming was behind schedule, a Native American stuntman was put in a blond wig and equipped with squibs to capture the character's death in one take.[47] To prevent the in-building locations looking similar because of the standard fluorescent office lighting, De Bont concealed small film lights in high locations. He controlled these to create more dynamic and dramatic lighting. This gave him the opportunity to use unusual light positioning. He also placed fluorescent tubes on the floor in one scene to indicate they had not been installed.[44] The shifting nature of the filming script meant some sets were designed before it was known what they were to be used for.[39] The Nakatomi Building's 30th floor—where the hostages are held—was one of the few sets.[38][39] It contained a recreation of the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house Fallingwater. De Govia reasoned that it reflected the contemporary trend of Japanese corporations buying up American corporate assets. An early design for the Nakatomi logo was too reminiscent of a swastika and it was re-designed to look closer to a samurai warrior's helmet. A 380-foot-long (120 m) matte painting provided the city backdrop as viewed from inside the building's 30th floor. It featured animated lights and other lighting techniques to present both moving traffic, daytime and nighttime.[39] The summer of 1988 was expected by film industry executives to be dominated by action and comedy films, although a broader range of films were released that year.[41][65] More films targeted older audiences rather than teenagers, a reflection of the increasing age of the average audience member.[65] Sequels to successful films, Crocodile Dundee II and Rambo III, were predicted to control the May box office and break opening weekend revenue records. Industry executives also had high expectations for the comedies Coming to America and Who Framed Roger Rabbit.[41] Expectations for Die Hard were low compared to its action film competition—the Schwarzenegger-starring Red Heat and Clint Eastwood's The Dead Pool. The New York Times noted that Die Hard, and the comedies Big Top Pee-wee and Bull Durham, would be closely scrutinized by the industry for success or failure. Die Hard was singled out for Willis's salary, and the failure earlier that year of his previous film, the western Sunset, which brought into question his leading man capabilities.[41] Lawrence Gordon agreed that not using a major action star like Stallone or Eastwood meant audience interest in Die Hard was lower than it might have been. The larger salaries paid to these stars were based on the built-in audience they could attract to a film's opening week, with good word of mouth supporting the film thereafter, but Willis did not have a built-in audience.[29] Willis featured prominently in the film's early marketing campaign, but it underwent several changes as the film's release date drew nearer.[21][29][66] Willis had developed a reputation as an \"arrogant\" actor concerned with his own fame. His refusal to address this, or speak about his personal life to the media, had reinforced this perception. For his part, Willis said that he wanted the media to focus on his acting.[31][67] There were reports that cinema audiences would moan at Willis's appearance in Die Hard trailers, and that a representative from an unnamed theater chain had pulled the trailer in response.[66] Research by several film studios revealed that audiences had a negative opinion of Willis overall and little or no interest in seeing him in Die Hard.[29] Newsweek's David Ansen called Willis \"the most unpopular actor ever to get $5 million for making a movie\".[17] As 20th Century Fox's confidence in Willis's appeal faltered, the film's posters were changed to focus on Nakatomi Plaza, with Willis's name billed in tiny print.[21][66] Willis's image was not included in the film's first full-page newspaper advertisement in mid-July.[29] 20th Century Fox executive Tom Sherak denied that Willis was being hidden, saying their marketing strategy had changed when they realized that the building was as important a character as the actor.[66] Defying expectations, sneak previews of the film were well received by audiences,[29] and the week following its release, the advertising began featuring Willis more prominently.[29] Despite his dislike of interviews, Willis appeared on several daytime shows to promote the film. Explaining why he was more involved in the promotion for Die Hard, Willis said, \"I'm so excited about this film... To me, it represents why I wanted to be an actor.\"[31][66] Die Hard's premiere took place on July 12, 1988, at the Avco theater in Los Angeles, California.[68] In North America, the film received a limited release in 21 theaters in 13 cities on July 15, 1988, earning $601,851—an average of $28,659 per theater.[69] It was considered a successful debut with a high per-theater average gross.[70] The Los Angeles Times said that the late change in advertising focus and diminishing popularity for action films should have worked against Die Hard. Instead, positive reviews and the limited release had made it a \"must-see\" film.[71] It received a wide release the following week on July 22, 1988, across 1,276 theaters, and earning $7.1 million—an average of $5,569 per theater. The film finished as the number three film of the weekend, behind Coming to America ($8.8 million)—in its fourth week of release—and Who Framed Roger Rabbit ($8.9 million), in its fifth.[72] The film fell to number four in its third week with a further gross of $6.1 million, just behind Coming to America ($6.4 million), Who Framed Roger Rabbit ($6.5 million) and the debuting romantic comedy Cocktail ($11.7 million).[73] In its fourth weekend, it rebounded to the number three position with $5.7 million.[74] While the film never claimed the number-one box office ranking, it spent ten straight weeks among the top five highest-grossing films.[17][74] In total, the film earned an approximate box office gross of between $81.3 million and $83 million.[75][76] This made it the seventh-highest-grossing film of 1988, behind Crocodile Dundee II ($109.3 million), buddy comedy Twins ($111.9 million), fantasy-comedy Big ($114.9 million), Coming to America ($128.1 million), Who Framed Roger Rabbit ($154.1 million) and comedy-drama Rain Man ($172.8 million).[77] Outside North America, Die Hard is estimated to have earned $57.7 million, giving it an approximate cumulative gross of between $139.1 million and $140.7 million.[75][76][d] This figure makes it the tenth-highest-grossing film worldwide of 1988 behind Big ($151 million), Cocktail ($171 million), A Fish Called Wanda ($177 million), Rambo III ($189 million), Twins ($216 million), Crocodile Dundee II ($239 million), Coming to America ($288 million), Who Framed Roger Rabbit ($329 million) and Rain Man ($354 million).[76][78][79][e] The summer of 1988 saw box office grosses totaling $1.7 billion, breaking the previous year's record-breaking summer by $100 million,[65] and it was the most successful summer since 1984, when only three films earned more than $100 million in North America.[80] Defying pre-release expectations Die Hard was considered an enormous success.[12][80] In a year otherwise dominated by comedy films, Die Hard's overperformance was an anomaly compared to other action films such as Rambo III and Red Heat, which failed to meet box office expectations.[15][81] Film critic Sheila Benson believed this demonstrated a generational shift in audiences and their tastes; in particular, 25- to 37-year-old men had turned against alcohol abuse, sexism, and mindless machismo.[82] Along with films like Big and Young Guns (1988), Die Hard is credited with revitalizing 20th Century Fox, which had had few successes in preceding years. It also showed the action genre was not \"dead\".[65] Initial critical reviews of Die Hard were mixed.[43] Audiences reacted more positively; polls by the market research firm CinemaScore found that audiences gave it an average rating of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale.[83] McTiernan's direction was praised.[2][84][85] In the Chicago Tribune, Dave Kehr wrote that McTiernan's \"logical\" direction created a sense of scale in the film that made it seem more significant than its content.[84] The scene in which the terrorists take over the building was described as a \"textbook study\" by Kevin Thomas, providing a strong introduction to both McTiernan's abilities and De Bont's cinematography.[2] De Govia's set design was complimented by Kehr as \"ingenious\".[84] Ebert praised the stunts and special effects.[86] Critics were conflicted over Willis's performance.[5][84][87] Many considered Die Hard Willis's breakout role, reviving his faltering transition from television to film star, and demonstrating his leading-man status and comedic range.[2][5][88] Kathy Huffhines and James Mills considered Willis's performance an evolution of his Moonlighting character David Addison with less sexism and more masculinity. Huffhines wrote that the performance improved as Willis hewed closer to his own working-class background.[89][90][91] Reviewers including Terry Lawson and Paul Willistein believed that despite expectations, Willis had been well cast, bringing a necessary vulnerability and sense of humor to a contemporary hero; one who displays remorse, fear, and indecision without being overly macho or comedic, and delivers dialogue that other action stars could not.[92] Marke Andrews argued that this vulnerability was essential to creating tension because audiences care about the character's fate.[93] Some reviewers felt that Willis's strongest talent—his comedic ability—had been woefully underutilized.[87][94] Writing for The Washington Post, Hal Hinson complimented Willis's \"grace and physical bravado\" that allowed him to stand alongside the likes of Stallone and Schwarzenegger. Conversely Vincent Canby said he lacked \"toughness\".[85][87] Reviewers generally agreed that Willis's dramatic acting was unimpressive or limited; Jay Boyar believed his abilities were perfect for McClane, although Kehr criticized him as only a television-level star.[84][95][96] Richard Schickel said Willis's performance was \"whiny and self-involved\", and that removing his undershirt by the film's denouement was the totality of his acting range. He acknowledged it was difficult to perform when acting only against special effects.[97] Rickman's performance was praised.[f] Caryn James said he was the film's best feature, portraying \"the perfect snake\",[3] and Hinson likened his work to the \"sneering\", malevolent performance by Laurence Olivier in Richard III (1955).[87] Kehr called Gruber a classic villain who combined the silliness of actor Claude Rains and the \"smiling dementia\" of actor George Macready.[84] Canby said that Rickman provided the only credible performance, and Roger Ebert—who was otherwise critical of the film—singled it out for praise.[86] Critics routinely praised Bedelia's performance and lamented that she was underused, in favor of McClane's and Powell's relationship.[g] Schickel highlighted a scene in which McClane confesses his sins to Powell before rescuing his wife, robbing their marital reunion of meaning.[97] Ebert and Schickel both felt that only McClane's and Powell's characters were developed.[87][97] The film's success was credited to the remote relationships built between Willis, Rickman, and Veljohnson, by Mike Cidoni.[91] Huffhines and Mills credited the performances with anchoring the film.[89][100][90] Ebert focused his criticism on the police captain (portrayed by Gleason), citing the character as an example of a \"willfully useless and dumb\" obstruction that wasted screen time and weakened the plot.[86] Thomas commended the casting of several minority actors.[2] The action and violence were criticized by many reviewers.[h] Kevin Thomas said the film had plot holes and lacked credibility. He believed it was the result of a calculated effort to please the broadest possible audience, and concluded that it had squandered its potential as an intelligent thriller for \"numbing\" violence and carnage.[2] Canby offered a similar sentiment, suggesting the film would appeal only to audiences that required a constant stream of explosions and loud noises. He described it as a \"nearly perfect movie for our time\", designed to appeal to audiences Canby described as \"kidults\"—adults with the mindset of children.[85] One violent scene, in which Powell saves McClane by shooting Karl, was singled out. Schickel believed it to be a cynical scene that undermined the humanity formed between McClane and Powell, by having Powell find redemption for his own mistakes through violence. Hinson believed the audience was deliberately manipulated into cheering for the act.[2][87][97] Writing for The New York Times, James said the film offered fun escapism while relying on action clichés, but Hinson countered that despite the relentless thrills, the film was not enjoyable.[87] Reviews identified allusions in Die Hard to films such as The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure (1972), Alien (1979), Aliens, and RoboCop (1987).[i] Kehr said Die Hard emulated Alien and RoboCop by developing a humorous and sentimental design that perfected the action genre, but in doing so it lacked a personality of its own.[84] Writing for the Poughkeepsie Journal, Cidoni felt Die Hard made previous action blockbusters such as Predator, Missing in Action (1984), and Rambo look like \"tupperware parties\".[91] Die Hard was one of several 1988 films labeled \"morally objectionable\" by the Roman Catholic Church, along with The Last Temptation of Christ, Bull Durham and A Fish Called Wanda.[101] Robert Davi saw the film with Schwarzenegger; Schwarzenegger was positive, but did not like Davi's character narrative, saying, \"You were heroic! And now you've turned into an idiot!\"[47] At the 1989 Academy Awards, Die Hard was nominated for Best Film Editing for Frank J. Urioste and John F. Link; Best Visual Effects for Richard Edlund, Al DiSarro, Brent Boates and Thaine Morris; Best Sound Effects Editing for Stephen Hunter Flick and Richard Shorr; and Best Sound for Don J. Bassman, Kevin F. Cleary, Richard Overton and Al Overton Jr.[102] Michael Kamen won a BMI TV/Film Music Award for his work on the score.[103] Die Hard was released on Video Home System (VHS) cassette in January 1989.[104] It was a popular rental, debuting as the third-most rented film on the early February rental charts, rising to number one the following week.[105][106][107][108] It spent six of its first seven weeks in release at number one until it was replaced by A Fish Called Wanda at the end of March.[105][109] By 1997, it was estimated to have earned $36 million from rentals.[110] Die Hard was released on DVD in 1999 as part of a collection with its sequels Die Hard 2 (1990) and Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995).[111][112] It was released separately as a special edition DVD in 2001, including commentary by McTiernan, De Govia, and Edlund, and deleted scenes, trailers and behind-the-scenes images.[113][114] It was released on Blu-ray in 2007.[115] Die Hard: The Nakatomi Plaza Collection was released in 2015, collecting all five Die Hard films on Blu-ray in a container shaped like Nakatomi Plaza.[116] For its 30th anniversary in 2018, a remastered 4K resolution version was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray; the set also includes a standard Blu-ray and digital download. A limited-edition SteelBook case version was also released.[117] Die Hard merchandise includes clothing, Funko Pops, coloring and activity books, crockery, Christmas jumpers and ornaments, and an illustrated Christmas book retelling the film.[118] A third-person shooter video game, Die Hard, was released in 1989 for the Commodore 64 and Windows. Different top-down shooter versions were released for the TurboGrafx-16 and the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The TurboGrafx-16 edition begins with McClane fighting terrorists in a jungle; the NES version offers a \"foot meter\" that slows McClane's movements after he repeatedly steps on shattered glass.[119][120] Die Hard Trilogy (1996), a popular game for the PlayStation, adapted the first three Die Hard films.[121][122] In 1997, the Japanese arcade game Dynamite Deka was redesigned and released in western territories as Die Hard Arcade. Players choose either McClane or secondary character Chris Thompsen to battle through Nakatomi Plaza, defeat terrorists led by White Fang, and rescue the President's daughter.[119][123] Two first-person shooters were released in 2002: Die Hard: Nakatomi Plaza, which recreates the events of Die Hard, and Die Hard: Vendetta, which serves as a narrative sequel to the film, pitting McClane against Gruber's son Piet.[119][121][123] Die Hard: The Ultimate Visual History—a book chronicling the development of the Die Hard film series—was released in 2018 to coincide with the film's 30th anniversary.[124] A board game based on the film was released in 2019. Developed by USAopoly, Die Hard: The Nakatomi Heist casts up to four players as McClane, Gruber, and his terrorists, each vying to complete their opposing tasks.[125][126] Die Hard has been described by critics such as Richard Brody and Chris Hewitt as a story about obtaining redemption through violence. McClane comes to Los Angeles to save his marriage, but makes the same mistakes that drove Holly away; Brody and Hewitt suggest that it is only after McClane defeats the terrorists through violence that their marriage is seemingly reconciled.[4][18] Similarly, Powell is haunted after accidentally shooting a child and finds redemption by drawing his gun to shoot Karl.[4] Several male characters who are driven by rage or ego suffer for it including the FBI agents, Karl, Ellis, and McClane who nearly loses Holly by showing off after shooting Gruber. Ebert notes the more even-tempered characters—often African American—fare better.[15] McClane identifies himself as a Roman Catholic, a religion requiring penance to earn redemption. Brody said that McClane endures physical punishment, including his feet being cut by glass shards to create bloody \"stigmata\". In making these sacrifices, he salvages his family. In this sense, McClane can be seen as a modern, working-class Christ-like figure.[4] Alexander Boon compares McClane violently reclaiming his wife to the Greek figure Odysseus slaughtering his wife's suitors. McClane is rewarded for his masculinity, despite demonstrating negative male traits.[127] Jeffrey Brown believed McClane's undershirt emphasizes his masculine physical form. This outfit is worn by other action characters like Rambo, and females displaying masculine traits such as Rachel McLish (Aces: Iron Eagle III) and Linda Hamilton (Terminator 2: Judgment Day).[128] Powell and Argyle are not McClane's physical equals but they prioritize relationships, and when called on to act, they succeed.[129] McClane possesses an imposing physicality but is clumsy and reliant on improvisation, and succeeds only because of the relationships with his allies.[129] It is McClane and Powell's relationship that is particularly instrumental to McClane's success. The pair share a non-romantic intimacy that enables McClane to confess his failings as a husband in a way he did not with Holly, allowing McClane to grow as a person.[130][131][132] Gruber fails because he is isolated, self-interested, and sacrifices his team for his own survival.[131] Peter Parshall observed that McClane and Gruber are reflections of each other.[131] Brody contrasts McClane—an all-American stereotype compared to Western cowboy stars like Roy Rogers, John Wayne and Gary Cooper—to Gruber, a classically educated, European villain who refers to America as a \"bankrupt\" culture.[4][18] Elizabeth Abele wrote that when compared to the superheroes of the previous decade in films like Superman (1978) and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), McClane is portrayed as physically but realistically masculine, conveying the idea of a \"real man\" who possesses independent, intrinsic strength.[133] According to Justin Chang and Mark Olsen, this can be seen as a response to Reaganism—the political positions of United States president Ronald Reagan—promoting values of the American dream, self-reliance, initiative, and technological advancement.[134][135] Willis believes that if given the choice, McClane would pass the responsibility of dealing with the terrorists onto anyone else, but he is ultimately compelled to serve as a reluctant hero.[12] When the character is introduced, he is wearing his wedding ring. Scott Tobias wrote this serves as a symbol of his marital commitment. Holly is presented as the opposite; she uses her maiden name and is not wearing her wedding ring. Instead, she is gifted a Rolex watch by her employers, serving as a symbol of her commitment to her job and the division in her marriage. When McClane unclasps the watch at the film's end to free Holly from Gruber's grasp, the totem of their separation is broken, and they appear to have reconciled.[132][136] Parshall describes the negative portrayals of female characters in Die Hard. They appear sexualized in pin-up posters, suggest drinking while pregnant, or are away from their families on Christmas Eve at a work function. Holly takes a position of authority following her boss's death, but that power is delegated to her by Gruber, and it is used in traditionally feminine ways, to care for her colleagues. Takagi is replaced in Holly's life with a different dominant male, McClane.[131] Darin Payne wrote that Die Hard reflects the contemporary decline of men as the main household earner as more women joined the workforce and blue-collar jobs were being lost to foreign countries. In response, an American cowboy saves the day, rescuing his captured wife from a foreign-owned tower.[137] Die Hard has elements that are anti-government, anti-bureaucracy and anti-corporation.[4][18][13] A terrorist asserts McClane cannot harm him because there are rules for policemen, rules he intends to exploit. McClane responds \"so my captain keeps telling me\", suggesting that he operates outside of bureaucratically approved procedures.[4][13] Brody wrote that the police often present a bigger obstacle than the terrorists. They believe they are in control of events, unaware the terrorists have already anticipated their every action.[4] The police chief is portrayed as incompetent, and the FBI is shown to be indifferent to the lives of the hostages as long as they kill the terrorists.[4][138] McClane is an everyman fighting against terrorists who are dressed like elite big-city workers.[18] As Ellis states, the only difference between the corporate employees and the terrorists is that he uses a pen and Gruber uses a gun.[131] The police, the FBI, and an intrusive journalist are each punished for standing in McClane's way.[18] Parshall noted the Christmas setting can be seen as an attack on traditional societal values. The corporation hosts a party on Christmas Eve, keeping employees away from their families, and the villains cynically appropriate Christmas iconographies. By defeating them, McClane upholds tradition and defends society.[131] Alongside the mainly German group of terrorists, Nakatomi Plaza is owned by a Japanese corporation, and the hostages are American.[4][137][139] Brody identified this as reflecting American anxieties about foreign powers at a time when Japanese technology firms threatened to dominate the American technology industry.[4][135][137] When McClane prevails, the suggestion is that American ingenuity will prevail.[139] America's old enemies, Germany and Japan, are portrayed as having forsaken their integrity in the pursuit of financial gain.[85] Dave Kehr said the film embodies a resentful 1980s \"blue-collar rage\" against feminists, yuppies, the media, the authorities and foreign nationals.[84] Brody notes that the film can also be considered progressive in its portrayal of its African American characters, as cast members VelJohnson, Gilyard, and White are featured in prominent and important roles.[4] The A.V. Club noted that unlike many other 1980s films, Die Hard is not an allegory for the Vietnam War. The film mocks the idea when one FBI agent remarks that their helicopter assault is reminiscent of the war; his partner responds that at the time he was only in middle school.[140] Even so, Empire believed the film references Vietnam by showcasing an ill-equipped local taking on highly equipped foreign invaders; this time America wins.[18] Drew Ayers described the complex layout of Nakatomi Plaza as analogous to the concealing jungles of Vietnam.[141] Before Die Hard's release, Hollywood action films often starred muscle-bound men like Schwarzenegger and Stallone, who portrayed invincible, infallible, catchphrase-spouting heroes in unrealistic settings. Willis's portrayal of John McClane redefined the action genre, presenting a normal person with an average physique completely counter to that archetype. He is failing, both personally and professionally, and serves as a vulnerable, identifiable hero who openly sobs, admits his fear of death, and sustains lasting damage. Importantly, his one-liners do not come from a place of superiority over his foes, but as a nervous reaction to the extreme situation in which he finds himself, which he is only able to overcome through enduring suffering and using his own initiative.[12][18][20][140] Similarly, Rickman's portrayal of Gruber redefined action villains who had previously been bland figures or eccentric madmen. Gruber ushered in the clever nemesis; he is an educated, intelligent villain, who serves as the antithesis of the hero.[18] He has been referred to as one of the most iconic villains in the genre.[140] Empire magazine called Gruber one of the finest villains since Darth Vader. Rickman described the role as a \"huge event\" in his life.[18] Though other more typical 1980s-style action films were released, the genre gradually shifted to a focus on smaller, more confined settings, everyman heroes, and charming villains with competent plans.[140] Die Hard raised Willis from television stardom to worldwide recognition and brought fame to Rickman.[12] Willis's salary was seen as the peak of the 1980s bidding wars between new and old managers vying for jobs. The New York Times described it as the salary equivalent of an \"earthquake\" and MGM/UA chairman Alan Ladd Jr. said that it threw \"the business out of whack ... like everybody else in town, I was stunned.\" It was seen as the most substantial change to salaries since Dustin Hoffman was paid $5.5 million to star in Tootsie (1982) at a time when top salaries ranged from $2 million–$3 million. It was expected that salaries for major stars would increase significantly to ensure they were paid more than a newer star like Willis.[16][142] McTiernan transitioned his success into directing an adaptation of one of his favorite novels, The Hunt for Red October (1990).[143] VelJohnson's performance resulted in his casting in the 1989–1998 sitcom Family Matters.[34] In 2017, Die Hard was selected by the United States Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[144][145] In July 2007, Bruce Willis donated the undershirt worn in the film to the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution.[146] The blood and sweat-stained shirt is considered iconic, an emblem of McClane's difference from archetypal, invincible heroes.[12] Fox Plaza has become a popular tourist attraction, although the building itself cannot be toured.[45] A floor used for filming became Ronald Reagan's office. When his head of staff toured the under-construction area, it was littered with broken glass and cartridge cases.[147] A giant mural depicting McClane's crawl through a Nakatomi Plaza vent was erected at the Fox Studio lot in Century City to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary in 2013.[148] One of the most influential films of the 1980s, Die Hard served as the blueprint for action films that came after, especially throughout the 1990s.[136] The term \"Die Hard on/in a...\" has become shorthand to describe a lone, everyman hero who must overcome an overwhelming opposing force in a relatively small and confined location.[12][136] Examples include: Under Siege (1992, \"Die Hard on a battleship\"); Cliffhanger (1993, \"Die Hard on a mountain\"); Speed (1994, \"Die Hard on a bus\"); and Air Force One (1997, \"Die Hard on a plane\").[12][136][140] Willis himself recalled being pitched a film that was \"Die Hard in a skyscraper\". He said he was sure it had already been done.[12] It was not until the 1996 action-thriller film The Rock (\"Die Hard on Alcatraz Island\"), that the tone of action films changed significantly, and the increasing use of CGI effects allowed films to move beyond the limitations of real locations and practical stunts. Writing for The Guardian in 2018, Scott Tobias observed that none of these later films readily captured the complete effectiveness of the Die Hard story.[136] The film has been a source of inspiration for filmmakers including: Lexi Alexander, Darren Aronofsky, Brad Bird, Joe Carnahan, Gareth Evans, Barry Jenkins, Joe Lynch, Paul Scheer, Brian Taylor, Dan Trachtenberg, Colin Trevorrow, and Paul W. S. Anderson.[149][150][151] During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was among the action films director James Gunn recommended people watch.[152] The film's popularity has seen it referenced across a wide variety of media, including TV shows, films; video games; music; and novels. It has even been referenced in media targeted at children.[148][153] Willis cameos as McClane in the 1993 parody film Loaded Weapon 1.[154] There has been much debate over whether Die Hard is a Christmas film. Those in favor argue that the Christmas setting is sufficient to qualify it as a Christmas film. Those opposed argue that it is an action film whose events happen to take place at Christmas.[155][156] A 2017 YouGov poll of over 5,000 UK citizens determined that only 31% believed that Die Hard is a Christmas film; those who did skewed under the age of 24, while those opposed were mainly over 50.[157][158] A similar 2018 Morning Consult poll of 2,200 American citizens determined that only 25% supported its status as a Christmas film. Those aged between 30 and 44, who were young during the peak of the film's popularity, were most in favor.[159] De Souza and Stuart support it being a Christmas film, while Willis feels it is not.[23][160][161][162] On the film's 30th anniversary in 2018, 20th Century Fox stated that it was \"the greatest Christmas story ever told\", releasing a re-edited Die Hard trailer that portrays it as a traditional Christmas film. According to De Souza, Silver predicted the film would be played at Christmastime for years.[162][163][164] Die Hard is now considered one of the greatest action films ever made.[165][166][167] On the film's 30th-anniversary in 2018, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Die Hard was easily one of the most influential films in the action genre, whose influence could still be seen in contemporary films.[168] The Guardian and the British Film Institute regard it as the \"quintessential\" American action film, the latter calling it one of the ten greatest action films of all time.[169][136] Deadline Hollywood labeled it a staple of the action genre, that launched a \"classic\" franchise.[170] Writing for Vanity Fair, K. Austin Collins said that despite the number of times he had viewed the film, it remained a persistently satisfying and well-crafted piece.[13] It is listed in the 2003 film reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, which says that the film \"...effectively redefines the action movie as one-man-army.\"[171] A retrospective review by The A.V. Club said that Willis's everyman persona is key to the film's success.[140] Rickman said he believed it had continued to find fans decades after its release because it was delivered with wit and style.[12] Contemporary review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes offers a 94% approval rating from the aggregated reviews of 84 critics, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The consensus reads, \"Its many imitators (and sequels) have never come close to matching the taut thrills of the definitive holiday action classic.\"[172] The film also has a score of 72 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[173] Readers of Rolling Stone ranked it the number ten action film of all time in a 2015 poll,[174] while Empire readers voted it number 20 in 2017.[175] In 2001, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Die Hard number 39 on its 100 Years... 100 Thrills list recognizing the most \"heart-pounding\" films.[176] In 2008, Empire ranked it number 29 on its list of the 500 Greatest Movies of all Time.[165] In 2014, The Hollywood Reporter's entertainment industry-voted ranking named it the eighty-third-best film of all time.[177] The film's characters have also been recognized. In 2003, the AFI ranked Hans Gruber number 46 on its 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains list.[178] In 2006, Empire ranked McClane number 12 on its list of its '100 Greatest Movie Characters'; Gruber followed at number 17.[32][179] Several publications have listed it as one of the greatest action films of all time, including: number one by Empire,[180] IGN[166] and Entertainment Weekly;[167] number 10 by Time Out New York;[181] number 14 by The Guardian;[182] number 18 by Men's Health[183] and unranked by Complex,[184] Esquire[185] and Evening Standard.[186] Adding to the debate over Die Hard's status as a Christmas film, it has appeared on several lists of the top holiday films, including at number one by Empire[187] and San Francisco Gate,[188] number four by Entertainment Weekly[189] and The Hollywood Reporter,[190] number five by Digital Spy,[191] and number eight in a Radio Times readers' poll.[192] The success of Die Hard spawned four film sequels, beginning with Die Hard 2 in 1990, which was rushed into production to capitalize on the original's popularity.[140][193] Stuart and McTiernan did not return for the film; McTiernan was replaced by Renny Harlin.[193] Die Hard 2 is the last film in the series to feature the involvement of De Souza, Bedelia, VelJohnson, Atherton, Silver, and Gordon. Silver and Gordon fell out with each other and Willis after filming concluded, delaying the production of a third film—Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995).[193][194][195] This sequel also took longer to develop because of the difficulty in scripting an original scenario that had not already been used by one of Die Hard's many imitators.[193][195] McTiernan returned to direct Die Hard with a Vengeance; his only other film in the series.[140] The film's plot pits McClane against Hans Gruber's brother, Simon (Jeremy Irons).[193] Live Free or Die Hard—also known as Die Hard 4.0—was released in 2007. In it, McClane teams up with a hacker (Justin Long) to fight cyber terrorists led by Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant).[8][196] The film was controversial for its studio-mandate to target younger audiences, requiring much of the violence and profanity prevalent in the rest of the series to be excluded.[196] Even so, it was financially and critically successful.[197] The fifth film in the series, A Good Day to Die Hard (2013), teams McClane up with his son Jack for an adventure in Moscow. The film was considered a financial success.[197][198] It was derided by critics and fans, and the negative reception stalled the franchise. A Good Day to Die Hard is considered the weakest entry in the series.[8][196][199] Although Willis expressed interest in a sixth and final film, plans for a prequel film were cancelled following the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney in 2019, and Willis retired from acting in 2022, after being diagnosed with aphasia, a condition which affects his ability to communicate.[193][200][201] Die Hard remains the most critically acclaimed film in the series based on aggregated reviews.[202] As the sequels progressed, they increasingly hewed closer to the 1980s-style action films Die Hard had eschewed, McClane becoming an invincible killing machine surviving damage that would have killed his original incarnation.[20][203] NPR called Die Hard a \"genuinely great\" movie whose legacy has been tarnished by lackluster sequels.[204] According to The Guardian, the evolution of the action genre can be tracked by the differences in each Die Hard sequel, as McClane evolves from human into a superhuman.[136] A comic book prequel and sequel have been released: Die Hard: Year One is set in 1976 and chronicles McClane as a rookie officer; A Million Ways to Die Hard is set 30 years after Die Hard, and features a retired McClane seeking out a serial killer.[205][206]",

The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, an arena they share with the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League.[10] The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA with 17 championships, the second most in the league behind the Boston Celtics.[11] The franchise began in 1946 as the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL).[12] After one season, a new ownership relocated the team to Minneapolis, Minnesota,[13][12] and renamed the team as the Minneapolis Lakers.[14] The Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America, where they won the 1949 BAA championship. Following the merger of the NBL and the BAA into the NBA in 1949, the Lakers won four of the next five NBA championships.[15] After struggling financially in the late 1950s, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season. The Lakers made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost every series to the Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain, and won their sixth NBA title in 1972, led by coach Bill Sharman. After the retirement of Chamberlain, the team traded for superstar Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Two big changes came in 1979, first, Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers, and pioneered a vision of basketball as entertainment as well as sport.[16] Second, the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson first overall in the 1979 NBA draft. The combination of Johnson, a prodigy point guard, and dominant center in Abdul-Jabbar provided the Lakers with superstars to anchor their roster. The promotion of head coach Pat Riley in 1981 and addition of forward James Worthy through the 1982 draft established the Lakers as an NBA powerhouse throughout the 1980s. The franchise won five championships in a nine-year span, including two out of three marquee Finals matchups against the Celtics. The Lakers were defeated by their Boston archrivals in the 1984 Finals, but triumphed over them in 1985 and 1987. After Riley departed and Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, and Worthy retired, the Lakers struggled in the early 1990s. It was not until 1996 when the team traded with the Charlotte Hornets for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant and signed center Shaquille O'Neal that the Lakers returned to dominance during the early 2000s. The superstar duo, along with Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, led the Lakers to three consecutive championships between 2000 and 2002, securing the franchise's second \"three-peat\".[17] The dynamic \"Shaq-and-Kobe\" era ended when the Lakers traded away O'Neal after the team lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 Finals. It was not until the Lakers traded for Pau Gasol that Bryant and Jackson returned to the NBA Finals, losing to the Celtics in 2008 but winning championships in 2009 and 2010. The 2010 Finals marked the latest matchup of the Lakers and Celtics, with Los Angeles winning its 16th title. Jackson retired in 2011, and the Lakers endured their longest playoff drought in franchise history. Gasol departed in 2014, and Bryant retired in 2016. After rebuilding seasons with young, highly rated prospects, the Lakers signed superstar LeBron James in 2018.[18] In 2019, the team traded several of those prospects for star big man Anthony Davis.[19] The Lakers—led by James, Davis, and coach Frank Vogel—won the team's 17th championship in 2020, tying the Celtics for the most titles until 2024.[20] The Lakers hold the record for NBA's longest winning streak, 33 straight games, set in 1971–72.[21] 26 Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles, while four have coached the team. Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, O'Neal, and Bryant won a combined eight NBA MVP awards with the Lakers.[22] The franchise was founded in 1946 as the Detroit Gems and played in the National Basketball League (NBL) during the 1946–47 season where it finished last in the league with only 4 wins in 44 games. Though the team was scheduled to continue in the NBL the following season,[23] its ownership, faced with high losses due to low attendance and lack of homecourt, decided on selling the team to Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota for $15,000[13][24] Minneapolis sportswriter Sid Hartman played a key behind-the-scenes role in helping put together the deal and later the team.[25] Inspired by Minnesota's nickname, \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\", the team rechristened themselves the Lakers.[26][27] Hartman helped them hire John Kundla from College of St. Thomas, to be their first head coach, by meeting with him and selling him on the team.[28][29] As the franchise had the worst record in the NBL the previous season, it got the first pick in the 1947 Professional Basketball League of America dispersal draft, which they used to select George Mikan. Led by Mikan, the Lakers had a solid roster, which also featured forward Jim Pollard and playmaker Herm Schaefer.[30] In their first season, they led the league with a 43–17 record, later winning the NBL championship that season.[31] In 1948, the Lakers moved from the NBL to the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and Mikan's 28.3 point per game (ppg) scoring average set a BAA record. In the 1949 BAA Finals they won the championship, beating the Washington Capitols four games to two.[32] Following the season, the BAA and the NBL merged to form the National Basketball Association (NBA).[33] In the newly formed league, the Lakers improved to 51–17 record and won their third straight professional championship.[34] In the 1950–51 season, Mikan won his third straight scoring title at 28.4 ppg and the Lakers went 44–24 to win their second straight division title.[35] One of those games, a 19–18 loss against the Fort Wayne Pistons, became infamous as the lowest scoring game in NBA history.[36] In the playoffs, they defeated the Indianapolis Olympians in three games but lost to the Rochester Royals in the next round.[30] During the 1951–52 season, the Lakers won 40 games, finishing second in their division.[37] They faced the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals, which they won in seven games.[38] In the 1952–53 season, Mikan led the NBA in rebounding, averaging 14.4 rebounds per game (rpg), and was named MVP of the 1953 NBA All-Star Game.[35] After a 48–22 regular season, the Lakers defeated the Fort Wayne Pistons in the Western playoffs to advance to the NBA Finals.[38] They then defeated the New York Knicks to win their second straight championship.[39] Though Lakers star George Mikan suffered from knee problems throughout the 1953–54 season, he was still able to average 18 ppg.[40] Clyde Lovellette, who was drafted in 1952, helped the team win the Western Division.[40] The team won its third straight championship in the 1950s and sixth in seven seasons when it defeated the Syracuse Nationals in seven games.[39] Following Mikan's retirement in the 1954 off-season, the Lakers struggled but still managed to win 40 games. Although they defeated the Rochester Royals in the first round of the playoffs, they were defeated by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the semifinals.[41] Although they had losing records the next two seasons, they made the playoffs each year.[37] Mikan came back for the last half of the 1955–56 season, but struggled and retired for good after the season.[42] Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956–57. The Lakers had one of the worst seasons in team history in 1957–58 when they won a league-low 19 games.[43] They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace Kundla. Mikan was fired in January when the team was 9–30, and Kundla was rehired.[37][44] The Lakers earned the top pick in the 1958 NBA draft and used it to select Elgin Baylor. Baylor, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year and co-MVP of the 1959 NBA All-Star Game, averaged 24.9 ppg and 15.0 rpg helping the Lakers improve to second in their division despite a 33–39 record.[45] After upsetting the Hawks in six games in the division finals, they returned to the NBA Finals, but were swept by the Celtics, beginning their long rivalry.[46] In their last year in Minneapolis, the Lakers went 25–50. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and traveling to St. Louis when their plane crash-landed.[49] Snow storms had driven the pilot 150 miles off course when he was forced to land in a cornfield. No one was hurt.[50] Their record earned them the number two pick in the 1960 NBA draft. The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia University.[51] During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles.[52] Led by Baylor's 34.8 ppg and 19.8 rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the year before in West's first season.[53] On November 15 that season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks while grabbing 25 rebounds.[54] In doing so, Baylor broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers made the playoffs.[37] They came within two points of the NBA Finals when they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.[55] Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8 ppg respectively,[56] the Lakers improved to 54–26 in 1961–62, and made the finals. In a game five victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61,[57] despite fouling out of the game.[58] The Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven.[56] Frank Selvy, after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game,[59][60] missed a potential game-winning 18 foot jump shot in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later.[60] Los Angeles won 53 games in 1962–63, behind Baylor's 34.0 ppg and West's 27.1 ppg[61] but lost in the NBA Finals in six games to the Celtics.[61] After falling to 42–38 and losing in the first round of the 1964 NBA playoffs to the Hawks, the team won 49 games in 1964–65. The Lakers surged past the Baltimore Bullets in the division finals, behind West's record-setting 46.3 ppg in the series.[62] They lost again to the Celtics in the Finals however, this time in five games.[63] Los Angeles lost in the finals to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points.[64] Down by 16 entering the fourth quarter, and 10 with a minute and a half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments, which fell just short.[65] After dropping to 36 wins and losing in the first round of the 1967 NBA playoffs, they lost in the finals to the Celtics again in 1968.[37] Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. On July 9, 1968, the team acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers.[67] In his first season as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league-leading 21.1 rpg.[68] West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, and Los Angeles won their division.[69] The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston for the first time in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry West's 53 points,[70] and had a 3–2 lead after five.[71] Boston won the series in seven games however,[72] and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons.[73] West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award.[74] In 1970, West won his first scoring title at 31.2 ppg, the team returned to the finals, and for the first time in 16 years, they did not have to face the Celtics; instead playing the New York Knicks, who defeated them 4–3.[75][76] The next season the Lakers were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks, led by future Laker Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in the Western Conference Finals.[77] The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner Jack Kent Cooke brought in Bill Sharman as head coach,[78] and Elgin Baylor announced his retirement early in the season after realizing that his legs were not healthy enough.[78] Sharman increased the team's discipline.[79] He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots.[80] They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December.[78] They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104.[81] By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in major American professional team sports.[82][83] The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96.[84] Chamberlain averaged a low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game.[85] West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game.[85] The team failed to score 100 points just once all year,[86] and at the end of the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year.[87] The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.[88][89] The Lakers won 60 games in the 1972–73 season, and took another Pacific Division title.[90] Wilt Chamberlain, playing in his final season, again led the league in rebounding and set the NBA record for field-goal percentage at 72.7% which stood for several decades.[90] The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven games in the conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals.[90] They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.[91] During the 1973–74 season, the team was hampered by the loss of West, who played only 31 games before his legs gave out.[92] Goodrich, averaging 25.3 points, helped the team to a late-season surge.[92] Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division.[92] They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.[93] After missing the playoffs in the 1974–75 season, the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVPs by that time.[94] Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade to either New York or Los Angeles.[95] He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played.[96] The Lakers struggled in January, going 3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.[96] West and Cooke settled their differences—and the former Laker's lawsuit—and Cooke hired him to replace Sharman as the team's coach.[97] West became upset, however, when Cooke refused to spend the money necessary to acquire forward Julius Erving, who the Nets were selling.[98] Behind another MVP season from Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles won the Pacific Division, finishing the 1976–77 season a league-best 53–29.[99] They defeated the Warriors in a seven-game series to open the postseason before being swept by Portland in the Western Conference Finals.[96] During the off-season, Los Angeles picked up Jamaal Wilkes from Golden State and signed first-round draft pick Norm Nixon. In the first two minutes of the first game of the 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar punched Bucks center Kent Benson for an overly aggressive elbow and broke his hand.[100] Two months later, a healthy Abdul-Jabbar got into an altercation with Houston Rockets center Kevin Kunnert after a rebound. The team's starting power forward, Kermit Washington, who was averaging 11.5 points and 11.2 rebounds,[101] entered the fight, and when Rudy Tomjanovich ran in from the bench to break up the action, Washington punched him in the face.[102] Tomjanovich nearly died from the punch, suffering a fractured skull and other facial injuries, which prematurely ended his playing career.[103] Washington, who stated that he assumed Tomjanovich was a combatant, was suspended for two months by the NBA, and released by the Lakers.[104] The team won 45 games despite being down a starter in Washington and not having Abdul-Jabbar for nearly two months, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to Seattle.[105] During the 1978–79 season, the team posted a 47–35 record but lost to the SuperSonics in the semifinal round of the playoffs.[96] In the 1979 NBA draft, Los Angeles selected 6-foot, 9-inch point guard Magic Johnson from Michigan State with the first overall pick.[106] It took Johnson's teammates time to acclimate themselves to his passing ability, as his \"no-look\" passes often caught them unaware. Once they adjusted, his passing became a key part of Los Angeles' offense.[107] The Lakers won 60 games in Johnson's rookie year, and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals. Johnson won the Finals MVP award, after starting at center for the injured Abdul-Jabbar in game six, and tallying 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists.[108] The team fell off in the 1980–81 season, though, as the Lakers lost Johnson for most of the season to a knee injury.[109] The team turned in a 54–28 record and finished second behind the Phoenix Suns in the Pacific Division.[109] The Rockets, led by Moses Malone, defeated Los Angeles in the first round of the playoffs.[109] Early in the 1981–82 season, Johnson complained to the media about head coach Paul Westhead and demanded a trade.[110] Westhead was fired shortly after Johnson's criticisms, and although Lakers' owner Jerry Buss stated that Johnson's comments did not factor into the decision, Johnson was vilified by the national media and booed both on the road and at home.[111][112][113] Buss promoted assistant coach Pat Riley to \"co-head coach\" with Jerry West (although West considered himself Riley's assistant) on November 19 and the team won 17 of its next 20 games.[109][114][115] Nicknamed \"Showtime\" due to the team's new Johnson-led fast break-offense, the Lakers won the Pacific Division title and swept both the Suns and Spurs in the 1982 playoffs.[116] Los Angeles stretched its postseason winning streak to nine games by taking the first contest of the NBA Finals from the 76ers.[109][117] The team won the Finals 4–2 to finish a 12–2 playoff run.[109] On draft night in 1982, the Lakers had the first overall pick (the result of a trade with Cleveland midway through the 1979–80 season, when the Lakers had sent Don Ford and a 1980 first-round pick to the Cavaliers for Butch Lee and their 1982 selection) and selected James Worthy from North Carolina.[118] The Lakers won the Pacific Division at 58–24, but Worthy suffered a leg injury in the last week of the season and missed the rest of the season.[119] Nevertheless, they advanced to play Philadelphia in the 1983 NBA Finals after defeating Portland and San Antonio.[119] The Sixers, however, won the series and the championship in four games.[118] After the season West replaced Sharman as the team's GM.[120] In the 1983–84 season, Los Angeles went 54–28, and played Boston in the Finals for the first time since 1969.[121] The Lakers won two of the first three games. However, Kevin McHale's hard clothesline foul of Lakers forward Kurt Rambis on a fast break is credited as a turning point of the series.[122] Boston won three of the next four to win the title and send Los Angeles's record to 0–8 in Finals series against the Celtics.[121] Using the past year's Finals defeat as motivation, the team won the Pacific Division for the fourth straight year and lost just two games in the Western Conference playoffs. In the NBA Finals, the Celtics were again the Lakers' final hurdle. Los Angeles lost game one of the NBA Finals by a score of 148–114, in what is remembered as the \"Memorial Day Massacre\".[123] The Lakers, behind 38-year-old Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar, recovered to defeat the Celtics in six games.[124] The team won the title in the Boston Garden and became the first visiting team to ever win an NBA championship in Boston, as the Golden State Warriors later achieved this feat in 2022.[123] In the 1985–86 season, the Lakers started 24–3 and went on to win 62 games and their fifth straight division title.[126] The Rockets, however, defeated the Lakers in five games in the Western Conference Finals. Houston won the series when Ralph Sampson hit a 20-foot jumper as time expired in game five at The Forum.[126] Prior to the 1986–87 season, the Lakers moved A.C. Green into the starting lineup, and acquired Mychal Thompson from the Spurs.[127] Johnson won his first career MVP Award while leading the Lakers to a 65–17 record,[127] and Michael Cooper was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year.[127] Before the season, Riley had made the decision to shift the focus of the offense to Johnson over the 40-year-old Abdul-Jabbar.[128] The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals by sweeping the Nuggets, defeating the Warriors in five games, and sweeping the SuperSonics in the Western Conference Finals.[129] The Lakers defeated Boston in the first two games of the Finals, and the teams split the next four games, giving Los Angeles their second championship in three seasons.[127] The series was highlighted by Johnson's running \"baby hook\" shot to win game four at Boston Garden with two seconds remaining.[130] Johnson was named the NBA Finals MVP, in addition to regular season MVP.[131] At the Lakers' championship celebration in Los Angeles, coach Riley brashly declared that Los Angeles would repeat as NBA champions,[127] which no team had done since the 1968–69 Boston Celtics. Looking to make good on Riley's promise in the 1987–88 season, the Lakers took their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title with a 62–20 record. They swept the Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Finals before pulling out a tough seven-game series win over the Utah Jazz led by youngsters Karl Malone and John Stockton. A seven-game Western Conference finals win over the Dallas Mavericks propelled the Lakers to the NBA Finals once again. In their seventh trip to the Finals in nine years, they met the Detroit Pistons. Los Angeles would take the series in seven games, and James Worthy's game seven triple-double earned him a Finals MVP award.[132] The win marked their fifth title in nine years, but would also mark their last title until 2000. In the 1988–89 season, Los Angeles won 57 games and their eighth consecutive Pacific Division crown. They swept through the playoffs defeating Portland, Seattle, and Phoenix. In an eighth trip to the NBA Finals in 10 years, they once again faced the Detroit Pistons.[133] Hampered by injuries to Byron Scott and Johnson, the Lakers were swept by Detroit.[134] Following the 1989 Finals, on June 28, 1989, after 20 professional seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar announced his retirement. The Lakers still cruised through the Pacific Division, winning their ninth consecutive division crown with a 63–19 record. However, after beating the Rockets in the first round, they lost four games to one in the second round of the playoffs to the Suns.[135] Riley announced he was stepping down after the season citing burnout,[136] and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy.[137] Riley's departure received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had grown tired of his intense practices and felt he tried to take too much credit for the team's successes.[138] Following the season, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request.[139] The 1990–91 Lakers failed to win the Pacific Division for the first time in 10 years, but still finished with a 58–24 record. After cruising through the Western Conference playoffs, the Lakers found themselves in the NBA Finals once again, their ninth trip to the Finals in 12 years. The 1991 Finals represented a changing of the guard as the Lakers were defeated in five games by the Chicago Bulls, led by superstar Michael Jordan.[140] On November 7, 1991, Magic Johnson announced he had tested positive for HIV and would retire immediately.[141] In their first season without Johnson, the team won 43 games to earn the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoffs.[37] The Lakers were defeated in the first round by Portland. Following the season, head coach Mike Dunleavy was fired. The Lakers would lose 43 games in 1992–93 under Randy Pfund, their first losing season since 1976. The Lakers would still make the playoffs, and would become the first eighth seed to win the opening two games on the road against a number one seed when they took a 2–0 lead against Phoenix.[142] They lost the next two games at home however, then game five in Phoenix in overtime.[142] During the 1993–94 season, Pfund was fired during the season that would result in the Lakers failing to make the playoffs for the first time since 1976. Magic Johnson, would coach the final 16 games of the season with former teammate Michael Cooper as his lead assistant.[143] Johnson decided not to take the job permanently due to what he felt was a lack of commitment from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing streak to finish 33–49.[144][145] Under new coach Del Harris, Los Angeles made the playoffs each of the next two seasons but was eliminated in the second and first rounds respectively.[146][147] The team was led by young guards Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones.[148] Johnson came out of retirement to return as a player in the 1995–96 season to lead the then 24–18 Lakers to a 29–11 finish.[149] After some run-ins with Van Exel, displeasure with Harris's strategies, and a first-round loss to the Rockets, Johnson decided to retire for the final time after the season.[150] During the 1996 off-season, the Lakers acquired 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th overall out of Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in that year's draft, by Charlotte. Los Angeles also signed free-agent Shaquille O'Neal.[151] Trading for Bryant was West's idea, and he was influential in the team's signing of the all-star center.[152] \"Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers\", O'Neal later said.[153] They used their 24th pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher.[154] During the season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos to Phoenix for Robert Horry.[155] O'Neal led the team to a 56–26 record, their best effort since 1990–91, despite missing 31 games due to a knee injury.[156] O'Neal averaged 26.2 ppg and 12.5 rpg and finished third in the league in blocked shots (2.88 bpg) in 51 games.[156][157] The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs as O'Neal scored 46 points in Game 1 against the Trail Blazers, marking the highest single-game playoff scoring output by a Laker since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics in 1969.[156] In the next round, the Lakers lost in five games to the Utah Jazz.[156] In the 1997–98 season, O'Neal and the Lakers had the best start in franchise history, 11–0.[158] O'Neal would miss 20 games on the season due to an abdominal injury.[158] Los Angeles battled Seattle for the Pacific Division title most of the season. In the final two months, the Lakers won 22 of their final 25 games,[158] finishing 61–21, but still finished second to Seattle in the standings.[158] The Lakers defeated Portland three games to one in the first round to advance to face Seattle. Although the Sonics won the first game, the Lakers responded with four straight wins, taking the series,[158] but were swept by the Jazz in the Western Conference Finals.[158] During the 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell were traded to the Charlotte Hornets.[159] The team also acquired J. R. Reid, B. J. Armstrong, and Glen Rice.[160] Head coach Del Harris was fired in February after a three-game losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former Laker Kurt Rambis.[161] The team finished 31–19 in the strike-shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference.[162] The Lakers defeated Houston in the first round of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round. Game four of the series would be the last game ever played at the Great Western Forum.[163] Before the 1999–2000 season, West was prepared to hire Rambis as the team's full-time coach before an outcry from fans and members of the organization caused him to seek out a bigger name.[164] Los Angeles hired former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who had coached that team to six championships, and gave him a lucrative $6 million a year contract.[165] He brought along assistant Tex Winter and they installed Winter's version of the triangle offense.[166] The Lakers signed veterans Brian Shaw, John Salley, Ron Harper, and A.C. Green, who was a Laker during the \"Showtime\" era.[155] The team also moved to a new arena, the Staples Center.[167] Led by league MVP O'Neal, the Lakers won 31 of their first 36 games.[168] They finished 67–15, the highest win total since they won 65 in the 1986–87 season.[168] Then eliminated Sacramento and Phoenix in the first two rounds of the playoffs.[169] After the Lakers took a three games to one lead in the Western Conference Finals against Portland, the Trail Blazers won the next two games to force a game seven.[170] The Lakers, who trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter, would go on 19–4 run to tie the game and eventually win 89–84 to advance to the NBA Finals.[170] In their first trip to the Finals since 1991, the Lakers defeated Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers four games to two win their first title since 1988.[171] West retired from his spot in the team's front office after the season after a power struggle between him and Jackson over control of the team's operations.[172] After the season, starters Rice and Green left the team,[173] and Los Angeles signed Horace Grant.[174] The following season, the Lakers won 11 fewer regular season games than the prior year,[175] but swept the first three rounds of the playoffs, defeating the Portland, Sacramento, and San Antonio.[176] They met Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals. Although the Sixers took game one in overtime,[177] the Lakers won the next four games to win their second straight title. Their 15–1 postseason record was the best in NBA history.[178] The Lakers won 58 games in 2001–02. In the playoffs, they swept Portland and defeated San Antonio four games to one to advance to the Western Conference Finals to face Sacramento.[181] The series would go on to be known as one of the greatest playoff matchups in NBA history. The series extended to all seven games and ended in a Lakers victory.[182] In game one, Bryant scored 30 points as the Lakers won, 106–99. The series would then shift in Sacramento's favor, with the Kings winning the next two games. Facing a deficit in game 4, the Lakers had the ball with under 20 seconds to play. After misses by both Bryant and O'Neal, Kings center Vlade Divac tapped the ball away from the rim in an attempt to wind down the clock. It went straight into Robert Horry's hands, who drained a game-winning three with under three seconds to play. After the Kings won game five on a buzzer-beater by Mike Bibby, the Lakers were faced with a must-win game six. In one of the most controversial playoff games in league history (Tim Donaghy's betting scandal), the Lakers would win by four points.[183] The Lakers went on to win game seven in overtime, with the Kings missing numerous potentially game-saving shots and free throws. The Lakers then achieved a three-peat by sweeping Jason Kidd and the New Jersey Nets in the NBA Finals.[184] O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP awards, making him the only player besides Michael Jordan to win three consecutive Finals MVPs.[185] The Lakers would attempt a four-peat the following year, but started the 2002–03 season 11–19.[186] However, they finished the season 39–13 to finish 50–32.[187] They defeated Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, but the four-peat attempt ended as they were eliminated by San Antonio in six games in the second round.[188] During the 2003–04 season, the team was the subject of intense media coverage generated by the teaming of four stars and the sexual-assault case involving Kobe Bryant.[189][190] Before the season, the Lakers signed two-time MVP Karl Malone formerly of the Jazz, and former Seattle Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton to join O'Neal and Bryant,[191] forming the first \"superteam\" of the 21st century.[192][193] Three of the \"big four\", however, struggled with injuries: O'Neal suffered from a strained calf, Malone an injured knee, and Bryant an injured shoulder.[194][195] The Lakers started 18–3 and finished 56–26 and won the Pacific Division title, entering the playoffs as the No. 2 seed. They defeated Houston, San Antonio, and Minnesota to advance to the NBA Finals.[196] In the Finals, they would lose to Detroit in five games. During the 2004 off-season, the team entered a rebuilding phase when O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, Caron Butler, and a first-round draft pick.[197] Bryant and O'Neal had clashed in the past,[198] and the media credited their feud as one of the motivating factors for the trade.[199] Jackson did not return as head coach, and wrote a book about the team's 2003–04 season, in which he heavily criticized Bryant and called him \"uncoachable\".[200][201][202] The Lakers front office said that the book contained \"several inaccuracies\".[203] The Lakers also traded Rick Fox and Gary Payton to Boston, for Chris Mihm, Marcus Banks, and Chucky Atkins before the 2004–05 season.[204] Derek Fisher, frustrated with losing playing time, opted out of his contract and signed with the Warriors.[204] The team hired Rudy Tomjanovich to replace Jackson.[204] After sitting out the first half of the 2004–05 season, Malone announced his retirement on February 13, 2005.[205] Tomjanovich coached the team to a 22–19 record before resigning due to health problems.[206] Assistant Frank Hamblen was named interim head coach to replace Tomjanovich for the remainder of the season.[207] Bryant (ankle) and Odom (shoulder) suffered injuries, and the Lakers finished 34–48, missing the playoffs for only the fifth time in franchise history and the first time since 1994.[37] With the tenth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft, the Lakers selected Andrew Bynum, a center from St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey.[208] The team also traded Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins to Washington for Kwame Brown and Laron Profit.[209] Jackson returned to coach the team after Rudy Tomjanovich resigned midway through the previous season.[210] On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points against Toronto, the second-highest total in NBA history.[211] Ending the season 45–37, the team made the playoffs after a one-season absence.[212] After taking a three games to one lead in the first round, Phoenix came back to take the series in seven games.[213] In the following season, the Lakers won 26 of their first 39 games,[214] but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40.[214] They were eliminated in the first round by Phoenix again.[214] Frustrated by the team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the off-season.[215] Buss initially agreed to seek a trade,[216] but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.[217] After re-acquiring Derek Fisher, the Lakers started the 2007–08 season with a 25–11 record, before Andrew Bynum, their center who was leading the league in field-goal percentage, went out for the year due to a knee injury in mid-January.[218] In what would become a crucial transfer for the franchise's return to championship form, they acquired the six-time all-star power forward Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade in early February and went 22–5 to finish the season.[219] The Lakers' 57–25 record earned them the first seed in the Western Conference.[220] Bryant was awarded the league's MVP award, becoming the first Laker to win the award since O'Neal in 2000.[221][222] In the playoffs, they defeated the Nuggets in four games, the Jazz in six, and the defending champion Spurs in five, but lost to the Celtics in six games in the NBA Finals.[223] In the 2008–09 season, the Lakers finished 65–17; the best record in the Western Conference.[224] They defeated the Jazz in five games, the Rockets in seven and the Nuggets in six, to win the Western Conference title. They then won their 15th NBA championship by defeating the Orlando Magic in five games in the NBA finals.[225] Bryant was named the NBA Finals MVP for the first time in his career.[226] The Lakers, who had added Ron Artest (Metta World Peace)[227] in place of Trevor Ariza in their starting lineup, finished the 2009–10 season with the best record in the Western Conference for the third straight time. On January 13, 2010, the Lakers became the first team in NBA history to win 3,000 regular-season games by defeating the Dallas Mavericks 100–95.[228] They defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Utah Jazz, and the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference playoffs. In the finals, the Lakers played the Boston Celtics for the 12th time. They rallied back from a 3–2 disadvantage in the series and erased a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter of the seventh game to defeat the Celtics. This series win gave them their 16th NBA title overall and 11th since they moved to Los Angeles.[229] Bryant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, despite a 6–24 shooting performance in game seven.[230] After much speculation, head coach Phil Jackson returned for the 2010–11 season.[231] In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the New Orleans Hornets in the first round.[232] But their opportunity for a three-peat was denied by the Dallas Mavericks in a four-game sweep of the second round. After the season, it was announced that Jackson will not be returning to coach the Lakers.[233] After Jackson's retirement, former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown was hired as head coach on May 25, 2011.[234] Before the start of the shortened 2011–12 season, the Lakers traded Lamar Odom to the Dallas Mavericks after Odom requested to be traded.[235] On the trade deadline long time Laker Derek Fisher along with a first round draft pick were traded to the Houston Rockets for Jordan Hill.[236] With a 41–25 regular season record the Lakers entered the playoffs as the third seed, the team defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round in seven games but were eliminated by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round in five games.[237][238] On July 4, 2012, Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns agreed to a sign-and-trade deal that would send him to the Lakers in exchange for the Lakers' 2013 and 2015 first round draft picks, 2013 and 2014 second round draft picks, and $3 million. The trade was made official on July 11, 2012, the first day the trade moratorium was lifted.[239] On August 10, 2012, in a four-team trade the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum and acquired Dwight Howard.[240] The combination of these players with Bryant and Gasol led media outlets to refer to them as a \"superteam\" comparable to the 2003-04 Lakers.[241][242] On November 9, 2012, Mike Brown was relieved of coaching duties after a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season.[243] Assistant Coach Bernie Bickerstaff took over as interim head coach, leading the Lakers to a 5–5 record. On November 12, 2012, the Lakers hired Mike D'Antoni as head coach.[244] On February 18, 2013, Lakers owner Jerry Buss died from cancer at age 80.[245] On the court, D'Antoni coached the Lakers to a 40–32 record the rest of the way to finish 45–37, their worst record since 2007. The Lakers clinched a playoff berth on the final game of the season and finished seventh in the Western Conference after beating the Houston Rockets on April 16, 2013.[246][247] The Lakers battled injuries all season, the most prominent of which is the Achilles tendon rupture to Kobe Bryant that ended his season after 78 games. The absence of Bryant was sorely felt as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs.[248] Nevertheless, Bryant passed Lakers legend Wilt Chamberlain to become the fourth all-time leading scorer in NBA history on March 30, 2013, against the Sacramento Kings.[249] On December 8, 2013, Bryant played in his first game since tearing his Achilles tendon on April 12, 2013.[250] However, on December 17, 2013, he suffered a broken bone in his knee, and did not return for the remainder of the season.[251][252] On March 25, 2014, the Lakers scored 51 points in the third quarter against the New York Knicks, the most points scored in a quarter in the history of the franchise.[253] The Lakers went on to miss the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2005, for just the second time in the last two decades and for just the sixth time in franchise history. On April 30, 2014, Mike D'Antoni resigned from his position as head coach after a 27–55 season.[254] After spending the majority of the off-season without a head coach, the Lakers named former player Byron Scott as the new head coach.[255] After the season, he was the frontrunner to become the new Lakers head coach. Scott interviewed three times for the position, which had become vacant after Mike D'Antoni's resignation.[256] On July 28, 2014, he signed a multi-year contract to coach the Lakers.[257] During the first game of the 2014–15 season, the seventh overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, Julius Randle went down with a broken leg, which ended his rookie season. The Lakers began their season losing 10 of their first 16 games. After playing only 35 games, Kobe Bryant tore a rotator cuff in his shoulder ending his season. Nick Young was also forced to end his season with a fractured kneecap, leaving the team with a record of 14–41.[258] With 27 games left in the regular season, Byron Scott gave rookie Jordan Clarkson more playing time. Clarkson, the 46th overall pick in the 2014 draft, finished his rookie season with game stats of 11.9 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 3.5 apg, and shooting 44.8% from the field.[259] The Lakers' season ended with a record of 21–61, the fourth worst record in the league and at the time the worst record in franchise history. The next season, the Lakers had the second overall pick of the 2015 NBA draft, which they used to select Ohio State freshman point guard D'Angelo Russell. The team also selected Larry Nance Jr. with the 27th overall pick.[260] On November 30, 2015, Bryant announced he would retire at the end of the season after 20 seasons with the team.[261] In Bryant's last season the team missed the playoffs for the third straight year with a 17–65 record, the worst in franchise history.[262] On April 24, 2016, the Lakers announced that they would not exercise their option on Byron Scott's contract for the following season.[263] On April 29, the team announced another former Laker, Luke Walton, as their new head coach. At the time of his hiring, Walton was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, who were in the playoffs, so he could not officially begin his duties as head coach until the Warriors' playoff run was over.[264] The Lakers earned the second overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft,[265] and selected Brandon Ingram from Duke University.[266] The team also selected Ivica Zubac with the 32nd overall pick.[267] On February 21, 2017, the Lakers fired general manager Mitch Kupchak, while Magic Johnson was named as the president of basketball operations. The team's governor Jeanie Buss, also announced the removal of her brother, Jim Buss, from his position as executive vice president of basketball operations.[268][269] On March 7, 2017, the Lakers hired Rob Pelinka as the general manager, signing him to a five-year deal.[270] The Lakers again earned the second overall pick, this time, in the 2017 NBA draft,[271] and selected Lonzo Ball from UCLA.[272] The Lakers also acquired Kyle Kuzma from the University of Utah with the 27th overall pick from a draft-day trade, along with Brook Lopez in exchange for D'Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov.[273] The Lakers also traded their 28th overall pick, Tony Bradley, in exchange for the 30th overall pick, Josh Hart, from Villanova University and the 42nd overall pick, Thomas Bryant, from Indiana University.[274] In February 2018, Nance Jr. and Clarkson were traded away to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye, and a 2018 first-round draft pick.[275] On July 2, 2018, Randle was renounced by the Lakers.[276] On July 9, 2018, the Lakers signed LeBron James to a four-year, $154 million contract.[277][278] By the Christmas Day game, the Lakers were six games over .500 before James sustained a groin injury leading to several weeks of missed games. Ball and Ingram also ended their seasons early due to injuries. On February 7, 2019, Zubac was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers along with Michael Beasley in exchange for Mike Muscala.[279] On April 9, 2019, Johnson stepped down as the team's president of basketball operations,[280] and two days later, the Lakers parted ways with head coach Walton after the team failed to reach the playoffs for the sixth straight year.[281] On May 13, Frank Vogel was named the Lakers' head coach.[282] The Lakers received the fourth overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft lottery.[283] On July 6, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans for Ball, Ingram, Hart, and three first-round picks, including the number four overall in the 2019 draft.[284] This trade officially ended the young core era of the Lakers; only Kuzma remained out of the group of players. Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Lakers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season.[285] The Lakers finished the regular season with a 52–19 record, entering the playoffs for the first time since 2013,[286] and as the top seed for the first time since 2010.[287] They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010.[288] They defeated the Miami Heat 4–2 to win the 2020 NBA Finals,[289] and James was named the Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career.[290] The win gave Los Angeles their 17th championship in franchise history, tying the Boston Celtics for the most all-time.[291] Primary Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, who took over the team in 2017, would also become the first female controlling owner of an NBA team to win the NBA Finals.[292] During the 2021 off-season, the Lakers picked up many NBA veterans, the most notable of which was Russell Westbrook, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade with the Washington Wizards. Kyle Kuzma, the last player left from the Lakers' young core era, was traded away, along with others. Other veterans picked up during the off-season included Carmelo Anthony, DeAndre Jordan, and returning players Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo.[293] Alex Caruso left the Lakers and signed with the Chicago Bulls, and veteran locker-room voice Jared Dudley retired.[294][295] The Lakers made a surprising run in the 2023 Playoffs, making the Western Conference Finals, but were defeated by the eventual champion Denver Nuggets. On December 9, 2023, the Lakers won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament after defeating the Indiana Pacers in the championship game. James was named the inaugural tournament MVP.[296] They finished the 2023–24 season 47–35 and beat the New Orleans Pelicans in the Play-In to make the playoffs as the seventh seed. On June 27, 2024, the Lakers selected Bronny James, the son of LeBron, at 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, forming the first father-son duo in NBA history.[297] JJ Redick was hired as head coach of the Lakers.[298] On October 23, 2024, the team made NBA history as being the first one to have father and son (LeBron James & Bronny James) play together as they beat Minnesota Timberwolves on their season opening game.[299] The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the Lakers involves the two most storied basketball franchises in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. It has been called the best rivalry in the NBA.[300] The two teams have met a record 12 times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s and three times in the 1980s. The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4–2. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games. The two teams were tied for the highest number of championships, with 17 titles apiece, until the Celtics surpassed this record in the 2024 NBA Finals; together, the 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history. The all-time series record for the Lakers vs Celtics is 209–165 with the Celtics being the forerunners. Boston is the only NBA team with an overall winning record against the Lakers.[301] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Detroit Pistons developed in the late 1980s.[302]: 228 Both teams faced each other in back-to-back finals appearances in the 1988 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games and the 1989 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in 4 games. The rivalry reemerged in the early 2000s as both teams squared off against one another in the 2004 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in five games. The Lakers have a lengthy history with the Golden State Warriors as both franchises relocated to California during the early 1960s. Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike, unlike the Dodgers–Giants rivalry of MLB, or the 49ers–Rams rivalry of the NFL in which both teams express fierce animosity against one another.[303][304] The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991. Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers. Both teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams relocated to California in the early 1960s.[305][306] The Lakers lead the all time regular season series 262–173, and the postseason series 25–11.[307][308] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers is unique because they were the only two NBA teams to share an arena, the Crypto.com Arena. It is also one of only two intra-city rivalries in the NBA, the other being the new crosstown rivalry between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets. Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers.[309][310] Some contend that the term rivalry was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful.[311] The Lakers and the Phoenix Suns rivalry didn't develop until the 2000s where the teams were led by Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash, respectively. The San Antonio Spurs and the Lakers, developed what some would classify as a rivalry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 1999, the teams have met in the NBA Playoffs five times, with the clubs combining to appear in seven consecutive NBA Finals (from 1999 to 2005). Additionally, the teams combined to win five NBA championships from 1999 to 2003; the Spurs won the NBA championship in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014 while the Lakers won the championship in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010. From 1999 to 2004 the clubs' rivalry was often considered the premier rivalry in the NBA,[312] and each time the clubs faced each other in the playoffs the winner advanced to the NBA Finals. In 2008, the teams met again in the Western Conference Finals where the Spurs were handily defeated only to beat the Lakers when they met again in 2013. The Kings and the Lakers have faced each other in the playoffs nine times between 1949 and 2002, and since the Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985, both have been based in California. The 2002 Western Conference Finals was one of the most bitterly contested in NBA history, with many controversial calls in game 6.[313] The Lakers would win the series in game 7. Berger and Chalfen purchased the NBL's disbanded Detroit Gems for $15,000 in 1947, changed their name to the Lakers, and relocated them to Minnesota. Max Winter bought a third of the club in their early years and sold his share to Mikan in 1954. Berger bought Mikan's share in 1956 giving him a controlling (⅔) interest.[314] After Mikan retired, attendance plummeted and the team lost money for several seasons, leading the ownership group to put the team up for sale in 1957.[315] Marty Marion, a retired baseball player and manager, and his business partner Milton Fischman attempted to purchase the team with the intention of moving the club to Kansas City, Missouri.[315][316] Mikan offered to mortgage his home in an attempt to buy the team and keep the club in Minnesota.[317] The Lakers were sold to a group of investors led by Bob Short, however.[314] The team was sold to Short's group with the agreement that it would not be relocated to Kansas City but kept in Minnesota.[318] Short's ownership group consisted of 117 Minnesota businesses and private citizens, who amassed a total of $200,000 for the purchase; $150,000 to buy the team and $50,000 to run it.[314] By 1958 Short had become 80% owner of the team by buying out his partners,[314] but the team was floundering. Attendance remained poor, and the NBA had put the Lakers on \"financial probation\", notifying them that if they did not meet certain ticket sales numbers they could be bought out by the league and relocated. Short was forced to move the team to Los Angeles in 1960; the club had lost $60,000 in the first half of the 1959–60 season alone.[319] The NBA's owners originally voted 7–1 against the move.[320] When Short indicated that he might take the team to a new rival league that was developing, however, the owners held another vote that same day and allowed the relocation (8–0).[321] Aided by Baylor's drawing power,[322][323] and the new locale, the team's finances improved when they arrived in LA.[324][325] Short sold the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for a then league record amount of $5.175 million.[326] Short insisted the deal be conducted in cash as he was wary of Cooke, so guards transported the money in a cart from one New York bank to another.[327] Cooke was a more hands-on owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations.[328] He personally financed construction of the Forum in 1967 at a cost of $16.5 million.[329][330] He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67 million.[331] Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce.[332][333] Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate.[330][334] Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998,[335] and until October 2010 Magic Johnson was a minority owner as well.[336] Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988.[337] In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league.[335] In 2013, Buss died at the age of 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer.[338][339][340] His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote.[341][342] Buss' succession plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.[342][343] Given the team's proximity to Hollywood, the Lakers fanbase includes numerous celebrities, many of whom can be seen at the Staples Center during home games.[344] Jack Nicholson, for example, has held season tickets since the 1970s, and directors reportedly need to work their shooting schedules around Lakers home games.[345] From 2002 and 2007 the team averaged just over 18,900 fans, which placed them in the top ten in the NBA in attendance. Red Hot Chili Peppers' song \"Magic Johnson\", from their 1989 album Mother's Milk, is a tribute to the former point guard, and frontman Anthony Kiedis and bassist Michael \"Flea\" Balzary are frequently seen attending home games.[346] In 2008, the team sold out every home game,[347] and in 2010, the Lakers had the most popular team merchandise among all NBA teams, and Bryant the most popular jersey.[348] The Laker nickname came from the state of Minnesota being the Land of 10,000 Lakes.[14][349] The team's colors are purple, gold and white.[350][6][351] The Lakers logo consists of the team name, \"Los Angeles Lakers\" written in purple on top of a gold basketball. The team usually wears white jerseys for Sunday and holiday home games.[350][352] List of the last five seasons completed by the Lakers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Los Angeles Lakers seasons. The Lakers have won 17 NBA titles and have appeared in the NBA Finals 15 other times.[37] These appearances include eight NBA Finals appearances in the 1980s. The best record posted by the team was 69–13, in 1972; the worst record was 17–65, in 2016.[37] Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage Bryant holds most individual team records for longevity including most games played (1,333), and most minutes logged (48,298). Johnson holds all significant assist records for the club including career assists (10,141), assists in a game (24), and highest assist average for a season (13.1). Johnson also has the most triple doubles, with his 138 over 100 more than the next closest player (Bryant; 17). Elmore Smith holds team records for blocks in a game (17), blocks per game for a season (4.85), and career blocks per game (3.93). The scoring records are mostly shared by Elgin Baylor and Bryant, with Baylor having the highest average for a career (27.4) while Bryant has the highest points scored in a single game (81). Baylor, Bryant and West hold the top five single-season scoring averages, with Bryant occupying the first (35.4) and fourth (31.6) spots, while Baylor has the second (34.8), and third (34.0), and West the fifth (31.3).[353][354] The Lakers hold several NBA records as a team including most consecutive games won overall (33) and most consecutive road games won (16), both of which came during the 1971–72 season,[355] highest field-goal percentage for a season at 54.5% (1984–85),[356] and highest road winning percentage at 0.816 (1971–72).[66] They also hold records for having (into the 2009–10 season) the most wins (3,027), the highest winning percentage (61.9%), and the most NBA Finals appearances (31).[37][357] The 2000–01 team set the NBA record for best playoff record at 15–1, which was later broken by the Golden State Warriors in 2017.[358] The 1971–72 team holds franchise records in wins (69), most points scored, and largest margin of victory; both of the latter came in the team's 63 point win versus Golden State (162–99).[359] They also held the record for most wins at home in the regular season (going 36–5 in 1971–72, then 37–4 in both 1976–77 and 1979–80) unil the Boston Celtics set the current record of 40–1 in the 1985–86 season. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, located at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles. The arena opened in fall 1999 and seats up to 18,997 for Lakers games.[360] Owned and operated by AEG and L.A. Arena Company, the arena is also home to the Los Angeles Clippers, the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings.[360] Before moving to Staples Center, for 32 seasons (1967–1999), the Lakers played their home games at The Forum in Inglewood, California, located approximately 10 miles southwest of the team's current home.[167] During the 1999 preseason, the Lakers played their home games at the Forum before officially moving into Crypto.com Arena, and once again hosted a preseason game versus the Golden State Warriors on October 9, 2009, this time to commemorate the team's 50th-anniversary season in Los Angeles.[361] In the first seven years in Los Angeles, the team played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, south of downtown Los Angeles.[362] While the team played in Minneapolis, the team played their home games at the Minneapolis Auditorium and the Minneapolis Armory from 1947 to 1960.[363] Roster Last transaction: December 22, 2024 The Lakers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA.[364] A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[365] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. The Lakers have had three first overall picks in their history: Elgin Baylor (selected in 1958), Magic Johnson (selected in 1979) and James Worthy (selected in 1982).[368] The Lakers have also had six lottery picks in their history: Eddie Jones (selected tenth overall in 1994), Andrew Bynum (selected tenth overall in 2005), Julius Randle (selected seventh overall in 2014), D'Angelo Russell (selected second overall in 2015), Brandon Ingram (selected second overall in 2016) and Lonzo Ball (selected second overall in 2017).[368] Other draft picks include Jerry West and Gail Goodrich in the 1960s, Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon in the 1970s, A.C. Green and Vlade Divac in the 1980s, Elden Campbell, Nick Van Exel, Derek Fisher and Devean George in the 1990s, and Luke Walton, Sasha Vujačić, and Ronny Turiaf in the 2000s.[368] There have been 29 head coaches for the Lakers franchise. John Kundla coached the team in Minneapolis when they won their first five BAA/NBA championships from 1949 to 1954.[52] Pat Riley is second in franchise history in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins.[369] Phil Jackson broke Riley's regular-season wins record in 2009, and he passed Riley's playoff wins and games coached records in 2010.[369] Jackson, Riley, Kundla, and Bill Sharman have all been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for their coaching careers. George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Jerry West, Pat Riley, Magic Johnson, Kurt Rambis, Byron Scott and Luke Walton have all played and head-coached for the Lakers. Jackson, who had two stints as head coach, was coach from 2005 to 2011. In May 2011, Mike Brown was named his replacement for the 2011–12 season.[370] Brown was fired[371] on November 9, 2012, after a 1–4 start. Assistant coach Bernie Bickerstaff served as interim head coach for five games before the Lakers selected Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. D'Antoni resigned at the end of the 2013–14 season. In July 2014, Byron Scott was hired as head coach.[372] After the 2015–16 season ended, Scott was fired. On April 29, 2016, former Lakers player Luke Walton was named as Scott's replacement,[373] and served as head coach until the end of the 2018–19 season.[374] Frank Vogel was named his successor on a multiyear deal announced on May 13, 2019.[375] Vogel was fired following the conclusion of the 2021–22 season.[376] On June 6, 2022, Darvin Ham was named as Vogel's successor as head coach.[377] However, Ham was fired by the Lakers on May 3, 2024, after the Lakers were eliminated in Game 5 of the first round by the Denver Nuggets. Among his accomplishments was leading the Lakers to their first In-Season Tournament championship.[378] On June 24, 2024, former NBA player JJ Redick was hired as the 29th coach in team history.[379] The Lakers have 39 Hall-of-Famers (29 players, 5 head coaches, 1 assistant coach, and 3 contributors) who contributed to the organization.[380][381][382] Notes: The Lakers have retired thirteen jersey numbers and an honorary microphone in honor of their players and broadcaster:[392][393][394][395][396] On January 13, 2025, Michael Cooper will have his #21 jersey retired.[397] In addition, several other players and coaches who were instrumental to the franchise's success during its days in Minneapolis have a banner commemorating them as Hall of Fame members of the Minneapolis Lakers, although jersey numbers for these players are not retired by the franchise:[400] For 41 years, Chick Hearn was the team's broadcaster until his death in 2002. He broadcast 3,338 consecutive games between November 21, 1965, and December 16, 2001.[401] Hearn came up with West's \"Mr. Clutch\" nickname.[402] He was a part of the team's \"inner sanctum\" when Cooke was owner, and was consulted on basketball decisions.[403] Paul Sunderland, who had filled in for a couple of games while Hearn recuperated in the 2001–02 season, was named the permanent play-by-play announcer. Stu Lantz was retained as the color commentator.[404] When Sunderland's contract expired in the summer of 2005, the team chose not to renew it.[405] Then, Joel Meyers moved in alongside Lantz as the television announcer, with Spero Dedes and former Laker player Mychal Thompson on the radio.[406] For the 2011–12 season, Bill Macdonald became the new television play-by-play announcer, joining Lantz who remained as the color analyst. Meanwhile, John Ireland joined Mychal Thompson to call the games on radio.[407] Beginning in the 2009–10 season, Lakers radio broadcasts were heard on KSPN (Los Angeles ESPN Radio affiliate) in English and KWKW in Spanish.[406][408] KLAC had the team's radio broadcast rights from the 1976–77 season until the 2008–09 season.[408][409] Until 2011, telecasts had been split between KCAL-TV (road games) and Fox Sports West (home games), unless they are chosen for national broadcasts on ABC.[410] KCAL had been the Lakers' over-the-air television broadcaster since 1977, dating back to when the station was the RKO General-owned KHJ-TV, the longest relationship between an NBA team and a television station. Prior to KHJ, Laker games were televised on KTLA. The Lakers had been on Fox Sports West since 1985, dating to when it was the original Prime Ticket and owned by Buss.[411] On February 14, 2011, Time Warner Cable and the Lakers announced the formation of two new regional sports networks (one in English, one in Spanish) that would exclusively televise the team's games and related programming for 20 years starting with the 2012–13 season.[412] The said networks were originally known as Time Warner Cable SportsNet, before it was renamed Spectrum SportsNet in 2016 upon Charter Communications' purchase of Time Warner Cable.[413]",

                "content": "The holiday season signifies different things for different people, but for many, Christmas means being together with your family, likely with gifts and a big holiday dinner. However, that isn’t the case for everyone. For many, Christmas either isn’t a holiday they celebrate, one they celebrate a bit non-traditionally, or one they wish they could celebrate with loved ones, but can’t make it home this year (lookin’ at you, out-of-state college students). If you fall into this latter camp, that may mean that the big, home-cooked Christmas dinner you see on TV and in movies isn’t likely to happen. But whether you’re looking for a way to still make Christmas specially, or you’d like to escape the holiday altogether, there are still ways to have a great meal on Dec. 25. One of my favorite ways to celebrate (or simply seek comfort) is by getting food from my favorite chain restaurant. But which chain restaurants are open Christmas? That’s the big question — one you don’t want to wait to find out the answer to, especially if you’re traveling to find some good grub. Have no fear, though.

                "content": "Please welcome my daddy, Nate Bargatze. My dad is a magician. He’s done that my entire life. He was a clown at the very beginning, just in case you’re like, “How do you get into something like that?” Uh… It goes clown, then magic. There’s two steps. You can take them in either order. I was born, he was a clown. It was never weird to me. I thought everybody’s dad was a clown. My, uh, first memory of my life is I was five years old, and I remember my mom walked me out to the front yard, and my dad pulled up… We had this old red Mazda. He’s dressed as a clown, that doesn’t even faze me. That’s just how he left. How else would he come home? And… The Easter Bunny was in the passenger seat. That’s the first thing that I remember, to my life. If you want to know how you get into comedy, that’s a pretty good nudge. And I remember it didn’t fit. The Easter Bunny head didn’t fit in the car. Like, he couldn’t sit normal, so his head was bent to the side. And I remember he had his seat belt on, and he’s just like… and I was like… I like to think about all the other people that saw that. Just in the car next to them, just at a red light, you’re like, “I didn’t even know they hung out like that.” Uh… So, me and my dad, we do… He just does magic now, and he’s very good at what he does. He’s very funny, and we do shows together. So, uh, one time, we did this show. Magicians have conventions where they get together and they buy and sell tricks, and they give a lecture, and they do this big show. So this guy was putting one together in Des Moines, Iowa, which is the birthplace of magic, something a lot of people don’t know. And… It’s not, but that does sound like it could be. I don’t know why. I said that in Des Moines, and people are like, “I think I already knew that.” Uh… They’re like, “No. Uh, yeah, he’s… No, he’s right.” So, this guy calls me, he’s like, “Your dad’s performing this year, so we want you to come down, and we’re gonna make you appear out of a magic trick.” I’m gonna come out, I’m gonna surprise my dad, surprise the audience, everybody will go crazy, and then I’ll do five minutes of stand-up, and that will end the show. He’s like, “It’s gonna be a big deal.” I was like, “All right.” I agreed to it. I fly to Des Moines. I’m hiding. I’m in my room. No one knows I’m there. The show starts. My dad’s out performing, I climb in a box backstage. When my dad gets done performing, they ask him to stay and help, and they push the box out. The trick is, the guy has a very pretty lady assistant. She walks around, shows the box is empty, and then she climbs in. Normally, it just falls apart, and then she disappears. But now, it falls apart, and it’s me, and I pop out. And you have to come out big. I don’t know if you’ve ever appeared out of a magic trick, but… if you do, you can’t just be like, “How you doing?” -You know? Like… It’s gotta be a big grand, like, “Can you believe it?” And I look at my dad, his face is so surprised. He had no idea. But his eyes are just like, “Why would you ever do this?” And I was like, “Is this not a good time to visit you?” Uh… The audience is clapping, but they’re not going that crazy… Like, they start… The clapping starts dying down, and as I’m standing there, it’s, like, hitting me. I was like, “I don’t think they know who we are.” That guy told me they did, and they don’t. They don’t know that’s my dad, they don’t know I’m a comedian. This looks like the stupidest trick they’ve ever seen. It doesn’t make sense. They’re like, ‘A pretty girl goes in and just a whatever dude pops out? That’s your trick? Your trick is backwards, sir. It’s backwards.” And now I gotta do comedy, but they don’t know I’m a comedian. So I get a microphone, they’re like, “He’s gonna talk to us now? How long is this trick?” When you do comedy in front of people not expecting comedy, it does not come off as comedy. It sounds like a mean speech. They were just like, “Get back in the box. Where’s the girl? Is she fine? Can we hear from her?” So I have a daughter, and my daughter’s name is Harper. So a lot of people ask, “Did you name her after Harper Lee, the author of To Kill a Mockingbird?” And, you know, I’ve never thought about an author a day in my life, so… That never occurred to me. I mean, my middle name is Lee, and it just never crossed my mind. Uh… I love having a kid. We… I love when kids cry, it’s just innocent. I love how innocent it is. They cry over a tag in their shirt. I mean, they bawl. They don’t like… It feels weird. And then, you could be like, “Is your house on fire?” I’ve never seen someone cry this much. It’s over nothing. She’s on her iPad a lot. You know, that’s the hard part. You got to get these kids off… You don’t want technology all the time. She just sits there on her iPad. She wants to be a YouTuber, which, as a comedian, makes me furious. She watches these kid YouTube videos, and now she makes her own videos. It’s just her sitting there going, “Hey, guys, what’s going on?” “Click the links below, subscribe, leave a comment.” None of this is anywhere but my phone. I got 90 hours of this. It’s not on YouTube. Me and her mom are the only subscribers. Our daughter still sleeps in our bed too, and parents don’t like that, when you say it. They’re like, “You gotta keep them outside. Don’t look at them.” Uh… It’s my fault. So we had a kid late in life. We have one kid. So we’re hitting all the sights, and I’d be… When I travel a bunch, and I’d get home, I’d want us to sleep in the bed together. and I’ve built up a habit now, it’s happened. So it’s tough, though, because kids don’t know how to sleep. I mean, she makes a king bed feel like a twin. I mean, I’m on the edge. When I sleep alone in a hotel, I sleep with my head on the nightstand. It’s the only way I know how to go to bed. She gets sideways, upside down. If you woke up upside down tomorrow, you would go to the hospital. She’s also apparently going through menopause ’cause she’s the hottest human being that’s ever lived. I’m freezing at night. She kicks all the covers off. You’re like, “Yeah, you go ahead. It’s your bed. We’re lucky to be in it.” She’s gotta get out at some point, you know? I don’t know. She’ll be 37 years old… “Hey, can I get in the bed with you guys?” Her kids are upstairs asleep in their bed. Her husband left a while ago, he ain’t gonna put up with that. Our daughter is in third grade, and for first grade, she started taking the bus, and it was the first time she ever took the bus. So you know, as a parent, you walk them to the bus stop, it’s very fun. So we got her on the bus, she went to school. At the end of the day, someone from school called my cell phone. They have my wife’s cell phone; they have my cell phone. They called my cell phone, and she said, “Do you know what bus number your daughter’s supposed to be on?” And I said, “I’m her dad.” As in, “Are you cra…” I was like, “This is how you thought you’d get this information, was to call the dad?” “You saw Mom and Dad’s cell phone, you go, ‘I bet the dad knows.'” I was like, “Do you have parents? You ever seen a family before?” “You thought, ‘Let’s call the husband’?” “Unless there’s two husbands, you should never call a husband a day in your life.” “I’d rather you ask a lady that doesn’t know her.” “I think she could get to the bottom of it quicker than I can.” I had to go get her. “All right, I’ll come get her.” “Tell me the name of the school and I’ll come get her. Where does she go?” We’re doing homework too. Our daughter started bringing it home. Homework’s fun. First and second grade was awesome. Third grade, you’re like, “Okay.” They throw some stuff in, you’re like, “Oh, all right. All right.” It’s, uh… “Okay, learning it earlier than we used to, huh?” I don’t even know if that’s true, but… I have learned stuff from elementary homework, which is embarrassing. I’m 41. My daughter is eight. Nothing should ever come out of her mouth that I’m like, “What? What was that?” I learned when to use “a” or “an” in a sentence. [chuckles] I didn’t know that there was a rule in play. I thought you felt it out, you know, and just go, “That feels right,” and that’s what you do. I do the same thing with a comma. I’ve never known where a comma’s supposed to go. If I feel a comma’s coming, I try to get out of that sentence so bad. I mean, I… And if I can’t, I just put a comma and see if someone says something, you know? They’re like, “Is that a comma?” I’m like, “Is it? My comma button has been sticking on my phone.” magician - a person who performs magic tricks for entertainment. magician clown - clown pulled up - approach with a vehicle and then stop faze - disturb or disconcert (someone). nudge - a light touch or push. bent - not straight, crooked seat belt - a belt or strap securing a person to prevent injury, especially in a vehicle or aircraft. seat belt conventions - a large meeting or conference, especially of members of a political party or a particular profession. tricks - a cunning or skillful act or scheme intended to deceive or outwit someone. backstage - relating to or situated in the area behind the stage in a theater. it’s hitting me - (slang) I’m finally understanding tag tag bawl - cry noisily. furious - extremely angry. nightstand - a small low bedside table Nightstand sideways - from the side menopause - period in a woman's life (typically between 45 and 50 years of age) when this occurs. get to the bottom - (informal) solve, figure something out felt it out - (informal) Not based on logic but instead based on feel. sticking - When a button is sticking, it is not working properly. Nate says that his dad’s job is a clown and a magician. What is your dad’s job? Nate said that his dad pulled up to his house with the Easter bunny in the car. Did anyone pull up to your house who was very exciting or who you were happy to see or who you did not want to see? Nate said that seeing his dad dressed as a clown did not faze him. What is unique about your parents that would faze many people but does not faze you? Did your parents try to nudge you into a certain career or job? Nate said that the Easter Bunny did not fit in his dad’s car, so its head was bent to the side. Do you remember a time when you were packed in a car with other people? Why? Are people required by law to wear seat belts in your country? Did you ever attend a convention? What convention? Have you ever performed a magic trick? Did you ever go backstage? Why? The truth that the audience did not know him or why he is was showing up in the box finally hit Nate as he appeared in the magic trick. Was there a time when truth hit you? Nate said that kids can bawl over just a tag in their shirt. He said that he loves it when kids cry because it is so innocent. What is your opinion of kids bawling easily? Nate sarcastically says that his daughter wanting to be a YouTuber makes him furious. What actually makes you furious? What book is on your nighstand now? Nate’s wife can sleep sideways and even upside down. Nate also sarcastically says that his wife is going through menopause because his wife gets really hot at night. What are your sleeping habits like? Do you sleep sideways? Do you go to bed early or late? Nate sarcastically says that a random lady could get to the bottom of his daughter’s bus number faster than him. Would your dad know your bus number? How was your dad involved in your life? Do you feel things out or use logic more? Nate made up the excuse that his comma key was sticking to take away attention from his poor grammar skills. How would you rate your grammar skills?

                "content": "By William Vaillancourt Nate Bargatze‘s George Washington is back. Last season on SNL, the comedian’s portrayal of the Revolutionary War general expressed a deep aversion to the straightforward metric system while envisioning what kind of country he wants to form. One year later, and he is defending all the quirks of the English language and its odd naming customs. “We will live through the battle ahead because we fight to control our own destiny, to create our own nation, and to do our own thing with the English language,” he said, rallying his troops alongside him in an open vessel. “I dream that one day, our great nation will have a word for the number ‘twelve.’ We shall call it ‘a dozen,'” he said, prompting one of his men to ask what other numbers shall have their own names. “None,” he replied flatly. “We will also have two names for animals–one when they are alive, and a different one when they become food. So cows will be beef, and pigs will be pork,” he explained. “And chickens, sir?” one soldier asked. “That one stays,” he replied. And other foods, he added, will be named “whatever we want,” like the hamburger. “Made of ham, sir?” “If it only were that simple. A hamburger is made of beef, just as a buffalo wing is made of chicken,” he clarified. “But fear not, men: hot dogs will not be made of dogs.” Washington then instructs one soldier, who is adamant that the ingredients to a hot dog be known, throw himself overboard, which he does. Finally, Washington addresses education, explaining that the first year of schooling will be known as kindergarten. And as for the second year? “First grade.” Bargatze, in his stand-up monologue, touched on education as well. “I went to community college, and–it’s a big deal. A lot of people probably don’t know this, but community college is like, ‘You’re probably staying in your community,'” he joked. “I took speech as a class in college,” the Tennessee comedian continued. “I drove there with my friends. They had real classes, and they’d go to like business, math, or something. I don’t even know what a real class is called. I said ‘I’m going to speech. I think I’m a different part of the campus. We stay in the same room and our teachers rotate. How about you guys?'” We want to hear it. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                "title": "San Jose State Spartans football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The San Jose State Spartans football team represents San José State University in NCAA Division I FBS college football as a member of the Mountain West Conference. Since its first regular season in 1898, the team has produced over 90 All-America team members, won 18 conference championships, and sent 139 players to the NFL, including Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Bill Walsh and Dick Vermeil.[3] The Spartans head coach is Ken Niumatalolo. San Jose State plays their home games in CEFCU Stadium (built in 1933 as Spartan Stadium), and regional rivalries include Fresno State, Stanford, Hawai'i, and San Diego State. San Jose State first fielded a football team in 1892 which did not have a coach. In their first year fielding an American football team, the Spartans lost in their sole contest against the local YMCA team of San Jose. The game technically occurred during 1893, but it represented the 1892 academic year and so that is the season it is counted.[1] In 1983, James E. Addicott started to serve as the head coach. Addicott also served as a math professor at the California State Normal School (now San José State University). The team played a local YMCA club in 1893 and 1894 and garnered its first tie in 1896, a 6–6 decision against nearby rival College of the Pacific. The first regular football seasons began in 1898 and mostly consisted of games against local high schools and some colleges and junior colleges.[4] During the 1920s the football program began playing home games at \"Spartan Field,\" future home of Spartan Stadium. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Spartan football program was considered a powerhouse, posting 12 consecutive winning seasons and earning eight conference championship titles over an 18-year span. The 1932 and 1939 teams went 7–0–2 and 13–0 respectively, the only undefeated seasons in school history.[4][3] San Jose State first appeared in the national rankings in 1939 when the AP Poll ranked the Spartans No. 19 in week seven. The team would climb to No. 18 in week eight. Lloyd Thomas was the first San Jose State player to receive first-team All-America honors. Thomas played as a defensive end on the 1936, 1937 and 1938 teams that fielded a combined win-loss record of 27–7–1. As of 2022, SJSU has produced over 90 All-America team members, including seven first-team selections.[5] Spartan Stadium (now known as CEFCU Stadium) was built on the original Spartan Field site and completed in 1933 with a capacity of 18,000. The Spartans won the first football game played in the stadium 44–6 over San Francisco State on October 7, 1933. The San Jose State Spartans football team served unexpectedly with the Honolulu Police Department during World War II. The team had just arrived in Hawaii to play a series of post-season bowl games against Hawaii and the Willamette University Bearcats when the U.S. Navy base at Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7, 1941. The team was stranded on the islands for a number of weeks following the attack, and players were employed by the local police department to help improve island defenses against a possible Japanese amphibious assault and as guards for military bases on the island.[3][6] The Spartan football program posted just six winning seasons in the 1950s and 1960s, but the 1970s would usher in a string of successful seasons spanning 20 years. From 1971 to 1992, San Jose State posted 15 winning seasons, won eight conference titles, appeared in four bowl games and sent nearly 50 players to the NFL.[7] SJSU's first win over a nationally ranked opponent occurred in 1971 when the Spartans defeated No. 10 Stanford 13–12 on November 13. Stanford would go on to defeat Michigan in the Rose Bowl that season.[8] SJSU's second win over a ranked opponent occurred four years later in 1975, when the Spartans defeated No. 15 Stanford 36–34 in a nationally televised game on September 27.[3] San Jose State also had victories over No. 10 Baylor in 1980, No. 19 Fresno State in 1986, and No. 23 Fresno State in 1990.[3] From 1971 to 1992, SJSU garnered 23 victories over current Power Five conference opponents. These victories included eight wins over Stanford, five wins over Cal and three over Oregon.[9] In 1975, San Jose State appeared in the national rankings for the first time in over 30 years when the team was ranked No. 20 in the AP Poll in week 13.[10] SJSU later earned its first post-season national ranking in 1990 when the Spartans finished No. 20 in the Coaches Poll.[4] Two stadium expansions and renovations in the 1980s increased the Spartan Stadium seating capacity from 18,000 to 31,218. From 1993 to 2004, San Jose State had just one winning season when the team finished 7–5 in 2000; however, the team did earn two wins over ranked opponents during this period. The Spartans claimed a 25–22 victory over No. 24 Air Force in 1997 and a 27–24 win over No. 9 TCU in a nationally televised game in 2000.[3] The Spartans also defeated rival Stanford three consecutive years from 1998 to 2000. By the spring of 2004, the combination of rising costs for the football program and budget cuts from the state led some San Jose State faculty members to advocate dropping football.[11][12] In 2004, San Jose State defeated the Rice Owls 70–63 in a game that set the NCAA Division I record for total points scored and total touchdowns in a non-overtime game.[13] Coach Dick Tomey took over the program in 2005 amid Academic Progress Rate (APR) shortcomings that would result in severe penalties imposed by the NCAA.[14] After showing moderate improvement that year, the Spartans had a breakout season in 2006. It was the team's best season since joining the WAC ten years prior. Tomey guided the Spartans to a 9–4 record, a win over rival Fresno State, and a win over New Mexico in the 2006 New Mexico Bowl, thus ending the team's 16-year bowl drought. The 2006 Spartan squad produced two 2007 NFL draft picks in wide receivers James Jones and John Broussard. From 2007 through the 2009 seasons, the program was hit with heavy NCAA sanctions for failing to meet APR standards. By the start of the 2009 season, the Spartans had lost 57 scholarships over a four-year period. By the spring of 2010, the NCAA penalties were lifted and a full complement of 85 scholarships was restored.[14] The 2007 team was not as successful as the previous year's team, with the Spartans finishing 5–7 and fifth in the WAC. The post-season showed a positive result, however, with several players being named to all-star games including Dwight Lowery, Marcus Teland, Matt Castelo and Adam Tafralis. The Spartans produced another draft pick in the 2008 NFL draft, in defensive back Dwight Lowery. Lowery was named a 1st-team All-America winner in 2007. The 2008 roster gave the school its best start since joining the WAC. The Spartans jumped to 5–2 and led the WAC for three weeks until losing to Boise State. The Spartans finished the season in sixth place in the WAC with a conference record of 4–4 and a 6–6 overall record. Three players were picked in the 2009 NFL draft, those being defensive tackle Jarron Gilbert, defensive back Christopher Owens and defensive back Coye Francies After playing an unusually tough non-conference schedule, the 2009 Spartans finished 2–10 with wins over Cal Poly and New Mexico State. Head Coach Dick Tomey announced in November he would retire at the close of the season, thus ending his legendary coaching career. Tomey's record at SJSU was 25–35. On December 17, 2009, Mike MacIntyre was formally introduced as Tomey's replacement. MacIntyre was previously the defensive coordinator at Duke University.[15] San Jose State finished 1–12 in 2010 and 5–7 in 2011 under MacIntyre. In MacIntyre's third season, the 2012 San Jose State Spartans football team finished 11–2 including a win over Bowling Green in the 2012 Military Bowl. The 2012 team earned top-25 post-season rankings in the Associated Press (AP), Coaches and BCS polls. Kent Baer served as interim head coach for the Military Bowl because MacIntyre resigned to accept the head coach position at Colorado. Ron Caragher, previously the head coach at the University of San Diego, became the SJSU head coach following the conclusion of the 2012 football season. Caragher's team finished a disappointing 6–6 in 2013, however, that season did include a 62–52 upset win over No. 16 Fresno State to close out the year. The team finished 3–9 in 2014, 6–7 in 2015 and 4–8 in 2016. On November 27, 2016, Caragher was relieved of his duties as head coach after compiling a 19–30 (.388) win-loss record and only one bowl appearance over four seasons. Oregon State wide receivers coach Brent Brennan, who was a San Jose State assistant under Tomey and MacIntyre from 2005 to 2010, took over as head coach in 2017.[16] In Brennan's first two years as head coach, the Spartans won just three games. This included a 1–11 season in 2018.[17] Despite the poor record, five of the team's losses in 2018 were by fewer than nine points. Three of those losses were by a field goal, including a 5 overtime 44-41 loss to the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors on September 29, 2018.[18][19] The 2019 team improved to 5–7, missing bowl eligibility by one win.[20] The Spartans also showed promise by defeating Arkansas on the road in 2019 for the program's first win over a Southeastern Conference team. Additionally, the 2019 Spartan team defeated Army, making the Spartans one of only 20 teams in college football to defeat all three FBS service academies (Army, Air Force, and Navy).[21] Brennan received a contract extension at the close of the 2019 season.[22] The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the 2020 season, with restrictions imposed by Santa Clara County prompting the team to conduct preseason practice at Humboldt State University. The pandemic also resulted in the cancellation of all four non-conference games and two games against Mountain West Conference opponents. Santa Clara County public health orders also forced the Spartans' last two home games to be relocated to Aloha Stadium in Hawaii and Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas.[23] The abbreviated 2020 campaign would be a breakout year for the Spartans, who won each of their six regular season games for their first 6–0 start since 1939. The Spartans also cracked the AP Poll top-25 for the first time since 2012 and debuted in the College Football Playoff ranking at No. 24.[24][25] The Spartans qualified for the Mountain West Conference championship game for the first time, where they defeated Boise State 34–20. In addition to giving San Jose State its maiden win over Boise State, the victory gave the Spartans their first conference championship title since 1991.[26] Brennan was named the Mountain West Conference Coach of the Year and also received the 2020 Lombardi Foundation national Coach of the Year award.[25][27] In 2023, the Spartans, along with Boise State and UNLV, finished tied for first in the conference standings.[28] All three teams finished 6–2 in conference play, but the Spartans were left out of the MWC championship game after a computer tiebreaker placed UNLV and Boise State higher in the rankings. In January 2024, Brennan left San Jose State to join the Arizona Wildcats as head coach.[29] Ken Niumatalolo took over as head coach on January 21, 2024,[30] becoming the 30th head football coach in the program's history. Niumatalolo was previously the head coach at Navy and won a program-best 109 games, appeared in ten bowl games over 15 seasons, and was a three-time American Athletic Conference (AAC) Coach of the Year (2015, 2016, 2019). In his first year, he led the Spartans to a bowl eligible 7–5 season, and earned San Jose State its first consensus All-American in Nick Nash.[31] The San Jose State football team has been affiliated with six different athletics conferences since joining the California Coast Conference in 1922.[32] San Jose State has won 17 conference championships. From 1969 to 1995, San Jose State earned more Big West Conference football championship titles than any other team in the history of the Big West Conference.[3] The Spartans moved to the WAC in 1996 and later moved to the Mountain West Conference in 2013. † Co–champions San Jose State has made 13 bowl appearances and has an overall bowl game record of 7–6.[3] Their most recent bowl appearance was on December 23, 2023, when they faced Coastal Carolina in the 2023 Hawaii Bowl in Honolulu, Hawaii. Their next bowl appearance will be at the 2024 Hawaii Bowl, where San Jose State will face the South Florida Bulls. Known as Spartan Stadium for over eight decades, CEFCU stadium officially opened in 1933 as a 4,000-seat facility. The stadium featured large berms on the east, west, north and south sides of the field, which gave the stadium a \"sunken bowl\" appearance. The stadium's seating capacity was increased to 8,500 in 1936, and later expanded incrementally to a total seating capacity of just over 18,000 by 1948. The most recent additions came in the 1980s when the capacity of the stadium was expanded from approximately 18,000 to just over 31,000 by adding end zone bleachers, an upper deck and boxes on the west side. In 1998, the field was widened and other renovations were carried out for the MLS San Jose Earthquakes soccer team in accordance with official FIFA regulations.[33] As a result of these renovations, parts of the stands closest to the playing field were removed, thus lowering available seating for all sports to 30,456. In August 2016, Citizens Equity First Credit Union purchased sole naming rights to Spartan Stadium for $8.7 million. The deal between CEFCU and San José State University will last for 15 years.[34] In 2019, seating capacity was temporarily reduced to 21,520 as part of a massive east-side stadium renovation project. Phase I of the project, which included construction of the $70 million Spartan Athletic Center, was completed in August 2023. Phase II, which is tentatively slated to include installation of premium spectator seating on the stadium's east side, remains in the planning stages as of 2023. Other distinctive and unique features of the stadium include the original 1933 Romanesque balustrade spanning the entire east and west sidelines, and the CEFCU Stadium \"Ring of Honor\" displayed along the west side upper deck. The Battle for the Valley San Jose State's biggest rival is California State University, Fresno, due in large part to the two schools' geographic proximity and long history of competing in the same conferences.[35] Fresno is the largest city in the agriculturally rich San Joaquin Valley. San Jose is the largest city in the metropolitan capital of the high-tech Silicon Valley. The two schools are separated by approximately 150 driving miles. Beginning in 2013, the winner of the game is awarded the Valley Trophy.[36][37] San Jose State led the series from 1949 to 2001, but Fresno State tied it at 32–32–3 with a victory in 2002 and recaptured the lead in 2003. The Bulldogs and Spartans first played each other in 1921. As of 2023, Fresno State leads the football series 44–39–3. The two schools have met on the gridiron 86 times.[38] Bill Walsh Legacy Game The Bill Walsh Legacy Game is the name given to the rivalry between the Spartans and the Stanford Cardinal football team of Stanford University.[39][40] In 2007, following the death of San Jose State alumnus and former Stanford coach Bill Walsh, the near-annual game played between the two schools was renamed the Bill Walsh Legacy Game.[41] The rivalry is rooted in the two schools' close geographical proximity to one another, with the Stanford University campus being located just 23 driving miles northwest of the San Jose State campus on Interstate 280. The two teams have played each other 67 times since 1900. The rivalry is currently on hiatus due to non-conference scheduling conflicts, however, on June 22, 2022, Stanford and San Jose State announced an agreement to renew the rivalry with a six game home-and-home series beginning in 2024.[42][43] Stanford currently leads the series 52–14–1. Dick Tomey Legacy Game The two schools first met in 1936, and each team was previously led by legendary coach Dick Tomey. Tomey was a successful head coach at Hawaii from 1977 to 1986 and was a successful head coach at San Jose State from 2005 to 2009. The winner of the rivalry game each year takes possession of the Dick Tomey Legacy Trophy. The Rainbow Warriors and Spartans have played each other 46 times as of the 2023 season. In 1941, the San Jose State Spartans football team served unexpectedly with the Honolulu Police Department during World War II. The team had just arrived in Hawaii to play a series of postseason bowl games against the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors and the Willamette University Bearcats when the U.S. Navy base at Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7, 1941. The team was stranded on the islands for a number of weeks following the attack, and players were employed by the local police department to help improve island defenses against a possible Japanese amphibious assault and as guards for military bases on the island.[3][6] As of 2023, the Spartans lead the series 23–22–1. El Camino Real Rivalry The rivalry between the two Cal State schools dates back to 1935. The matchup is named after the historic 600-mile Camino Real that connects the 21 Spanish missions in California, stretching from San Diego Bay in the south to San Francisco Bay in the north. The San Diego State Aztecs and San Jose State Spartans have played each other 47 times as of the 2023 season. In 2014, there were conversations between the two programs about creating a trophy using an old mission bell or a replica of an old Spanish mission bell to be awarded to the winner of the rivalry game, but no trophy ever materialized.[44] The Spartans currently have the longest win streak in the series with 11 consecutive wins from 1938 to 1952. As of 2023, San Diego State leads the series 24–22–2. The University of Nevada, Reno and San Jose State first played each other in 1899. The Wolf Pack won the first meeting 6–0 in Reno on Thanksgiving Day. Bob Brule scored the game’s only touchdown and fell into an irrigation ditch behind the end zone, followed by three Cal State Normal School players.[citation needed] The series was tied at seven wins apiece at the close of the 2001 season, but SJSU fell to 4–16 against Nevada over the following 20 seasons (2002–2022). The two schools did not play each other from 1901 to 1930 and again from 1949 to 1991. The SJSU and Nevada campuses are located approximately 250 miles apart. The football teams have competed in the same conferences since 1992, first in the Big West Conference in the 1990s and then in the 2000s as members of the WAC. Since 2013, the two teams are West Division rivals in the Mountain West. Both schools are the oldest public institutions of higher education in their respective states of California and Nevada. SJSU was founded in 1857 while UNR was founded in 1874. As of 2024 Nevada leads the series 23–12–2. Victory Bell The now defunct, 100-year rivalry matchup between the SJSU Spartans and the Pacific Tigers began in 1895 and ended in 1995 when Pacific dropped its football program. The Spartan-Tiger football game was played 72 times between 1895 and 1995. Due to the \"private vs. public\" institutional competitiveness and the close geographical proximity of the two schools, a natural \"cross-town\" rivalry was born. University of the Pacific was founded in 1851 in Santa Clara, California, and claims to be the first institution of higher education in California.[45] San José State University was founded in 1857 and is California's first public institution of higher education. In 1949, in a game which drew national attention, the \"Victory Bell\" was unveiled.[46] The Victory Bell would go to the winner of subsequent Tiger-Spartan games. The bell was two feet tall and waist-high on a rolling cart. The bell was half black with an orange \"P\" for Pacific and half blue with a gold \"SJ\" for San Jose.[47] The Spartans led the series 43–23–6 when the rivalry ended at the close of the 1995 season. San Jose State earned its first national ranking in 1939, reaching the 18th spot in the Associated Press college football poll. Since then, the school has spent eight weeks ranked among the top–25 college football teams in the AP poll, including two post–season top–25 rankings. In 2020, the team received a postseason ranking in the AP Poll (24), Coaches Poll (24), and the College Football Playoff Rankings (22). San Jose State has had 29 head football coaches. There have been four periods in which the Spartans did not host a team (1894, 1896–1897, 1901–1920, 1943–1945).[48] In 2019, Dave Chaney was the first and thus far only Spartan to have his number retired. Chaney was a two-time All America linebacker who played for the Spartans from 1969 to 1971. In his three seasons, he established school career records for tackles, interception return yardage and interceptions returned for a touchdown. His 527 career tackles in just three seasons remains a San Jose State record. Although Chaney was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in 1972, he turned down the offer to pursue a career in education.[67] As of 2022, SJSU has produced over 90 All-America team members, including eight first-team selections, 22 second- and third-team selections, and over 65 honorable mentions.[68] As of 2024, Nick Nash became the first Spartan player to ever earn both consensus and unanimous All-American honors. Unanimous selections are indicated by a double asterisk (**) beside their name. Note: List below does not include honorable mention selections.[69] Two former SJSU players have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Bill Walsh attended San Jose State, where he played quarterback from 1953 to 1955. He went on to win three Super Bowls as the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. Dick Vermeil played for San Jose State as a backup quarterback before graduating in 1959 with a master's degree.[101] Vermeil later won Super Bowl XXXIV in 1999 as the head coach of the St. Louis Rams. Two former SJSU players have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Willie Heston attended San Jose State, where he played halfback from 1898 to 1900 before transferring to the University of Michigan. Heston has been named one of the greatest halfbacks in college football history.[104] Terry Donahue was a freshman walk-on defensive tackle for one year at San Jose State before transferring to UCLA. Donahue was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame for his contributions as the head coach at UCLA. Two former San Jose State coaches are also enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame, mostly for their contributions while coaching at other schools. Pop Warner led his teams to a combined four national championships while serving as the head coach at Pitt and Stanford. John Ralston led Stanford to multiple Rose Bowl victories before taking over as the head coach at SJSU from 1993 to 1996. Ralston was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1992. As of December 2022, 139 San Jose State players have gone on to play in the NFL,[109] and seven former Spartans are actively playing in the NFL as of August 2023.[3][110][111] The 139 players include 121 draftees, six NFL Pro Bowl selections, six first-round draft picks, two MVP award winners, and one NFL Rookie of the Year.[109][110] Along with Miami (OH), Dayton, Arkansas, Eastern Illinois, and Pacific, SJSU is one of only six programs in the nation to produce more than one alumnus who would go on to coach Super Bowl-winning teams. [112][3] As of May 2024, there are nine former SJSU players in the NFL.[113] Record at the conclusion of the 2023 NCAA Division I FBS football season.[114] Announced schedules as of August 11, 2024.[144]",

You hosted Thanksgiving dinner, baked sugar cookies and even made cute hors d’oeuvres for your friend’s Christmas party. Yep, you’ve spent quite enough time in the kitchen this holiday season, and so you’ve decided it’s time to treat yourself to a day off...preferably on Christmas Day or Christmas Eve. Fear not: This well-deserved act of defiance doesn’t mean you have to go hungry. Whether you’re seeking basic takeout or a cozy spot for dining in with a group, our round up of restaurants open on Christmas 2024 will do you right—provided you call your local chain to confirm days/hours before hanging up your apron, that is. Swing by any Village Inn location during their regular business hours on Christmas Eve for a casual dining experience, or perhaps just to scoop up one of their famous pies. (You know, in case you fell short of star baker status this year.) The restaurant chain will also be open until 4pm on Christmas Day so families can enjoy some good eats when the gift opening mayhem has passed. There’s nothing better than a short stack with a side of bacon after a whirlwind Christmas morning, especially when you don’t have to make it yourself, which is why I recommend you hop on over to your nearest International House of Pancakes. This popular breakfast chain will be open both on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, albeit with limited hours at certain locations. It’s also a fun place to go after a day full of Christmas crafts with the kids. Treat everyone to a stack of pancakes and some hot cocoa to reward their creativity and round out the festive fun! You can’t count on all the restaurants in this franchise to be open on Christmas, but a good number of them are. To be safe, check the holiday hours of your local Mickey D’s before you hit up the drive-thru for your fast-food fix. Your local Applebee’s will most likely be happy to take Christmas Eve cooking duties off your plate. Yep, all branches will be open and serving their typical family-friendly fare on the holiday, though some will have reduced hours.

KFC If you’re craving some Southern comfort this holiday season, you will be pleased to know that all KFC locations are operating during regular hours on Christmas Eve.

Burger King Good ol’ BK is among the several fast food restaurants that will be open on Christmas in 2024. Indeed, the joint will be grilling up fresh patties during regular hours on Christmas Eve. Some locations will also be open with reduced hours on Christmas Day, but it’s best to call before you go out of your way for your fast food fix. Still, it’s handy information to have—particularly if you’re traveling by car for the holidays and are looking for a quick drive-thru meal. 41. TGI Friday’s Christmas Eve might not fall on a Friday this year, but that’s not a reason to pass on a filling meal at the family-favorite restaurant chain TGI Friday’s, which will be open during regular hours at all locations on Tuesday, December 24. 20 Grocery Stores Open on Thanksgiving",

                "title": "Chevy Chase - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Cornelius Crane \"Chevy\" Chase (/ˈtʃɛvi/; born October 8, 1943) is an American comedian, actor, and writer. He became the breakout cast member in the first season of Saturday Night Live (1975–1976), where his recurring Weekend Update segment became a staple of the show. As both a performer and a writer on the series, he earned two Primetime Emmy Awards out of four nominations.[2][3] After leaving Saturday Night Live early in its second season, he established himself as a leading man, starring in some of the most successful comedy films of the 1980s, starting with his Golden Globe–nominated role in the romantic comedy Foul Play (1978).[3] Most famously, he portrayed Ty Webb in Caddyshack (1980) and Caddyshack II (1988), Clark W. Griswold in five National Lampoon's Vacation films, and Irwin \"Fletch\" Fletcher in Fletch (1985) and Fletch Lives (1989). He also starred in Oh! Heavenly Dog (1980), Modern Problems (1981), Spies Like Us (1985) and ¡Three Amigos! (1986). He has hosted the Academy Awards twice (1987 and 1988) and briefly had his own late-night talk show, The Chevy Chase Show (1993). Chase had a popularity resurgence with his role as Pierce Hawthorne on the NBC sitcom Community (2009–2014).[4][5] Cornelius Crane Chase was born in Lower Manhattan on October 8, 1943,[6] and grew up in Woodstock, New York.[7] He has an older brother, Ned Jr.[8] His father, Edward Tinsley \"Ned\" Chase (1919–2005),[9] was a Princeton-educated Manhattan book editor and magazine writer.[10] Chase's paternal grandfather was artist and illustrator Edward Leigh Chase, and his great-uncle was painter and teacher Frank Swift Chase. His mother, Cathalene Parker (née Browning; 1923–2005), was a concert pianist and librettist, whose father, Rear Admiral Miles Browning, served as Admiral Raymond A. Spruance's Chief of Staff on the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise at the Battle of Midway in World War II. Cathalene was adopted as a child by her stepfather, Cornelius Vanderbilt Crane, heir to The Crane Company, and took the name Catherine Crane.[11] Her mother, also named Cathalene, was an opera singer who performed several times at Carnegie Hall.[12] Chase was named for his adoptive grandfather, Cornelius, while the nickname \"Chevy\" was bestowed by his grandmother from the medieval English ballad \"The Ballad of Chevy Chase\". As a descendant of the Scottish Clan Douglas, she thought the name appropriate.[13] Chase is a 14th-generation New Yorker, and was listed in the Social Register at an early age. His mother's ancestors arrived in Manhattan starting in 1624 — among those ancestors are: According to his step-brother John: [Chevy] once told me that people who defined themselves in terms of their ancestry were like potatoes—the best parts of them were underground. He disdained the pretension of his mother's side of the family, as embodied by her mother, Cattie.[13] As a child, Chase vacationed at Castle Hill, the Cranes' summer estate in Ipswich, Massachusetts.[15] Chase's parents divorced when he was four; his father remarried into the Folgers coffee family, and his mother remarried twice. He has stated that he grew up in an upper middle class environment and that his adoptive maternal grandfather did not bequeath any assets to Chase's mother when he died.[16] In a 2007 biography, Chase stated that he was physically and psychologically abused as a child by his mother and stepfather, John Cederquist.[17] Both of his parents died in 2005.[citation needed] Chase was educated at Riverdale Country School,[18] an independent day school in the Riverdale neighborhood of The Bronx, New York City, before being expelled. He ultimately graduated as valedictorian in 1962 from the Stockbridge School,[19] an independent boarding school in the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts. At Stockbridge, he was known as a practical joker with an occasional mean streak. He attended Haverford College during the 1962–1963 term, where he was noted for slapstick comedy and an absurd sense of physical humor, including his signature pratfalls and \"sticking forks into his orifices\".[20] During a 2009 interview on the Today show, he ostensibly verified the oft-publicized urban legend that he was expelled for harboring a cow in his fourth floor room,[21] although his former roommate David Felsen asserted in a 2003 interview that Chase left for academic reasons.[20] Chase transferred to Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, where he studied a pre-med curriculum and graduated in 1967 with a Bachelor of Arts in English.[22] Chase did not enter medical school, which meant he was subject to the military draft. Chase was not drafted, and when he appeared in January 1989 as the first guest of the just-launched late-night The Pat Sajak Show, he said he had \"convinced\" his draft board he deserved a 4-F classification by \"'falsely' claiming, among other things, that he had homosexual tendencies\".[23] He played drums with the college band The Leather Canary, headed by school friends Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. Chase has called the group \"a bad jazz band\"; Becker and Fagen later founded the successful group Steely Dan. Chase has perfect pitch.[13] He played drums and keyboards for a rock band called Chamaeleon Church, which recorded one album for MGM Records before disbanding in 1969. To give the album a more soft-rock sound, producer Alan Lorber made several alterations in the mixing, including the muting of Chase's bass drum, and Chase was reportedly incensed when he heard the final mix.[24] Chase was a member of an early underground comedy ensemble called Channel One, which he co-founded in 1967. He also wrote a one-page spoof of Mission: Impossible for Mad magazine in 1970 and was a writer for the short-lived Smothers Brothers TV show comeback in the spring of 1975. Chase made the move to comedy as a full-time career by 1973, when he became a writer and cast member of The National Lampoon Radio Hour, a syndicated satirical radio series. The National Lampoon Radio Hour also featured John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, and Brian Doyle-Murray, all of whom later became the \"Not-Ready-For-Prime Time Players\" on NBC Saturday Night (later re-titled NBC's Saturday Night and finally Saturday Night Live). Chase and Belushi also appeared in National Lampoon's off-Broadway revue Lemmings, a sketch and musical send-up of popular youth culture, in which Chase also played the drums and piano during the musical numbers. He appeared in the movie The Groove Tube, which was directed by another co-founder of Channel One, Ken Shapiro, featuring several Channel One sketches.[citation needed] Chase was one of the original cast members of Saturday Night Live (SNL), NBC's late-night comedy television show, beginning in October 1975. During the first season, he introduced every show except two, with \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\" The remark was often preceded by a pratfall, known as \"The Fall of the Week\". Chase became known for his skill at physical comedy. In one comedy sketch, he mimicked a real-life incident in which President Gerald Ford accidentally tripped while disembarking from Air Force One in Salzburg, Austria.[25][26] This portrayal of President Ford as a bumbling klutz became a favorite device of Chase's, and helped form the popular concept of Ford as being a clumsy man despite Ford having been a \"star athlete\" during his university years.[27] In later years, Chase met and became friendly with President Ford.[27][28] Chase was the original anchor for the Weekend Update segment of SNL, and his catchphrase introduction, \"I'm Chevy Chase… and you're not\" became well known. His trademark conclusion, \"Good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow\" was later resurrected by Jane Curtin and Tina Fey. Chase also wrote comedy material for Weekend Update. For example, he wrote and performed \"The News for the Hard of Hearing\". In this skit, Chase read the top story of the day, aided by Garrett Morris, who repeated the story by loudly shouting it. Chase claimed that his version of Weekend Update was the inspiration for later news satire shows such as The Daily Show and The Colbert Report.[29] Weekend Update was later revived as a segment on The Chevy Chase Show,[30] a short-lived late-night talk show produced by Chase and broadcast by Fox Broadcasting Company. Chase was committed contractually to SNL for only one year as a writer and became a cast member during rehearsals just before the show's premiere. He received two Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for his comedy writing and live comic acting on the show. In Rolling Stone's February 2015 appraisal of all 141 SNL cast members to date, Chase was ranked tenth in overall importance. \"Strange as it sounds, Chase might be the most under-rated SNL player,\" they wrote. \"It took him only one season to define the franchise…without that deadpan arrogance, the whole SNL style of humor would fall flat.\"[31] In a 1975 New York magazine cover story, which called him \"The funniest man in America\", NBC executives referred to Chase as \"The first real potential successor to Johnny Carson\" and claimed he would begin guest-hosting The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson within six months of the article. Chase dismissed rumors that he could be the next Carson by telling New York, \"I'd never be tied down for five years interviewing TV personalities.\" Chase did not appear on the program until May 4, 1977, when he was promoting a prime-time special for NBC. Carson later said of Chase: \"He couldn't ad-lib a fart after a baked-bean dinner.\"[32] Chase acknowledged Ernie Kovacs's influence on his work in Saturday Night Live,[33] and he thanked Kovacs during his acceptance speech for his Emmy Award.[34] In addition, Chase spoke of Kovacs's influence on his work in an appearance in the 1982 documentary called Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius.[35] In late 1976, in the middle of SNL's second season, Chase became the first member of the original cast to leave the show. While he landed starring roles in several films on the strength of his SNL fame, he asserted that the principal reason for his departure was the reluctance of his girlfriend, Jacqueline Carlin, to move to New York.[36] Chase moved to Los Angeles, married Carlin, and was replaced by Bill Murray, although he made a few cameo appearances on the show during the second season. Chase hosted SNL eight times from 1978 to 1997.[37] In regards to Chase's 1997 appearance as a host, SNL creator and show-runner Lorne Michaels disputed reports that he was shocked by Chase's behavior or had banned him as a result, claims which he calls \"idiotic\".[38] While Chase has not returned to SNL to host since 1997, he appeared on the show's 25th anniversary special in 1999 and was interviewed for a 2005 NBC special on the first five years of SNL. Later appearances included a Caddyshack skit featuring Bill Murray, a 1997 episode with guest host Chris Farley, as the Land Shark in a Weekend Update segment in 2001, another Weekend Update segment in 2007, and in Justin Timberlake's monologue in 2013 as a member of the Five-Timers Club, where he was reunited with his Three Amigos co-stars Steve Martin and Martin Short. He also participated in the 40th anniversary special in February 2015.[39] Chase's early film roles included Tunnel Vision; Foul Play, a box-office hit that earned more than $44 million;[40] and Oh! Heavenly Dog. The role of Eric \"Otter\" Stratton in National Lampoon's Animal House was written with Chase in mind, but he turned the role down to work on Foul Play.[16] The role went to Tim Matheson instead. Chase said in an interview that he chose to do Foul Play so he could do \"real acting\" for the first time in his career instead of just \"schtick\".[41] Chase followed Foul Play in 1980 with the Harold Ramis comedy Caddyshack. A major box office success that pulled in $39 million off a $6 million budget,[42] the movie has become a classic. It reached a 73% approval rate on Rotten Tomatoes, with critics saying: \"Though unabashedly crude and juvenile, Caddyshack nevertheless scores with its classic slapstick, unforgettable characters, and endlessly quotable dialogue\"[citation needed]. That same year, he reunited with Foul Play co-star Goldie Hawn for Neil Simon's Seems Like Old Times, a box-office success that earned more than $43 million.[43] He then released a self-titled record album, co-produced by Chase and Tom Scott, with novelty and cover versions of songs by Randy Newman, Barry White, Bob Marley, the Beatles, Donna Summer, Tennessee Ernie Ford, The Troggs, and The Sugarhill Gang. Chase narrowly escaped death by electrocution during the filming of Modern Problems in 1980. During a sequence in which Chase's character wears \"landing lights\" as he dreams that he is an airplane, the lights malfunctioned and an electric current passed through Chase's arm, back, and neck muscles. The near-death experience followed the end of his marriage to Carlin, and Chase experienced a period of deep depression. Chase continued his film career in 1983's National Lampoon's Vacation. Directed by Ramis and written by John Hughes, the movie grossed $61 million[44] on a $15 million budget—his most successful movie yet. He married Jayni Luke in 1982. In 1985, he starred in Fletch, which grossed more than $50 million off an $8 million budget.[45] He would later make another movie based on Gregory Mcdonald's Fletch books. Chase later co-starred with fellow SNL alum Dan Aykroyd in Spies Like Us. Chase joined SNL veterans Steve Martin and Martin Short in the Lorne Michaels–produced comedy Three Amigos in 1986, declaring in an interview that making Three Amigos was the most fun he had making a film. In 1987, his Cornelius Productions company signed a non-exclusive, first-refusal deal to develop four feature projects at the Warner Bros. studio, and set up a fifth project at Universal Pictures.[46] In 1988, he starred alongside Madolyn Smith in Funny Farm, a sizeable hit at $25 million that reached 65% approval rate on Rotten Tomatoes. At the height of his career in the late 1980s, Chase earned around US$7 million per film and was a highly visible celebrity. He appeared alongside Paul Simon, one of his best friends, in Simon's 1986 second video for \"You Can Call Me Al\", in which he lip-syncs all of Simon's lyrics.[47] Chase hosted the Academy Awards in 1987 and 1988, opening the telecast in 1988 with the quip, \"Good evening, Hollywood phonies!\" Chase filmed a sequel to Vacation, 1985's National Lampoon's European Vacation, which pulled in just shy of $50 million at the box office.[48] A third film, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation in 1989, pulled in $71 million and, thanks to its holiday theme, has become one of his more durable films.[49] He played saxophone onstage at Simon's free concert at the Great Lawn in Central Park in the summer of 1991. Later in 1991, he helped record and appeared in the music video \"Voices That Care\" to entertain and support U.S. troops involved in Operation Desert Storm, and supported the International Red Cross. Chase had three consecutive film flops: 1991's Razzie Award-nominated Nothing but Trouble, 1992's Memoirs of an Invisible Man, and 1994's Cops & Robbersons. The three releases had a combined gross of $34 million in the United States. In September 1993, Chase hosted The Chevy Chase Show, a weeknight talk show, for the Fox Broadcasting Company. Although it had high commercial expectations, the show was cancelled by Fox after five weeks. Chase later appeared in a commercial for Doritos, airing during the Super Bowl, in which he made humorous reference to the show's failure.[citation needed] Chase found success with some of his subsequent movies. 1995's Man of the House, co-starring Farrah Fawcett, was relatively successful, grossing $40 million[50] and 1997's Vegas Vacation was a box office success, grossing $36.4 million.[51] 2000's Snow Day, in which Chase appeared, was also successful grossing over $60 million,[52] as well as Orange County in 2002, grossing more than $40 million.[53] Chase was Hasty Pudding's 1993 Man of the Year, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in that same year.[54] He also received The Harvard Lampoon's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.[55] He was roasted by the New York Friars Club for a Comedy Central television special in 2002. This roast was noted for being unusually vitriolic, even by the standards of a roast.[56] Some of the more recent films starring Chase (e.g., Vacuums, Rent-a-Husband, Goose!) have not been widely released in the United States. He returned to mainstream movie-making in 2006, co-starring with Tim Allen and Courteney Cox in the comedy Zoom, though it was both a critical and commercial failure. Chase guest-starred as an anti-Semitic murder suspect in \"In Vino Veritas\", the November 3, 2006, episode of Law & Order. He also guest-starred in the ABC drama series Brothers & Sisters in two episodes as a former love interest of Sally Field's character. Chase appeared in a prominent recurring role as villainous software magnate Ted Roark on the NBC spy-comedy Chuck. In 2009, Chase and Dan Aykroyd voiced themselves in the Family Guy episode \"Spies Reminiscent of Us\". Starting in 2009, Chase returned to NBC in the sitcom Community, as aging moist-towelette tycoon Pierce Hawthorne. The show was created by Dan Harmon and starred Joel McHale, Alison Brie, Gillian Jacobs, Donald Glover, Danny Pudi, and Yvette Nicole Brown. The series received critical acclaim for its acting and writing, appeared on numerous critics' year-end \"best-of\" lists and developed a cult following.[57][58] The New York Times critic Alessandra Stanley praised the casting of Chase writing, \"Jeff has the kind of sardonic repartee and slapdash nonchalance that the comedian Chevy Chase had when he was the young star of the ’Fletch’ movies,\" while adding, \"Even that is an inside casting joke: Mr. Chase, who is farcically loopy and delightful in the pilot.” [59] In 2010, he appeared in the film Hot Tub Time Machine which received some praise. Throughout the filming of Community seasons one through four, Chase became increasingly angry and uncomfortable with the direction of his character, Pierce, who is a bigot. It was reported that in 2012 Chase \"snapped and launched the tirade, airing his frustration and suggesting that the way things with Pierce are going, he may next be asked to call Troy (Glover) or Shirley (Brown) the N-word\". While Chase apologized for his outburst he proceeded to leave the show,[60][61] due to increasing disagreements with his character and the show's creator Dan Harmon. After a mutual agreement with the network, his character was abruptly written out of the fourth season of Community.[60] Chase later claimed that his exit was due to his personal opinions of the show rather than the outburst, claiming that it \"wasn't funny enough\".[62] His departure was cemented by the writers making the creative decision to kill off Pierce, in the third episode of Community's fifth season.[63] In 2013 Chase appeared in a short online film featuring the Griswold Family, and in the Funny or Die original comedy sketch \"Presidential Reunion\", where he played President Ford alongside other current and former SNL president impersonators. In 2015, Chase reprised his role as Clark Griswold in the fifth Vacation installment, titled Vacation. Unlike the previous four films in which Clark is the main protagonist, he only has a brief though pivotal cameo appearance. In spite of largely negative critical reception, the film proved to be a financial success, grossing over $107 million worldwide,[64] making it the highest-grossing entry to date.[citation needed] 2019 saw him in the Netflix movie The Last Laugh where he starred alongside Richard Dreyfuss. Chase married Susan Hewitt in New York City on February 23, 1973. They divorced on February 1, 1976. His second marriage, to Jacqueline Carlin, was formalized on December 4, 1976, and ended in divorce on November 14, 1980; they had no children.[65] Chase resided in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles from 1980 until 1995 in a Tudor-style home. He was the Honorary Mayor of Pacific Palisades between 1986 and 1988.[66][67] He married his third wife, Jayni Luke, in Pacific Palisades on June 19, 1982.[68] He and Luke have three daughters, Cydney, Caley, and Emily.[8] The couple reside in Bedford, New York.[69] In 1986, Chase was admitted to the Betty Ford Center for treatment of a prescription painkiller addiction. His use began after he experienced ongoing back pain related to the pratfalls he took during his Saturday Night Live appearances.[70] In 2010, he said that his drug abuse had been \"low level.\"[71] He entered the Hazelden Clinic in September 2016 to receive treatment for alcoholism.[72] An active environmentalist and philanthropist, Chase is a political liberal. He campaigned for Bill Clinton in the 1990s, and for John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election.[73][74] In 2004, he mocked President George W. Bush during a speech at a People for the American Way benefit at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where he referred to Bush as an \"uneducated, real lying schmuck\" and a \"dumb fuck\", which upset the organizers and the crowd, leading Norman Lear to categorize the statements as \"utterly untoward.\"[75] While filming an episode of Saturday Night Live in 1978, Chase got into a fistfight with Bill Murray in John Belushi's dressing room. Murray and Chase's backstage brawl took place when Chase returned to host the show after his exit as a full-time cast member in 1976. Murray had reportedly made a derogatory comment about Chase's troubled marriage to Jacqueline Carlin, leading Chase to criticize Murray's physical appearance. SNL cast members Jane Curtin, Laraine Newman, and Gilda Radner witnessed the incident.[76][citation needed] In a talk show appearance in 2021, Newman noted of the altercation, \"it was very sad and painful and awful\". She went on to say, \"I think they both knew the one thing that they could say to one another that would hurt the most and that's what I think incited it.\" Chase and Murray would later reconcile to star together in Caddyshack in 1980.[77] On September 23, 1993, Chase received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard.[54]",

Or, since the Cheviot Hills run along the middle of the border country, which was partly under cultivation, and the hills’ “chases” (unenclosed hunting grounds reserved for their owners’ use) were popular hiding and hunting areas for both sides, perhaps “Cheviot” and “chase” were combined to create the name “Chevy Chase.” Whatever its derivation, the name became the title of the English version of a ballad memorializing the famous Battle of Otterbourne which took place at Otterburn, in the Cheviot Hills, Northumberland, England, in August 1388, between the Scottish troops of James, Earl of Douglas and Englishmen led by Lord Harry “Hotspur” Percy, who challenged Douglas by mounting a deer hunt in the hills. The battle was stubborn and bloody, fought hand to hand in the dark -- and may have been fought hand to hand through the night. The Scots prevailed, but many troops were lost, and Douglas died. The Ballads “Popularizing” the Name The battle became part of Scottish and English folklore, moving from oral to written tradition, first in the form of the Scottish ballad, “Battle of Otterbourne,” then in the English version, “Chevy Chase.” These were sung well into the 19thcentury in America as well as in Britain. The different perspectives of the Scottish and the English people are apparent, although nuanced, in their ballads. [See notes 1 and 2 below.] There are substantive differences as well – for example, the Scottish version is correct that Percy survived the battle. (Indeed, the Scots held Percy and his brother Ralph for ransom.) Yet it is unclear whether the Scottish version is correct that the battle continued through the night, or whether it ended earlier as the English version has it. The Scottish version apparently is correct that Douglas was wounded in personal combat with Percy, and not struck by an English arrow as the English ballad relates [See note 3]. But was it actually Douglas’ nephew Sir Hugh Montgomery who took Percy hostage, as the Scottish version recounts?

The Naming of our Community The Chevy Chase Land Company took the name \"Chevy Chase\" from a 200-plus acre tract of land that the Land Company purchased to include in its planned street car suburb. The tract was identified in its 1751 proprietary patent as \"Cheivy Chace.\" It was part of an earlier, larger grant also named Cheivy Chace, deeded from Lord Baltimore to Colonel Joseph Belt. The Belt estate gradually was broken up. The owner of one part was Abraham Bradley, who was Assistant Postmaster General of the United States in 1814, and is rumored to have sheltered several cabinet members (and the valuable government documents they were carrying) at \"Bradley Farm\" when the British burned the White House. After the Land Company purchased the farm, it became home to the Chevy Chase Hunt - appropriately enough, given the origin of the name. The hunt later became the Chevy Chase Club. In 1892, John Frank Ellis purchased 14 ½ acres of farm land along Brookville Road from J.M.C. Williams. Ellis plotted 69 house lots and put them up for sale in 1894, \"spinning off\" of the Chevy Chase name by calling his development \"Otterbourne\" on Connecticut Avenue \"at Chevy Chase.\" The development depended on the same Connecticut Avenue street car line that served the Land Company's new development of Chevy Chase Section 2; Ellis gave its streets the battle-related names of Melrose Street (now Thornapple Court), Dalkeith Street, Douglas Street (now Underwood Street), and Percy Street (now Thornapple Street); and it became Section 6 of the Village of Chevy Chase, then part of Section 5. The southern row of the Otterbourne lots now is the boundary between Sections 3 and 5. It blocks Delaware, Florida, Fulton, and Georgia Street from going through to Thornapple Street.

                "title": "The Ballad of Chevy Chase - Wikipedia",
                "content": "\"The Ballad of Chevy Chase\" is an English ballad, catalogued as Child Ballad 162 (Roud 223[1]). There are two extant ballads under this title, both of which narrate the same story. As ballads existed within oral tradition before being written down, other versions of this once-popular song also may have existed. Its tune has been used by other, unconnected songs. The ballads tell the story of a large hunting party upon a parcel of hunting land (or chase) in the Cheviot Hills, a range of rolling hills straddling the Anglo-Scottish border between Northumberland and the Scottish Borders—hence, Chevy Chase. The hunt is led by Percy, the English Earl of Northumberland, against the wishes of the Scottish Earl Douglas, who had forbidden it. Douglas interprets the party's arrival as an invasion of Scotland and attacks. Only 110 people survive the bloody battle that follows. Thomas Percy and scholar Francis J. Child noted similarities with the older \"The Battle of Otterburn\", about the 1388 Battle of Otterburn. Neither set of lyrics is completely historically accurate.[2] Versions of either ballad often contain parallel biographical and historical information; nonetheless, the differences led Child to believe that they did not originally refer to the same occurrence.[3] Simpson suggests that the music of \"Chevy Chase\" was identical to the tune of \"Flying Flame\", in which the former superseded the latter by the beginning of the seventeenth century.[4] Both ballads were collected in Thomas Percy's Reliques. The first of the ballads is in Francis James Child's English and Scottish Popular Ballads. Different versions were collected in England, Scotland, and the United States.[1] Versions of \"The Ballad of Chevy Chase\" exist in several ballad collections, including the Roxburghe Ballads, the Pepys Library, the Huntington Library Miscellaneous, the Glasgow University Library, and the Crawford Collection at the National Library of Scotland. The ballads in these collections were printed with variations between 1623 and 1760.[5] Online facsimiles of the ballad are also available for public consumption at the English Broadside Ballad Archive and other online repositories. The first of the two ballads of Chevy Chase may have been written as early as the 1430s, but the earliest record we have of it is in The Complaynt of Scotland, printed around 1549. One of the first printed books in Middle Scots, the book calls the ballad The Hunting of Cheviot. The first manuscript version of the ballad was written around 1550 (MS Ashmole 48, Bodleian Library).[6] In the seventeenth century, the tune was licensed in 1624 and again in 1675.[7] In 1711, Joseph Addison wrote in The Spectator: The old song of \"Chevy-Chase\" is the favourite ballad of the common people of England, and Ben Jonson used to say he had rather have been the author of it than of all his works. Sir Philip Sidney, in his discourse of Poetry [The Defence of Poesie], speaks of it in the following words: \"I never heard the old song of Percy and Douglas that I found not my heart more moved than with a trumpet; and yet it is sung by some blind crowder with no rougher voice than rude style, which being so evil apparelled in the dust and cobweb of that uncivil age, what would it work trimmed in the gorgeous eloquence of Pindar?\" For my own part, I am so professed an admirer of this antiquated song, that I shall give my reader a critique upon it without any further apology for so doing.[8] Apparently, Addison was unaware that the ballad, which he proceeded to analyze in detail, was not the same work praised by Sidney and Jonson.[8] The second of the ballads appears to have been written in modernized English shortly after Sidney's comments, perhaps around 1620, and to have become the better-known version. William Hutton, in A Journey from Birmingham to London (1785), mentions \"the old song of Chevy Chace\" and its tale about \"the animosity between England and Scotland\".[10] In Sir Walter Scott's Rob Roy (1817), the main character, Frank, upon seeing the trophies on the walls of Osbaldistone hall, imagines them being from the Chevy Chase. An early and popular painting of 1825–6 by Edwin Landseer was titled The Hunting of Chevy Chase. In Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights (1847), Catherine Heathcliff (née Catherine Linton) scorns Hareton Earnshaw's primitive attempts at reading, saying, \"I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did yesterday; it was extremely funny!\"[11] In Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South (1855), on hearing the conversation between Mr. Thornton and her father, Margaret Hale wonders, “How in the world had they got from cog-wheels to Chevy Chace?”[12] In F. Anstey's Vice Versa (1882), the boys at Dr. Grimstone's boarding school are required to play a game called \"chevy\" (a version of \"prisoners' base\" or \"darebase\"), \"so called from the engagement famed in ballad and history\".[13] A tract of land in British America was named \"Cheivy Chace\" by 1725, and was in the 1890s and early 1900s developed into the affluent areas of Chevy Chase, Maryland, and Chevy Chase, Washington, D.C. A golf club in the Maryland Chevy Chase inspired the name of Chevy Chase, Lexington, Kentucky. A shopping mall in the Eldon Square Shopping Centre in Newcastle upon Tyne is named \"Chevy Chase\" in allusion to the ballad.[14] The ballad inspired the childhood nickname and adult stage name of the American comedian and actor Chevy Chase (born Cornelius Crane Chase, 1943). The ballad has given the English language the verb to chivvy, meaning to pester or encourage someone to perform a task.[15][16]",

                "content": "A Christmas Carol. In Prose. Being a Ghost Story of Christmas, commonly known as A Christmas Carol, is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in London by Chapman & Hall in 1843 and illustrated by John Leech. It recounts the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, an elderly miser who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. In the process, Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man. Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol during a period when the British were exploring and re-evaluating past Christmas traditions, including carols, and newer customs such as cards and Christmas trees. He was influenced by the experiences of his own youth and by the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several establishments for London's street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a selfish man to redeem himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this is a fully secular story, or if it is a Christian allegory. Published on 19 December, the first edition sold out by Christmas Eve; by the end of 1844 thirteen editions had been released. Most critics reviewed the novella favourably. The story was illicitly copied in January 1844; Dickens took legal action against the publishers, who went bankrupt, further reducing Dickens's small profits from the publication. He subsequently wrote four other Christmas stories. In 1849 he began public readings of the story, which proved so successful he undertook 127 further performances until 1870, the year of his death. A Christmas Carol has never been out of print and has been translated into several languages; the story has been adapted many times for film, stage, opera and other media. A Christmas Carol captured the zeitgeist of the early Victorian revival of the Christmas holiday. Dickens acknowledged the influence of the modern Western observance of Christmas and later inspired several aspects of Christmas, including family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit. The book is divided into five chapters, which Dickens titled \"staves\". A Christmas Carol opens on a bleak, cold Christmas Eve in London, seven years after the death of Ebenezer Scrooge's business partner, Jacob Marley. Scrooge, an ageing miser, dislikes Christmas and refuses a dinner invitation from his nephew Fred. He turns away two men seeking a donation to provide food and heating for the poor and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom. That night Scrooge is visited at home by Marley's ghost, who wanders the Earth entwined by heavy chains and money boxes forged during a lifetime of greed and selfishness. Marley tells Scrooge that he has a single chance to avoid the same fate: he will be visited by three spirits and must listen or be cursed to carry much heavier chains of his own. The first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood, reminding him of a time when he was more innocent. The scenes reveal Scrooge's lonely childhood at boarding school, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, the long-dead mother of Fred, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr Fezziwig, who treated him like a son. Scrooge's neglected fiancée Belle is shown ending their relationship, as she realises that he will never love her as much as he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on the Christmas Eve that Marley died. Scrooge, upset by hearing a description of the man that he has become, demands that the ghost remove him from the house. The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to a joyous market with people buying the makings of Christmas dinner and to celebrations of Christmas in a miner's cottage and in a lighthouse. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred's Christmas party. A major part of this stave is taken up with Bob Cratchit's family feast and introduces his youngest son, Tiny Tim, a happy boy who is seriously ill. The spirit informs Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die unless the course of events changes. Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want. He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge's concern for their welfare. The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The silent ghost reveals scenes involving the death of a disliked man whose funeral is attended by local businessmen only on condition that lunch is provided. His charwoman, laundress and the local undertaker steal his possessions to sell to a fence. When he asks the spirit to show a single person who feels emotion over his death, he is only given the pleasure of a poor couple who rejoice that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. When Scrooge asks to see tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the death of Tiny Tim. The ghost then allows Scrooge to see a neglected grave, with a tombstone bearing Scrooge's name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to change his ways. Scrooge awakens on Christmas morning a changed man. He makes a large donation to the charity he rejected the previous day, anonymously sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner and spends the afternoon at Fred's Christmas party. The following day he gives Cratchit an increase in pay, and begins to become a father figure to Tiny Tim. From then on Scrooge treats everyone with kindness, generosity and compassion, embodying the spirit of Christmas. The writer Charles Dickens was born to a middle-class family which got into financial difficulties as a result of the spendthrift nature of his father John. In 1824 John was committed to the Marshalsea, a debtors' prison in Southwark, London. Dickens, aged 12, was forced to pawn his collection of books, leave school and work at a dirty and rat-infested shoe-blacking factory. The change in circumstances gave him what his biographer, Michael Slater, describes as a \"deep personal and social outrage\", which heavily influenced his writing and outlook.[1] By the end of 1842 Dickens was a well-established author with six major works[n 1] as well as several short stories, novellas and other pieces.[2] On 31 December that year he began publishing his novel Martin Chuzzlewit as a monthly serial;[n 2] it was his favourite work, but sales were disappointing and he faced temporary financial difficulties.[3] Celebrating the Christmas season had been growing in popularity through the Victorian era.[4] The Christmas tree was introduced in Britain during the 18th century, and its use was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.[5] In the early 19th century there had been a revival of interest in Christmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years. The publication of Davies Gilbert's 1823 work Some Ancient Christmas Carols, With the Tunes to Which They Were Formerly Sung in the West of England and William Sandys's 1833 collection Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern led to a growth in the form's popularity in Britain.[6] Dickens had an interest in Christmas, and his first story on the subject was \"Christmas Festivities\", published in Bell's Weekly Messenger in 1835; the story was then published as \"A Christmas Dinner\" in Sketches by Boz (1836).[7] \"The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton\", another Christmas story, appeared in the 1836 novel The Pickwick Papers. In the episode, a Mr Wardle describes a misanthropic sexton, Gabriel Grub, who undergoes a Christmas conversion after being visited by goblins who show him the past and future.[8] Slater considers that \"the main elements of the Carol are present in the story\", but not yet in a firm form.[9] The story is followed by a passage about Christmas in Dickens's editorial Master Humphrey's Clock.[9] The professor of English literature Paul Davis writes that although the \"Goblins\" story appears to be a prototype of A Christmas Carol, all Dickens's earlier writings about Christmas influenced the story.[10] Dickens was not the first author to celebrate the Christmas season in literature.[11] Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819–20 work The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham.[12] The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that returning to Christmas traditions might promote a type of social connection that they felt had been lost in the modern world.[13] Several works had an influence on the writing of A Christmas Carol, including two essays by his friend Douglas Jerrold: one from an 1841 issue of Punch, \"How Mr. Chokepear Keeps a Merry Christmas\" and one from 1843, \"The Beauties of the Police\".[14] More broadly, Dickens was influenced by fairy tales and nursery stories, which he closely associated with Christmas, because he saw them as stories of conversion and transformation.[15] Dickens was touched by the lot of poor children in the middle decades of the 19th century.[16] In early 1843 he toured the Cornish tin mines, where he was angered by seeing children working in appalling conditions.[17] The suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital's half-starved, illiterate street children.[18] In February 1843 the Second Report of the Children's Employment Commission was published. It was a parliamentary report exposing the effects of the Industrial Revolution upon working class children. Horrified by what he read, Dickens planned to publish an inexpensive political pamphlet tentatively titled, An Appeal to the People of England, on behalf of the Poor Man's Child, but changed his mind, deferring the pamphlet's production until the end of the year.[19] In March he wrote to Dr Southwood Smith, one of the four commissioners responsible for the Second Report, about his change in plans: \"you will certainly feel that a Sledge hammer has come down with twenty times the force—twenty thousand times the force—I could exert by following out my first idea\".[20] In a fundraising speech on 5 October 1843 at the Manchester Athenaeum, Dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform,[21] and realised in the days following that the most effective way to reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write a deeply felt Christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays.[22] By mid-1843 Dickens began to suffer from financial problems. Sales of Martin Chuzzlewit were falling off, and his wife, Catherine, was pregnant with their fifth child. Matters worsened when Chapman & Hall, his publishers, threatened to reduce his monthly income by £50 if sales dropped further.[23] He began A Christmas Carol in October 1843.[24] Michael Slater, Dickens's biographer, describes the book as being \"written at white heat\"; it was completed in six weeks, the final pages being written in early December.[25] He built much of the work in his head while taking night-time walks of 15 to 20 miles (24 to 32 km) around London.[26] Dickens's sister-in-law wrote how he \"wept, and laughed, and wept again, and excited himself in a most extraordinary manner, in composition\".[27] Slater says that A Christmas Carol was intended to open its readers' hearts towards those struggling to survive on the lower rungs of the economic ladder and to encourage practical benevolence, but also to warn of the terrible danger to society created by the toleration of widespread ignorance and actual want among the poor.[16] George Cruikshank, the illustrator who had earlier worked with Dickens on Sketches by Boz (1836) and Oliver Twist (1838), introduced him to the caricaturist John Leech. By 24 October Dickens invited Leech to work on A Christmas Carol, and four hand-coloured etchings and four black-and-white wood engravings by the artist accompanied the text.[28] Dickens's hand-written manuscript of the story does not include the sentence in the penultimate paragraph \"... and to Tiny Tim, who did not die\"; this was added later, during the printing process.[29][n 3] The central character of A Christmas Carol is Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly London-based businessman,[30] is described in the story as \"a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!\"[31] Kelly writes that Scrooge may have been influenced by Dickens's conflicting feelings for his father, whom he both loved and demonised. This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man.[32] The professor of English literature Robert Douglas-Fairhurst considers that in the opening part of the book covering young Scrooge's lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty \"is something of a self-parody of Dickens's fears about himself\"; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself.[33] Scrooge could also be based on two misers: the eccentric John Elwes, MP,[34] or Jemmy Wood, the owner of the Gloucester Old Bank and also known as \"The Gloucester Miser\".[35] According to the sociologist Frank W. Elwell, Scrooge's views on the poor are a reflection of those of the demographer and political economist Thomas Malthus,[36] while the miser's questions \"Are there no prisons? ... And the Union workhouses? ... The treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\" are a reflection of a sarcastic question raised by the philosopher Thomas Carlyle, \"Are there not treadmills, gibbets; even hospitals, poor-rates, New Poor-Law?\"[37][n 4] There are literary precursors for Scrooge in Dickens's own works. Peter Ackroyd, Dickens's biographer, sees similarities between the character and the elder Martin Chuzzlewit character, although the miser is \"a more fantastic image\" than the Chuzzlewit patriarch; Ackroyd observes that Chuzzlewit's transformation to a charitable figure is a parallel to that of the miser.[39] Douglas-Fairhurst sees that the minor character Gabriel Grub from The Pickwick Papers was also an influence when creating Scrooge.[40][n 5] It is possible that Scrooge's name came from a tombstone Dickens had seen on a visit to Edinburgh. The grave was for Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose job was given as a meal man—a corn merchant; Dickens misread the inscription as \"mean man\".[42][n 6] This theory has been described as \"a probable Dickens hoax\" for which \"[n]o one could find any corroborating evidence\".[44] When Dickens was young he lived near a tradesman's premises with the sign \"Goodge and Marney\", which may have provided the name for Scrooge's former business partner.[45] For the chained Marley, Dickens drew on his memory of a visit to the Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in March 1842, where he saw—and was affected by seeing—fettered prisoners.[37] For the character Tiny Tim, Dickens used his nephew Henry, a disabled boy who was five at the time A Christmas Carol was written.[46][n 7] The two figures of Want and Ignorance, sheltering in the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present, were inspired by the children Dickens had seen on his visit to a ragged school in the East End of London.[18] The transformation of Scrooge is central to the story.[48] Davis considers Scrooge to be \"a protean figure always in process of reformation\";[49] Kelly writes that the transformation is reflected in the description of Scrooge, who begins as a two-dimensional character, but who then grows into one who \"possess[es] an emotional depth [and] a regret for lost opportunities\".[50] Some writers, including the Dickens scholar Grace Moore, consider that there is a Christian theme running through A Christmas Carol, and that the novella should be seen as an allegory of the Christian concept of redemption.[51][n 8] Dickens's biographer, Claire Tomalin, sees the conversion of Scrooge as carrying the Christian message that \"even the worst of sinners may repent and become a good man\".[54] Dickens's attitudes towards organised religion were complex;[n 9] he based his beliefs and principles on the New Testament.[53] His statement that Marley \"had no bowels\" is a reference to the \"bowels of compassion\" mentioned in the First Epistle of John, the reason for his eternal damnation.[57][n 10] Other writers, including Kelly, consider that Dickens put forward a \"secular vision of this sacred holiday\".[11] The Dickens scholar John O. Jordan argues that A Christmas Carol shows what Dickens referred to in a letter to his friend John Forster as his \"Carol philosophy, cheerful views, sharp anatomisation of humbug, jolly good temper ... and a vein of glowing, hearty, generous, mirthful, beaming reference in everything to Home and Fireside\".[58] From a secular viewpoint, the cultural historian Penne Restad suggests that Scrooge's redemption underscores \"the conservative, individualistic and patriarchal aspects\" of Dickens's \"Carol philosophy\" of charity and altruism.[59] Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol in response to British social attitudes towards poverty, particularly child poverty, and wished to use the novella as a means to put forward his arguments against it.[60] The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance.[61] The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim.[62] Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity without alienating his largely middle-class readership.[63] As the result of the disagreements with Chapman and Hall over the commercial failures of Martin Chuzzlewit,[64] Dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself, in exchange for a percentage of the profits.[33] Production of A Christmas Carol was not without problems. The first printing was meant to have festive green endpapers, but they came out a dull olive colour. Dickens' publisher Chapman and Hall replaced these with yellow endpapers and reworked the title page in harmonising red and blue shades.[65] The final product was bound in red cloth with gilt-edged pages, completed only two days before the publication date of 19 December 1843.[66] Following publication, Dickens arranged for the manuscript to be bound in red Morocco leather and presented as a gift to his solicitor, Thomas Mitton.[67][n 11] Priced at five shillings (equal to £31 in 2024 pounds),[68] the first run of 6,000 copies sold out by Christmas Eve. Chapman and Hall issued second and third editions before the new year, and the book continued to sell well into 1844.[70] By the end of 1844 eleven more editions had been released.[71] Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.[72] It was Dickens's most popular book in the United States, and sold over two million copies in the hundred years following its first publication there.[52] The high production costs upon which Dickens insisted led to reduced profits, and the first edition brought him only £230 (equal to £29,000 in 2024 pounds)[68] rather than the £1,000 (equal to £124,000 in 2024 pounds)[68] he expected.[73] A year later, the profits were only £744, and Dickens was deeply disappointed.[64][n 12] According to Douglas-Fairhurst, contemporary reviews of A Christmas Carol \"were almost uniformly kind\".[75] The Illustrated London News described how the story's \"impressive eloquence ... its unfeigned lightness of heart—its playful and sparkling humour ... its gentle spirit of humanity\" all put the reader \"in good humour with ourselves, with each other, with the season and with the author\".[76] The critic from The Athenaeum, the literary magazine, considered it a \"tale to make the reader laugh and cry – to open his hands, and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable ... a dainty dish to set before a King.\"[77] William Makepeace Thackeray, writing in Fraser's Magazine, described the book as \"a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness. The last two people I heard speak of it were women; neither knew the other, or the author, and both said, by way of criticism, 'God bless him!'\"[74] The poet Thomas Hood, in his own journal, wrote that \"If Christmas, with its ancient and hospitable customs, its social and charitable observances, were ever in danger of decay, this is the book that would give them a new lease.\"[78] The reviewer for Tait's Edinburgh Magazine—Theodore Martin, who was usually critical of Dickens's work[75]—spoke well of A Christmas Carol, noting it was \"a noble book, finely felt and calculated to work much social good\".[79] After Dickens's death, Margaret Oliphant deplored the turkey and plum pudding aspects of the book but admitted that in the days of its first publication it was regarded as \"a new gospel\", and noted that the book was unique in that it made people behave better.[75] The religious press generally ignored the tale but, in January 1844, Christian Remembrancer thought the tale's old and hackneyed subject was treated in an original way and praised the author's sense of humour and pathos.[80] The writer and social thinker John Ruskin told a friend that he thought Dickens had taken the religion from Christmas, and had imagined it as \"mistletoe and pudding—neither resurrection from the dead, nor rising of new stars, nor teaching of wise men, nor shepherds\".[81] There were critics of the book. The New Monthly Magazine praised the story, but thought the book's physical excesses—the gilt edges and expensive binding—kept the price high, making it unavailable to the poor. The review recommended that the tale should be printed on cheap paper and priced accordingly.[82] An unnamed writer for The Westminster Review mocked Dickens's grasp of economics, asking \"Who went without turkey and punch in order that Bob Cratchit might get them—for, unless there were turkeys and punch in surplus, someone must go without\".[83] Dickens had criticised the US in American Notes and Martin Chuzzlewit, making American readers reluctant to embrace his work, but by the end of the American Civil War, the book had gained wide recognition in American households.[84] In 1863 The New York Times published an enthusiastic review, noting that the author brought the \"old Christmas ... of bygone centuries and remote manor houses, into the living rooms of the poor of today\".[85] In January 1844 Parley's Illuminated Library published an unauthorised version of the story in a condensed form which they sold for twopence.[n 13] Dickens wrote to his solicitor I have not the least doubt that if these Vagabonds can be stopped they must. ... Let us be the sledge-hammer in this, or I shall be beset by hundreds of the same crew when I come out with a long story.[87] Two days after the release of the Parley version, Dickens sued on the basis of copyright infringement and won. The publishers declared themselves bankrupt and Dickens was left to pay £700 in costs.[88] The small profits Dickens earned from A Christmas Carol further strained his relationship with his publishers, and he broke with them in favour of Bradbury and Evans, who had been printing his works to that point.[16] Dickens returned to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised on the success of the book by publishing other Christmas stories: The Chimes (1844), The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846) and The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain (1848); these were secular conversion tales which acknowledged the progressive societal changes of the previous year, and highlighted those social problems which still needed to be addressed. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.[89] By 1849 Dickens was engaged with David Copperfield and had neither the time nor the inclination to produce another Christmas book.[90] He decided the best way to reach his audience with his \"Carol philosophy\" was by public readings.[91] During Christmas 1853 he gave a reading in Birmingham Town Hall to the Industrial and Literary Institute. He insisted that tickets be reserved for working-class attendees at quarter-price and the performance was a great success.[92][93][94] Thereafter, he read the tale in an abbreviated version 127 times, until 1870 (the year of his death), including at his farewell performance.[95] In the years following the book's publication, responses to the tale were published by W. M. Swepstone (Christmas Shadows, 1850), Horatio Alger (Job Warner's Christmas, 1863), Louisa May Alcott (A Christmas Dream, and How It Came True, 1882), and others who followed Scrooge's life as a reformed man – or some who thought Dickens had got it wrong and needed to be corrected.[96] The novella was adapted for the stage almost immediately. Three productions opened on 5 February 1844, one by Edward Stirling, A Christmas Carol; or, Past, Present, and Future, being sanctioned by Dickens and running for more than 40 nights.[97] By the close of February 1844 eight rival A Christmas Carol theatrical productions were playing in London.[75] The story has been adapted for film and television more than any of Dickens's other works.[98] In 1901 it was produced as Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost, a silent black-and-white British film; it was one of the first known adaptations of a Dickens work on film, but it is now largely lost.[99] The story was adapted in 1923 for BBC radio.[100] It has been adapted to other media, including opera, ballet, animation, stage musicals and a BBC mime production starring Marcel Marceau.[101] Davis considers the adaptations have become better remembered than the original. Some of Dickens's scenes—such as visiting the miners and lighthouse keepers—have been forgotten by many, while other events often added—such as Scrooge visiting the Cratchits on Christmas Day—are now thought by many to be part of the original story. Accordingly, Davis distinguishes between the original text and the \"remembered version\".[102] The phrase \"Merry Christmas\" had been around for many years—the earliest known written use was in a letter in 1534—but Dickens's use of the phrase in A Christmas Carol popularised it among the Victorian public.[103] The exclamation \"Bah! Humbug!\" entered popular use in the English language as a retort to anything sentimental or overly festive;[104] the name \"Scrooge\" became used as a designation for a miser and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary as such in 1982.[105] In the early 19th century the celebration of Christmas was associated in Britain with the countryside and peasant revels, disconnected to the increasing urbanisation and industrialisation taking place. Davis considers that in A Christmas Carol, Dickens showed that Christmas could be celebrated in towns and cities, despite increasing modernisation.[106] The modern observance of Christmas in English-speaking countries is largely the result of a Victorian-era revival of the holiday. The Oxford Movement of the 1830s and 1840s had produced a resurgence of the traditional rituals and religious observances associated with Christmastide and, with A Christmas Carol, Dickens captured the zeitgeist while he reflected and reinforced his vision of Christmas.[107] Dickens advocated a humanitarian focus of the holiday,[108] which influenced several aspects of Christmas that are still celebrated in Western culture, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit.[109][n 14] The historian Ronald Hutton writes that Dickens \"linked worship and feasting, within a context of social reconciliation\".[110] The novelist William Dean Howells, analysing several of Dickens's Christmas stories, including A Christmas Carol, considered that by 1891 the \"pathos appears false and strained; the humor largely horseplay; the characters theatrical; the joviality pumped; the psychology commonplace; the sociology alone funny\".[111][112] The writer James Joyce considered that Dickens took a childish approach with A Christmas Carol, producing a gap between the naïve optimism of the story and the realities of life at the time.[112] Ruth Glancy, the professor of English literature, states that the largest impact of A Christmas Carol was the influence felt by individual readers.[113] In early 1844 The Gentleman's Magazine attributed a rise of charitable giving in Britain to Dickens's novella;[114] in 1874, Robert Louis Stevenson, after reading Dickens's Christmas books, vowed to give generously to those in need,[115] and Thomas Carlyle expressed a generous hospitality by hosting two Christmas dinners after reading the book.[116] In 1867 one American businessman was so moved by attending a reading that he closed his factory on Christmas Day and sent every employee a turkey,[75] while in the early years of the 20th century Maud of Wales—the Queen of Norway—sent gifts to London's crippled children signed \"With Tiny Tim's Love\".[117] On the novella, the author G. K. Chesterton wrote \"The beauty and blessing of the story ... lie in the great furnace of real happiness that glows through Scrooge and everything around him. ... Whether the Christmas visions would or would not convert Scrooge, they convert us.\"[118] Analysing the changes made to adaptations over time, Davis sees changes to the focus of the story and its characters to reflect mainstream thinking of the period. While Dickens's Victorian audiences would have viewed the tale as a spiritual but secular parable, in the early 20th century it became a children's story, read by parents who remembered their parents reading it when they were younger. In the lead-up to and during the Great Depression, Davis suggests that while some saw the story as a \"denunciation of capitalism, ...most read it as a way to escape oppressive economic realities\".[119] The film versions of the 1930s were different in the UK and US. British-made films showed a traditional telling of the story, while US-made works showed Cratchit in a more central role, escaping the depression caused by European bankers and celebrating what Davis calls \"the Christmas of the common man\".[120] In the 1960s, Scrooge was sometimes portrayed as a Freudian figure wrestling with his past. By the 1980s he was again set in a world of depression and economic uncertainty.[120]",

                "content": "Dunkin' Donuts LLC,[4] trading as Dunkin' since 2019 in some markets, is an American multinational coffee and doughnut company, as well as a quick service restaurant. It was founded by Bill Rosenberg (1916–2002) in Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1950. The chain was acquired by Baskin-Robbins' holding company Allied Lyons in 1990; its acquisition of the Mister Donut chain and the conversion of that chain to Dunkin' Donuts facilitated the brand's growth in North America that year.[5] Dunkin' and Baskin-Robbins eventually became subsidiaries of Dunkin' Brands, headquartered in Canton, Massachusetts, in 2004, until being purchased by Inspire Brands on December 15, 2020. The chain began rebranding as a \"beverage-led company\", and was renamed Dunkin', in January 2019; while stores in the U.S. began using the new name, the company intends to roll out the rebranding to all of its international stores eventually.[6] It is also sometimes known locally in the Northeast as Dunkie's. With approximately 12,900 locations in 42 countries, Dunkin' is one of the largest coffee shop and doughnut shop chains in the world.[7][8] In addition to various varieties of coffee and doughnuts, products sold include bagels, breakfast sandwiches, muffins, and doughnut holes branded as Munchkins.[9][10] Bill Rosenberg opened the Open Kettle in 1948, a restaurant selling doughnuts and coffee in Quincy, Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston), but in late May 1950,[11] he changed the name to Dunkin' Donuts after discussions with company executives.[12][13] He conceived the idea for the restaurant after his experiences selling food in factories and at construction sites, where doughnuts and coffee were the two most popular items. The company introduced its first logo in 1953, and the mascot Dunkie in 1954.[14] The restaurant was successful, and Rosenberg sold franchises to others starting in 1955.[15] In 1963 Rosenberg's son Bob became CEO of the company at age 25, and Dunkin' Donuts opened its hundredth location that year.[16] Dunkin' Donuts was a subsidiary of Universal Food Systems at the time, a conglomerate of 10 small food-service businesses,[17] and Dunkin' Donuts locations varied greatly in their menu options, with some selling full breakfasts and others serving only doughnuts and coffee. In the following years, the other businesses in the Universal Food Systems portfolio were sold or closed, and the company was renamed to Dunkin' Donuts. The menu and shop format was standardized, and various new menu items were introduced. In the early 1980s counter service and ceramic coffee cups were replaced by self-service counters and paper cups.[18] The chain went public in 1968[19] and was acquired by Baskin-Robbins owner Allied Lyons in 1990.[20][21] By 1998, the brand had grown to 2,500 locations worldwide with $2 billion in annual sales.[citation needed] Dunkin' Donuts expanded in the 1990s by buying out two rival chains: Mister Donut (which was founded by Bill Rosenberg's former partner Harry Winokur.) and Dawn Donuts.[22] At some point, the chain produced a doughnut specifically designed for dunking, with a handle. This was discontinued in 2003 (except in Singapore) because it was hand-cut and uneconomical compared to machine-cut doughnuts.[23] In 2004 the company's headquarters were relocated to Canton, Massachusetts. In December 2005 Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins (by then, operating under the name Dunkin' Brands) were sold to a private equity consortium of Bain Capital, Carlyle Group, and Thomas H. Lee Partners for $2.4 billion.[24] By 2010, Dunkin' Donuts' global sales were $6 billion.[25] In June 2013 Dunkin' Donuts unveiled a new store design, the brand's first in almost seven years.[26] The Dunkin' Donuts location in Natick, Massachusetts launched a program to test the concept of curbside pickup in December 2016.[27][28] In January 2018, Dunkin' Donuts began to open new concept locations, beginning in Quincy, featuring modern decor, cold beverages on tap and a single-cup brewing machine, more packaged take-out options, and dedicated pick-up lines for mobile ordering inside and in the drive-thru. The concept was described as being part of a shift towards becoming an \"on-the-go, beverage-led brand\". In addition, the location, as well as others, began to trial signage referring to the chain as simply \"Dunkin'\"—removing \"Donuts\" from the name.[29][30] In February 2018, Dunkin' announced plans to phase out polystyrene foam cups globally for environmental purposes by April 2020.[31][32][33] In July 2018, Dave Hoffmann took over from Nigel Travis to become the CEO. He is looking to add 1,000 new locations outside of the Northeastern United States by the end of 2020 and to have a revenue increase of 3 percent for stores open a year or longer.[34] Also late 2018, Dunkin' installed espresso machines at all possible locations and launched espresso products using a new recipe.[35][36] In June 2019, Dunkin' partnered with Grubhub to begin the rollout of its new Dunkin' Delivers service.[37][38] Later in July 2019, Dunkin' partnered with Beyond Meat to introduce a meatless breakfast sandwich in Manhattan, becoming the first U.S. restaurant brand to serve Beyond Sausage.[39] The sandwich launched nationally later in 2019.[40][41] In September 2019, the New York attorney general's office alleged in a lawsuit that Dunkin' mishandled a series of cyberattacks that were directed at customers using the Dunkin' mobile app. These attacks took place in early 2015 and thousands of usernames and passwords stolen. The state lawsuit alleges that Dunkin' employees knew about these attacks, but failed to take appropriate action.[42] In October 2020, Dunkin' Brands stated that the company was in conversation with Inspire Brands, a private equity-backed company, negotiating to sell the company.[43] Inspire Brands announced on Saturday, October 31, 2020, that they would be acquiring Dunkin' Brands Group for $11.3 billion, which would include Dunkin' Brands' debt that Inspire Brands would be taking on. Inspire would pay $106.50 in cash for each of Dunkin' Brands' shares.[44] On December 15, 2020, the acquisition was completed, and Dunkin' Brands ceased to exist as a separate company, with Dunkin', Baskin-Robbins, and the trademark management of Mister Donut, becoming part of Inspire Brands.[45] Dunkin' Donuts' \"It's Worth the Trip\" campaign starred sleepy-eyed \"Fred the Baker\" and featured the catchphrase \"Time to make the donuts\". It won honors from the Television Bureau of Advertising as one of the five best television advertisements of the 1980s. Fred the Baker was played by actor Michael Vale for 16 years until his retirement in 1997. The catchphrase was used in the title of founder William Rosenberg's autobiography Time to Make the Donuts: The Founder of Dunkin' Donuts Shares an American Journey. Dunkin' Donuts changed its slogan in March 2006 to \"America Runs on Dunkin'\". They Might Be Giants songs were featured in a series of advertisements of new products to boost summer sales.[46] In 2006, a series of Dunkin' Donuts commercials referred to the fictional language \"Fritalian\". \"Is it French? Or is it Italian?\" sings a chorus of customers facing a long menu of non-English terms. \"Perhaps Fritalian?\" was created by Hill Holliday to \"poke fun at pretentious Starbucks-style coffee chains, with patrons attempting to order hard-to-pronounce lattes.\"[47][48] The commercial was interpreted as a deliberate mocking of Starbucks.[48][49] The commercials' punch line is: \"Delicious lattes from Dunkin' Donuts. You order them in English\". It has been a point of discussion that latte, cappuccino, and espresso are loanwords from Italian which have no equivalence in English. The commercials, however, refer to the Starbucks ordering language itself, poking fun at words such as grande and venti.[48] Further commercials in 2007 more directly mocked Starbucks, with a customer ordering a \"large\" and being chastised to use the term \"dieci\". Rachael Ray starred in commercials for Dunkin' Donuts beginning in 2007. In May 2008 Dunkin' Donuts removed a commercial from its website featuring Ray wearing a scarf with a black and white paisley floral design, in response to columnist Michelle Malkin's claims that the scarf resembled the keffiyeh worn by Yasser Arafat and therefore a sign of support for terrorists.[50] Dunkin' Donuts pulled that commercial off the air, leading to criticism of the company's perceived kowtowing to special interests.[51] In March 2009, the company unveiled the alternate slogan \"You 'Kin Do It!\" and launched a $100 million ad campaign promotion.[52] In 2017, the company announced that it would begin testing the name of simply \"Dunkin'\" at some retail locations, as they would like to be thought of as a destination for coffee, its most profitable product.[53] The branding would be implemented in other locations in the latter half of 2018 if it was successful.[54] The brand announced that it would be known simply as Dunkin' in September 2018.[55] In April 2018, Dunkin' Donuts teamed up with the Massachusetts shoe manufacturer, Saucony to produce a strawberry-frosted doughnut themed running shoe to commemorate the 122nd running of the Boston Marathon. The Saucony X Dunkin' Kinvara 9 came in a doughnut box and the heel of the shoe was covered in rainbow sprinkles.[56] The chain is a favorite among some celebrities. Ben Affleck began starring in commercials for the company along with wife Jennifer Lopez in February 2023. The first aired during Super Bowl LVII. They starred in a follow up that first aired during Super Bowl LVIII, along with Affleck's long-time friend, Matt Damon, and former NFL star Tom Brady. The chain then announced it would add Affleck's specific order, an iced coffee with creame, sweet cold foam, and cinnamon sugar, via its limited-time DunKings Menu. [57][58] A script version of the words Dunkin' Donuts was filed on March 31, 1955, and registered on February 2, 1960. A later logo was for a drawing and word logo depicting a figure with a doughnut for a head and a coffee cup and doughnut body wearing a garrison cap, with Dunkin' emblazoned on both the coffee cup and cap. The design was rendered primarily in yellow and brown. The logo was applied for on June 23, 1958, registered on May 23, 1961, and put into use on July 1, 1964.[59] In 1966, the company began using a hot pink color for its branding and used a logo showing a stylized coffee cup with the company's name rendered on one line as a circle, evoking a doughnut dunking into the cup. In 1980 bright orange was added to the hot pink. As of 2014 the logo was a variation of the logo that has been in use since about 1980: an all-capitals rendering of the words Dunkin' Donuts (Dunkin' in orange; Donuts in pink) in a thick, Frankfurter typeface[60] with a coffee cup outlined in brown with a \"DD\" monogram.[61] In September 2018, the company announced that it would shorten its name to Dunkin', with a wider roll-out beginning in January 2019. The company acknowledged that \"Dunkin'\" was already a common shorthand name for the chain among customers and in its marketing (including the slogan \"America Runs on Dunkin'\"), and that the rebranding would reflect the chain's continuing shift towards being a \"beverage-led\" brand at a time when consumers have shown a preference for healthier trends and options as they consume fewer doughnuts.[62][6][63][64] While stores in the U.S. started using the new name in 2019, the company intends to roll out the rebranding to all of its international stores eventually.[6] In April 2018, Dunkin' named BBDO as their primary advertising agency. This replaced Hill Holliday, which had been producing print, digital, broadcast, and billboard advertising for almost twenty years. Hill Holliday was the agency responsible for the tagline \"America Runs on Dunkin'\". ARC/Leo Burnett was also named to lead all in-store promotions.[65] Dunkin' has a close relationship with the Boston Red Sox and the New England Patriots, making commercials at the start of each team's season for promotions. Dunkin' also sponsors other professional sports teams, including the Dallas Cowboys, New York Yankees, New York Mets, Philadelphia Eagles, and Tampa Bay Rays.[citation needed] In 2001 Dunkin' Donuts purchased the naming rights for the former Providence Civic Center, and renamed it the Dunkin' Donuts Center. The center is currently[when?] the home court for the NCAA and Big East Providence Friars men's basketball team from Providence College as well as home ice for the AHL Providence Bruins hockey team. In reference to the center's long association with local college basketball, it is often known locally as \"The Dunk\".[citation needed] In January 2014 English football club Liverpool announced a multimillion-pound global partnership with the company.[66] Dunkin' Donuts signed a sponsorship deal with the National Women's Hockey League in December 2015. As part of the multi-year agreement, Dunkin’ Donuts is the official hot, iced and frozen coffee of the NWHL.[67] In 2016, Dunkin' became the official \"coffee, doughnut and breakfast sandwich partner\" of the National Hockey League.[68] On January 16, 2013, Nigel Travis, Dunkin' Brands CEO, announced that the Dunkin' Donuts franchises would be available in California beginning in 2015.[69] In July 2013, Dunkin' Donuts announced that it has signed its first Southern California multi-unit store development agreements with four franchise groups for a total commitment of 45 new restaurants. The first standalone restaurants were expected to open in 2015 in Orange and Los Angeles counties.[70] The chain also planned to expand into more stores in Texas by 2015.[71] On March 10, 2014, the first Dunkin' Donuts/Baskin-Robbins combination store in Southern California opened in Ramona.[72] This is Dunkin' Donuts' third California shop to open, following shops in Barstow and on Camp Pendleton. Since March 2014, Dunkin' Donuts has opened several additional locations throughout California, including the Los Angeles area. Dunkin' Donuts shops opened in the San Francisco Bay Area in Walnut Creek, Half Moon Bay,[73] and American Canyon in 2016, as well as South San Francisco and Fremont, in 2017.[73][74][75] 2014 saw the return of Dunkin' Donuts to the state of Minnesota after nearly a decade's absence, with a new shop opened inside the Kahler Grand Hotel in Rochester.[76] In the United States, Dunkin' is sometimes paired with Baskin-Robbins ice cream in a single multibranded store. While such locations usually maintain separate counters for each chain (much like co-branded Wendy's–Tim Hortons locations in Canada), depending on business that day, both chains' products can be bought at a single counter (usually Dunkin' Donuts').[citation needed] The practice of single-counter service is similar to that of multibranded Yum! Brands stores such as KFC–Taco Bell, which share a single kitchen and cashier line.[77] As of February 9, 2017, all Dunkin' locations are franchisee owned and operated.[78] In addition to its stand-alone shops, Dunkin' shops can be found within many gas stations, supermarkets, mall and airport food courts, and Walmart stores. In July 2013 Dunkin' Donuts opened its 500th restaurant in New York City. This location is combined with a Baskin-Robbins.[79] On July 30, 2020, Dunkin' Brands announced it would permanently close 800 shops in the US by the end of the year because of a 21 percent drop of sales in the second quarter during the COVID-19 pandemic, 450 of which are part of the previously announced closing of locations within Speedway gas stations.[80][43] As of 2019, 40 Dunkin' Donuts shops in the United States were certified fully kosher, in addition to one that sells both kosher-certified and non-kosher products.[81] By March 2014, Dunkin' Donuts' largest international market was South Korea, representing nearly 40 percent of all international sales. With over 900 outlets in the country, it had three times as many as McDonald's and about a third more than Starbucks. South Korea is home to Dunkin' Donuts' only coffee roasting plant outside the U.S. Still, the company sees China and its vastly larger population as the more lucrative opportunity. In 2008 Dunkin' Donuts opened its first restaurant in Shanghai, representing the first step in its China expansion strategy. By March 2014, it had about 50 stores in the country and an agreement to open 100 more over the next five years.[82][83] In Australia, Dunkin' Donuts opened in the 1980s but by the late 2000s, they had left the Australian market. In 2014, Dunkin' Brands global chairman Nigel Travis said there were no plans in the short term to return the brand to the Australian market.[84] Baskin-Robbins, a subsidiary of Dunkin' Brands, continues to exist in the country. In Brazil, Dunkin' Donuts opened its first building in 1980.[85] In 2013, it planned to open 25 franchises in the country.[86] In Colombia, Dunkin' Donuts opened its first store in Bogota in 1983. By 2015, Dunkin' Donuts operated more than 100 stores only in the capital city of the country.[87] Currently,[when?] it operates more than 150 stores around the country including locations in the cities of Medellin, Cali, Ibague, Pereira, Manizales and Barranquilla.[88] In January 2014, Dunkin' Donuts relaunched in England 20 years after it exited the country with its store opening in Harrow, London.[89] There are no Dunkin' Donuts stores in Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales. On December 5, 2014, Dunkin' Donuts opened their first location in the Nordic region, at the Täby Centrum shopping mall in the outskirts of Stockholm, Sweden.[90][91] On July 24, 2018, Dunkin' Donuts announced that the company's Swedish operations had filed for bankruptcy and all locations in Sweden would close immediately.[92] On April 1, 2015, the first store in Denmark opened in Copenhagen Central Station and by May 5, 2015, one opened at Roskilde railway station. There is still one in construction in Odense.[93] In early December 2015, Dunkin' Donuts opened their first cafe in 13 years in Warsaw. The opening of a second location in Warsaw is announced for January 2016. In December 2018, a third branch was under construction in the city.[94] On January 21, 2016, Dunkin' Brands announced a master franchise agreement with Grand Parade Investments Ltd. that called for developing 250 Dunkin' Donuts and 70 Baskin-Robbins outlets throughout South Africa.[95] The first stores opened in the end of 2016 in the Cape Town area. Eventually, only 11 Dunkin' Donuts locations and five Baskin-Robbins locations opened in South Africa due to GPI's financial trouble. However, by February 2019, Grand Parade Investments announced that it permanently closed all Dunkin' Brands locations in South Africa due to poor performance and unprofitably.[96] In September 2015, Roland Zanelli, the owner of the Dunkin' Donuts license in Switzerland, announced the opening of the first two stores in Basel, Switzerland in Fall 2015, followed by the opening of up to 60 stores in the whole country.[97] The first Basel store opened on March 1, 2016. On February 24, 2011, Dunkin' Donuts signed a master franchise agreement with Indian food service company Jubilant FoodWorks to operate the brand in India.[98] Jubilant FoodWorks opened the country's first Dunkin' Donuts outlet at Connaught Place, New Delhi in April 2012.[99] In November 2014, Dunkin' Donuts opened its first store in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh inside Z Square Mall.[100] There were 32 Dunkin' Donuts outlets across 10 Indian cities as on December 31, 2019.[101] The term \"Donuts\" was already trademarked by one of the largest Spanish bakery firms, Panrico,[102] so the company was born as a joint venture between Dunkin' Donuts' then-parent Allied Domecq and Panrico (only Spanish shareholders, representing 50%) in order to use the brand name \"Dunkin' Donuts\". In 2007, after Dunkin' Donuts bought out Panrico's 50% share, the stores were rebranded to \"Dunkin' Coffee\".[103] As of 2017, there are 59 Dunkin' Coffee locations in Spain, the majority of which are in Barcelona, Madrid, and Málaga. Their slogan, \"Juntos es mejor\", translates to \"Together is better\". Despite once having hundreds of stores nationwide, Dunkin' Donuts and its market share all but vanished from Canada by the turn of the century. In the late 1990s to early 2000s the chain began disappearing from all regions of Canada, with its last foothold in the province of Quebec. However, its decline was most apparent in Quebec, where the chain once had 210 stores but by mid 2017 had only three—the last franchises in the country.[104] By then, only one free standing store had the facilities to make doughnuts fresh on site; the other two were merely shopping-mall food-court stands, dependent on the delivery of baked goods from the main store. One of the main reasons for Dunkin' Donuts' decline was competition with Tim Hortons, similar to Tim Hortons' own decline in the northeastern United States due to heavy competition from Dunkin' Donuts. A group of Dunkin' Donuts franchisees won a C$16.4 million civil court judgement against the parent company for failing to adequately promote the brand in Canada. In September 2018, after 57 years of operating in Canada,[105] Dunkin' Donuts ceased business in that country when it refused to renew its franchise license to the few remaining stores left. All remaining Canadian locations were closed or rebranded as independent businesses in late 2018 – ending the presence of Dunkin' Donuts in the country.[106] Baskin-Robbins – a subsidiary of Dunkin' Brands – continues to operate stores across Canada.[107] Dunkin' opened its first location in Lebanon in 1998 and has since gained a lot of popularity among Lebanese people and is now one of the most popular coffee shops with many branches spread across the country. In 2020, Dunkin' Lebanon started selling its products in supermarkets and grocery stores. In 1970, Japan became the first Asian country to open Dunkin' Donuts stores. The Japanese chain was owned by a joint venture between the Saison Group, Yoshinoya, and the Japanese subsidiary of the Compass Group named Seiyo Food Systems. After 28 years of operating in Japan, Dunkin' Donuts ceased business there in 1998 due to declining sales and poor performance. All of the non-military base locations were either closed or converted to Mister Donut locations. Dunkin' still has locations in United States military bases, which are open only to military personnel. Dunkin' Donuts Korea has launched a fun-shaped doughnut with fried chicken legs in cooperation with Kyochon, a South Korean chicken franchise.[108] The first Philippine store of Dunkin' Donuts opened in Makati in 1981 under the Philippine franchisee Golden Donuts Incorporated (GDI).[109] Dunkin' Donuts later expanded outside Metro Manila when Queen City Food Chain, Inc. opened its first outlet in Fuente Osmeña, Cebu City in 1986.[110] It later expanded to Mindanao when its first two branches in Cagayan de Oro opened in 1991.[111][112] Its first drive-thru store was opened in Tomas Morato Avenue, Quezon City in January 2021.[113] In mid-August 2023, Dunkin’ opened its 800th Philippine store in Laoag, becoming the largest coffee operator in the country.[114] Dunkin' Donuts opened its first location in Saudi Arabia in 1986. As of October 2022, it operates over 500 stores and plans to operate more than 600 in the Kingdom by the end of 2022[needs update] due to the high coffee demand.[115] Dunkin' Donuts Israel (Hebrew: דאנקן דונאטס) was an Israeli franchise of the chain. Dunkin' Donuts Israel opened their first location within Israel in 1996 in Tel Aviv. Their main flagship store was located in Rabin Square, with their factory in Lod.[116] Upon opening their first location Dunkin' was a tremendous hit. When the original location opened it broke Dunkin's own sales records by selling 3 million doughnut in the first eight months.[117] The chain's manager was quoted saying \"Israelis do not stop eating doughnuts, They buy such quantities, quantities that we would never have believed they would buy. They buy boxes of 12, eat them here, and then buy more boxes to take home.\"[118] In 2001, when Dunkin' Donuts Israel decided to close, the company had accumulated a large amount of debt. When the Second Intifada broke out, Israeli tourism slowed, and Dunkin' decided to close.[119] Approximately $2 million was invested in Dunkin' Donuts Israel when it failed.[120] At the peak, Dunkin' Donuts had 9 branches in Israel, short of their original goal of 15, including 3 in Jerusalem.[116] The first New Zealand store opened in Manukau, Auckland in 2001; three others also opened in Auckland that year.[121] By 2017, it had 12 Auckland stores and two other cities.[122] By 2022, it had 15 Auckland stores and three other cities.[123] In 1997, Dunkindonuts.org was established by a customer for disgruntled consumers and employees to lodge complaints about the company. The site appeared ahead of the company's own website in many search engines and received national media coverage before being purchased by Dunkin' Donuts in 1999.[130] Dunkin' Donuts was criticized by one of its franchisees for allegedly forcing single-store owners to agree to a buyout at a loss for minor infractions. Dunkin' Donuts sued franchise owners 154 times from 2006 to April 2008. Over the same period, McDonald's was involved in five lawsuits. Subway, a company that has four times the number of locations as Dunkin' Donuts, sued its franchisees 12 times. (These figures do not include arbitrations, which the companies use in pursuing legal claims against their franchisees.) Franchisees allege that the company's business strategy needs predominantly multi-unit franchisees.[131] In May 2010, Dunkin' Donuts was criticized for advertising \"Free Iced Coffee Day\" on its national Facebook page, which took place in only 13 cities.[132] Because of the limited scope of the promotion, many customers became dissatisfied with the lack of free iced coffee and vented their anger on the Dunkin' Donuts Facebook page.[133] In 2013, the Dunkin' Donuts chain in Thailand used an advertisement that contained a photograph of a woman in black face-paint, in order to promote its new chocolate-flavored doughnuts. The company was criticized for the advertisement, with the Human Rights Watch calling the advertisement \"bizarre and racist\". The headquarters in the United States apologized for the advertisement.[134] Nancy Lewis, in Canaan, Connecticut, began a petition in January 2014 to request that Dunkin' Donuts donate their unsold food to local shelters and food banks in her area after seeing her local shop regularly throwing away \"large amounts\" of unsold food. She said because the company has no official policy on the redistribution of its unsold food items to shelters or food banks, and employees are not allowed to take any home,[135] many affiliates throw all of the goods away.[136] In August 2024, a group of Trump supporters called for a boycott of Dunkin' Donuts for declining advertisements from Rumble for promoting right-wing populism. They also accused the company of being \"woke\".[137]",

                "content": "Dunkin’ Donuts’ app for mobile payment and gifting now features language setting for viewing content in Spanish Dunkin’ Donuts becomes first national coffee retailer to offer mobile app content and features in Spanish CANTON, MA (May 20, 2013) – Dunkin’ Donuts, America’s all-day, everyday stop for coffee and baked goods, today updated the brand’s Dunkin’ App for mobile payment and gifting, introducing a new language setting that enables users to view content in English or Spanish. With the new setting, Dunkin’ Donuts becomes the first national coffee retailer to make information, features and special offers within its mobile app available in both languages. Dunkin’ Donuts also announced that the company’s official website (www.dunkindonuts.com) can also now be viewed in both English and Spanish languages. Available for free from the App Store on iPhone or iPod touch or at www.itunes.com/appstore and from the Google Play Store at https://play.google.com/store, the Dunkin’ App enables guests to pay for food, beverages and merchandise at participating U.S. Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants by scanning their Dunkin' Donuts Cards stored in the app either in-store or at the drive-thru. The Dunkin’ App also allows guests the option of sending Dunkin’ Donuts virtual cards to friends, family and colleagues with the mGift feature. Dunkin’ Donuts Cards can be mGifted three ways – via text, email or Facebook Connect. And, guests can enjoy mobile offers via the “My Offers” tab, where they can receive exclusive, geo-targeted regional discounts and promotional offers for Dunkin’s famous coffee and other favorite menu items. “As the Hispanic population continues to grow, we believe it is important to continue to find new and meaningful ways to enhance our relationships and brand equity within the Hispanic marketplace,” said Xavier Turpin, Director of Multicultural Marketing for Dunkin’ Donuts. “Our mobile app has helped millions of busy, on-the-go people run on Dunkin’ faster and more conveniently. As our guests rely on their mobile devices more than ever, we are excited to make our app, as well as our mobile-friendly website, available in Spanish, deepening our connections with our Hispanic guests who make Dunkin’ Donuts part of their daily lives.” Dunkin’ Donuts has an increasing focus on serving and marketing to the rapidly growing Hispanic community. In 2012, the company launched an integrated Hispanic advertising and marketing campaign asking people, “¿Qué Estás Tomando?” (What are you Drinkin’?). The Spanish-language campaign introduced the brand’s first Spanish tagline, “América Se Mueve Con Dunkin’”, which is the equivalent to the general market tagline, “America Runs On Dunkin’.” In addition to its media advertising to Hispanic consumers, the company's expanding multicultural marketing includes a recent partnership with Universal Music Latin Entertainment (UMLE) to make Dunkin’ Donuts coffee part of Latin music’s biggest nights. Dunkin' Donuts also has a presence in various local cultural events, including the Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York City. The Dunkin’ App connects guests to the brand with an exciting array of tools and information to make any Dunkin’ run fast and easy. Highlights include: Earlier this year, the Dunkin’ Donuts mobile app also added support for Apple's Passbook, allowing guests to easily add their Dunkin' Donuts virtual cards to Passbook and pay for food, beverages and merchandise at participating U.S. Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants simply by scanning their Dunkin' Pass in-store or at the drive-thru. The Dunkin' Pass is also location-aware, meaning it will conveniently appear on a guest's lock screen when they are near their favorite Dunkin' Donuts location, for easy, on-the-go access.

The company started as a traditional donut shop, selling doughnuts and coffee. Later, they added flavored coffee and iced coffee. They also began to sell breakfast sandwiches: these contain egg, cheese, and pork (bacon, ham, or sausage), on bread (bagel, croissant, or English muffin). With the addition of breakfast sandwiches, Dunkin' Donuts has since become a popular spot for a quick breakfast. The franchise was established around 1950, in Quincy, Massachusetts. As of 2010, over ten thousand Dunkin' Donuts locations exist worldwide. Their largest market outside of the United States is in South Korea. Its name was officially changed to simply Dunkin' in 2019.[5] Notes",

                "title": "Pozole - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Pozole (Spanish pronunciation: [po'sole]; from Nahuatl languages: pozolli, meaning cacahuazintle, a variety of corn or maize) is a traditional soup or stew from Mexican cuisine. It is made from hominy with meat (typically chicken or pork), and can be seasoned and garnished with shredded lettuce or cabbage, chili peppers, onion, garlic, radishes, avocado, salsa or limes. Known in Mesoamerica since the pre-Columbian era, the stew is common across Mexico and neighboring countries, served both as a day-to-day meal and as a festive dish. Pozole can be prepared in many ways, but all variations include a base of cooked hominy in broth. The broth is most commonly made with chicken or pork, but vegetarian preparations exist. When the broth is meat-based, pieces of the meat used to make the broth are usually served in the final dish; vegetarian versions substitute beans for the meat. The three main types of pozole are blanco (white),[1] verde (green), and rojo (red). Pozole blanco—\"white pozole\"—is the preparation without any additional green or red sauce. Pozole verde—\"green pozole\"—adds a rich salsa verde based on green ingredients, possibly including tomatillos, epazote, cilantro, green chiles (typically jalapeños or serranos), or pepitas. Pozole rojo—\"red pozole\"—is similar, but using a salsa roja made from one or more dried or smoked red chiles, such as guajillo, piquin, or ancho, and usually tomato. Pozole is commonly served accompanied by a wide variety of toppings, particularly raw vegetables. Common toppings include chopped onion, shredded cabbage, sliced radish, avocado, limes, oregano, tostadas, chicharrón, and chiles.[2] Pozole is also considered a festive dish. In Mexico and in New Mexico, pozole is typically served on New Year's Eve to celebrate the new year.[3][4] Pozole is frequently served as a celebratory dish throughout Mexico and in Hispanic communities outside Mexico. Other occasions for serving pozole include Mexican Independence Day, birthdays, Christmas, and other holidays.[5] Pozole is a typical dish in various states, such as Nayarit, Sinaloa, Michoacán, Guerrero, Zacatecas, Jalisco, and Morelos. Pozole is served in Mexican restaurants worldwide. It is also popular in the cuisine of New Mexico where it is known as posole, and is a common dish among the Puebloan Indigenous peoples residing along the Rio Grande.[6][7] In the Southwestern United States, a type of field corn (posole corn) is used that differs from hominy. It is considered to be more flavorful and has a firmer texture than hominy which tends to be softer and mushier than posole.[8] The Hopi people make a variety called noquivi (Hopi: nöqkwivi), using lamb or mutton rather than the traditional pork.[9] It is often made from dried blue corn posole kernels; green chiles and juniper berries (instead of bay leaves) are added to the stew. This variety of posole is also prepared by the Puebloan people of New Mexico.[10] Pozole was mentioned in the 16th century Florentine Codex by Bernardino de Sahagún.[12] Since maize was a sacred plant for the Aztecs and other inhabitants of Mesoamerica, pozole was made to be consumed on special occasions. According to research by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History) and the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, on these special occasions, the meat used in the pozole may have been human. Possible archeological evidence of mass cannibalism may support this theory,[11] and there is widespread scholarly agreement that the Aztecs practiced cannibalism in the context of human sacrifice and warfare, though the social and dietary significance of such acts is disputed. While some authors such as Marvin Harris suggest that human flesh was a significant part of an aristocratic diet, others argue that there was not sufficient human flesh available to be a major source of proteins and that its consumption was chiefly a status symbol.[13][14]",

                "content": "Pozole is a traditional Mexican soup made with pork, hominy, and red chiles. Years ago when I spent a summer studying Spanish in Cuernavaca, Mexico, my Mexican teacher told me that it was much easier to pronounce the language properly if you smiled as you spoke it. She was right! Good thing Mexican food is so delicioso, because just thinking about dishes like this pozole makes me smile. It's somewhat of a feast, pozole. I guess you could make smaller batches, but since you have to cook it for several hours, it just makes sense to make a large amount, and then have lots of friends over with whom to enjoy it. Pozole (or posole) is a traditional soup in Mexico, often served Christmas eve, and in many parts of the country on Thursdays and Saturdays all year round. My good friend Chef Arturo Vargas, from Acapulco, Mexico, taught me how to make this soup, thanks Chef! This pozole rojo, or \"red\" pozole, is made with pork shoulder or shanks, red chiles, and lots of hominy corn. I made this for my parents, and they loved it. Mom told me she hadn't had pozole since she was a kid in Tucson. Lots of smiley faces around the table tonight. Typically just the simple soup with pork and hominy is served, and the add-ins, or garnishes are set at the table for all to pick and put in their soup as they wish. Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer The soup itself should be rather thin, or brothy, because you are going to load it up quickly with shredded cabbage, thinly sliced radishes, chopped avocados, cilantro, onions, and wedges of lime. More hot sauce or chiles can be added for more heat. Pozole is all about the garnishes. So good! Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer This recipe makes enough for a large crowd with plenty of leftovers! The leftovers will keep, refrigerated, for about a week or can be frozen for up to three months. To freeze, transfer the pozole to freezer containers or bags with as little air as possible to prevent freezer burn. Thaw overnight in the fridge, and warm over low heat on the stovetop. Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer We haven't made this in a slow cooker, but I'm guessing that step 6 could easily be done in a slow cooker. Tostadas are crispy fried corn tortillas. They are sold packaged and can often be found in the same section of your grocery store as fresh tortillas, or can be found at Mexican markets. You can make your own by frying stale corn tortillas (or tortillas that have dried out a bit in a warm oven), in hot vegetable oil until stiff. 4 ounces dried guajillo or ancho chiles, or a combination of both Salt 1 large (108 ounce, 6 lb 12 oz, 3 kg) can white hominy, drained and rinsed 3 pounds pork shoulder (preferably with bone), cut into 1 to 1 1/2 inch cubes (can also use pork shanks), make sure to use a cut well marbled with fat 8 cloves garlic, 4 cloves roughly chopped, and 4 whole cloves 3 bay leaves 1 teaspoon ground cumin 2 tablespoons dry oregano (Mexican oregano if available) Garnishes (can prep while pozole is cooking): 1/2 small cabbage, thinly sliced 1 bunch cilantro, chopped 1/2 white onion, chopped 2 avocados, chopped 4 limes, quartered 1 bunch red radishes, sliced thin 12 to 24 tostada shells (see Recipe Note) Fill a large 10 to 12 quart stockpot with 5 quarts of water. Set on heat to bring to a boil while you proceed with the next steps. Remove and discard the stems, seeds, and large veins from the chili pods. Heat a cast iron pan on medium high and heat the chili pods for a couple minutes, until they begin to soften. Do not let them burn. Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer While the chilies are heating, bring a medium pot with 3 cups of water to a simmer and remove from heat. Once the chiles have softened, add the chiles to the pot hot water and cover. Let the chiles soak in the hot water for 15 to 20 minutes. Heat a tablespoon or two of olive oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan) in a large sauté pan on medium high heat. Pat the pork pieces dry with paper towels. Sprinkle them generously with salt. Working in batches, taking care not to crowd the pan or stir the meat much, brown the meat on all sides. Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer Right at the end of browning the meat, add 4 cloves of roughly chopped garlic to the pan with the meat, let cook with the meat for about a minute. Once the meat has browned, transfer it to the large stockpot of boiling water. Scrape up any browned bits at the bottom of the pan, and any garlic, and add those to the pot as well. Add the rinsed hominy. Add bay leaves, cumin, and oregano. When you put the oregano in, smoosh together with your hands so that the oregano breaks up more as it goes in. Add a tablespoons of salt. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat and cook for 15 minutes. by puréeing in a blender the chilies, 2 1/2 cups or so of their soaking liquid, a teaspoon of salt, and 4 cloves of garlic. (To prevent the blender from creating too much pressure, it's probably best to start with the chiles and garlic and only a cup of the liquid in the blender, and then adding the rest of the liquid.) Strain the red sauce through a sieve, discarding the tough bits of the sauce. Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer Add another couple teaspoons of salt. Return to a simmer, lower the heat to just high enough to maintain a simmer, partially covered. Skim away excess fat. Taste for seasoning and add more salt to taste (you will likely need more than you expect, perhaps a tablespoon or more.) The resulting soup should be rather brothy, as you will be adding a lot garnishes. Add more water if necessary. When getting ready to serve the pozole, you can prep the garnishes (slice the cabbage, chop the cilantro, etc.) To serve, arrange the garnishes in bowls on the table and serve the pozole soup into bowls. Let your guests pick and choose which garnishes they would like on their pozole. Serve with tostada shells (or tortilla chips if you can't find tostada shells). Did you love the recipe?

I’m not sure why you wouldn’t lightly sautee the garlic with the butter, add the milk and then pour it in. That’s what I did and it was great. If you’re using a ricer the garlic may get stuck in the holes. Happened to me! Creamy, buttery perfection! These mashed potatoes are the epitome of comfort food bliss. Truly irresistible! Can this be made the night before? And that was the best way to heat it up on the day of to not dry out the potatoes? Thank you for sharing this recipe! These potatoes are amazing! Followed it almost exactly, just a little more garlic (4 cloves) and used a hand mixer to get them a little smoother. Thank you also for the make ahead options, so helpful! Never use a hand mixer for potatoes…it breaks down the starch and creates glue…and it happens so fast you can’t control it . I have been making this recipe for years and love it! Even my “I hate cream cheese” family member had to admit that these are some of the best mashed potatoes he’d ever had, and he is a mashed potatoes connoisseur. Thank you for including the make ahead/reheating directions – I hadn’t looked for those before, and am grateful for them today. I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. I changed nothing. I left it pretty chunky. They were SO GOOD everyone loved them! I will definitely save this recipe forever. So easy and so delicious! Couldnt ask foe a better recipe! Just ate these mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving and now they are gone. Oh my goodness these were freaking delicious. I particularly loved the idea of garlic in the water when boiling. Some of the water was used for a vegan version for one of our guests- and the garlic water was used instead of milk, butter and cheese…. Even though the original was way better, this vegan version was raved about too. Nice job posting this delicious recipe. Much appreciated!! SO good. This recipe is incredible, I’ve made it for Thanksgiving three years in a row now and rave about it.

Oh my goodness! Thank you, thank you, thank you! This is THE BEST potato recipe EVER! Never gonna look again for a mashed potato recipe thanks to you m’friend! Out of this world! Delectable and smacking!❤️ Great stuff. We added Garlic & Herb Goat Cheese, instead of Cream Cheese and it tasted good. Thanks. I’ve tried at least a dozen different recipes and none of them turned out as good as this one. However, I did make a small tweak by only using russet potatoes. I also baked them and scooped out the insides. The cream cheese really makes it! Thank you! These were incredible! PERFECT ratios. I used 4 large russet potatoes (5lbs?) and everything was spot on. My new go-to mashed taters recipe. Thank you!!! My husband has been “in charge” of mashed potatoes at every holiday for like 15 years but has struggled with nailing down perfection (or consistency)… too watery, too bland. I discovered this recipe and decided to give it a whirl for Easter. Ladies & Gentlemen, we have a winner!! I used the half & half I had on hand instead of milk and was happy with just 2T of cream cheese. Absolutely delicious!!! Tried twice for family occasions – a hit both times! I had some leftover potatoes (nowhere near 5 pounds), so I guesstimated and adjusted the other ingredients to match. My husband who usually rates things as “fine,” judged these to be “excellent!” You bet I’m keeping this recipe. (P.S. I loved them too.) Very helpful and direct instructions Delicious and efficient. The garlic really comes through (when you use 7 cloves at least) and the consistency was absolutely perfect for 5.5lb of russet. Used about 1 and a third cup of milk, subbed sour cream, and used some truffle parmesan powder in the wet mix. Absolutely delicious! And so easy! I made these for a friend who had morning sickness and all she wanted was mashed potatoes. She loved them! She said they were the best she’d ever eaten. The recipe fed her entire family and mine! My husband and son both went back for seconds. This is definitely my go to mashed potatoe recipe from now on! Thank you so much! Family loved it! We used a mixer to smooth them out and go extra fluffy but it would have been great as written as well. The flavor is on point. Thanks! My biggest compliment is every time I revisit this recipe to make and click Jump to Recipe it actually takes me right to it That alone makes it worth it. The fact how awesome they are is the bonus. Excellent recipe! I learned great mashed potato recipes nearly 40 years ago cooking in a fine country club. Our executive chef there was probably the best I worked with in my long career as a chef. He always said the key to great mashed potatoes was ” lots of quality butter “. This recipe is excellent as I agree with the potato blend. Only thing I add, as I also learned was imperative to great mashed is the addition of ground white pepper. Thanks for the recipe! Very nice and looks good Thanks for sharing!!!!! Perfect , def is the best! Can I freeze the garlic mash potatoes.. Make it now and defrost for Thanksgiving? Wow, this mashed potato recipe is an absolute game-changer! I love how detailed and easy-to-follow the instructions are, especially the tips on using Yukon Gold potatoes and warming the butter and cream beforehand.

Teacup Maltipoo This will definitely be my go-to for holiday meals and beyond! I have googled this recipe every year at Thanksgiving and Christmas to re-read all of the great tips on how to make the perfect mashed potatoes. I always make them ahead of time, refrigerated, and re-heat. I have even frozen them in aluminum pans, thawed, then baked in the oven and they were just as delicious. These potatoes are totally amazing!!! I made your style of mashed potatoes today first time for the Thanksgiving dinner- and the extra drying and the cream cheese addition made them creamy and dense without being lumpy! They were terrific with our vermouth laced gravy and a lovely accompaniment to our very nice turkey. Thank you! Great recipe! One thing only – you mentioned fresh black pepper in the Ingredients, but not in the Instructions. Add it at the end to season – you’ll get some even more finger-licking-good potatoes)! My favorite thing in life is time spent around the table. And all the better with some seriously tasty food to bring us all together. more about me »",

                "content": "Sprinkles and Sprouts Updated: Nov 12th 2020 • Published: Mar 10th 2020 • 5 Comments British Mashed Potatoes or \"mash,\" as it is usually called in Britain, is different from the US version or the French version. But it is just as delicious and the perfect side dish when you are serving gravy or stew. The buttery potato soaks up the flavorful sauces; it is a sponge for extra flavor! This classic British Mash, makes a wonderful side dish for so many meals or your holiday table. You want a medium-starch potato, like a Yukon Gold, Dutch Cream, Desiree, or Maris Piper. Why? (If you want to understand your potatoes a little more) - For mashed potato, you want a potato that is high in starch as this makes it easier to smash, and the quicker and easier a potato mashes, the fluffier the finished mash will be. But go too high in starch, and the potato takes on water when cooking, resulting in loss of flavor in the finished dish and a denser non-fluffy, watery texture. Then as you go down to the low starch varieties (the waxy salad potatoes), they need far more effort to be mashed, and you find that the texture can go gluey and almost sticky. Butter - Although it wouldn't be British mash, you can change the butter for olive oil for a more Mediterranean inspired mashed potato. Milk - You can use heavy cream, double cream, single cream, or half and half. They will give you a creamier, richer mash. In Britain, mashed potatoes with cream are reserved for special occasions or dinner parties (think Downton Abby dinners) Potatoes - you can use this recipe with sweet potatoes as well. Or check out my savory sweet potato mash recipe. Once you have the classic British mash, there are plenty of things you can add to it: Herbs - Go classically English with some finely chopped sage, rosemary, or thyme. (1 tbsp) Mustard - A touch of hot English mustard adds a beautiful tang to the mash. Or go across the English channel and add some dijon for a milder french twist. (1-2 tbsp) Prepared Horseradish - Add another English classic to your mashed potatoes. The creamy prepared horseradish mash is terrific with roast beef. (1-2 tbsp) Onions - Cooking some finely chopped onions in with the potatoes adds a nice savory note. It makes it a little harder to use a potato ricer but works well with a masher. (½ small onion) Cheese - Once the mash is finished, stir through a cup of sharp English cheddar for a beautiful cheesy mashed potato. (1 cup of grated cheese) We'll email this post to you, so you can come back to it later! Make AheadPrepare the potatoes upto step 7 (mashing the plain potatoes). Don't add the butter or milk, let the mashed potatoes cool completely, then place in a non-metal dish, cover, and store in the fridge for up to three days. To Serve Microwave the mash for 2 minutes.

                "content": "Learn how to make the best mashed potatoes with this easy recipe! Rich, creamy, and flavorful, they're always a crowd-pleasing side dish. I can’t share a mashed potatoes recipe without mentioning my husband Jack. He LOVES homemade mashed potatoes, specifically ones that are rich, creamy, and flavorful. I’ve made plenty that he’s liked in the past (see these garlic mashed potatoes and these Instant Pot mashed potatoes). But last year, I finally made the potatoes he’d been waiting for: ones loaded up with butter, milk, and sour cream. I’m not kidding when I say that these are the best mashed potatoes I’ve tried. They’re ultra-rich and blissfully creamy, and the sour cream gives them a delicious tangy kick. They’re easy to make (and make ahead!), and they’re guaranteed to be a crowd pleaser at Thanksgiving or any meal. If not from me, then take it from Jack—you’re going to love this mashed potatoes recipe. You can find the complete recipe with measurements at the bottom of this post, but for now, I’ll give you an overview of how it goes: This classic recipe starts with 7 simple ingredients: Find the complete recipe with measurements below. I think Yukon Golds and russets are the best potatoes for mashing. Feel free to make this recipe with either of these types of potatoes. Another option I like is to use a mix of both kinds. The russets help with fluffiness and the Yukon Golds supply great flavor. It’s a combination that can’t be beat! My method for how to make mashed potatoes couldn’t be simpler! Here’s how it goes: First, peel and cut the potatoes. Chop them into large chunks—halve smaller Yukon Golds and cut larger russets into quarters or sixths. Do your best to cut the pieces to a consistent size so that they cook evenly. Next, cook. Place the potatoes and garlic in a large pot and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Add a tablespoon of salt, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and gently boil until the potatoes are fork-tender. When I make this recipe, I generally boil the potatoes for 15 to 20 minutes. But the timing can vary! The potatoes are ready when you can easily pierce them with a fork. Avoid undercooking them. If they’re still firm in the center, you’ll end up with lumpy mashed potatoes! When the potatoes are tender, drain them into a colander. Lightly shake to remove excess water, and return the potatoes to the pot. Finally, mash! Use a potato masher to partially mash the potatoes. Then, pour in the milk and add the butter, salt, and pepper. Continue mashing until the potatoes reach your desired consistency (we like them totally smooth!). If desired, use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir in the sour cream. Season to taste, adding more butter, sour cream, and salt and pepper as needed. Enjoy! Don’t forget the fixings! We love these potatoes with butter, chives, and salt and pepper on top. You can’t go wrong with mushroom gravy either. Leftover mashed potatoes keep well in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You have a few options for reheating them: I’ve also had success reheating these mashed potatoes using the Keep Warm setting of my Instant Pot. A slow cooker would work well too! If the potatoes seem dry after reheating, stir in some melted butter or a splash of milk to loosen them up.

Looking forward to eating this tomorrow. Hi Lori, yes, I’ve used a ricer – if you have one, go for it! Thanks and sorry I called you Phoebe! These mashed potatoes are so easy and delicious. Perfectly seasoned and creamy! I love them topped with some scallions. Yum! I love everything These mashed potatoes are delicious and super easy! My only regret is not making the mushroom gravy too (next time!) Do I need to mince the garlic or leave whole? I was wondering the same thing Megan! I am not sure what I will do. We cook them whole with the potatoes and mash them with the potatoes – no need to mince. We cook them whole with the potatoes and mash them with the potatoes – no need to mince. Can you prepare the mashed potatoes the day before? If so, what is the best way to reheat the next day? Hi Cathy, yep, you can make these ahead! Here’s how we recommend reheating them: – In the microwave – Microwave until heated through, stirring every 2 minutes. – In the oven – Transfer the potatoes to a casserole dish or oven-safe pan. Dot the top with butter and cover. Warm in a 350°F oven until heated through, 25 minutes or more depending on the size and shape of your baking dish. These really are the BEST mashed potatoes! They don’t even need butter on top, as they’re fantastic as is. I will try gravy on them next time though! I sprinkled with scallions, as I didn’t have chives. I’m so glad you loved them, Laurie! Do you have any recipes for a great turkey gravy? Hi Lori, all our recipes are vegetarian, so we don’t have a turkey gravy. We love this mushroom gravy though! I made this recipe along with the Mushroom Gravy recipe on this site and they both came out great. Highly recommend trying this out! It was a crowd pleaser and sure to be a hit with the family. For the recipe rating = For the recipe rating! thank you! I’m so glad you loved it! Can you freeze this receipe to use in a couple weeks? yep! It’s best fresh, but still great after freezing. This recipe is amazing! For real! Easy to make, and it’s absolutely delicious! Sending you a picture now! I’m so glad you loved it! I love mashed potatoes.
