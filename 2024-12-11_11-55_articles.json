                "content": "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 alongside with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[8] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023.[9][10] It was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable football club.[11] In 2024, Real Madrid become the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue according to the club's announcement.[12] In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 34 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record eight FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[17] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[18][19] Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.[20][21] Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[22] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018); however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.[23] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million);[24] he became both the club's and history's all-time top goalscorer.[25][26][27][28] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham[29] and Kylian Mbappé.[30][31] Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[32] while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[33] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (43),[18] a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[34] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18. In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records.[35] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[36] As of July 2024,[update] Real Madrid are ranked 2nd in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall.[37][38] Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.[39] They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[40][41][42] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[7] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[43][44] Three years after its founding, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[45] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[46] In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[47] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[48] On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco.[note 2][49] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[50] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper Ya reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[51] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: Reds! Separatists!... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[52] Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's José Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while Ángel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'.\"[53] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[54] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[50] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[55] Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[56] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"cantera,\" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[57] In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel)[58] and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[59] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[57] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[60] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[61] The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[62] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name \"Yé-yé\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[63] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[64] and 1964.[62] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[65] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[66] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[67] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president. Bernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[68] In the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[69][70] Spanish sports journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. All five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[69][70] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[69][70] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club. In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[71] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[72] In November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[73] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[74] In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[75] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[76] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[77] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the field, the Zidanes y Pavones policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[78] The few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[79] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[80] \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[81] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[81] The 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[82] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[83] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[84] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,[85] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[86] Ramón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[87] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[88] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.[89] On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[90][91] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[92] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[93] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos.[94] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[95] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[96][97] José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[98][99] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[100][101] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[102] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe. In the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[103] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[104] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[105][106] Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[107] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[108] On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[109] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[110] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[111] By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[112] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[113] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La Décima\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la ˈðeθima]).[114] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[115] After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[116] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[117] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[118] After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[119] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[120] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[121] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[122] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012.[123] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[124] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[125][126] On 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[127] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez.[128][129][130] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to get good results against top teams.[131] Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[132] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favour, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[133] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"La Undécima\".[134][135][126] Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[136] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[137] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[138] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[139] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[140] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[141] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[142][143] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duodécima\".[144] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[145] Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[146] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[147] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[148] In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[149][150] Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[151] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[152] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[97] On 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[153][154] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[155] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[156] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[157] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[158] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.[159] In the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million.[160] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[161] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[162] From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[163][164] Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[165] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[166] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[167][168][169] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[170] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[171] defeating pre-tournament favourites Paris Saint-Germain,[172][173] defending champions and favourites Chelsea,[174] Premier League champions and heavy favourites Manchester City,[175] all in dramatic fashion,[176] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favourites,[177] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius Júnior goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[178][179] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favoured to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[180] After a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club. Real Madrid's 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup. The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to FC Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate. In 2023, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham, who was given the number #5 jersey, previously used by Zinedine Zidane. Real also signed Arda Güler and Fran García. Meanwhile, Vinícius Júnior was given the number #7 jersey, previously used by Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo; while Rodrygo was given the number #11 jersey, previously used by Gareth Bale. Karim Benzema left the club, while Toni Kroos would later announce that he would retire from football after this season. The 2023-24 season would prove to be another highly successful season for Los Blancos. First, Real Madrid lifted the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona 4–1, taking revenge of the previous year's 3–0 defeat. Then, Real Madrid lifted the La Liga with relative ease, reaching 95 points, the second-best winning campaign by Real Madrid in La Liga history after the 2011–12 100 points season. In the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid knocked out RB Leipzig in the Round of 16, then defending champions Manchester City in penalties. In the semifinals, Real Madrid faced Bayern Munich again. The first match was a 2–2 draw, while the second match in the Bernabéu was marked by a double by Joselu in the last few minutes of the game, with Bayern Munich suffering a historic comeback after leading 1–0. Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in the final, and won 2–0, with Dani Carvajal being the man of the match and scoring with a header after a Toni Kroos corner, and Vinícius Júnior once again scoring in a UCL final. Real Madrid won their 15th Champions League without losing a single match during the campaign. Following the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, Real Madrid announced that striker Kylian Mbappé would be joining the club on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2024, concluding one of the most highly anticipated transfer sagas in modern history.[181] The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[182] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[183] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[182] With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[48] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[184][56] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[182] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[182] Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[43] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 3] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[56] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[185] Real's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[186][187] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[188][189] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[190] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[191][192] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year.[193] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[194] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[195] Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[45] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[201] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[47] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[56][202] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[57] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[56] The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[203] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[203] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[204][205][206][207] The Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[208] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[209] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[210] On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground.[211] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.[212][164] The latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to nearly 85,000.[213][214] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[215][216] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[217][218] Raúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741 appearances from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times.[219] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176. Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[220][221] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[222] Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 129,690, which was for a European Cup match in 1956 against Milan. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 80,000.[223] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (36 as of 2023–24) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[224] The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fifteen times[225] and for the most semi-finals appearances (33). As of June 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[226] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game, before Bayern Munich breaks the record in 2021.[227] In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million).[228][229] The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million.[110] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[230] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million.[231] The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.[232] During most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[233] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[234][235] Real Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[236][237] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[238][239] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[240] Questioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\".[241] Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[242] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[243] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 100 victories for Madrid, 97 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[244] As early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[246][247] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[248] There is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[249] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[250][184] The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millonarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[251] Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[252] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[253] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[254] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[255] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[256] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[256][257] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.[256] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[256] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[256] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.[258] The club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.[47] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"[184] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were \"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\" – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).[259][260] The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[261] In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites).[262] By then, Real Madrid did not want to sign non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, \"Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote\" (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\").[263] Atlético's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the 2016–17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city.[264][265] In fact, the Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region). Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times is very favourable.[266] A high point came in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4–1 comeback victory in extra time.[267] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss.[268] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.[269] A further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico (the old classic),[270] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903.[271][272] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by El Clásico.[273] Athletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players,[274] have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the Lions won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005–06 to 2016–17.[270][275][276] However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.[277][260][278] Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times.[279][280] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws),[281] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings.[282][283][284] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\"). During the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium by the same method), then at the same stage in the 2013–14 edition with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate,[285] and again in 2017–18 with the Spanish club progressing 4–3;[286] both times they went on to win the competition. Another match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).[287][288][289] Their first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961–62 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in Paris.[288] At the quarter-final stage in 1995–96, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy.[288] In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1–0.[288][290] They met again in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate.[288] By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the Bianconeri in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.[291] The teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player Álvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid.[288] They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.[288][292][293] The latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017–18 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline.[294][295] Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick,[296] and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time,[297] he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.[298] It was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[299] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[78] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[300] The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[301] Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[81] By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion),[302] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million).[303] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[304] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.[305] A study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\"[306] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[307][308] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.[309] Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money,[310] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership.[311] The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[312] As of 2010, the club had 60,000 socios.[313] At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.[314][315] During the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football.[314] Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million.[314] For the 2010–11 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona;[316] furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, Forbes listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion.[317] Real Madrid was valued at €3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016–17 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million.[318] In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was £8.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona.[319][320] In 2022, Forbes listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.[321] Real Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the Goal! football movie trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream... (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.[322] Real, The Movie is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on galácticos such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase. The book White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled Legends, and a remix of the club's anthem, \"Himno del Real Madrid,\" was released as the first single from the album.[323] Real Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre. Hala Madrid is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the Madridistas Fan Club card holders.[324] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans).[6] The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches.[324] Real Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times. In 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play's liquidation in September 2009) would end up being Real Madrid: The Game, which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play's publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay. Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.

                "content": "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain.The club was formed in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, and played its first competitive match on 13 May 1902, when it lost 3–1 in the semi-final of the Campeonato de Copa de S.M. Alfonso XIII against FC Barcelona.[1] Real Madrid played against other local clubs in various regional tournaments, that served as qualifiers for the Copa del Rey, from 1902 to 1940. In 1929, the club became one of the founding members of La Liga, Spain's first national league. As of 2024, Real is one of only three clubs never to have been relegated from the top level of Spanish football, the others being Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona.[2][3] From 1902 to 1929, Real won the Copa del Rey five times and the regional championship 15 times. Real Madrid had a successful start in La Liga, finishing second in the competition's first season, and winning the league in 1932 for the first time. In the 1947–48 season, Madrid finished eleventh, which remains, as of 2024, the club's lowest final position.[4] Real Madrid won La Liga four times and the European Cup five times during the 1950s. However, the most successful period for the club in terms of domestic titles was the 1960s, when Real Madrid won eight league championships. It won its first double of league championship and national cup in 1962. Real is also the only Spanish football team to win five consecutive titles, a feat which it has achieved on two occasions (1960–65 and 1985–90).[5] In addition to their domestic success, Real Madrid's reputation as a major club was established by their outstanding record in the European Cup. To date, they have been crowned champions of Europe a record fifteen times. Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás and other famous players helped the club win the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included a memorable 7–3 Hampden Park final against German side Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. The club won the trophy for a sixth time in 1966 with a team known as the Ye-Ye that defeated Yugoslavian club Partizan 2–1 in the final while being composed entirely of Spanish-born players, a first in the competition. They were also runners-up in 1962, 1964 and 1981. Winning the competition five consecutive times saw Real permanently awarded the original cup and earning the right to wear a multiple-winner badge since 2000. They have also won the UEFA Cup twice and were twice runners-up in the European Cup Winners' Cup. In 1996, president Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach. Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions and several important players arrived at the club, such as Roberto Carlos, Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker and Clarence Seedorf, to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid, with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997, finally ended its 32-year wait for the seventh European Cup in 1998 under manager Jupp Heynckes, defeating Juventus 1–0 in the final thanks to a goal from Mijatović. Real Madrid would go on to win again in 2000, 2002 (under manager Vicente del Bosque), 2014 (under manager Carlo Ancelotti), 2016, 2017, 2018 (under manager Zinedine Zidane), 2022 and 2024 (again under Ancelotti). Madrid are also eight-time winners of the Intercontinental Cup/FIFA Club World Cup, defeating Peñarol, Vasco da Gama, Club Olimpia, San Lorenzo, Kashima Antlers, Grêmio, Al Ain and Al Hilal in 1960, 1998, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2022 respectively. Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza.[6] They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in December 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only club based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, called Nueva Sociedad de Foot-ball (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Nueva Sociedad was founded in October 1900 in a tavern on Calle de la Cruz. The dissenters were led by Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president.[7] The other dissenters included brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, as well as Adolfo Meléndez, Antonio Neyra, Manolo Mendía, Varela, and the Giralt brothers (Armando, José and Mario). In October 1901, Nueva Sociedad de Foot-ball was renamed as Madrid Football Club.[7][8][9] The first field the club used to play matches was a camp in Moncloa, located on the current Vallehermoso street. They utilised the El Solar de Estrada in 1901, which was owned by Claudio Estrada, a member of the club and the father-in-law of president Julián Palacios. The club later played matches at the Tiro del Pichón between 1901 and 1902.[10] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[6] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family's fashion business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[11][12] The club had 28 founding socios (members).[13] The club played its first ever match on 9 March 1902. It featured two teams of Madrid FC players and was played between the streets of Alcalá and Goya, next to the old Plaza de Toros. The two teams wore blue and red respectively, with the blue team winning the match 1–0.[14] Madrid paid an annual rent of 150 pesetas for the pitch, and the players changed into their playing kits in a tavern called La Taurina.[6] The regulations governing the club, comprising 22 articles, were drafted on 18 April and approved by provincial governor José Sanchez Guerra on 22 April 1902.[6] Madrid FC played its first match against another club on 2 May 1902 at the Hipódromo in a friendly against New Foot-Ball Club that ended in a 1–1 draw.[15] Carlos Padrós, wanting to demonstrate that the club could organize matches against other teams, helped organize the 1902 Copa de la Coronación in honour of the coronation of Alfonso XIII. He convinced the mayor of Madrid, Alberto Aguilera, to donate a silver cup as the prize for the winning team. Padrós contacted the captains of FC Barcelona, Club Español de Foot-Ball, Bizcaya (a combination of Athletic Club and Bilbao Football Club) and New Foot-Ball Club and invited them to enter the competition. The event was the first national football tournament played in Spain and was held at the Hipódromo. Madrid FC contested its first competitive match in the semi-finals of the Copa de la Coronación on 13 May.[11][6] Arthur Johnson scored the club's first competitive goal in a 1–3 loss to FC Barcelona. This was also the first El Clásico.[16] Madrid secured its first competitive victory defeating Club Español de Football (now RCD Espanyol) 3–2 on 16 May 1902.[17] On 23 May 1902, Alfonso Albéniz became the first player to leave FC Barcelona in order to join Madrid.[6] Madrid was invited to participate in festivities at El Escorial in August 1902, part of which included a match against Moncloa. The match was played next to the facade of the monastery on 11 August and ended with a 6–5 score favourable to Madrid. The club was awarded two ceramic plates which represent the first trophy in its history.[6] Carlos Padrós initiated the establishment of the Madrid Association of Foot-ball Clubs, a football association responsible for the administration of the sport in Madrid, in December 1902. He also became the association's first president. The Association organized the 1903 Campeonato de Madrid, the inaugural edition of the regional championship of Madrid.[note 1] Padrós resigned as president of the association in December 1903, and it dissolved in March 1904.[18][19] Madrid played their first match outside of the Community of Madrid against Club Español de Fútbol at the Parc de la Ciutadella in Barcelona on 24 February 1903.[15] The club participated in the inaugural edition of the Copa del Rey held at the Hipódromo in 1903. Madrid defeated RCD Espanyol 4–1 in the competition's first match on 6 April 1903.[20] The club finished runners-up after losing 3–2 in the final to Athletic Bilbao. The match was also the first El Viejo Clásico.[15] The club faced a major crisis during the 1903–04 season. A dispute between the members in October 1903 resulted in several players leaving the club to form Club Español de Madrid. They included Antonio Neyra, Enrique Aruabarrena, Pérez, Manuel Vallarino, Ramón Cárdenas, and brothers Mario, Armando and José Giralt. Five other Madrid players also left the club to join Moncloa.[21][11] This precipitated a merger with Moderno on 30 January 1904. Carlos Padrós was elected president post-merger.[22] The club officially adopted the name Madrid–Moderno due to the merger, although most members, players and fans generally continued to refer to it as Madrid. The club dropped the Moderno name before the next season.[23] Madrid retroactively secured the 1903 Campeonato de Madrid trophy, won by Moderno, as a result of their merger.[24] The club won the first Madrid derby defeating Atlético Madrid 6–0 on 13 November 1904 in a friendly at the Plaza de Toros.[25] Madrid was a founding member of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) on 21 May 1904.[6] Madrid qualified for the 1905 Copa del Rey by defeating Moncloa 2–0 to win the 1905 Campeonato de Madrid[note 1] at the Plaza de Toros on 2 April 1905.[25] Madrid defeated Athletic Bilbao 1–0 in the 1905 Copa del Rey final thanks to a goal by Manuel Prast, to win the first official title in their history.[6] The club secured four consecutive titles by winning again in 1906, 1907 and 1908, becoming the first team to win four consecutive Copa del Rey titles. Madrid was allowed to keep the original trophy following its third consecutive victory in 1907. The club also won four consecutive regional championships between 1905 and 1908. On 23 October 1905, Madrid organised a friendly against French side Gallia FC to commemorate the visit of French President Émile Loubet to Madrid. It was the club's first match against a foreign side and the first international match to take place in Madrid.[6] In 1907, Madrid lost a match to a team of seminarians from Royal English College in Valladolid, with Edward Power scoring five goals in a 6–2 victory.[26] In 1957, then-club president Santiago Bernabéu was quoted as saying that the \"game changed the whole history of football in Spain by showing us how football should be played.\"[27] Madrid became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish football association.[6] Club vice-president and player José Ángel Berraondo, who was instrumental in helping Madrid secure four Copa del Rey titles, left the club in 1909. He returned to his hometown of San Sebastián and became one of the founding members of Real Sociedad.[6] Arthur Johnson was appointed as manager of Madrid FC in 1910 becoming the first manager in the club's history.[28] Santiago Bernabéu made his debut for the club on 3 March 1912 when he was only 16 years old in a friendly against English Sports Club.[29][30][31] In 1912, Madrid moved to their first permanent home ground called Campo de O'Donnell, after previously moving between some minor grounds.[32] The venue was inaugurated on 31 October 1912 with a match against Sporting Club de Irún.[29] Madrid secured their 6th regional championship during the 1912–13 season,[24] and three consecutive regional titles between 1916 and 1918.[24] The semi-finals of the 1916 Copa del Rey involved four matches between Madrid and FC Barcelona. Madrid defeated Barcelona 4–2 in the second replay match to qualify for the final, where it lost to Athletic Bilbao.[33] The club won its 5th Copa del Rey trophy in 1917 defeating Arenas Club de Getxo in the final,[34] and won its 10th regional championship during the 1919–20 season.[24] The club's name was changed to Real Madrid Football Club after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of real (Spanish for \"royal\") to the club on 29 June 1920. The royal patronage also permitted the club to add the royal crown to its crest.[35] Real Madrid visited Italy in 1920 and played several friendlies against local sides including Bologna, US Livorno, and Genoa, marking the first foreign tour in its history.[29] Santiago Bernabéu left the club to join Athletic Madrid ahead of the 1920–21 season. He would only play one match before re-joining Real Madrid in 1921.[36][37] The Madrid team wore black armbands in a match against Athletic Madrid on 5 Match 1922, in honour of the deaths of Madrid player Sotero Aranguren and Bilbao player Pichichi, becoming the first team to make such a gesture.[37] The club had to leave the Campo de O'Donnell in 1923, because the owner wanted to develop the land, and adopted the Campo de Ciudad Lineal as their new home stadium. The ground was leased to Madrid by the heirs of urban planner Arturo Soria. It was the first grass playing field in the club's history, contained a pitch that was 108 metres long by 68 metres wide, and had a capacity for 8,000 spectators.[37] Madrid defeated Real Unión 2-0 in the inaugural match played at the Ciudad Lineal on 29 April 1923.[38] Construction of the Estadio Chamartín was completed in 1924, and it would serve as Madrid's home stadium until the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium opened in 1947. The Chamartín was inaugurated on 17 May 1924 with a 3–2 victory over Newcastle United.[37] Real Madrid embarked on its first tour of England in 1925 playing friendlies against Newcastle United, Birmingham City and Tottenham Hotspur. Although the club lost all three matches, it received praise from the British press for its talent and playing style.[37] Real Madrid switched to wearing black shorts for the 1925–26 season, however following a series of poor results, club president Pedro Parages switched back to the all-white kit.[37] The club toured the Americas for the first time in 1927 visiting Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, Cuba, Mexico and the United States over a period of three and half months.[37] During this period, Real Madrid continued its regional dominance in the Campeonato Regional Centro winning the championship in the 1921–22, 1922–23, 1923–24, 1925–26, and 1926–27 seasons.[24] Madrid reached the 1924 Copa del Rey final but lost to Real Unión. The Copa Federación Centro, a football competition contested by clubs from the Castile region, and a second-tier competition to the Campeonato was first held between 6 May and 17 June 1923 and won by Real Madrid. The next edition was held in 1928 and was also won by Madrid.[24] Real Madrid participated in the Torneo de Campeones during the 1927–28 season. The competition involved the six teams that had previously won the Copa del Rey, and was played with a make shift schedule. The teams had been scheduled to play each other in a double round-robin format, however all matches could not be played, and some teams including Real only played 9 games. The Torneo de Campeones served as a rehearsal for the establishment of La Liga, the first national football league in Spain, in the following season.[39] Real Madrid led the inaugural 1929 La Liga season for the first 10 matchdays, however after dropping points in the next three games, they dropped to third behind Club de Getxo and then Barcelona. A string of four victories enabled Madrid to retake the lead ahead of the last match, but a loss to Athletic Bilbao on the final matchday meant they finished runners-up, just one point behind Barcelona.[37] Madrid reached the finals of the Copa del Rey in 1928–29 and 1930 but lost on both occasions. Real Madrid acquired goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora from RCD Espanyol for 150,000 pesetas (900€) in 1930. He made his debut on 5 October 1930 against Athletic Madrid in the Campeonato Regional Centro.[37] On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title \"Real\" and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club. Madrid won its first Primera División title in the 1931–32 season finishing the league unbeaten. They retained the title the following year equaling Athletic Bilbao for most league title wins, and were close to clinching the domestic double, but lost the 1933 Copa del Presidente de la República final[note 2] to Bilbao 1–2.[40] After a gap of 17 years, the club would secure their 6th domestic cup in 1934 defeating Valencia 2–1. Madrid won their 7th Copa in 1936 losing to Barcelona 2–1. The club consistently finished as runners-up in La Liga between 1933–34 and 1935–36. In the regional championship, Madrid won a record 8 consecutive Campeonato Regional Centro titles between 1928–29 and 1935–36, winning a record 23 regional championships in total. No football competitions were held in Spain for three seasons between 1936–37 and 1938–39 due to the Spanish Civil War. Madrid finished 4th in the 1939–40 La Liga season, the first one held after the Civil War. The 1939 Campeonato Mancomunado Centro, where Madrid finished runners-up to Athletic-Aviación, was the last edition of the regional championship. The club reached the final of the 1940 Copa del Generalísimo[note 2] but finished runners-up. On 1 January 1941, Madrid Football Club changed their name to Real Madrid Club de Fútbol and restored the royal crown on their crest.[41][42] Real Madrid finished 6th, 2nd and 10th in the league in 1940–41, 1941–42 and 1942–43 respectively. On 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in a controversial second leg match of the 1943 Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals.[43] It remains the largest victory margin in the history of El Clásico. According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[44] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said, \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[45] Madrid lost to Athletic Bilbao 0–1 in the final. Before becoming president in 1943, Santiago Bernabéu had already carried out the functions of player, first-team captain, club maintenance, first-team manager and director in an association with the club that would last nearly 70 years. He was responsible for rebuilding the club after the Civil War and oversaw the construction of the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and the Ciudad Deportiva. Bernabéu also reorganized the club at all levels in what would become the normal operating hierarchy of professional clubs in the future, giving every section and level of the club independent technical teams and recruiting staff, such as Raimundo Saporta. Moreover, under Bernabéu's tutelage, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"cantera,\" known today as La Fábrica.[46] Finally, beginning in 1953, Bernabéu embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from Spain and abroad, the most prominent being Argentine Alfredo di Stéfano. During Bernabéu's presidency, many of Real Madrid's most legendary names played for the club, including Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Francisco Gento, Héctor Rial, Raymond Kopa, José Santamaría, Miguel Muñoz, Amancio and Santillana. It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force both in Spanish and European football. Before passing away in 1978, Bernabéu had been the club's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won 1 Intercontinental Cup, 6 European Cups, 16 league titles, 6 Spanish Cups, 2 Latin Cups, and 1 Copa Eva Duarte.[47] After a brief period as interim president, Raimundo Saporta called for elections. The club's treasurer, Luis de Carlos, resigned in order to run for president. 26 July 1978 was the deadline for candidates to apply in order to run for office. De Carlos submitted 3,352 documents endorsing his candidacy, while the rest – gynaecologist Campos Gil and florist José Daguerre – did not get the minimum number required in time. This called off the election and Luis de Carlos was proclaimed president of Real Madrid. On 4 June 1980, the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium hosted the Copa del Rey final between Real Madrid and Real Madrid Castilla, the club's second team that was initially founded on 21 July 1972. Castilla managed to defeat four First Division teams – Hércules, Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad and Sporting de Gijón – to reach the final. Real Madrid defeated Castilla, coached by the sorely-missed Juanjo, by a score of 6–1. Later in the year, France Football magazine named Real Madrid \"Best European Team\" of 1980. The jury took into account the two national titles the team won that year – La Liga and the Copa del Rey – and the fact that they reached the semi-finals of the European Cup that season. Despite the previous year's successes, the 1980–81 season had an unpleasant finish for Madrid. On 26 April 1981, they lost the league title when the victory chant was already being sung in Valladolid. Real Sociedad, who drew 2–2 against Sporting de Gijón in the last minute at El Molinón, claimed the title. Barely one month later, in the 1981 European Cup Final on 27 May, an Alan Kennedy goal gave Liverpool the European Cup title over Madrid. The professional Real Madrid squad was one of four teams of the Primera División to back the strike called on 11 April 1982. On that day, the Whites played at Castellón with Castilla footballers and defeated the hosts 1–2. The final of the 1982 FIFA World Cup took place at the Santiago Bernabéu. In a thrilling match, Italy outplayed West Germany and won 3–1. What most spectators will remember most from that 11 July 1982 was the joy that overcame President of Italy Sandro Pertini each time the Italian side scored. With the presidential elections on the horizon, candidate Luis de Carlos introduced Alfredo Di Stéfano and Amancio Amaro as coaches of the first team and Castilla, respectively, on 19 May 1982. \"The Arrow,\" as Di Stéfano was popularly known, initially left Madrid in 1964 only to return 18 years later. In the election, de Carlos defeated Ramón Mendoza and invited Di Stéfano, who signed to manage the team on a two-year contract. His first season in charge is best remembered by the bizarre fact of five trophies closely lost, four of them in four finals (Supercopa, European Cup Winners' Cup, Copa del Rey and Copa de La Liga). Besides that, in La Liga the squad finished in 2nd place a single point behind champions basque-side Athletic Bilbao after losing 0–1 against former Di Stefano club Valencia in the ultimate match at Mestalla Stadium. Madrid were leading most of the rounds before the game and only needed a draw to clinch the title.[48] Once the 1983–84 season had ended, Di Stéfano again said goodbye to Real Madrid. Twenty-one years later he went through the same experience. His contract ended on 30 June 1984 and Luis de Carlos decided not to re-sign him due to the failure to achieve sporting success. On 12 December 1984, Emilio Butragueño became a European household name with an unforgettable performance against Anderlecht at the Bernabéu. The Belgians were coming off a 3–0 first leg win in Brussels and had the next round of the UEFA Cup in sight, but Butragueño crushed their hopes with a three-goal performance (the others by Valdano [two] and Sanchís) and Real Madrid won convincingly 6–1, progressing on aggregate. Real Madrid's first two UEFA Cup titles were won back-to-back—the first in 1985 against Hungary's Videoton (3–0 at Sóstói Stadion and 0–1 at Chamartín) and the second over 1. FC Köln in 1986 (5–1 at the Bernabéu and 0–2 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin). After two brief stints as a director and an election-time defeat to Luis de Carlos, Ramón Mendoza's became president of Real Madrid in 1985, ushering in the dawn of a new era in the history of the club. \"La Quinta del Buitre\" was the name given by Spanish sport journalist Julio César Iglesias to the five homegrown Real Madrid players who were at the core of the team that dominated Spanish football in the 1980s. The name, meaning \"Vulture's Cohort\" in English, was derived from the nickname given to its most charismatic member, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members included Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. Sanchís and Martín Vázquez were the first to play for the first team of Real Madrid, making their debut at Murcia on 4 December 1983 under coach Alfredo Di Stéfano. Both played surprisingly well, with Sanchís scoring the game's winner. A few months later, on 5 February 1984, Butragueño debuted in an away match at Cádiz. El Buitre was an instant sensation and scored twice. Pardeza was added to the first team that same season and Míchel followed at the start of the next. With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left the club for Zaragoza in 1986), Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning, amongst others, two UEFA Cups and five Spanish championships in a row. Their record was only blemished by their failure to win the European Cup, and their continued abject defeats against the far superior Milan side of the time. Martín Vázquez went to play for Torino in 1990, later returning to Madrid in 1992 only to leave again in 1995 for Deportivo de La Coruña. Butragueño left the club in 1995 and Míchel in 1996, both joining Atlético Celaya in Mexico. Sanchís was the only member of La Quinta to play his entire career with Madrid. By winning the Champions League twice (in 1998 and 2000), he accomplished what La Quinta had failed to achieve in its glory days. He retired in 2001 as the last active member of the famous cohort at the age of 37. After ten-and-a-half years in office, Ramón Mendoza handed in his irrevocable resignation on 20 November 1995. He was relieved by Lorenzo Sanz, who held recourse to Club by-law 49 to get elected as heir to Mendoza by the 11 directors who continued on the Board of Directors following the transfer of power. On 20 May 1996, Lorenzo Sanz presented Fabio Capello as new head coach of Real Madrid. The Italian trainer landed in Madrid borne out by his five successful seasons with Milan (with whom he won the 1994 Champions League) to replace Arsenio Iglesias, who managed the team on a temporary basis after coach Jorge Valdano resigned. Although winning the league, however, Capello left Madrid after just one season, saying years later did so because he did not settle at Madrid as well as he would have wanted; he returned to Milan. Replacing Capello was the German Jupp Heynckes, who led the team to win the much-awaited Champions League/European Cup title, the team's last having come in 1966. In the Final, held at the Amsterdam Arena on 20 May 1998, the Merengues conquered their seventh top European trophy with a goal by Pedja Mijatović against Juventus, who were the favourites on the night. Despite conquering Europe, Heynckes was fired at the end of the year and replaced by José Antonio Camacho, who himself resigned just months later in July 1998 before the actual season even began. The team then hired Guus Hiddink to take the reins of the squad, his first challenge being the 1998 Intercontinental Cup. An extraordinary goal by Raúl in Tokyo sealed a 2–1 end result for Los Blancos over Brazilian side Vasco da Gama. Hiddink, however, was fired just after less than a season, with the Welshman John Toshack replacing him in February 1999. Nine months later, during the 1999–2000 season, Toshack was also fired, the seventh coaching change in just three years. Under the guidance of new manager Vicente del Bosque, Real Madrid claimed their eighth European Cup/Champions League title. The Final, held at the newly built Stade de France in Paris, would host the competition's (including the European Cup era) first-ever Spanish final, pitting Madrid against Valencia on 24 May 2000. The game Madrid comfortably defeat Los Che 3–0, with goals coming from Fernando Morientes, Steve McManaman and Raúl. In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president, vowing to erase the club's debt and modernise the club's facilities, though the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of then-Barcelona star Luís Figo. During the campaign, Pérez claimed he had an agreement with the Portuguese winger that would see Figo move to the Bernabéu should Pérez be elected. On July 16, Pérez won the election and indeed, eight days later, Figo was presented with the number 10 shirt for Madrid. Days later, surrounded by controversy, Real Madrid idol Fernando Redondo, who had openly supported Pérez's opponent Lorenzo Sanz, was sold to Italian giants Milan. During the summer of 2000, Real Madrid signed Claude Makélélé, Albert Celades, Flávio Conceição, César Sánchez, Pedro Munitis and Santiago Solari, although aside from Makélélé and Conceição, the rest had been signed prior to the election of Pérez. Expectations were high as Los Blancos began the 2000–01 season with the possibility of winning five trophies. The club, however, stumbled at the first test, losing the 2000 UEFA Super Cup by a score of 1–2 to 2000 UEFA Cup champions Galatasaray. Later, an injury to Fernando Morientes left Real Madrid without a centre forward, but manager Vicente del Bosque improvised by using youth team graduate Guti in the role, with Real Madrid coping and making good start to both their domestic and European campaigns. They were, however, defeated 2–0 at the Camp Nou against rivals Barcelona and were later eliminated from the Copa del Rey by lowly Toledo, as well as losing the Intercontinental Cup final to a Boca Juniors side led by Martín Palermo and Juan Román Riquelme. Nonetheless, Real Madrid recovered form and went top of the league table in mid-January, a position they would not relinquish on their way to ultimately winning the title. Madrid also advanced from the second group stage of the Champions League to face Galatasaray in the quarter-finals. Los Merengues lost the first leg in Istanbul 3–2, but recovered to win the tie after a 3–0 victory at the Bernabéu. This would then set-up a replay of the 1999–2000 Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich. This year, however, Real Madrid would not reach the final, losing 1–3 on aggregate to the eventual champions. Despite the setback, on 26 May, Madrid would crown themselves champions of the first division with an emphatic 5–0 win over Alavés at the Bernabéu. Two goals by Raúl and one each by Guti, Fernando Hierro and Iván Helguera would ensure victory and Real Madrid's 28th league title with two matches left to play. After reaching an agreement to re-zone and sell the Ciudad Deportiva, Pérez went on to sign Zinedine Zidane in 2001, Ronaldo in 2002 and David Beckham in 2003. The media began referring to the team as \"Los Galácticos\". The strategy, initially dubbed \"Zidanes y Pavones\", meant to integrate world stars and youth team graduates together on the squad. It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the field, the Zidanes y Pavones policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia. The few days after capturing the 2002–03 league title were mired with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque after Real's sporting director claimed that Del Bosque was not the right man for the job; they wanted someone young to shake up the team. The turning atmosphere continued when Madrid legend and captain Fernando Hierro left the club after a disagreement with management, as did Steve McManaman. However, the club toured Asia in pre-season and introduced newly signed galáctico David Beckham. Pérez and his directors refused to renew Claude Makélélé's contract with an improved salary, upsetting Makélélé who asked for a transfer, eventually moving to Chelsea. In the final days of the transfer window, Fernando Morientes also left the club, joining French Ligue 1 side Monaco on loan. Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, began their domestic league slowly after a hard-fought win over Real Betis. Doubts of the team were quelled, however, when Madrid won 7–2 at home over Real Valladolid. The second half of the season then saw the team giving playing time to youngsters and academy graduates, including Borja, Álvaro Mejía, Antonio Núñez and Juanfran, as Queiroz opted to rotate his squad. Real Madrid also topped their group in the Champions League, advancing to the quarter-finals after defeating Bayern Munich in the round of 16 2–1 on aggregate. However, Madrid's on-loan striker Fernando Morientes punished his team in the quarter-finals, as Madrid saw Monaco progress 5–5 on aggregate via the away goals rule and move on to the semi-finals. Madrid nonetheless kept their Liga form high, leading the table by eight point over second-placed Valencia in February. A poor run of form would await them, however, as they were beaten for the first time at the Bernabéu that season at the hands of Osasuna, 0–3. They recovered their points lead after a win at the Vicente Calderón Stadium over city rivals Atlético Madrid, but more disappointments quickly followed; they lost their final five league games at home to Mallorca, Barcelona and Real Sociedad, and also lost away at both Real Murcia and Deportivo de La Coruña. These defeats allowed all of Valencia, Barça and Deportivo to leapfrog them in the table and end the year in up the top three, respectively, as Real ended the season in a disappointing fourth. Their poor performances continued as they lost the final of the Copa del Rey to Real Zaragoza. Shortly after the end of the season, Queiroz was sacked and replaced by ex-Real Madrid player José Antonio Camacho. Camacho highlighted the team's poor defensive performances and persuaded Florentino Pérez to spend a total of €45 million on both Argentine defender Walter Samuel and English centre-back Jonathan Woodgate from Roma and Newcastle United, respectively, but failed to sign Arsenal's midfield general Patrick Vieira due to his boldness of asking for a Galáctico-like paycheck in the likeness of Luís Figo's, Zinedine Zidane's, Ronaldo's and David Beckham's. The summer of 2004 also saw the sale of Cameroonian striker Samuel Eto'o, who had been previously loaned out to Mallorca, to archrivals Barcelona. In addition to the defensive additions, English striker Michael Owen was bought from Liverpool, but the player never settled at Real Madrid. Somewhat ironically, Eto'o would go on to achieve great success with Barcelona in just his first season with the team. Camacho resigned as head coach because of his team's poor performances and was replaced by Mariano García Remón. García Remón's last game was a loss at the hand of Sevilla, where the eventual champions Barça were six points clear from their nearest rivals, and Madrid sitting in lowly fifth. Remón was replaced by Vanderlei Luxemburgo after the winter break, who then signed Thomas Gravesen from Everton to fill the hole in midfield. Madrid failed to progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League and in the Copa del Rey, but under Luxemburgo, Madrid fought hard to earn second place with 80 points, four points behind Barcelona. The 2005–06 season began with several new signings, including Júlio Baptista (€20 million), Robinho (€30 million) and Sergio Ramos (€30 million). However, Luxemburgo was not able to find the right formula on the pitch, as Real Madrid's poor form continued and hitting rock bottom after a humiliating 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Bernabéu. Luxemburgo would eventually resign and be replaced by Juan Ramón López Caro, the former the manager of Real Madrid Castilla. A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after losing the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Zaragoza. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time by Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned as club president.[49] Real Madrid eventually managed to finish second in the league but did not pose a serious threat to defending champions Barcelona. On July 2, 2006, Ramón Calderón was elected as club president and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new head coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. As new manager of Real Madrid, Capello signed 2006 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro and Emerson, both from embattled Juventus, for a total sum of €23 million; Ruud van Nistelrooy from Manchester United for €15 million; Mahamadou Diarra from Lyon for €26 million; and on a last minute trade-loan José Antonio Reyes, with Júlio Baptista going the other way after a disappointing stint at Madrid. However, Calderón failed to sign Milan's Kaká, Arsenal's Cesc Fàbregas and Chelsea's Arjen Robben, as he had previously promised. Nonetheless, during the January transfer window, he did manage to sign Fluminense left back Marcelo (€6.5M), River Plate forward Gonzalo Higuaín (€13M) and Boca Juniors midfielder Fernando Gago (€18M). On 16 January 2007, Calderón made some very unfortunate comments about the behaviour of some players in the squad and the Santiago Bernabéu fans, which has put the club in a delicate situation.[50] One of the players that Calderón criticised was David Beckham, who, in January 2007, agreed to a deal to play for the LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer (MLS) at the end of that season. Among others to criticise Beckham was manager Fabio Capello, who at the time vowed never to select Beckham for the team again, although he later withdrew his words. At the end of January, striker Ronaldo left the club for €7.5 million for Milan. On 9 February 2007, Capello allowed Beckham back onto Real's starting 11 in an away match against Real Sociedad. Beckham played well and scored the equalizing goal in the match, a 2–1 triumph. On 24 February 2007, the Madrid Derby between Atlético and Real at the Vicente Calderón finished in a 1–1 draw, with goals coming from Fernando Torres and Gonzalo Higuaín for Atlético and Real respectively. On 7 March 2007, Real Madrid failed to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League, stifled by Bayern Munich's strong home performance. Despite winning the home leg 3–2, they lost 2–1 at the Allianz Arena in Munich and were eliminated on an away goals tiebreaker. Bayern also scored the fastest goal in the Champions League during that match, after Roberto Carlos lost the ball after kick-off, which led to Roy Makaay scoring in ten seconds. On 10 March 2007, Real Madrid contested the Clásico against Barcelona at the Camp Nou. Real Madrid took the lead three times after two goals from Ruud van Nistelrooy and one from Sergio Ramos, but were pegged back by a hat-trick from Lionel Messi, including an injury-time equaliser. Despite the sending off of Oleguer, the Clásico ended 3–3. Real Madrid managed to find their form consistently for the first time all season as they managed to win seven out of eight of the final twelve games, including a 2–1 home win over Valencia on 21 April 2007 and another 3–2 home win over Sevilla on 6 May 2007. Calderón then went on to say that if the team keep up their great play, he was confident Real Madrid will win the league title and end their four-year wait for a major trophy on June 17. On 12 May 2007, despite not having Robinho and Beckham on the pitch (due to separate yellow cards given in the previous match against Sevilla), Real Madrid took over first place in the La Liga for the first time all season by defeating Espanyol 4–3, coming back from 1–3 first half deficit. Los Blancos were able to avoid a 3–3 draw thanks to an 89th-minute goal by Gonzalo Higuaín. The Sunday after, Barça dropped points with a 1–1 draw to struggling Real Betis. By virtue of their superior head-to-head record, Real Madrid sat at the top of the Liga table with four crucial matches left to play. The following Sunday, Real managed to beat Recreativo de Huelva 2–3 at the Nuevo Colombino. With the score tied at 2–2, Real Madrid looked set return the lead back to rivals Barcelona until Roberto Carlos scored at the end of the match from a Fernando Gago assist and the squad left Huelva with just three games left to play against, in order, Deportivo, Zaragoza and Mallorca. On 26 May 2007, Real Madrid put in another excellent performance to defeat Deportivo 3–1 at the Bernabéu. This victory made it six wins in a row for Real Madrid, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Raúl and Ruud van Nistelrooy securing the win. On 9 June, Real played their penultimate league fixture against Zaragoza at La Romareda. The match began badly when Real Madrid were forced to change their starting lineup mere minutes before the start of the match when young defender Miguel Torres suffered an injury during warm-up, tearing his hamstring. In the game, Zaragoza led Real 2–1 near the end of the match, while Barcelona were also winning against Espanyol 2–1. Real's title challenge looked to be over. A late Van Nistelrooy equalizer, however, followed by a last minute Raúl Tamudo goal for Espanyol, sprang Real Madrid's title hopes back into their favour. Sevilla were also held 0–0 away against Mallorca, which meant that a win at home against Mallorca would effectively secure Los Merengues their 30th Spanish league title. The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu, while Barcelona and Sevilla faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona; however, three goals in the last half-an-hour secured Real Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003. The first goal came from José Antonio Reyes, who scored after a good work from Higuaín. An own goal followed by another delightful goal from Reyes allowed Real to begin celebrating the title. Thousands of Real Madrid fans began going to Plaza de Cibeles to celebrate the title. On 25 August, Real Madrid kicked off the season in a derby against city rivals Atlético Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu. It was a highly entertaining display from both sides but Real managed to win 2–1, with goals from Raúl and Wesley Sneijder for Real, while Sergio Agüero scored for Atlético. It was a great start for Real as they showed skill and that they were adapting to the new style of play new manager Bernd Schuster had brought in. On 28 August, Sevilla's Antonio Puerta died after three days in the hospital. The Santiago Bernabéu Trophy, which Real Madrid was about contend for against Sporting CP, was cancelled in honour of Puerta. On 2 September, Real Madrid managed to win 5–0 against Villarreal at El Madrigal, with two goals from Sneijder, one from Raúl, one from Ruud van Nistelrooy and one from Guti. Real extended their winning streak to three after they beat Almería at home before earning a well-deserved 1–1 draw against Real Valladolid, with Javier Saviola scoring the equalizer three minutes from final time. Four days later, Real remained unbeaten as they beat Real Betis 2–0 at the Bernabéu, with goals from Raúl and an amazing bicycle kick from Júlio Baptista. Real continued their unbeaten run under Schuster by beating Getafe 0–1 away to ensure Los Blancos remain at the summit of La Liga. Real began their European campaign well, defeating German side Werder Bremen 2–1 at home thanks to goals from Raúl and Van Nistelrooy and topping their group over Olympiacos, Werder Bremen and Lazio, respectively. However, they lost in the first knockout round against Roma, 4–2 on aggregate. On 9 December 2008, it was announced Bernd Schuster had been sacked as manager, and that ex-Tottenham Hotspur manager Juande Ramos would replace him.[51] That season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, crashed out of the Copa del Rey to third tier side Real Unión, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble. Madrid then lost their final four league games to cap off the disastrous campaign.[52] On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[53][54] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[55] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[56] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[57] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[58][59] José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[60][61] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[62] The matches in the Champions League proved the most controversial, as multiple refereeing decisions were harshly criticized by Mourinho and Madrid players who accused UEFA of favoring the Catalan side. Namely, Pepe's red card in the 61st minute of the first leg was questioned, after which Barcelona scored two goals, with Mourinho being ejected and subsequently banned for the second leg for protesting, and several controversial offside calls were made, as well as Real having a goal disallowed in the second leg, when the score was tied 0–0.[63][64] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe. In the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[65] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[66] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich on penalties (after a 3–3 aggregate tie) in a heartbreaking fashion. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[67][68] Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals (including an emphatic 3–1 victory at Camp Nou)[69] before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. in a heartbreaking fashion. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[70] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[71] On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[73] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[74] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[75] By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[76] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after 12 years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[77] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La Décima\".[78] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[79] After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos, and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[80] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[81] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[82] After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[83] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[84] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[85] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[86] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011–12.[87] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[88] several heartbreaking defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[89][90] On 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[91] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player Denis Cheryshev in a 3–1 first leg away win against Cádiz. Cheryshev was suspended from the previous season for three yellow cards (when he was representing a different team) but played the game nonetheless due to an accounting mistake by Madrid officials. Real was disqualified from the 2015–16 Copa del Rey two days later by the competition judge despite protests from president Pérez.[92][93][94] In the meantime, Real comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to get good results against top teams.[95] Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[96] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favor, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[97] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"La Undécima\".[98][99][90] Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[100] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[101] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[102] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[103] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[104] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[105] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[106][107] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duodécima\".[108] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[109] Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[110] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[111] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[112] On 24 January 2018, Madrid was knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the quarter-final stage by Leganés on away goals. The team's league campaign was also a disappointment as Real collected only 76 points and finished third, 17 points behind champions Barcelona. Madrid fared far better in the Champions League, once again progressing to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-final appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[113][114] Madrid ended the season with four trophies out of possible six. Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[115] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[116] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice), and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[59] On 12 June, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spain national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spain national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[117][118][119] The club then began aggressively re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[120] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a disgraceful 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after 10 games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[121] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain by a 4–1 margin in the FIFA Club World Cup final. With their win, Real Madrid became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles. They are considered to have been the world champions for grand total of seven times because FIFA officially recognizes the Intercontinental Cup as the predecessor of the FIFA Club World Cup. They also extended the record for most consecutive titles with their third in a row.[122] Solari won 10 out his first 13 La Liga matches, but the team started to struggle again soon after that. First, they were knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 0–3 at home on 27 February 2019 after a 1–1 away draw in the first leg. Then there was another El Clásico a few days later, this time in the league, and Madrid against lost a home game to Barça, 0–1. Finally, on 5 March 2019, Real was thumped by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) in a home game, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[123][124] Madrid went on to win five, draw two and lose four remaining league matches under Zidane, finishing third with 68 points, 12 losses and a +17 goal difference, making it Real's worst points total since 2001–02 and worst goal difference since 1999–2000.[125] The club won one out of five possible trophies in one of the most disastrous seasons in its modern history.[126] The 2019–20 season seemed a promising one, as Madrid went on a spending spree in the summer of 2019, signing Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million. On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[127] On 6 February 2020, Madrid was eliminated by Real Sociedad in the Copa del Rey quarter-finals, losing 3–4 at home.[128] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[129] Madrid played the postponed second leg of the Champions League round of 16 against Manchester City in August, losing 1–2 (2–4 on aggregate) at the Etihad and being eliminated at the first knockout stage for the second consecutive year.[130] As such, Real ended the season with two trophies out of possible four.[131] From La Liga's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Madrid temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[132] Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[133] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[134] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[135][136][137] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[138] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[139] defeating pre-tournament favorites Paris Saint-Germain,[140][141] defending champions Chelsea,[142] Premier League champions and heavy favorites Manchester City,[143] all in dramatic fashion, and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favorites,[144] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[145][146] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17).[147] Despite Real Madrid's status as the most decorated team in European Cup / Champions League history, they were considered underdogs in this season's campaign, rated no higher than seventh prior to the start of the group stages in September 2021 (after, in order, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United).[148] Prior to the start of the knockout phase in February 2022, they were again seventh, behind Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, and Ajax, in addition to having been considered underdogs to all of the teams they faced thereafter.[149] As such, Madrid's run can be considered among the most improbable ones in modern Champions League history.[150] In 2023, Real Madrid wins its 20th Copa del Rey after beating Barcelona 4–0 in the semifinals, and defeating Osasuna 2–1 in the final. In July 2023, Karim Benzema left Real Madrid to go to Al Ittihad, and Marco Asensio also left Real Madrid, this time going to Paris Saint-Germain. However, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund, who would score 19 goals in his first La Liga season, and winning the Kopa Trophy and the Laureus for his outstanding performance at Real Madrid. They also signed Arda Güler from Fenerbahçe, but he has spent most of his time on the bench. In October 2023, Eden Hazard retired from football at just 32 years old after having a poor performance on the team, and because he had many injuries that prevented him from playing. Real Madrid's first title in 2024 was the Spanish Supercup, in which they defeated Atlético de Madrid 5–3 in the semifinals and in the final they beat Barcelona 4–1.[151] More domestic success would come when they won their 36th league title, having a long run with Girona, who was first on the table for several journeys, but would lose several times while Real Madrid would only lose one game, and being the first spanish team to qualify for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League. In the Champions League, Real Madrid would advance as leader of Group C along with Napoli, Braga and 1. FC Union Berlin. In the round of 16, they would face RB Leipzig, which they would defeat 2–1 on aggregate, advancing to the quarter finals against Manchester City. They drawed the first game 3–3, and in the complicated second leg a 1–1 draw that would lead them to penalties. Finally, Real Madrid would win 4–3 on penalties, facing Bayern Munich at semifinals. They would draw the first match at the Allianz Arena 2–2, and at the Santiago Bernabéu they would turn it around in the last minutes by 2–1. They qualified for the final against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley Stadium. The match kicked off at 20:00 UTC+0 in Wembley, England. At minute 20, Karim Adeyemi has a clear opportunity in front of the goal, but he opens up too much and Carvajal intervenes. Just two minutes later, Niclas Füllkrug has another clear opportunity without defense in front of the goal, but the shot goes off the post and he misses the opportunity. In the 48th minute, Toni Kroos has a free kick that almost ends in a goal, but Gregor Kobel saves the shot. In the 62nd minute, Dortmund has another chance, a long, curved pass for Füllkrug, but Thibaut Courtois makes another save. In the 73rd minute, Real Madrid had a corner taken by Toni Kroos, and Dani Carvajal converted the score to 1–0 with a header. Minute 80, Eduardo Camavinga has a distant opportunity, but again Kobel avoids the goal. Two minutes later, Dortmund makes a serious mistake that Belligham takes advantage of, passes to Vinicius and makes it 2–0. With this score, Real Madrid become champions for the 15th time, and Luka Modrić, Dani Carvajal, Nacho and Toni Kroos become the top winners of the Champions League, equaling Paco Gento's record. This was last Toni Kroos' last game with Real Madrid after he announced his retirement after Euro 2024.[152] Despite their success in the Champions League, several players announced their departures from the team. Among them Nacho, the captain would go to Al Qadsiah, Toni Kroos would retire and Joselu would go to Al Gharafa. On June 3, one of the most anticipated signings arrived, the signing of Kylian Mbappé to Real Madrid from PSG was made official, he would have a contract for 5 seasons. His presentation would be on July 16 in the Santiago Bernabéu in front of 80,000 people. Mbappe's debut and the first match of the 2024–25 season would be against Atalanta in the 2024 UEFA Super Cup, a match that Real Madrid would win 2–0, becoming the top winners of this competition.",

                "content": "The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) that is contested by top-division European clubs. The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations. Introduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens (French for European Champion Clubs' Cup), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997–98 season.[1] While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default,[2] with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season.[3][4] Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League.[5] In its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June.[6] The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.[7][8] Spanish clubs have the most victories (20 wins), followed by England (15 wins) and Italy (12 wins). England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 23 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once.[9] Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times. Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions).[10] Only one club has won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to the tournament victory: Bayern Munich in the 2019–20 season.[11] Real Madrid is the current European champion, having beaten Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2024 final for their fifteenth title. The first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 5–3.[12] The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[13] Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the \"club championship of the continent\" by the local newspapers.[14][15] The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs.[16] In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.[17] Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent. The tournament was won by Újpest of Hungary.[17] Latin European nations came together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.[18] After receiving reports from his journalists over the highly successful South American Championship of Champions of 1948, Gabriel Hanot, editor of L'Équipe, began proposing the creation of a continent-wide tournament.[19] In interviews, Jacques Ferran (one of the founders of the European Champions Cup, together with Gabriel Hanot),[20] said that the South American Championship of Champions was the inspiration for the European Champions Cup.[21] After Stan Cullis declared Wolverhampton Wanderers \"Champions of the World\" following a successful run of friendlies in the 1950s, in particular a 3–2 friendly victory against Budapest Honvéd, Hanot finally managed to convince UEFA to put into practice such a tournament.[1] It was conceived in Paris in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup.[1] The first European Cup took place during the 1955–56 season.[22][23] Sixteen teams participated (some by invitation): AC Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurgården (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany), Saarbrücken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Reims (France) and Vörös Lobogó (Hungary).[22][23] The first European Cup match took place on 4 September 1955, and ended in a 3–3 draw between Sporting CP and Partizan.[22][23] The first goal in European Cup history was scored by João Baptista Martins of Sporting CP.[22][23] The inaugural final took place at the Parc des Princes between Stade de Reims and Real Madrid on 13 June 1956.[22][23][24] The Spanish squad came back from behind to win 4–3 thanks to goals from Alfredo Di Stéfano and Marquitos, as well as two goals from Héctor Rial.[22][23][24] Real Madrid successfully defended the trophy next season in their home stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu, against Fiorentina.[25][26] After a scoreless first half, Real Madrid scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians.[24][25][26] In 1958, Milan failed to capitalise after going ahead on the scoreline twice, only for Real Madrid to equalise.[27][28] The final, held in Heysel Stadium, went to extra time where Francisco Gento scored the game-winning goal to allow Real Madrid to retain the title for the third consecutive season.[24][27][28] In a rematch of the first final, Real Madrid faced Stade Reims at the Neckarstadion for the 1959 final, and won 2–0.[24][29][30] West German side Eintracht Frankfurt became the first team not to compete in the Latin cup to reach the European Cup final.[18][31][32] The 1960 final holds the record for the most goals scored, with Real Madrid beating Eintracht Frankfurt 7–3 at Hampden Park, courtesy of four goals by Ferenc Puskás and a hat-trick by Alfredo Di Stéfano.[24][31][32] This was Real Madrid's fifth consecutive title, a record that still stands today.[9] Real Madrid's reign ended in the 1960–61 season when bitter rivals Barcelona dethroned them in the first round.[33][34] Barcelona were defeated in the final by Portuguese side Benfica 3–2 at the Wankdorf Stadium.[33][34][35] Reinforced by Eusébio, Benfica defeated Real Madrid 5–3 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam and kept the title for a second consecutive season.[35][36][37] Benfica wanted to repeat Real Madrid's successful run of the 1950s after reaching the showpiece event of the 1962–63 European Cup, but a brace from Brazilian-Italian José Altafini at Wembley gave the spoils to Milan, making the trophy leave the Iberian Peninsula for the first time ever.[38][39][40] Inter Milan beat an ageing Real Madrid 3–1 at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion to win the 1963–64 season and replicate their local-rival's success.[41][42][43] The title stayed in Milan for the third year in a row after Inter beat Benfica 1–0 at their home ground, the San Siro.[44][45][46] Under the leadership of Jock Stein, Scottish club Celtic beat Inter Milan 2–1 in the 1967 final to become the first British club to win the European Cup.[47][48] The Celtic players that day, all of whom were born within 30 miles (48 km) of Glasgow, subsequently became known as the \"Lisbon Lions\".[49] The 1967–68 season saw Manchester United become the first English team to win the European Cup, beating two-times winners Benfica 4–1 in the final.[50] This final came ten years after the Munich air disaster, which had claimed the lives of eight United players and left their manager, Matt Busby, fighting for his life.[51] In the 1968–69 season, Ajax became the first Dutch team to reach the European Cup final, but they were beaten 4–1 by Milan, who claimed their second European Cup, with Pierino Prati scoring a hat-trick.[52] The 1969–70 season saw the first Dutch winners of the competition. Feyenoord knocked out the defending champions, Milan in the second round,[53] before beating Celtic in the final.[54] In the 1970–71 season, Ajax won the title, beating Greek side Panathinaikos in the final.[55] the season saw a number of changes, with penalty shoot-outs being introduced, and the away goals rule being changed so that it would be used in all rounds except the final.[56] It was also the first time a Greek team reached the final, as well as the first season that Real Madrid failed to qualify, having finished sixth in La Liga the previous season.[57] Ajax went on to win the competition three years in row (1971 to 1973), which Bayern Munich emulated from 1974 to 1976, before Liverpool won their first two titles in 1977 and 1978.[58] The following seasons saw victories in 1978–79 and 1979–80 for Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. The following year Liverpool won their third title before Aston Villa continued the sense of English dominance in 1982. In 1982–83, Hamburger SV broke the English dominance. Liverpool regained it in 1983–84 before losing to Juventus (1984–85); Steaua București then won in 1985–86, Porto in 1986–87, PSV Eindhoven in 1987–88; Milan (2), Red Star Belgrade and Barcelona became champions before the competition was re-formulated as the UEFA Champions League. All English clubs were banned for five years (Liverpool for six years) following the 1985 European Cup final due to the Heysel Stadium disaster. \"Magic...it's magic above all else. When you hear the anthem it captivates you straight away.\" The UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled simply as \"Champions League\", was written by Tony Britten, and is an adaptation of George Frideric Handel's 1727 anthem Zadok the Priest (one of his Coronation Anthems).[60][61] UEFA commissioned Britten in 1992 to arrange an anthem, and the piece was performed by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and sung by the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.[60] Stating that \"the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy\", UEFA's official website adds it is \"known to set the hearts of many of the world's top footballers aflutter\".[60] The chorus contains the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French.[62] The climactic moment is set to the exclamations 'Die Meister! Die Besten! Les Grandes Équipes! The Champions!'.[63] The anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game as the two teams are lined up, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches. In addition to the anthem, there is also entrance music, which contains parts of the anthem itself, which is played as teams enter the field.[64] The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus.[62] Special vocal versions have been performed live at the Champions League final with lyrics in other languages, changing over to the host nation's language for the chorus. These versions were performed by Andrea Bocelli (Italian; Rome 2009, Milan 2016 and Cardiff 2017), Juan Diego Flores (Spanish; Madrid 2010), All Angels (Wembley 2011), Jonas Kaufmann and David Garrett (Munich 2012) and Mariza (Lisbon 2014). In the 2013 final at Wembley, the chorus was played twice. In the 2018 and 2019 finals, held in Kyiv and Madrid respectively, the instrumental version of the chorus was played, by 2Cellos (2018) and Asturia Girls (2019).[65][66] In the 2023 final, held in Istanbul, Hungarian pianist Ádám György performed the piano version of the anthem.[67] The anthem has been released commercially in its original version on iTunes and Spotify with the title of Champions League Theme. In 2018, composer Hans Zimmer remixed the anthem with rapper Vince Staples for EA Sports' video game FIFA 19, with it also featuring in the game's reveal trailer.[68] In 1991, UEFA asked its commercial partner, Television Event and Media Marketing (TEAM), to help brand the Champions League. This resulted in the anthem, \"house colours\" of black and white or silver and a logo, and the \"starball\". The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition.[69] TEAM gives particular attention to detail in how the colours and starball are depicted at matches. According to TEAM, \"Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem\". Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, \"the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans\".[70] The UEFA Champions League used to begin with a double round-robin group stage of 32 teams until it evolved into a league phase of 36 teams, which is preceded by two qualification 'streams' for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament proper. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing second, third or fourth in their national championship. The number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the UEFA coefficients of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League, Europa League and Conference League seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in. Five of the remaining seven qualifying places are granted to the winners of a four-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between ten and eleven clubs from the associations ranked 5–6 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, third or fourth in their respective national league. In addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure and finance requirements. In 2005–06, Liverpool and Artmedia Bratislava became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds. Real Madrid and Barcelona hold the record for the most appearances in the group stage, having qualified 25 times, followed by Porto and Bayern Munich on 24.[71] Between 1999 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top-ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds. An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[72] UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. Until 2015–16, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[73] In May 2012, Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth in the 2011–12 Premier League, two places ahead of Chelsea, but failed to qualify for the 2012–13 Champions League, after Chelsea won the 2012 final.[74] Tottenham were demoted to the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League.[74] In May 2013,[75] it was decided that, starting from the 2015–16 season (and continuing at least for the three-year cycle until the 2017–18 season), the winners of the previous season's UEFA Europa League would qualify for the UEFA Champions League, entering at least the play-off round, and entering the group stage if the berth reserved for the Champions League title holders was not used. The previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association was increased to five, meaning that a fourth-placed team from one of the top three ranked associations would only have to be moved to the Europa League if both the Champions League and Europa League winners came from that association and both finished outside the top four of their domestic league.[76] In 2007, Michel Platini, the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the three leagues with four entrants and allocating it to that nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting.[77] In the same meeting, however, it was agreed that the third-placed team in the top three leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe. This was part of Platini's plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage, while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lower-ranked nations in the group stage.[78] In 2012, Arsène Wenger referred to qualifying for the Champions League by finishing in the top four places in the Premier League as the \"4th Place Trophy\". The phrase was coined after a pre-match conference when he was questioned about Arsenal's lack of a trophy after exiting the FA Cup. He said \"The first trophy is to finish in the top four\".[79] At Arsenal's 2012 AGM, Wenger was also quoted as saying: \"For me there are five trophies every season: Premier League, Champions League, the third is to qualify for the Champions League...\"[80] Beginning with the 2024–25 season, UEFA changed the format of their three club competitions, abandoning the group stage in favour of an expanded league phase.[81] The number of participating teams was increased from 32 to 36 teams. Teams are no longer divided into groups of four teams each but are ranked in a single table. Each team plays eight matches against eight different opponents. For the draw of the league phase, teams are divided into four seeding pots according to their UEFA coefficient. Each team will play against two teams from each pot, one home and one away. The league phase is played from September to January, while the knockout phase begins in February, with matches predominantly played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. After the league phase, a two-legged knockout play-off round is played between teams finishing 9–16 (seeded) and 17–24 (unseeded) in the league phase. Teams finishing in the top eight of the league phase receive a bye to the round of 16 as seeded teams, while the eight winning teams from the knockout play-off round will enter the round of 16 draw as unseeded teams. Teams finishing 25th–36th place in the league phase and the eight losers of the knockout play-offs are eliminated from the competition and from European football since it is no longer possible to enter the Europa League from the league phase onwards. After the round of 16 the competition follows the traditional knockout format with quarter-finals, semi-finals (both two legged and without association draw protection) and then the final at a venue chosen prior to the season. The final is typically held in late May or early June. Prior to the 2024–25 season, the tournament proper began with a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight groups of four.[82] The draw to determine which teams entered each group was seeded based on each team's UEFA coefficient, and no group could contain more than one club from each association. Each team played six group stage games, meeting the other three teams in its group home and away in a round-robin format.[82] The first place team and the runners-up from each group then progressed to the next round. The third-placed teams entered the Europa League's knockout round and the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from the competition. For the next stage – the last 16 – the winning team from one group played against the runners-up from another group, but teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other (see random two-sided matching). From the quarter-finals onwards, the draw was entirely random, without association protection.[83] The group stage was played from September to December, whilst the knockout stage began in February, with matches usually played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. The knockout ties were played in a two-legged format, with the exception of the final. In the 2019–20 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was suspended for five months. The format of the remainder of the tournament was temporarily amended as a result, with the quarter-finals and semi-finals being played as single match knockout ties at neutral venues in Lisbon, Portugal in the summer with the final taking place on 23 August 2020.[84] The following is the default access list. Changes will be made to the access list above if the Champions League or Europa League title holders qualify for the tournament via their domestic leagues. Each year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. From the 1968–69 season and prior to the 2008–09 season any team that won the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall was awarded the official trophy permanently.[86] Each time a club achieved this, a new official trophy had to be forged for the following season.[87] Five clubs own a version of the official trophy: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool.[86] Since 2008, the official trophy has remained with UEFA and the clubs are awarded a replica.[86] The current trophy is 74 cm (29 in) tall and made of silver, weighing 11 kg (24 lb). It was designed by Jürg Stadelmann, a jeweller from Bern, Switzerland, after the original was given to Real Madrid in 1966 in recognition of their six titles to date, and cost 10,000 Swiss francs. As of the 2012–13 season, 40 gold medals are presented to the Champions League winners, and 40 silver medals to the runners-up.[88] Starting with the 2024–25 season, the distribution of the prize money is as follows.[89] A large part of the distributed revenue from the UEFA Champions League is linked to the \"market pool\", the distribution of which is determined by the value of the television market in each nation. For the 2019–20 season, Paris Saint-Germain, who were the runners-up, earned nearly €126.8 million in total, of which €101.3 million was prize money, compared with the €125.46 million earned by Bayern Munich, who won the tournament and were awarded €112.96 million in prize money.[90] Like the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations, in contrast to the single main sponsor typically found in national top-flight leagues. When the Champions League was created in 1992, it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event, with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch, as well as logo placement at pre- and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match. This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.[91] From the 2012–13 knockout phase, UEFA used LED advertising hoardings installed in knockout participant stadiums, including the final. From the 2015–16 season onwards, UEFA has used such hoardings from the play-off round until the final.[92] Since 2021, the UEFA also used Virtual Board Replacement (VBR) technology to offer region-based advertising; regional sponsors are inserted into the hoardings as shown on the broadcast feed in specific regions along with the global sponsors.[93][94] Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising. However, only two sponsorships are permitted per jersey in addition to that of the kit manufacturer, at the chest and the left sleeve.[95] Exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor or in place of it; or on the back, either below the squad number or on the collar area.[96] If a club plays a match in a nation where the relevant sponsorship category is restricted (such as France's alcohol advertising restriction), then they must remove that logo from their jerseys. For example, when Rangers played French side Auxerre in the 1996–97 Champions League, they wore the logo of the holiday chain Center Parcs instead of their primary sponsor, McEwan's Lager (both companies at the time were subsidiaries of Scottish & Newcastle).[97] The tournament's main sponsors for the 2024–27 cycle are: Adidas is a secondary sponsor and supplies the official match ball, while Macron supplies the referee kits.[107] The competition attracts an extensive television audience, not just in Europe, but throughout the world. The final of the tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[108] The final of the 2012–13 tournament had the competition's highest TV ratings to date, drawing approximately 360 million television viewers.[109] Notes Players that are still active in Europe are highlighted in boldface. The table below does not include appearances made in the qualification stage of the competition. Starting from the 2021–22 edition, UEFA introduced the UEFA Champions League Player of the Season award. The jury is composed of the coaches of the clubs that participated in the group stage of the competition, as well as 55 journalists selected by the European Sports Media (ESM) group, one from each UEFA member association. In the same season, UEFA also introduced the UEFA Champions League Young Player of the Season award.",

The final will be played on 31 May 2025 at Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany.[4] The winners of the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League will automatically qualify for the 2025–26 UEFA Champions League league phase, the 2025 FIFA Intercontinental Cup, the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup, and earn the right to play against the winners of the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League in the 2025 UEFA Super Cup. Real Madrid are the defending champions, having won their record-extending 15th title last season. A total of 81 teams from 53 of the 55 UEFA member associations are set to participate in the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Liechtenstein which does not organise a domestic league and Russia which is currently suspended). The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients is used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:[5] For the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2023 UEFA association coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2018–19 to 2022–23.[6] The table reflects Russia's ongoing suspension from UEFA. Apart from the allocation based on the association coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below: The information here reflects the suspension of Russia in European football, and so the following changes to the default access list were made: As the Champions League title holders (Real Madrid) qualified via their domestic league's standard berth allocation, the following changes to the default access list were made: As the Europa League title holders (Atalanta) qualified via their domestic league's standard berth allocation, the following changes to the default access list were made: The labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round: The second qualifying round, third qualifying round and play-off round were divided into Champions Path (CH) and League Path (LP). The schedule of the competition is as follows.[9] Compared to past seasons, one \"exclusive week\" will be introduced in which Thursday will also be a matchday.[2][10][11] All matches in other weeks will be played on Tuesdays and Wednesdays apart from the final. The draw for the first qualifying round was held on 18 June 2024. The first legs were played on 9 and 10 July, and the second legs were played on 16 and 17 July 2024. The winners of the ties advanced to the Champions Path second qualifying round. 12 of the 14 losers were transferred to the Conference League Champions Path second qualifying round and 2 were transferred to the Conference League Champions Path qualifying and received a bye to the third qualifying round. The draw for the second qualifying round was held on 19 June 2024. The first legs were played on 23 and 24 July, and the second legs were played on 30 and 31 July 2024. The winners of the ties advanced to the third qualifying round of their respective path. The Champions Path losers were transferred to the Europa League Champions Path third qualifying round, while the League Path losers were transferred to the Europa League Main Path third qualifying round. The draw for the third qualifying round was held on 22 July 2024. The first legs were played on 6 and 7 August, and the second legs were played on 13 August 2024. The winners of the ties advanced to the play-off round of their respective paths. The Champions Path losers were transferred to the Europa League play-off round, while the League Path losers were transferred to the Europa League league phase. The draw for the play-off round was held on 5 August 2024. The first legs were played on 20 and 21 August, and the second legs were played on 27 and 28 August 2024. The winners of the ties advanced to the league phase. The losers were transferred to the Europa League league phase. The league phase draw for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League took place at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco on 29 August 2024, 18:00 CEST.[12][13] The 36 teams were divided into four pots of nine teams each based on their UEFA club coefficient, except for the Champions League title holders, who were automatically placed as the top seed in pot 1. The 36 teams were manually drawn and then automated software digitally drew their eight different opponents at random, determining which of their matches were at home and which ones away. Each team will face two opponents from each of the four pots, one at home and one away. Teams could not face opponents from their own association, and could only be drawn against a maximum of two sides from the same association.[14] Aston Villa, Bologna, Brest, Girona and Slovan Bratislava made their debut appearances since the introduction of the group stage. Brest and Girona also made their debut appearances in European football.[15][16] A total of 16 national associations are represented in the league phase. The top eight ranked teams will receive a bye to the round of 16. The teams ranked from 9th to 24th will contest the knockout phase play-offs, with the teams ranked from 9th to 16th seeded for the draw. Teams ranked from 25th to 36th are eliminated from all competitions, with no access to the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League. In the knockout phase, teams will play against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The bracket structure for the knockout phase is partially fixed in advance using seeding, with teams' positions in the bracket determined by the final standings in the league phase. In the knockout phase, there is no country protection, with teams from the same association able to face each other in any round. The mechanism of the draws for each round is as follows:[5] The following teams have secured a place in the knockout phase: Guaranteed to finish 1–16 (round TBD, guaranteed seeded) The draw for the knockout phase play-offs will be held on 31 January 2025. The first legs will be played on 11 and 12 February, and the second legs will be played on 18 and 19 February 2025. The draw for the round of 16 will be held on 21 February 2025. The first legs will be played on 4 and 5 March, and the second legs will be played on 11 and 12 March 2025. The draw for the order of the quarter-final legs will be held on 21 February 2025, after the round of 16 draw. The first legs will be played on 8 and 9 April, and the second legs will be played on 15 and 16 April 2025. The draw for the order of the semi-final legs will be held on 21 February 2025, after the round of 16 and quarter-final draws. The first legs will be played on 29 and 30 April, and the second legs will be played on 6 and 7 May 2025. The final will be played on 31 May 2025 at the Allianz Arena in Munich. A draw will be held on 21 February 2025 (after the round of 16, quarter-final and semi-final draws) to determine the \"home\" team for administrative purposes.

The Franklin Fire started at 10:50 p.m. Monday in Malibu Canyon near South Malibu Canyon and Francisco Ranch roads, Cal Fire said. As of 7:05 p.m., the fire burned at least 3,049 acres, an increase from the 2,713 acres reported at 12:29 p.m. The “stubborn fire” is 0% contained and has drawn some 1,500 firefighters, Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony C. Marrone said at a news conference Tuesday night. He said a preliminary aerial assessment estimates that seven structures were destroyed and eight structures damaged. Cal Fire said that there have been no \"serious\" injuries or fatalities reported. Law enforcement at the conference said a patrol car was damaged by the flames, but no deputies were injured. They are also warning that they will arrest any looters who try to enter the evacuation zone. Dick Van Dyke, one of many celebrities with homes in Malibu, said he and his wife, Arlene Silver, had evacuated as the fire swept in. The actor turns 99 on Friday. “Arlene and I have safely evacuated with our animals except for Bobo escaped as we were leaving,” said Van Dyke, referring to one of their cats. “We’re praying he’ll be OK and that our community in Serra Retreat will survive these terrible fires.” The cause of the fire is unknown, but the fire's quick spread and threat to safety resulted in Gov. Gavin Newsom acquiring a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to help with firefighting efforts, according to the governor's office. “Fire officials and first responders are working relentlessly to protect lives and property from the Franklin Fire,\" Newsom said in a written release. \"California is grateful for this federal support, which bolsters these efforts. I urge all residents in affected areas to stay alert and follow evacuation orders.\" Through FEMA, the Fire Management Assistance Grant will allow local, state and tribal agencies battling the fire to apply for 75% reimbursement of \"eligible fire suppression costs.\" A shelter-in-place protocol was activated for the Pepperdine University campus. “Just seeing the flames grow and seeing that bright red color of fire just get brighter and brighter and brighter — it was so scary,” Pepperdine student Gabrielle Salgado told KABC-TV. The university later said the worst of the fire had pushed past campus. The university is requiring students to shelter-in-place in the Tyler Campus Center or Payson Library on Tuesday evening. The university said campus operations will be modified on Wednesday due to the fire. Malibu campus staff, apart from critical support personnel, should plan to work remotely. View real-time evacuations as they are issued in the map below. Can't see it? Click here. The fire burned amid dangerous fire conditions because of Southern California’s notorious Santa Ana winds. The evacuation order encompassed about 6,000 people and more than 2,000 structures, KABC-TV reported, attributing that information to fire officials. Pepperdine canceled classes and finals for the day and there was a shelter-in-place order that lasted for hours before the university lifted it at 8:05 a.m. However, the shelter-in-place order was reissued at 4:30 p.m. Fire engines were on campus and helicopters were dropping water collected from lakes in the school’s Alumni Park onto the fire. Pacific Coast Highway is closed between Carbon Canyon and Corral Canyon Road and is available for evacuees only. Find the latest on closures here. Below is information about evacuation shelters and locations to drop off any small animals or livestock. Evacuation shelters Small animals Large animals Meteorologist Tamara Berg said winds surpassing 40 mph are being recorded where the fire is burning. Power to tens of thousands of people had been shut off by Monday night as utilities worked to mitigate the impacts of Santa Ana winds, which bring strong gusts that can damage electrical equipment and spark wildfires. Santa Anas are dry, warm and gusty northeast winds that blow from the interior of Southern California toward the coast and offshore. They typically occur during the fall months and continue through winter and into early spring. The Weather Service issued a red flag warning for high fire risk with a rare “particularly dangerous situation,” or PDS, designation starting at 8 p.m. Monday into Tuesday for Los Angeles and Ventura counties. That warning was extended through 4 a.m. Wednesday because of strong winds and low humidity. While crews battle the fire, officials are asking residents in the surrounding area to not use sprinklers, explaining that firefighters will need the water and that sprinklers would not halt a brush fire's advance. Cal Fire expects to increase the number of personnel fighting the fire to about 1,000 staff as they are rushing to extinguish the flames before winds pick up again. -The Associated Press contributed to this reporting.

It is the third installment in the 28 Days Later film series, following 28 Days Later (2002) and 28 Weeks Later (2007). It stars Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Ralph Fiennes, with Cillian Murphy reprising his role from the first film. Produced by Columbia Pictures[3] in association with the British Film Institute, Decibel Films, and DNA Films, 28 Years Later marks the returns of Boyle and Garland as director and writer after they served only as executive producers on the second film.

Twenty eight years after the events of 28 Weeks Later, the Rage Virus has returned, and a group of survivors must face a world ravaged by hordes of the infected.[4] In June 2007, Fox Atomic confirmed development on a third 28 Days Later film, dependent upon the financial performance of 28 Weeks Later following its home video release.[5] In July of the same year, Danny Boyle said that the story for a third installment had been mapped out.[6] By October 2010, Alex Garland stated that due to differences involving the film rights, the project had been delayed.[7] In January 2011, Boyle stated that he believed the project would be realized, stating confirming further developments for the story.[8] By April 2013, however, the filmmaker expressed uncertainty as to whether the movie would be made.[9] In January 2015, Garland addressed the project's status, confirming that while it had fallen into development hell there were serious discussions going on behind the scenes to produce the project. Reiterating that development was progressing, stating that the script he was working on would tentatively be titled 28 Months Later.[10] In June 2019, Boyle confirmed that he and Garland had been working on the third installment.[11] In March 2020, Imogen Poots expressed interest in reprising her role from the second film,[12] followed by Cillian Murphy in May 2021.[13] In November 2022, Boyle, Garland and actor Murphy all indicated their interest in making a sequel to 28 Days Later.[14] In June 2023, Boyle and Garland expressed in collaboration their intentions to \"seriously\" and \"diligently\" see the project enter production; while announcing that the script was now titled 28 Years Later, acknowledging the years it had taken to be developed. Boyle stated that he would like to serve as director, unless Garland chooses to.[15] By July of the same year, Murphy stated that he had recently discussed the possibility of a third film with Boyle; once again expressing interest in reprising his role if Boyle and Garland return to the franchise in their creative roles.[16] In January 2024, it was announced that a third film titled 28 Years Later was officially in development; with plans for the project to be the first of a new trilogy of sequels. Danny Boyle will direct the first installment, with a script written by Alex Garland; while the latter will also write the scripts for each of planned sequels. Boyle, Garland, Andrew Macdonald, and Peter Rice will serve as producers.[17][18] In February of the same year, Murphy discussed his potential involvement with the project; that same month, MacDonald had bought back the rights to the first film from Searchlight Pictures, promptly selling it to Sony Pictures for future distribution, as well as rights to future sequels.[a][19][20][21] In March 2024, Garland confirmed that he is writing a trilogy of sequel films.[22] The following month, the writer stated that the film Kes was a major influence on his work for 28 Years Later.[23] Murphy was revealed as an executive producer later that month.[24] In April, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes were cast to star it,[25] with Jack O'Connell joining the cast,[26] and Murphy being confirmed to reprise his role as Jim.[27] Erin Kellyman would be added to the cast in June.[28] Principal photography began on May 7, 2024, in Northumberland,[29][30] with Anthony Dod Mantle serving as the cinematographer.[31] Filming wrapped on July 29.[32] The film was notably shot on an iPhone 15 Pro Max with the aid of numerous specialised attachments.[33] Filming locations include Holy Island (Lindisfarne) off the Northumberland Coast (the village and the causeway seen in aerial view in the first trailer), Hexham, Bellingham, Kielder Forest, Rothbury (Northumberland), Newcastle upon Tyne (Tyne and Wear), Waskerley (County Durham), Melsonby, Ripon , Fountains Abbey, Aysgarth Falls, Redmire (North Yorkshire) and Bradford (West Yorkshire).[34][35][36][37][38] Some scenes were filmed at Plankey Mill Farm, near Langley and Bardon Mill (Northumberland).[35] 28 Years Later is scheduled to be released in the United States and Canada by Sony Pictures Releasing on June 20, 2025.[39] In April 2024, Nia DaCosta entered early negotiations to direct the second film in the new trilogy of sequels, with Boyle, Garland, Andrew Macdonald, Peter Rice, and Bernie Bellew attached as producers.[40] The following month, DaCosta was confirmed to have signed onto the project as director.

He was named a starter on the 2021 All-MLB Second Team, earning his second consecutive All-MLB selection.[99] Through 2021, of the Braves career leaders, Fried was second in win–loss percentage (.690; behind Russ Ortiz and ahead of Greg Maddux).[100] Fried was named to his second straight Opening Day start in 2022.[101][102][103] Fried's salary for the 2022 season was set at $6.85 million via arbitration.[104] He was named to the 2022 Major League Baseball All-Star Game roster at midseason.[105][106] For the season, Fried was 14-7 with a 2.48 ERA (3rd in the NL; 10th-lowest in Atlanta franchise history), in 30 starts in which he pitched 185.1 innings with 170 strikeouts.[107][108] He gave up the lowest percentage of hard-hit balls in the NL (24.5%) and had the lowest barrel-percentage against (4.0%), was 2nd in fewest walks/9 innings (1.55), 3rd in strikeouts/walk (5.31) and fewest home runs/9 innings (0.58), 4th in ground ball percentage (51.2%), and tied for 5th

batters swung at his pitches outside the strike zone 36.8% of the time, the fourth-highest rate in the NL.[110] In the four seasons from 2019 to 2022, he had the lowest barrel-percentage against (4.6%) of all major league pitchers, and his 52 wins were second in the major leagues only to the 56 wins of pitcher Gerrit Cole.[111] On defense, opponents became hesitant to run on him.[112] Since his major league debut in 2017, his 23 pickoffs lead major league baseball, with him having picked the runner off in 14.29% of his career pickoff attempts, a much higher percentage than the major league average of 1.6%.[113] Fried was named the 2022 NL Gold Glove Award winner at pitcher, his third straight Gold Glove Award.[112] He became the first Braves pitcher since Greg Maddux to win three straight Gold Glove Awards.[114] The only other pitchers who have won the award three times in a row have been Harvey Haddix, Bobby Shantz, Bob Gibson, Phil Niekro, and Zack Greinke.[115] Fried finished second in the voting for the 2022 NL Cy Young Award.[116] It was the second time in three years he finished in the top five in Cy Young Award voting, as he had finished fifth in 2020.[117] At the end of the 2022 season, Fried was selected to his third consecutive All-MLB team.[118] Fried's 2023 season salary of $13.5 million was again determined by the arbitration process.[119] As the Opening Day starter for the third straight year, Fried was removed in the fourth inning against the Washington Nationals.[120][121] He spent time on the 15-day injured list in early April and early May, first for a strained left hamstring, then a strained left forearm.[122][123][124] On June 5, Fried was transferred to the 60-day injured list.[125] He was activated on August 4.[126] In the 2023 regular season Fried was 8–1 with a 2.55 ERA (the second-lowest in the major leagues among pitchers with at least 14 starts), as in 14 starts he had one shutout, and struck out 80 batters while giving up 18 walks in 77.2 innings.[39] Batters hit .109 against his curveball.[63][1] Of NL pitchers who pitched 70 or more innings in 2023, he was 2nd in ground ball percentage (57.7%) and lowest hard-hit percentage (24.2%), 3rd in lowest barrel percentage (3.8%), 5th in ERA, 6th in left-on-base percentage (82.3%) and lowest average exit velocity (86.5 mph), 7th in lowest line drive percentage (16.8%), and 9th in home runs/9 innings (0.81).[127] He ended the season as the Braves' career leader in won-loss percentage (.705), second in strikeouts/9 innings pitched (8.835), fourth in strikeouts/walk (3.688), eighth in WHIP (1.163), and 10th in hits per nine innings pitched (8.075).[100] From the beginning of his first full season in 2019 to the end of the 2023 regular season, Fried recorded 60 wins, the most in the NL and second to Gerrit Cole's 71 victories during this time period.[128][100] His 25 pickoffs since debuting in 2017 were the most in major league baseball, and in his career he had picked off a runner in 14.5% of his pickoff attempts, much higher than the MLB average during that period of 1.7%.[1] Fried and the Braves agreed to a one-year $15 million contract for the 2024 season, his final season before free agency.[129][130] Fried's streak of Opening Day starts was ended by Spencer Strider.[131][132] In Fried's season debut, the second game of the year against the Philadelphia Phillies, he recorded only two outs.[133][134] On April 23, Fried pitched a complete game shutout against the Miami Marlins, facing 29 hitters and throwing 92 pitches for his third career Maddux.[135] He pitched a scoreless inning for the NL team in the All Star Game, the second of his career.[39] In 2024, Fried was 11–10 with one shutout in 29 starts covering 174.1 innings, in which he gave up 146 hits and 57 walks while striking out 166 batters, and led the NL in ground ball percentage (58.8%) while having the second-lowest exit velocity (86.3 mph) and percentage of \"hard speed\" contact induced (26.1%).[39][136] He had a 3.25 ERA (5th in the NL), with 7.5 hits per 9 innings (7th), 0.64 home runs per 9 innings (4th), and a 1.164 WHIP (8th), keeping opposing batters to a .225 batting average (7th), while on defense he tied for the league lead with a 1.000 fielding percentage.[39][136] Fried received a qualifying offer from the Braves at the end of the season,[137][138] which he declined.[139] Fried throws a 94–96 mph four-seam fastball.[63] He also throws two types of a 74 mph \"plus\" curveball (which he patterned after that of Sandy Koufax), an 85 mph slider (since 2019), a 93 mph sinker, and an 86 mph change-up,[63][140][141] with the curveball resulting in the lowest batting average in 2021 (.160).[63]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Two days after missing out on retaining superstar right fielder Juan Soto, the Yankees pivoted to signing left-handed ace Max Fried. He is heading from Atlanta to the Bronx on an eight-year, $218 million deal, and he will team with Gerrit Cole for a ferocious 1-2 punch in the Yankees rotation. Fried didn't get Soto's $765 million, but he does end up with one of the most lucrative contracts in MLB history, especially if we isolated pitchers. Here's a look, by the numbers. We don't have an exact year-by-year breakdown just yet and it's possible the deal is backloaded, but the average annual value (AAV) is $27,250,000. There will be some consternation on the number of years, but that number per season is a bargain for a pitcher with Fried's proven track record. There are reportedly no opt outs or deferred money (via USA Today), and there's a full no-trade clause (via New York Post). Fried's deal ranks as the fourth-highest ever for a pitcher in terms of total money. Here are the seven contracts that have exceeded $170 million. Possibly of interest: Fried is the highest-ranked lefty on the list. We're leaving two-way star Shohei Ohtani off of all lists here. The only two lefties there are Fried and Snell, who both signed this offseason. As noted above, Fried's average annual value isn't too bad considering a pitcher of his pedigree. Among current deals only, he checks in at sixth. If we looped in the biggest AAV deals in history, some shorter term deals for Justin Verlander ($43,333,333 for 2023-24) and Max Scherzer ($43,333,333 from 2022-24) would sit tied at the top. Strasburg's deal had an AAV of $35 million. Again, the Yankees missed out on Soto, but they still have plenty of monster contracts on the roster. Fried's doesn't crack the top three but does give them three of the four MLB pitchers with deals of at least $150 million. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

They will now go into 2025 without one of their key pitchers as Max Fried has signed with the New York Yankees. Fried signed an eight-year, $218 million deal with the Yankees on December 10, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. \"BREAKING: Left-hander Max Fried and the New York Yankees are in agreement on a eight-year, $218 million contract, pending physical, sources tell ESPN,\" Passan wrote on X. \"It is the largest guarantee in baseball history for a left-handed pitcher.\" The Braves All-Star made history in a unique way by earning the most guaranteed money by a southpaw. He had spent his entire big league career with the Braves. He is a two-time All-Star and a World Series champion with the organization. The Yankees ultimately saved $700 million dollars in total money by missing out on Soto. They have needs to fill throughout the roster and Fried is a good start. He had a 3.25 ERA last season in 29 starts. He struck out 166 batters as well. He will become the Yankees No. 2 starter behind Gerrit Cole. He and Cole could give the Yankees one of the best one-two punches in Major League Baseball. The team had already met with the beloved Braves pitcher and now the two sides come to an agreement. Fried gets his well-deserved payday. He will be missed in Atlanta but has the opportunity to help lead the Yankees to back-to-back American League championships and potentially a World Series.

                "title": "Max Fried to sign with Yankees: New York picks up ace lefty on eight-year, $218 million deal - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The New York Yankees have landed one of the top starting pitchers in baseball. Left-hander Max Fried and the ballclub have agreed to a eight-year contract worth $218 million, CBS Sports HQ has confirmed. The deal includes a full no-trade clause and does not have opt-outs or deferrals, according to the New York Post. The team has not yet announced the signing. The Yankees missed out on free-agent right fielder Juan Soto two days ago when he accepted a 15-year, $765 million deal from the Mets. As part of the pivot here to Plan B, Fried ends up in the Bronx. The deal makes him the best-paid left-handed pitcher in MLB history. Fried is the third core member of the Atlanta Braves' 2021 World Series championship team to leave as a free agent, joining Freddie Freeman and Dansby Swanson. Fried started and won the Game 6 title clincher against the Houston Astros, striking out six in six shutout innings in the decisive Game 6 at Minute Maid Park. Our R.J. Anderson ranked Fried the fifth-best free agent available this offseason, and the third best pitcher behind Corbin Burnes and Blake Snell. Here's his write-up: We wanted to print a complete list of left-handed starting pitchers with a better ERA+ than Fried since the beginning of the 2020 season, but we ran into a problem when we went to compile the names. You see, no sinister hurler who had a decent amount of innings (min. 200 combined) actually placed ahead of him in that metric. Oh well. Blame Fried's sustained excellence on his ability to manage contact. He ranked in the 95th percentile in average exit velocity last season, and he did it while generating nearly 60% ground balls for a second consecutive year. The biggest knock on Fried is his innings count, as he's cleared the 180-threshold just once in his career. Given the league's direction over the past decade, we're not inclined to think that'll hurt him. Fried, 31 in January, pitched to a 3.25 ERA in 29 starts and 174 ⅓ innings in 2024, and it was his worst season since 2019, his first full year as a big-leaguer. From 2020-23, Fried had a 2.66 ERA in close to 500 innings with the excellent underlying numbers to match. Simply put, he has been one of the game's best pitchers over the last half-decade. The Braves originally acquired Fried as a prospect in the Justin Upton trade with the San Diego Padres in December 2014. Because he declined the qualifying offer, Atlanta will receive a compensation draft pick after the fourth round for losing Fried. There remains plenty of offseason, but with Fried on board, the Yankees' rotation right now looks something like: Righty Marcus Stroman and lefty Nestor Cortes are also still on the roster and could provide depth here or serve as trade bait. The Yankees won the AL East and won the AL pennant last season despite Cole starting the year on the injured list. They got 32 starts from Rodón, 30 from Cortes, 29 from Stroman, 29 from Gil, 17 from Cole and 16 from Schmidt. If they can get full seasons from Cole, Fried and Schmidt, that rotation looks a lot better and it was already a good one in 2024. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "title": "Bill Belichick - Wikipedia",
                "content": "William Stephen Belichick (/ˈbɛlɪtʃɪk, ˈbɛlɪtʃɛk/; born April 16, 1952) is an American sports analyst and American football coach. Widely regarded as one of the greatest head coaches of all time,[1][2][3] he holds numerous coaching records, including the record of most Super Bowl wins (six) as a head coach, all with the New England Patriots, along with two more during his time as the defensive coordinator of the New York Giants, for a record eight combined total Super Bowl victories as coach and coordinator.[4] A renowned American football historian, Belichick is often referred to as a \"student of the game\" with a deep knowledge of the intricacies of each player position.[5][6][7][8] During his tenure with the Patriots, Belichick was a central figure as the head coach and de facto general manager during the franchise's dynasty from 2001 to 2019.[9] Belichick is a descendant of the Bill Parcells coaching tree. He began his coaching career in 1975 as an assistant for the Baltimore Colts and became the defensive coordinator for New York Giants head coach Bill Parcells by 1985. Parcells and Belichick won two Super Bowls together before Belichick left to become the head coach of the Cleveland Browns in 1991. He remained in Cleveland for five seasons but was fired following the team's 1995 season. Belichick rejoined Parcells, first in New England where the team lost Super Bowl XXXI, and later with the New York Jets. After being named head coach of the Jets, Belichick resigned after only one day on the job to accept the head coaching job for the Patriots on January 27, 2000. In 24 seasons under Belichick, the Patriots won 17 AFC East division titles, made 13 appearances in the AFC Championship Game, and appeared in nine Super Bowls, with a record six wins. Overall, Belichick has won eight Super Bowl titles (the most of any individual in NFL history) and finished as runner-up four times from his combined time as an assistant and head coach. At the time Belichick left the Patriots, he was the NFL's longest-tenured active head coach. Belichick has the most playoff coaching wins all-time with 31 and ranks third in regular season coaching wins in the NFL with 302.[10] He is also in second place for combined regular season and postseason wins, and also second place for most regular season coaching wins with one franchise.[11] Belichick is one of only three head coaches who have won six NFL titles.[12] He was named the AP NFL Coach of the Year for the 2003, 2007, and 2010 seasons. Belichick has also been selected to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team, NFL 2010s All-Decade Team, as well as the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. Belichick was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 16, 1952,[13] the son of Jeannette (née Munn) and Steve Belichick.[14] Belichick was named after College Football Hall of Fame coach Bill Edwards, who was his godfather.[15] He is of Croatian ancestry;[16] his paternal grandparents, Marija Barković and Ivan Biličić, emigrated from Draganić in 1897 and settled in Monessen, Pennsylvania, having changed their names to Mary and John Belichick at the suggestion of immigration officers.[17] Belichick was raised in Annapolis, Maryland,[18] where his father was an assistant football coach at the United States Naval Academy. Belichick has said his father is one of his most important football mentors, and Belichick often studied football with him.[19] Bill reportedly learned to break down game films at a young age by watching his father and the Navy staff do their jobs.[20] Belichick graduated from Annapolis High School in 1970, where he was a classmate of Sally Brice-O'Hara, who would later become the Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard.[21][22] While there, Belichick played football and lacrosse, with the latter being his favorite sport.[23] Belichick enrolled at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for a postgraduate year, with the intention of improving his grades and test scores to be admitted into a quality college.[24] The school honored Belichick 40 years later by inducting him into its Athletics Hall of Honor in 2011.[25] Belichick attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he played center and tight end. In addition to being a member of the football team, Belichick played lacrosse and squash, serving as the captain of the lacrosse team during his senior season. A member of Chi Psi fraternity,[26] Belichick earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1975.[27] Eventually, he was part of the inaugural induction class into the university's Athletics Hall of Fame in spring 2008.[28] After graduating, Belichick took a $25-per-week job as an assistant to Baltimore Colts head coach Ted Marchibroda in 1975.[29] In 1976, Belichick joined the Detroit Lions as their assistant special teams coach before adding tight ends and wide receivers to his coaching duties in 1977.[30] Belichick was dismissed along with head coach Tommy Hudspeth and the rest of the coaching staff on January 9, 1978.[31] He spent the 1978 season with the Denver Broncos as their assistant special teams coach and defensive assistant while also serving as director of films.[32][33] In 1979, Belichick began a 12-year stint with the New York Giants alongside head coach Ray Perkins as a defensive assistant and special teams coach.[34] Belichick added linebackers coaching to his duties in 1980 and was named defensive coordinator in 1985 under head coach Bill Parcells, who had replaced Perkins in 1983. The Giants won Super Bowl XXI and Super Bowl XXV following the 1986 and 1990 seasons.[35][36] Belichick's defensive game plan from the New York Giants' 20–19 upset of the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV has been placed in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[37] From 1991 until 1995, Belichick was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns. During his tenure in Cleveland, Belichick compiled a 36–44 record, leading the team to the playoffs in 1994, his only winning year with the team.[38] Coincidentally, Belichick's lone playoff victory during his Browns tenure was achieved against the New England Patriots, who were coached by former Giants head coach Bill Parcells, in the Wild Card Round during that postseason.[39] In Belichick's final season in Cleveland, the Browns finished 5–11 despite starting 3–1.[40] One of his most controversial moves was cutting quarterback Bernie Kosar midway through the 1993 season. Kosar was signed by the Dallas Cowboys two days later and won a Super Bowl with the Cowboys in Super Bowl XXVIII as a backup. In November 1995, in the middle of the ongoing football season, Browns owner Art Modell had announced he would move his franchise to Baltimore after the season.[41] After first being given assurances that he would coach the new team that would later become the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was instead fired on February 14, 1996, a week after the shift was officially announced.[42] In the 2013 episode of A Football Life on the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, many sports journalists who had covered the Browns at the time had said that in retrospective, Belichick had laid the groundwork for the Ravens success in the ensuring decades including their win in Super Bowl XXXV (with Cleveland holdovers Matt Stover and Rob Burnett still with the team at that point), setting up the infrastructure by giving recently retired tight end Ozzie Newsome his first front-office job and had planned on drafting Ray Lewis in the 1996 NFL Draft if Belichick and the team stayed in Cleveland. (Indeed, the newly-christened Ravens did draft Lewis, who went on to a 17-year Hall of Fame career with the team.) Those who had covered the Browns went on to state that if the original Browns had stayed in Cleveland, Belichick would have seen his work through. For his part, Belichick stated that he was able to learn from some mistakes he had made with the Browns while largely sticking to his blueprint from Cleveland when resurrecting the Patriots, such as factoring in off-the-field issues that can affect performance. Among those interviewed, the general consensus was that Belichick's failure in Cleveland was more to do with Modell's financial struggles (even paying a young Scott Pioli only $14,000/year--equivalent to $32,447 in 2024--as a scout) that eventually led the NFL to force the sale of the Ravens to Steve Bisciotti than Belichick's own doing.[43] After his dismissal by the Cleveland Browns, Belichick served under Parcells again as assistant head coach and defensive backs coach with the New England Patriots for the 1996 season. The Patriots finished with an 11–5 record and won the AFC Championship over the Jacksonville Jaguars, but they lost to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI amid rumors of Parcells's impending defection.[44][45] Belichick had two stints as the head coach of the New York Jets without ever coaching a game. In February 1997, Belichick, who had been an assistant coach under Bill Parcells with the New York Giants and New England Patriots, was named the Jets interim head coach while the Jets and Patriots continued to negotiate compensation to release Parcells from his contract with the Patriots and allow Parcells to coach the Jets.[46] Six days later, the Patriots and Jets reached an agreement that allowed Parcells to coach the Jets, and Belichick became the team's assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.[47] When Parcells stepped down as head coach after the 1999 season, he had already arranged with team management to have Belichick succeed him. However, Belichick was the Jets' head coach for only one day. On January 4, 2000, when Belichick was introduced as head coach to the media—the day after his hiring was publicized—he turned it into a surprise resignation announcement. Before taking the podium, Belichick scrawled a resignation note on a napkin that read, in its entirety, \"I resign as HC of the NYJ.\" He then delivered a half-hour speech explaining his resignation to the assembled press corps.[48] Soon after this bizarre turn of events, Belichick was introduced as the Patriots' 12th full-time head coach, succeeding the recently fired Pete Carroll.[49] The Patriots had inquired to the Jets about permission to interview him for their vacant spot at head coach just prior to Parcells stepping down.[50] Parcells and the Jets claimed that Belichick was still under contract to the Jets, and demanded compensation from the Patriots. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue agreed, and the Patriots gave the Jets a first-round draft pick in 2000 in exchange for the right to hire Belichick.[51] Soon after hiring Belichick, owner Robert Kraft gave him near-complete control over the team's football operations, making him the de facto general manager as well. Until 2009, Belichick split many of the duties normally held by a general manager on other clubs with player personnel director Scott Pioli, though Belichick had the final say on football matters.[52] Pioli left for the Kansas City Chiefs after the 2008 season.[53] The Patriots went 5–11 in the 2000 regular season and missed the playoffs.[54] In 2001, the Patriots went 11–5 in the regular season, and in the playoffs defeated the Oakland Raiders (in the \"Tuck Rule Game\") and Pittsburgh Steelers on the way to the Super Bowl.[55][56] In Super Bowl XXXVI, Belichick's defense held the St. Louis Rams' offense, which had averaged 31 points during the season, to 17 points, and the Patriots won on a last-second field goal by Adam Vinatieri.[57] The win was the first Super Bowl championship in Patriots history.[58] The following season (2002)—the first in Gillette Stadium—the Patriots went 9–7 and missed the playoffs.[59] New England finished with the same record as the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins, but the Jets won the AFC East title as a result of the third tiebreaker (record among common opponents).[60] The Patriots' 2003 season started with a 31–0 loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 1, a few days after they released team defensive captain Lawyer Milloy.[61][62] However, they dominated through the remainder of the season to finish 14–2, setting a new franchise record for wins in a season.[63] In the final week of the regular season, the Patriots avenged their loss to the Bills by the same 31–0 score.[64] They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the divisional round of the playoffs. Playing against the Indianapolis Colts and Co-MVP Peyton Manning in the AFC Championship Game (Steve McNair of the Titans was also Co-MVP), the Patriots recorded four interceptions, and advanced to Super Bowl XXXVIII, where they defeated the Carolina Panthers 32–29 on a late Adam Vinatieri field goal.[65][66] Belichick was awarded the NFL Coach of the Year Award. In 2004, the Patriots once again finished with a 14–2 record, and they defeated the Indianapolis Colts in the divisional round of the playoffs.[67][68] They opened the season at 6–0, which combined with the 15 straight wins to end the previous season, gave New England 21 consecutive victories to break the record for most wins in a row formerly held by the Miami Dolphins with 18 straight victories in the 1972 and 1973 seasons. They defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game. In Super Bowl XXXIX, the Patriots beat the Philadelphia Eagles and became only the second team to win three Super Bowls in four years.[69][70] Belichick is the only coach to accomplish the feat as the Dallas Cowboys had two head coaches in the stretch they won three of four from 1992 to 1995. With a new defensive coordinator in Eric Mangini and no named offensive coordinator, the Patriots went 10–6 in the 2005 season and defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wild Card Round before losing to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.[71][72][73] Earlier, with a season-opening win over the Oakland Raiders, Belichick notched his 54th win with the Patriots, passing Mike Holovak as the winningest coach in Patriots history. The Patriots finished with a 12–4 record in the 2006 season and defeated the New York Jets by a score of 37–16 in the Wild Card Round.[74][75] They then beat the San Diego Chargers the next week in the Divisional Round, before losing to the eventual Super Bowl XLI champion Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship by a score of 38–34.[76][77] The Patriots led 21–3 midway through the second quarter, but the Colts mounted one of the great comebacks in playoff history.[78] In 2007, Belichick led the Patriots to the first perfect regular season since the introduction of the 16-game regular season schedule in 1978, only the fourth team to do so in National Football League history after the 1934[79] and 1942 Chicago Bears[80] and 1972 Miami Dolphins. In the Divisional Round of the playoffs, they defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars by a score of 31–20. In the AFC Championship, the Patriots defeated the San Diego Chargers by a score of 21–12. The Patriots were upset in Super Bowl XLII 17–14 by the New York Giants, his former team, due to the defense allowing a famous play to David Tyree near the end of regulation.[81] The Patriots' failure to attain a \"perfect season\" (undefeated and untied, including playoffs) preserved the Miami Dolphins as the sole team to do so, having finished their 1972 regular season at 14–0 and having won three games in the playoffs. Only two other teams in professional football have recorded a perfect season—the 1948 Cleveland Browns (14–0) of the then All-America Football Conference and the 1948 Calgary Stampeders (12–0) of the Canadian Football League. No team in the former American Football League ever had a perfect season. During the Patriots' 2008 season-opener against the Kansas City Chiefs, quarterback Tom Brady sustained a season-ending injury in the first quarter.[82] Backup quarterback Matt Cassel was named the starter for the remainder of the season. However, with a win in Week 2, the Patriots broke their own record for regular season wins in a row with 21 (2006–08). After losing over 12 players to the injured reserve list, including Rodney Harrison, Adalius Thomas, and Laurence Maroney, the Patriots still managed their league-leading eighth consecutive season with a winning record, going 11–5.[83] However, the Patriots, who finished second in the AFC East, missed the playoffs for the first time since 2002, losing on tiebreakers to the Miami Dolphins (who won the division on the fourth tiebreaker, better conference record) and the Baltimore Ravens (who beat out the Patriots for the last playoff spot due to a better conference record).[84] The 1985 Denver Broncos are the only other 11-win team to miss the playoffs in a 16-game season.[85] In 2009, with a fully healthy Tom Brady back as the starting quarterback, Belichick was able to guide the Patriots to yet another AFC East division title with a 10–6 record.[86] However, the Patriots lost to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round.[87] In an incident dubbed \"Spygate\",[88] on September 9, 2007, NFL security caught a Patriots video assistant taping the New York Jets' defensive signals from the sidelines, which is not an approved location. The NFL rules state: \"No video recording devices of any kind are permitted to be in use in the coaches' booth, on the field, or in the locker room during the game.\" Jets coach Eric Mangini, a former Patriots assistant, tipped off league officials that the Patriots might have been filming their signals. After the game, the Jets formally complained to the league. On September 13, the NFL fined Belichick $500,000—the largest fine ever imposed on a coach in the league's 87-year history,[89] and fined the Patriots $250,000. Additionally, the Patriots forfeited their first-round draft pick in the 2008 NFL draft. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, a former employee of the Jets, said that he fined the Patriots as a team because Belichick exercises so much control over the Patriots' on-field operations that \"his actions and decisions are properly attributed to the club.\" Goodell considered suspending Belichick but decided that taking away draft picks would be more severe in the long run.[90] Gary Myers, a columnist for New York's Daily News columnist, stated Belichick should have been suspended by Goodell for the Patriots' next game against the Jets.[91] Belichick later issued the following statement: I accept full responsibility for the actions that led to tonight's ruling. Once again, I apologize to the Kraft family and every person directly or indirectly associated with the New England Patriots for the embarrassment, distraction and penalty my mistake caused. I also apologize to Patriots fans and would like to thank them for their support during the past few days and throughout my career. [...] As the Commissioner acknowledged, our use of sideline video had no impact on the outcome of last week's game. We have never used sideline video to obtain a competitive advantage while the game was in progress. [...] Part of my job as head coach is to ensure that our football operations are conducted in compliance of the league rules and all accepted interpretations of them. My interpretation of a rule in the Constitution and Bylaws was incorrect. [...] With tonight's resolution, I will not be offering any further comments on this matter. We are moving on with our preparations for Sunday's game. The sanctions against Belichick were the harshest imposed on a head coach in league history until the New Orleans Saints' Sean Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season for covering up a scheme in which bounties were paid for deliberately knocking opponents out of games. Following the incident and its fallout, Belichick led the Patriots to a perfect 16–0 regular season record, and was awarded the 2007 NFL Coach of the Year Award, as voted on by the Associated Press.[92] In the 2010 season, Belichick and the Patriots finished with a 14–2 record for the top seed in the AFC.[93] However, their postseason ended quickly with a 28–21 loss to the New York Jets in the divisional round.[94] In the 2011 season, the Patriots topped the AFC with a 13–3 record.[95] Following a victory over the Denver Broncos in the divisional round of the playoffs, the Patriots won the AFC Championship game, beating the Baltimore Ravens 23–20 when the Ravens failed to score a touchdown and Baltimore's kicker, Billy Cundiff, missed a routine 32-yard field goal attempt to tie the game and send it into overtime.[96][97] This sent New England to their fifth Super Bowl under Belichick. In Super Bowl XLVI, the Patriots lost in the Super Bowl XLII rematch to the New York Giants by a score of 21–17.[98] On September 26, 2012, following a 31–30 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was fined $50,000 for grabbing a replacement official's arm while asking for more specific clarity on a ruling after Baltimore had narrowly converted a last-second field goal attempt to secure the win.[99] The Patriots finished the 2012 regular season with a 12–4 record. In the divisional round of the playoffs, they defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 41–28 and made it to the AFC Championship Game, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens by a score of 28–13, ending their season.[100][101] The Patriots began the 2013 season with much upheaval on the offensive side of the ball with the injury of Rob Gronkowski, the arrest and subsequent release of Aaron Hernandez, the departures of Wes Welker to the Denver Broncos and Danny Woodhead to the San Diego Chargers in free agency, and the release of Brandon Lloyd. To replace them, the Patriots signed Danny Amendola in free agency, drafted rookies Aaron Dobson and Josh Boyce, and signed undrafted rookie free agent Kenbrell Thompkins. The team finished the season with a 12–4 record, winning the AFC East and securing a playoff berth and a first-round bye, seeding second in the AFC standings.[102] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 43–22.[103] They lost to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 26–16.[104] In the 2014 season, Belichick's Patriots started 2–2. At a mid-week press conference following a 41–14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Belichick famously uttered, \"We're on to Cincinnati\" (referring to the Patriots' next opponent), several times in response to follow-up questions and criticisms of his team, Brady in particular.[105] Ultimately, they recorded a 12–4 record for the third straight season.[106] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 35–31.[107] During the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 45–7.[108] They reached Super Bowl XLIX, where they defeated the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28–24.[109] With his fourth championship as head coach, Belichick tied Chuck Noll for most Super Bowl wins by a head coach.[110] In the 2015 season, the Patriots recorded a 12–4 record for the fourth straight season.[111] They defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round by a score of 27–20.[112] During the AFC Championship Game, the Patriots narrowly lost to the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver Broncos by a score of 20–18.[113] In the 2016 season, the Patriots recorded a 14–2 record, which earned them the #1 seed for the AFC playoffs.[114] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 34–16.[115] During the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers by a score of 36–17.[116] They reached Super Bowl LI, where they defeated the Atlanta Falcons in a comeback victory by a score of 34–28 in overtime.[117] The Patriots were down 28–3 at one point in the third quarter.[118] With the victory, Belichick won his record fifth Super Bowl title as a head coach.[119] In the 2017 season, the Patriots went 13–3, setting an NFL record eighth consecutive 12-or-more-win seasons, capturing their ninth consecutive AFC East title and their 15th of the last 17 seasons. They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round by a score of 35–14 and the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 24–20, claiming their second consecutive AFC title, while also extending their record of consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances with seven.[120][121] Super Bowl LII was Belichick's eighth title game as head coach and his eleventh overall in any capacity, which was also the Patriots' tenth appearance, all extending NFL records. The Ringer wrote that Belichick's \"team is different from many of New England's famous teams from the previous decade: The first iteration of the Patriots dynasty relied on defense. This year, they are 29th in yards allowed (though fifth in points allowed) and instead have perfected the art of situational football.\" The latter Patriots teams were noted for mounting late comebacks in playoff games.[122][123] However, the Patriots fell to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII, 41–33, as Eagles quarterback Nick Foles repeated his dominant NFC Championship Game performance and led Philadelphia to victory in a high-scoring game. The Patriots were down early, as they had been in most of their Super Bowl wins. However, they could not make a comeback this time, although they came very close. Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham strip-sacked Tom Brady to get the ball back with about two minutes to go in the fourth quarter. The Patriots did get the ball again before the end of the game, but they ran out of time to score.[124] In the 2018 season, the Patriots went 11–5, failing to win 12 or more games for the first time since 2009. Despite this, they still captured their 10th consecutive AFC East title and their 16th of the last 18 years. They defeated the Los Angeles Chargers in the Divisional Round by a score of 41–28 and the Kansas City Chiefs during the AFC Championship Game 37–31 in a tough overtime game in Kansas City to advance to their third straight Super Bowl.[125][126] In Super Bowl LIII, the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13–3 to give Belichick his sixth Super Bowl championship as a head coach and his eighth overall to have the most Super Bowl rings in NFL history. His six championships matched both George Halas and Curly Lambeau for most championships as a head coach. The Patriots' defense held the high-scoring Rams offense to only 260 total yards.[127][128] On May 13, 2019, Belichick announced that he would assume another role as the Patriots' defensive coordinator starting the 2019 season.[129] On October 27, 2019, with the Patriots' win over the Cleveland Browns, Belichick obtained his 300th win, regular and postseason combined, as a head coach.[130] The Patriots finished the 2019 regular season with a 12–4 record, winning their 11th consecutive AFC East title.[131] However, the Patriots were defeated in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs by the Tennessee Titans, led by former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel, by a score of 20–13.[132] Following the departure of Tom Brady to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Belichick and the Patriots were faced with an uncertain quarterback situation for the first time in nearly two decades.[133] During the offseason, the Patriots signed former Carolina Panthers starter Cam Newton for the 2020 NFL season.[134] The off-season routines and schedules, as well as the normal processes of regular season were severely disrupted by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unanticipated difficulties and challenges of the pandemic, the Patriots were in the hunt for a playoff spot until late in the season, ultimately finishing 7–9. The 2020 season was Belichick's first losing season since his first year in New England.[135] In the 2021 NFL draft, the Patriots selected quarterback Mac Jones with the 15th overall pick.[136] After Jones and Newton competed for the starting job during the preseason, Belichick made the decision to release Newton and name Jones the starter for the upcoming season.[137][138] During Week 4, Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers visited the Patriots in his first trip to Gillette Stadium since signing with the Buccaneers. A missed 56-yard field goal by Patriots kicker Nick Folk allowed Tampa Bay to narrowly escape with a 19–17 victory.[139] Immediately after the game, Brady and Belichick shared a quick embrace on the field before Brady greeted his former teammates and other members of the Patriots organization.[140] Though fans criticized Belichick for his lack of warmth displayed towards his former quarterback, the two privately spoke at length in the Buccaneers locker room following the match.[141] Belichick helped lead the Patriots to a 10–7 record in 2021. The team fell to the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round by a score of 47–17.[142] In the 2022 season, despite starting quarterback Mac Jones being injured in Week 3 and subsequently missing three more weeks, the Patriots remained in the hunt for a playoff spot until the last week, finishing with a record of 8–9.[143][144] During Week 4 of the 2023 season, the Patriots lost to the Dallas Cowboys by a score of 38–3.[145] In doing so, Belichick suffered the worst loss of his coaching career (35 points).[146] The following week, the Patriots lost to the Saints by a score of 34–0, giving Belichick his worst home loss of his career.[147] Two weeks later, New England upset the Buffalo Bills 29–25 to earn Belichick his 300th career regular season win as an NFL head coach.[148] After a Week 10 10–6 loss to the Indianapolis Colts in Germany and subsequent bye week, Belichick named Bailey Zappe the team's starting quarterback.[149] In Belichick's final game with New England, the Patriots lost to the New York Jets 17–3, snapping the team's 15-game winning streak over the Jets. The Patriots finished the season with a 4–13 record, the team's worst in Belichick's 24 seasons as head coach.[150] On January 11, 2024, Belichick and the Patriots mutually agreed to part ways.[151] On January 15, Belichick was interviewed by the Atlanta Falcons for their head coaching position, but ultimately did not get the job as the Falcons hired Raheem Morris instead.[152] Under Belichick, the Patriots had a regular-season record of 266–121–0 over 24 seasons.[153] Belichick is the most successful coach in Patriots history; his 266 wins with the franchise are more than quadruple those of runner-up Mike Holovak.[154] Belichick also compiled a 30–12 record in the playoffs with New England, including a 6–3 record in Super Bowls. He led the Patriots to 17 divisional titles, including five consecutive titles from 2003 to 2007 and eleven consecutive titles from 2009 to 2019. This streak of 11 consecutive playoff appearances is the most in NFL history for any team.[155] While still serving as head coach for the Patriots in 2019, Belichick appeared as one of three main analysts, alongside host Rich Eisen and Cris Collinsworth, for the NFL 100 All-Time Team series on NFL Network, serving as a voter, in addition to providing his analysis of each member's significance and breaking down tape of highlight plays. Belichick was chosen in these roles due to his exceptional knowledge of American football, to the extent that he and fellow former head coach John Madden were specifically assigned to look over film of the earliest players selected to the team.[156] Belichick was awarded a Sports Emmy in 2021 for his contributions to the series.[157] After mutually parting ways with the Patriots in 2024, Belichick, while still declaring himself an active head coach, officially agreed to appear every Monday afternoon during the 2024 NFL season with ESPN's The Pat McAfee Show, first appearing as an analyst on the show during its \"5th Annual Draft Spectacular\", covering the 2024 NFL draft, following a guest appearance weeks prior.[158][159] \"I can't tell you the advantage to having a defensive coach to take the quarterback behind the ropes on that defense, it made me a better quarterback, so Bill's gonna do that. I think the audience is going to be fascinated at how smart he is. Look, you guys saw how witty he is. I watched the Draft show you guys did; it was awesome. He's quick-witted, he's funny and like I said, he's brilliant when it comes to defense and offense, the guy can flat-out coach.\"[160] –Peyton Manning on Belichick as an analyst, May 2024 Peyton Manning revealed during the Netflix special The Roast of Tom Brady that Belichick would join another ESPN program, joining the Manning brothers (Peyton and Eli) in the Manningcast, an alternate live television broadcast of Monday Night Football.[161] A week afterward, Manning stated during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show that Belichick would appear on every Manningcast broadcast during the 2024 season.[160] Coaching record accurate as of final week of the 2023 NFL season.[162] Bill Belichick has worked under six head coaches: Twenty of Belichick's assistant coaches have become NFL or NCAA head coaches (not including interim tenures): During the offseason, Belichick visits other football programs to learn from their experiences. For example, he has studied the Navy run offense, sought Bill Walsh (in past years) to understand more about the San Francisco 49ers as an organization and the West Coast offense as a system,[190] and spent time with Jimmy Johnson to learn about drafting and contract negotiations.[191] The track record of Belichick's coaching tree has been characterized as poor. Former assistant coaches under Belichick had a combined 208–296–1 (.413) record as head coaches of their own teams through November 28, 2020, and a number of them ended their brief tenures as head coaches by being fired midseason.[192] As of the end of the 2020 season, the only members of this coaching tree to have career NFL head coaching records above .500 were former coaches Groh (9–7) and O'Brien (52–48 during season, 2–4 in playoffs).[193] Nick Saban and Belichick are good friends. In 2007, when Belichick spoke about their relationship, he said: \"Two successful Croats in the same division of NFL. You must admit, you don't see that every day.\"[194] In May 2018, President Donald Trump appointed Belichick to be a member of his Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition.[195] Belichick has an Alaskan Klee Kai dog named Nike.[196] Interest in the breed surged after Nike made an appearance on camera during the 2020 NFL draft.[197] Belichick has dual Croatian/American citizenship.[198] He received Croatian citizenship on June 3, 2024, in Banski dvori in Zagreb from the Croatian prime minister Andrej Plenković.[199] He was also special guest of the association football friendly match on Stadion Rujevica between Croatia and North Macedonia.[200] Belichick was married to Debby Clarke from 1977 to 2006.[201][202] They have three children. Daughter Amanda played lacrosse at Wesleyan University. She is the head women's lacrosse coach at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts in July 2015.[203] Son Stephen played lacrosse and football at Rutgers University, served as assistant coach with the Patriots, and is currently defensive coordinator for the University of Washington.[204] Son Brian is an assistant coach with the Patriots.[205] Starting in 2007, Belichick was in a relationship with Linda Holliday, the executive director of the Bill Belichick Foundation.[206][207] The relationship ended in 2023. In June 2024 it was reported that Belichick was in a relationship with Jordon Hudson, who is a 24-year-old former cheerleader.[208] On January 10, 2021, Politico reported then-President Donald Trump planned to award Belichick the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[209] Belichick indicated that he was flattered to be considered for the honor, but declined the award in a statement issued the next day.[210] His statement referenced the January 6 United States Capitol attack, which the House of Representatives had accused Trump of provoking when it impeached for the second time of his presidency, and cited Belichick's \"great reverence for our nation's values, freedom and democracy\" in light of that event.[211][212] A number of Massachusetts politicians, including Senator Ed Markey and Representative Jim McGovern, had previously called on him to decline after news of the award became public.[213] # denotes interim head coach # denotes de facto general manager # denotes interim head coach # denotes de facto general manager",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl The six-time Super Bowl champion head coach is 48 years older than his woman Former New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick \"couldn't care less\" about the 48 years between himself and his new girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, as he faces criticism that he's too old for the 24-year-old. Hudson met the six-time Super Bowl champion on a flight where they discussed psychology, and they remained in touch with each other afterwards, before reportedly beginning dating sometime in 2022. \"[Belichick] couldn't care less about the age difference because he appreciates Jordon for the woman that she is,\" a source told PageSix.com. \"Jordon is an old soul so she and Bill connect on a deep level. \"Age is just a number to them. [They] don't listen to the haters because their relationship is the real deal. [They] don't care what anybody thinks.\" Their relationship has largely remained out of the spotlight due to Belichick's forced sabbatical from the NFL when the Patriots axed him as their head coach and general manager after two decades in the role. Whilst he is listed as an active coach, he currently is not registered to any team and works as a pundit for FOX Sports and often collaborates with Pat McAfee. The 72-year-old recently made his red carpet debut with his beau as they attended The Museum Gala at New York City's American Museum of Natural History on December 5 and now an insider reports his passionate defense of her. The young woman and senior citizen have bonded over their shared love of football, as well as nature and the outdoor world and despite criticism, they are said to genuinely like each other. \"Bill was so proud to have Jordon by his side,\" the insider tells PageSix.com of the trip to the Museum. \"They have a genuine connection and mutual respect for one another. \"[They] connect on so many levels despite what some may think.

                "content": "Blue Ivy Carter (born January 7, 2012) is an American actress. She is the first-born daughter of musicians Beyoncé and Jay-Z. Two days after her birth, Time dubbed Carter \"the most famous baby in the world.\"[1] That same day, her breathing, cries and coos were featured on the song \"Glory\", by her father Jay-Z, which earned her a Guinness World Record for being the youngest person to have a charted song on any Billboard chart.[2][3] She has been the subject of depictions in media, including impersonations on Saturday Night Live and RuPaul's Drag Race. In 2019, she was featured on \"Brown Skin Girl\", a single by her mother Beyoncé, alongside Wizkid and Saint Jhn.[4] The song won her accolades including an NAACP Image Award;[5] the BET Her Award, making her the youngest winner of a BET Award; and a Grammy Award for Best Music Video for the same song,[6] which earned her another Guinness World Record for being the youngest individually credited Grammy Award winner,[7] and the second youngest overall.[8] Carter is slated to make her feature film debut in 2024 in Mufasa: The Lion King, as a voice actress portraying Princess Kiara.[9] On August 28, 2011, Beyoncé's pregnancy was announced during her performance of \"Love On Top\" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards.[10] She finished the performance by unbuttoning her blazer and rubbing her stomach to confirm the pregnancy.[11] Blue Ivy Carter was born on January 7, 2012, to Beyoncé and Jay-Z at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, New York.[12] CBS wrote Carter was \"Arguably the world's most famous baby, aside from Prince George and North West\", the eldest child of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.[13] Two days after her birth, Time dubbed Carter \"the most famous baby in the world.\"[1] Since her birth, her parents have \"worked to secure trademarks of their daughter's name for everything, including books, shampoos, video games, and more.\"[14] Beyoncé argued Carter is a \"cultural icon\" during the trademark process.[15] Through her mother, Carter is a granddaughter of Tina and Mathew Knowles,[16][17] a first cousin once removed of Angela Beyincé,[18] and a niece of singer Solange Knowles.[19] Media attention has been focused on Carter from birth because of her famous parents and extended family. In 2018, Carter attended first grade at the Center for Early Education, a private school in West Hollywood, California.[20] Dubbed the \"New Princess of Pop\" by Rolling Stone, Carter was featured gurgling and crying on her father's single \"Glory\", a song released to celebrate her two days after her birth.[21][1] Because of \"Glory\", Carter is the youngest person to ever chart on the Billboard charts.[22][23] In 2015, Carter appeared as part of the choir on the Coldplay song \"Up&Up\" from their album A Head Full of Dreams.[24][25] In 2020, Carter sang on the track \"Brown Skin Girl\", earning accolades and awards for the performance. She was the youngest recipient of a BET Award when she received the BET Her Award. She was also awarded the Soul Train Music Award for The Ashford & Simpson Songwriter's Award, as well as the prize for Outstanding Duo, Group or Collaboration at the 2020 NAACP Image Award ceremony.[26][27] In November 2020, Carter narrated Matthew A. Cherry's book Hair Love about an African American father doing his daughter's hair for the first time.[28][29] Variety posited \"there's a chance she could contend for a Grammy nomination for spoken word.\"[30] On January 21, 2023, Carter joined her mother onstage to sing \"Brown Skin Girl\" for the first time, as Beyoncé performed at a private show in Dubai.[31] Beginning May 26, 2023, Carter joined the Renaissance World Tour as a dancer and danced to \"My Power\" and \"Black Parade\" with her mother.[32] In 2012, Hvar, Croatia named Carter an honorary citizen. Before Carter's birth, her parents had visited the town, where Beyoncé had first considered naming her Blue Ivy.[33] In August 2014, Carter joined her father Jay-Z onstage at the MTV Video Music Awards, where they presented Beyoncé with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.[34] Carter has continued to attend music award ceremonies with her parents, including the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards, where she made headlines for the cost of the clothing she wore.[35][36] In January 2020, just before Carter's eighth birthday, rapper Megan Thee Stallion posted photos to her Instagram and Twitter of her, Beyoncé, and Carter. Vanity Fair writer K. Austin Collins and Harper's Bazaar web editor Violet Lucca criticized Carter's physical appearance. Both apologized and deleted their posts after backlash.[37][38] In February 2012, a skit on Saturday Night Live depicted a baby Carter being serenaded by Bon Iver (played by Justin Timberlake).[39] In January 2013, a skit on the same series depicted Carter's crib, which was \"lined with one of Diana Ross's finest wigs\".[40] In 2018, Carter was the subject of an impersonation by drag queen The Vixen on the Snatch Game episode on Season 10 of RuPaul's Drag Race. Into stated the characterization rested on \"brat... without pushing Blue into more nuanced territory\".[41] In 2023, the seventh episode of the Apple TV+ event series Extrapolations, titled \"The Going-Away Party\", mentioned a hypothetical Blue Ivy Carter Holiday Album.[42]",

Her daughter Blue Ivy is making her feature film debut in Mufasa as Kiara, the daughter of Simba and Nala. The pair attended the movie's premiere on Monday night in gold gowns and Beyoncé later took to Instagram to praise Blue Ivy's performance. \"My gorgeous baby girl. This is your night. You worked hard and you did such a beautiful job as the voice of Kiara. Your family could not be prouder. Keep shining,\" Beyoncé captioned the post which has been liked 1.6 million times. Also attending the premiere was Beyoncé's husband and rapper, Jay-Z, and her mom, Tina Knowles. The group put on a united front on the red carpet at the premiere amid allegations of rape against Jay-Z— whose given name is Shawn Carter. A federal lawsuit was filed in October against his fellow rapper, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who is currently in custody awaiting trial on a number of criminal charges, including trafficking. Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee filed the lawsuit in the Southern District of New York and amended it to include Carter as a defendant. The men are accused of raping a 13-year-old girl at a party after the MTV Video Music Awards in 2000. Carter filed a countersuit against Buzbee and released a statement on Sunday denying the suit's allegations. \"These allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!! Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree? These alleged victims would deserve real justice if that were the case,\" Carter stated and also accused Buzbee of \"blackmail.\" \"My heart and support goes out to true victims in the world, who have to watch how their life story is dressed in costume for profitability by this ambulance chaser in a cheap suit,\" Carter wrote. Buzbee responded to Carter's statement in a message to Newsweek. \"Mr. Carter previously denied being the one who sued me and my firm. He even filed his frivolous case under a pseudonym. What he fails to say in his recent statement is my firm sent his lawyer a demand letter on behalf of an alleged victim and that victim never demanded a penny from him. Instead, she only sought a confidential mediation,\" the lawyer said. \"Since I sent the letter on her behalf, Mr. Carter has not only sued me, but he has tried to bully and harass me and this plaintiff. His conduct has had the opposite impact. She is emboldened. I'm very proud of her resolve. As far as the allegations in the complaint filed today, we will let the filing speak for itself and will litigate the facts in court, not in the media,\" Buzbee added.

                "content": "Marcus Dell Gastineau (born November 20, 1956) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL) from 1979 to 1988. A five-time All-Pro and Pro Bowler, he was one of the quickest and most feared pass rushers of his generation, and the first player to lead the NFL in sacks in consecutive seasons. Gastineau was ranked no. 8 in National Football League (NFL) history on NFL Network's top 10 pass rushers. He entered Eastern Arizona Junior College in 1975 and earned All-America honors in his first season. He transferred to Arizona State University, and spent just one season playing defensive end there before finally settling upon East Central Oklahoma State University, now East Central University, in Ada, Oklahoma. He had 27 quarterback sacks in his college career,[1] and earned Outstanding Defensive Lineman honors for the North in the 1979 Senior Bowl. Gastineau became ECU's first-ever draft pick when the New York Jets selected him in the second round of the 1979 NFL draft.[2] Connie Carberg, the first female NFL scout in history, was credited with helping the Jets discover Gastineau. The team was coaching in the Senior Bowl and needed another defensive lineman on the roster due to a vacancy, so Carberg called several prospects before suggesting Gastineau to be the replacement based on a phone conversation with him. He was projected to be an eighth round draft pick at the time, but due to his performance in the Senior Bowl and other pre-draft processes, the Jets selected him in the second round.[3] Gastineau was among the most talented and honored defensive linemen of his era. He made the Pro Bowl five straight seasons (1981–1985) and finished his ten-year career with 74 officially recorded sacks (sacks were not an official stat for the first three years of his career). He was a First-team All-Pro in 1982–1984 and was consensus All-AFC in each of those years. In New York, Gastineau was a key part of the famed \"New York Sack Exchange,\" the Jets defensive line that also included Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons and Abdul Salaam. The four combined for 66 sacks in 1981, including twenty by Gastineau (In 1981 sacks were unofficial, but Gastineau's 20 sacks trailed Klecko by only half a sack), to lead the Jets to their first playoff game since 1969. He was Second-team All-Pro in 1981 as well as being consensus All-AFC. In November 1981, he, Klecko, Lyons and Salaam were invited to ring the ceremonial opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, which served as the inspiration for their nickname.[4] With Klecko rupturing the patella tendon in his right knee in the second game of the strike shortened 1982 season against the New England Patriots, Gastineau became the new unofficial leader of the \"Sack Exchange.\" Though he was often double teamed, he finished the season with six sacks, and was voted the NFL Defensive Player of the Year by NEA (and awarded the George Halas Trophy). The Jets made the playoffs again in 1982, losing the AFC Championship game to the Miami Dolphins.[5] The 1983 season started with Gastineau and the Jets' first round pick of the 1983 NFL draft, quarterback Ken O'Brien, being arrested and charged with assault at Studio 54.[6] Despite this off-the-field indiscretion, Gastineau totaled 19 sacks to lead the NFL for the first time. Gastineau was nationally famous for doing his signature \"Sack Dance\" after sacking an opposing quarterback. However, he had to stop when the NFL declared it \"unsportsmanlike taunting\" in March 1984 and began fining players for it. The ban on the dance stemmed from a bench-clearing brawl in the third quarter of a 27–24 overtime win over the Los Angeles Rams at Shea Stadium on September 25, 1983, which began with a sack of Vince Ferragamo by Gastineau who was then shoved from behind by Jackie Slater, the right tackle he had beaten on the play. One month later on October 21, a total of $15,750 in fines was assessed by the NFL against 16 Jets ($7,300) and 21 Rams ($8,450), with Gastineau incurring a $1,000 penalty.[7][8] Gastineau had his best individual season with an NFL record 22 sacks (leading the NFL for the second year in a row), 69 tackles and one fumble recovery for a touchdown in 1984. He was voted the UPI AFC Defensive Player of the Year, and was also named MVP of that season's Pro Bowl after tallying four sacks and a safety in that game. Gastineau's sack record stood for 17 years until Michael Strahan broke it in 2001. New defensive coordinator Bud Carson installed a 3-4 defense for the 1985 season. Gastineau shifted from left defensive end to right defensive end, although he did move him around to allow for mismatches. Gastineau broke his hand early in that season but still finished second in the league with 13½ sacks and was voted All-Pro by the NEA. The Jets finished 11–5 in 1985 to earn a wildcard spot in the playoffs along with fellow AFC East rivals, the New England Patriots. Gastineau recorded a sack in the Jets' 26–14 loss to the Pats at the Meadowlands.[9] For the start of the 1986 season, Gastineau was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated alongside New York Giants star linebacker Lawrence Taylor. Injuries limited Gastineau to just two sacks in ten games (his lowest total since his rookie season) as he was slowed by groin and abdominal muscle ailments and then by a damaged left knee that required arthroscopic surgery and forced him to miss the last five games of the regular season. Gastineau rebounded in the postseason, however, recording a sack in the Jets 35–15 wildcard round victory over the Kansas City Chiefs[10] and 2+1⁄2 more in the divisional-round playoff game against the Cleveland Browns. Late in the fourth quarter of that game, though, with the Jets leading 20–10 and the Browns facing a second down and 24 from their own 18-yard line, Gastineau was called for a roughing the passer penalty. The play had originally resulted in an incomplete pass by Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar so instead of having a 3rd-and-24 situation, the 15-yard penalty on Gastineau gave the Browns a first down at their own 33. From there, the Browns drove the remaining 67 yards to a touchdown which cut the Jets' lead to 20–17. The Browns would later tie the game with 7 seconds remaining in regulation on a 22-yard field goal by Mark Moseley and win it on a 27-yard field goal by Moseley 2 minutes and 2 seconds into the second overtime period. After the game, Gastineau said that he hadn't been guilty of roughing and that he was \"just following through.\" Teammate Marty Lyons, the Jets' other starting defensive end, defended Gastineau saying, \"(Ben Dreith) is a referee who's known to take care of the quarterback.\" Joe Walton, the Jets' head coach would say only, \"It was a very key play, Mark was just trying to do the best he could do.\"[11] In 1987, Gastineau was the only Jet regular to immediately cross the picket line in that year's players' strike, citing his need to pay alimony. Teammate Dave Jennings said of this understandably unpopular move: \"We expected it from Mark. He's always put himself in front of the team.\" The crossing brought to a head longstanding tensions between Gastineau and his teammates; he had never been popular in the locker room.[12] Gastineau got into a fight with backup center Guy Bingham when he drove into the Jets complex early in the strike. Gastineau was later joined in crossing the picket line by teammates Marty Lyons and Joe Klecko, further undermining the players' strike. Gastineau led the AFC in sacks seven weeks into the 1988 season.[13] He then abruptly announced his retirement soon after Brigitte Nielsen, to whom he had previously announced his engagement, claimed to be suffering from cancer of the uterus.[14][13] The announcement was followed by a surge of investigation by local New York papers of whether she was telling the truth, reflecting citywide mistrust of Gastineau.[15] At the time of his retirement, Gastineau was the NFL's all-time leader in sacks. Gastineau attempted a comeback with the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League in 1990, but was released after only four games.[16] Gastineau was inducted into the New York Jets Ring of Honor on October 8, 2012.[17] In 2022, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Gastineau to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2022.[18] In 1991, Gastineau began a career in boxing, lasting five years. In his first fight, Gastineau knocked out Derrick Dukes in the first round. Dukes, a professional wrestler, later admitted he took a dive. TV newsmagazine show 60 Minutes interviewed several others that fought Gastineau and were told to take dives to make Gastineau look good. His career ended in 1996 when he lost to another former football player, Alonzo Highsmith. In 18 career bouts, his record in boxing was 15 wins, two losses, and one no-contest. Gastineau has been married three times. His first wife, Lisa Gastineau and their daughter Brittny Gastineau starred in the E! reality television show, The Gastineau Girls. Gastineau has a son with actress Brigitte Nielsen, Killian Marcus.[19] He was estranged from both children in 2010.[20] Shortly after his release from prison in 2001, Gastineau claimed he had put his turbulent past behind him after he had a religious conversion to faith in Jesus Christ. Gastineau has appeared on programs such as The 700 Club to speak of his experience.[21] Gastineau is a member of the choir at Times Square Church, where he married third wife JoAnn in 2007.[17] In 1984, Gastineau was found guilty of assaulting a patron at Studio 54. He was sentenced to 90 hours of community service, teaching football to inmates at Rikers Island.[22] In 1991, Gastineau was arrested for picking up a package of amphetamine pills at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. He was sentenced to three years probation in 1993.[23][24] In September 2000, Gastineau was sentenced to 18 months in jail after failing to complete an anger management course after hitting his second wife Patricia.[24] In 2016, Gastineau was diagnosed with dementia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.[25] Gastineau said he believed the illnesses could be traced back to football, stating he wanted to continue to teach younger football players how to play the game safely.[26] He blames the brain diseases on poor tackling technique.[27] In March 2019, Gastineau revealed that he had been battling colon cancer.[28]",

                "content": "NEW! Find where to watch all of your favorite sports! In this excerpt from 30 for 30's \"The New York Sack Exchange,\" Mark Gastineau has a tense exchange with Brett Favre over Michael Strahan sacking Favre to break Gastineau's single-season sack record. (2:28) Former New York Jets star Mark Gastineau, who has carried a grudge against Brett Favre for two decades, confronted the Hall of Fame quarterback last year at a memorabilia show and accused him of deliberately taking a sack that cost Gastineau the NFL's single-season record. It made for a tense and uncomfortable scene, captured on video. It appears in the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary \"The New York Sack Exchange,\" which premieres 8 p.m. ET Friday (ESPN/ESPN+). An angry Gastineau attended the memorabilia show in Chicago with two other members of the Jets' \"Sack Exchange,\" a four-man defensive line that dominated the early 1980s. He approached an unsuspecting Favre at a table where the Green Bay Packers legend was signing autographs. They shook hands. Favre mentioned how they had met once before. \"Yeah, right -- when you fell down for him,\" said Gastineau, alluding to former New York Giants star Michael Strahan -- the record breaker. \"I'm going to get my sack back. I'm going to get my sack back, dude.\" Favre looked bewildered. \"You probably would hurt me,\" he said. \"Well, I don't care,\" Gastineau said, pointing at Favre. \"You hurt me. You hurt me! You hear me?\" \"Yeah, I hear you,\" Favre said. \"You really hurt me,\" Gastineau shot back. \"You really hurt me, Brett.\" At that point, Favre was escorted away by one of his handlers, leaving a seething Gastineau by himself. He was miked up by a camera crew, which was following him. Gastineau was referring to the final game of the 2001 season, when Strahan broke Gastineau's single-season record with a controversial sack of Favre. With 22 sacks, Gastineau held the mark from 1984 to 2001. Many believe Favre went down on purpose so Strahan could break the record with 22.5. Gastineau was in attendance that day, graciously congratulating Strahan. After 18 years of suppressing his anger, Gastineau went public with his true feelings in a 2020 interview with ESPN. He doubles down in the documentary. \"Anybody will tell you that Brett Favre took a dive,\" Gastineau said in the documentary. The 30 for 30 chronicles the rise and fall of the \"Sack Exchange\" and the complex relationship between the polarizing Gastineau and teammates Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons and the late Abdul Salaam. Reached by phone, Gastineau explained why he confronted Favre. \"I wanted to let him know it was a trash sack,\" he said. \"I've been wanting to do that for a long time -- many, many years,\" Gastineau added. \"I've only got one more guy to go to\" -- meaning Strahan, who Gastineau says he believes conspired with Favre on the record-breaking sack. Gastineau had no idea Favre would be at the show until he and his wife, Jo Ann, arrived in Chicago and saw Favre's name on a list of attendees. Lyons, who was in Chicago and witnessed the confrontation, said he tried to convince his former teammate to stay away from Favre. \"I said, 'Mark, let it go, just let it go. That happened years ago,'\" Lyons said in a phone interview. \"But he had this little crazed look in his eye.\" Later that day, Jo Ann Gastineau returned to Favre's table to smooth things over. She said she apologized, saying her husband \"didn't mean anything by it.\" The record has been a source of anguish for Strahan as well. \"The sack record is great, absolutely phenomenal, but I almost feel like in a sense it was diminished because everyone goes, 'Oh, Brett Favre gave you a sack,'\" Strahan said in \"A Football Life,\" a documentary aired in 2013 by NFL Network. \"I caught so much flak over it. ... It's not worth it, because everyone looks as if one sack that they question is the defining moment of my career.\" The Hall of Famer is no longer the sole holder of the single-season record, as Pittsburgh Steelers star T.J. Watt matched Strahan's mark with 22.5 sacks in 2021. On Tuesday, Favre posted a long thread on X, addressing what he described as \"a small dustup\" between him and Gastineau. Favre said he didn't intentionally take the sack to hurt Gastineau, saying, \"There was no malice on my part.\" In retrospect, Favre said he sees how the sack record might have benefitted Gastineau financially and strengthened his case for the Hall of Fame. \"A while back, he saw me at a card show and got his frustration off his chest,\" Favre posted. \"It's not the kind of moment that should be filmed and released. It was a private moment of frustration between two old football warriors.\" Favre endorsed Gastineau for the Hall of Fame. \"I hope this controversy brings attention to just how great Mark Gastineau was. He belongs in Canton.\"",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Mark Gastineau forced a smile as he congratulated Michael Strahan for breaking his single-season sack record on the final day of the 2001 season. Gastineau, though, was incensed at how Strahan broke his record, and he let Brett Favre -- the quarterback Strahan tackled for the record-breaking sack -- know about it more than two decades later. Strahan got the record after Favre (who was seen talking to Strahan moments earlier) slid right in front of him near the end of the game. As you'll see in the video below, Gastineau confronted Favre at a memorabilia show last year. Favre was friendly at the beginning at the conversation, but Gastineau quickly made it clear that he had a two-decade-old ax to grind. \"I'm gonna get my sack back,\" Gastineau told Favre. \"I'm gonna get my sack back, dude. ... You hurt me. You hurt me. You hear me? You really hurt me. You hurt me, Brett.\" 22 years after losing the NFL single-season sack record, Mark Gastineau confronted Brett Favre for ‘taking a dive’ on the record-breaking play.Catch the latest @30for30, 'The New York Sack Exchange,' on ESPN and ESPN+ starting Dec. 13. pic.twitter.com/Oz5KRwVcy7 Gastineau, whose 22.0 sacks in 1984 stood as the record for 17 years, feels that the NFL should have stepped in and disallowed Strahan's record-breaking sack to count. \"The NFL should have stopped that,\" he said. \"(Favre) took that record away from me.\" Favre later responded to the video on social media. He said that the sack was the result of him deciding to run a bootleg and \"squeeze the last bit of fun out of a hard-fought game.\" But instead of seeing an open field, Favre saw Strahan and immediately went down. \"In a different game or situation, I would have made a bigger effort to avoid the sack or TFL,\" Favre wrote on X. \"But at no point was I thinking about hurting Gastineau. Maybe it crossed my mind to help Strahan. I didn't think it through. That wasn't my forte at the time. I just wanted to have fun and compete. In retrospect, I understand how Gastineau feels. We played a brutal game. Gastineau played during an era where guys didn't make generational wealth. \"I see now how being the Sack King would elevate his value at card shows, strengthen his case for the Hall of Fame, increase his demand as a public speaker. I had no way of knowing that then. I realize now the potential financial implications because football is far more business-oriented than when me or Mark played.\" Favre hopes that this situation helps shed light on Gastineau's impressive career that included three All-Pro nods, five Pro Bowl selections and a Defensive Player of the Year award. Gastineau is also the Jets' all-time career sack leader. \"I have a great deal of respect for Mark,\" Favre wrote. \"I hope one day he joins me in the Hall of Fame. He earned it.\" Gastineau's record was eventually matched by Jared Allen in 2011 and surpassed in 2021 by T.J. Watt, who tied Strahan's record of 22.5 sacks. Ironically, the player who unofficially has the record is Al Baker, who registered 23 sacks in 1978 as a member of the Detroit Lions. Unfortunately for Baker, the NFL did not begin to make individual sacks an official statistic until 1982. (Baker's total was compiled by Pro Football Reference in 2021.) The footage of Gastineau's encounter with Favre is part of ESPN's upcoming documentary on the Jets' iconic \"New York Sack Exchange\" defensive line, a unit that included Gastineau, 2023 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons and Abdul Salaam. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

Born in Terrell, Texas,[5] Foxx is the son of Darrell Bishop (renamed Shahid Abdula following his conversion to Islam),[6] who sometimes worked as a stockbroker, and Louise Annette Talley Dixon. Shortly after his birth, Foxx was adopted and raised by his mother's adoptive parents, Esther[7] Marie (née Nelson), a domestic worker and nursery operator, and Mark Talley, a yard worker.[8][9] He has had little contact with his birth parents, who were not part of his upbringing.[10] He was raised in the black quarter of Terrell, which at the time was a racially segregated community.[10] He has often acknowledged his grandmother's influence as one of the greatest reasons for his success.[8][11] Foxx began playing the piano when he was five years old.[12] He had a strict Baptist upbringing[8][13] and as a teenager was a part-time pianist and choir leader in Terrell's New Hope Baptist Church.[10] His natural talent for telling jokes was already in evidence as a third grader, when his teacher used him as a reward: if the class behaved well, Foxx would tell them jokes. He attended Terrell High School, where he received top grades and played basketball and football (as quarterback). His ambition was to play for the Dallas Cowboys, and he was the first player in the school's history to pass for more than 1,000 yards.[10][14] He also sang in a band called Leather and Lace.[10] After high school, Foxx received a scholarship to United States International University, where he studied musical and performing arts composition.[10][15] Foxx first told jokes at a comedy club's open mic night in 1989, after accepting a girlfriend's dare. When he found that female comedians were often called first to perform, he chose the stage name of Jamie Foxx, which he felt was ambiguous enough to disallow any biases,[10][16] with his surname being a tribute to the black comedian Redd Foxx.[16] Foxx joined the cast of In Living Color in 1991, where his recurrent character Wanda also shared a name with Redd's friend and co-worker, LaWanda Page. Following a recurring role in the comedy-drama sitcom Roc,[17] Foxx went on to star in his own sitcom The Jamie Foxx Show, from 1996 to 2001, which he also co-created and produced through his company Foxx Hole Productions and was aired on the WB network. Foxx made his film debut in the 1992 comedy Toys. His first dramatic role came in Oliver Stone's 1999 film Any Given Sunday, where he was cast as a hard-partying quarterback,[8] partly because of his own football background.[8] During filming, Foxx fought with costar LL Cool J.[18][19] In 2001, Foxx starred opposite Will Smith in Michael Mann's biographical drama Ali. Three years later, Foxx played taxi driver Max Durocher in the Mann film Collateral alongside Tom Cruise, for which he received outstanding reviews. Critic Roger Ebert praised Foxx's performance, stating that, \"Jamie Foxx's work is a revelation. I've thought of him in terms of comedy (\"Booty Call,\" \"Breakin' all the Rules\"), but here he steps into a dramatic lead and is always convincing and involving\".[20] He went on to receive a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.[8] In 1994, Foxx released an album (on the Fox record label) entitled Peep This, which was not commercially successful. In 2003, Foxx made a cameo in Benzino's music video for \"Would You\", which features LisaRaye McCoy and Mario Winans. In 2003, Foxx featured on the rapper Twista's song, \"Slow Jamz\", together with Kanye West, which reached No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and #3 on the UK Singles chart. His second collaboration with Kanye West, \"Gold Digger,\" in which Foxx sang the Ray Charles-influenced \"I Got a Woman\" hook, then went straight to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining there for 10 weeks. In 2005, Foxx featured on the single \"Georgia\" by Atlanta rappers Ludacris and Field Mob, which sampled Ray Charles' hit \"Georgia on My Mind\". Foxx would also portray Ray Charles in the biographical film Ray (2004), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor[8] and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Foxx is the third male in history (after Barry Fitzgerald and Al Pacino) to receive two acting Oscar nominations in the same year for two different movies, Collateral and Ray. In 2005, Foxx was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[21] Foxx released his second studio album, Unpredictable, in December 2005. It debuted at No. 2, selling 598,000 copies in its first week,[22] rising to No. 1 the following week and selling an additional 200,000 copies.[23] To date, the album has sold 1.98 million copies in the United States, and was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.[24][25] The album also charted on the UK Albums Chart, where it peaked at No. 9.[26] Foxx became the fourth artist to have both won an Academy Award for an acting role and to have achieved a No. 1 album in the U.S, joining Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Barbra Streisand. Foxx's first single from the album, the title track \"Unpredictable\" (featuring Ludacris), peaked in the Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 singles and also made the UK Top 20 singles chart; the track samples \"Wildflower\" by New Birth. The second U.S. single from the album was \"DJ Play a Love Song,\" which reunited Foxx with Twista. In the UK, the second single was \"Extravaganza\", which saw Foxx once again collaborate with Kanye West, although Foxx did not feature in the song's music video. At the 2006 BET Awards, Foxx won Best Duet/Collaboration with Kanye West for \"Gold Digger\" and tied with Mary J. Blige's \"Be Without You\" for Video of the Year. On December 8, 2006, Foxx received four Grammy Award nominations, which included Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for Love Changes featuring Mary J. Blige, Best R&B Album for Unpredictable, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for Georgia by Ludacris & Field Mob featuring Jamie Foxx, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for Unpredictable featuring Ludacris. Following on from these successes, Foxx went on to appear in the box-office hits Jarhead, Miami Vice, and Dreamgirls, which lifted his profile even higher as a bankable star in Hollywood. 2007 brought him the lead role in the action thriller film The Kingdom opposite Chris Cooper, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner and Ashraf Barhom. In September 2007, Foxx was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: \"[it was] one of the most amazing days of my life,\" said Foxx.[27] In April 2009, Foxx played the lead role in the dramatic film The Soloist. A few months later in October 2009, he played a starring role alongside Gerard Butler in the thriller Law Abiding Citizen. In 2007, his company FoxxKing Entertainment signed deals with MTV and VH1.[28] Foxx released his third album titled Intuition in 2008, featuring Kanye West, T.I., Ne-Yo, Lil' Kim and T-Pain. The album's first single, \"Just Like Me\" featuring T.I., was promoted by a video directed by Brett Ratner which featured an appearance by actress Taraji P. Henson. The second single \"Blame It\" featured T-Pain and became a top 5 single on the Billboard Hot 100 and a number-one single on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The song received many accolades for Foxx, including a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. The \"Blame It\" music video, directed by Hype Williams, features cameo appearances by Forest Whitaker, Samuel L. Jackson, Ron Howard, Quincy Jones and his Jarhead co-star Jake Gyllenhaal, amongst others. Foxx's musical career has also included a number of collaborations. In 2007, he recorded the song \"She Goes All the Way\" with country superstars Rascal Flatts for their Still Feels Good album. Foxx performed backing vocals for artist/songwriter Tank. He featured alongside The-Dream on Plies' \"Please Excuse My Hands.\" He also appeared alongside Fabolous on the remix of Ne-Yo's \"Miss Independent\". Foxx collaborated with rapper The Game on the track \"Around the World\". Foxx also featured on T.I.'s single \"Live in the Sky\" from the album King. On January 22, 2007, Foxx launched The Foxxhole, a channel on Sirius Satellite Radio featuring talk-radio programs, stand-up comedy albums and music primarily by African-American performers, as well as much of Foxx's own material. Foxx's own talk-radio variety program The Jamie Foxx Show airs Friday evenings on The Foxxhole with guests including musicians, actors and fellow comedians; co-hosts have included Johnny Mack, Speedy, Claudia Jordan, The Poetess, Lewis Dix, Yvette Wilson, T.D.P and Tyrin Turner. On the April 17, 2009, episode of The Jamie Foxx Show, Foxx and his co-hosts made several sexually suggestive and disparaging jokes regarding the teenage singer Miley Cyrus.[29] Several days later Foxx issued a public apology on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in response to growing public outcry and televised criticism by Cyrus's father, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus.[30] On April 6, 2009, Foxx, a longtime fan of country music, performed the George Strait song \"You Look So Good in Love\" at the George Strait Artist of the Decade All-Star Concert. Jamie Foxx hosted the 2009 BET Awards ceremony on June 28, 2009, which featured several tributes to pop star Michael Jackson, who had died three days prior to the show. As well as performing \"Blame It\" with T-Pain and \"She Got Her Own\" with Ne-Yo and Fabolous, Foxx opened the show with a rendition of Jackson's \"Beat It\" dance routine and closed the show with a cover of the Jackson 5's \"I'll Be There\" with Ne-Yo. \"We want to celebrate this black man. He belongs to us and we shared him with everybody else.\", said Foxx during the ceremony. In April 2011, Foxx voiced the cartoon canary Nico in the movie Rio. During the summer of 2011, Foxx was involved as a producer of In the Flow with Affion Crockett on Fox.[31] Foxx released his fourth album, Best Night of My Life, on December 21, 2010,[32] featuring the singles \"Winner\" (featuring Justin Timberlake and T.I.), \"Living Better Now\" (featuring rapper Rick Ross) and \"Fall for Your Type\" (featuring rapper Drake).[32] On October 7, the RCA Music Group announced that it was disbanding J Records along with Arista Records and Jive Records, meaning that all artists (including Foxx) previously signed to the three labels will release their future material on the RCA Records brand.[33][34] In 2011, Jamie Foxx also featured on the rapper Pitbull's album Planet Pit, in the song \"Where Do We Go\". In 2012, Foxx starred in the title role of the Quentin Tarantino written and directed Django Unchained.[35] Foxx starred alongside his Ray co-star Kerry Washington, as well as Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. In an interview about Django Unchained, Foxx told Vibe magazine: \"As a black person it's always racial. ... when I get home my other homies are like how was your day? Well, I only had to be white for at least eight hours today, [or] I only had to be white for four hours.\"[36] The filming was emotional as Foxx said, \"It's tough shooting when you're in plantation row and that's where your ancestors were persecuted and killed.\"[37] On November 25, 2012, at BET's Soul Train Awards, Foxx joked: \"It's like church in here. First of all, giving honor to God and our lord and savior Barack Obama.\"[38] The joke led to condemnation from some Christians, to which Foxx responded: \"I'm a comic [and] sometimes I think people get a little too tight.\"[39] While hosting Saturday Night Live on December 8, 2012, to promote Django Unchained, Foxx joked about being excited \"to kill all the white people in the movie\".[40] Appearing at the 2013 NAACP Image Awards, Foxx praised the achievements of black people, saying that \"black people are the most talented people in the world\".[41] In 2013, Foxx was cast as President James Sawyer in White House Down alongside Channing Tatum.[42] The following year, Foxx appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 as the villain Electro, and co-starred with Quvenzhané Wallis in Annie, Sony's Will Smith and Jay-Z produced update of the comic strip-turned-musical.[43] In 2017, Foxx starred as Bats, a trigger-happy gang member, in Edgar Wright's action film Baby Driver.

On the show, three sets of two partners try to beat the software application Shazam in correctly identifying the titles of popular songs for increasingly higher amounts of money, with one team eventually vying for a potential prize of $1 million. Foxx's daughter Corinne began co-hosting the show in its second season in 2018, replacing DJ October Gonzalez.[46] The show has aired four seasons so far.[47] Foxx co-executive produced the 2017 Showtime sitcom White Famous, which starred Jay Pharoah as a young aspiring African-American comic, and was based on Foxx's own early career.

The series marked Foxx's return to the sitcom format after The Jamie Foxx Show ended in 2001.[59] The entire eight-episode series premiered April 14, 2021, on Netflix.

Dybantsa, who made the announcement on ESPN's \"First Take,\" chose the Cougars over Alabama, North Carolina and Kansas. He is BYU's first five-star high school recruit from the United States. The chance to play for first-year BYU coach Kevin Young sold Dybantsa on joining the Cougars. He pointed to the extensive NBA experience of Young and his staff and Young's role in coaching NBA stars like Kevin Durant and Devin Booker as key factors influencing his decision. \"My ultimate goal is to get to the NBA,\" Dybantsa said on the program. \"I went on my visit and the head coach all the way down to the analytics guy and analytics guy all the way down to the dietician is NBA staff. Even the strength coach. If it's all NBA and I'm trying to get to the NBA, I think it's going to be the best development program for me.\" Young was the associate head coach at the Phoenix Suns before taking over at BYU in April following Mark Pope's departure to Kentucky. He set a goal of turning the BYU program into an NBA development pipeline. The Cougars are making strides in that direction. Projected 2025 NBA lottery pick Egor Demin stars for BYU in the backcourt this season and leads the Cougars in scoring and assists. Kanon Catchings, another BYU freshman, is a late first-rounder in multiple NBA mock drafts. With Dybantsa's commitment, Young has already brought in the three highest-rated BYU recruits in program history. \"AJ is a generational talent,\" Young said in a press release on Tuesday. \"He's a great young man who has a strong appetite to be the best player he can be. His versatile skill set and playmaking will seamlessly fit into our style of play.\" Dybantsa, a 6-foot-9 wing, has emerged as a prolific scorer in the high school ranks.

She lost her job in 1996 when Terence Hallinan was elected district attorney and fired 14 of the city's prosecutors.[15] Guilfoyle worked for four years in Los Angeles as a deputy district attorney, serving on adult and juvenile cases. She received several awards at the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office, including Prosecutor of the Month.[14] In 2000, Guilfoyle was rehired by Hallinan in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office, where she was an assistant district attorney from 2000 to 2004. During this time she obtained a conviction while co-prosecuting with James Hammer in the 2002 case People v. Noel and Knoller, a second-degree murder trial involving a dog mauling, which received international attention.[16][17] In 2003, by which time her then-husband Gavin Newsom was the front-running candidate in the 2003 San Francisco mayoral election, Guilfoyle publicly accused her fellow assistant DA Kamala Harris (who was running in the 2003 election for district attorney) of being unwelcoming towards Kimberly Guilfoyle. This accusation occurred years earlier during Guilfoyle's re-hiring at the San Francisco district attorney's office. Harris denied this accusation. Guilfoyle did provide positive comments on Harris' qualifications for office; she described Harris as someone that would \"work very hard\" if elected district attorney, as well as \"very smart\" and \"a good speaker\".[18] In 1995, Guilfoyle worked on the reelection campaign of district attorney Arlo Smith. Around this time, she was also a regular fixture at political fundraisers organized by oil billionaire Gordon Getty, whose son William she dated. (It is not publicly known what the timeline is on Guilfoyle's relationship with Billy Getty.[19])[13] In January 2004, Guilfoyle moved to New York to host the program Both Sides on Court TV. In addition, she worked as a legal analyst on Anderson Cooper 360°.[20] She joined Fox News in February 2006 as host of the weekend show The Lineup. This was eventually canceled. Guilfoyle remained a regular contributor for the network, and in 2011 was picked as co-host of The Five. She worked as a host on the show until 2018.[21] In 2014, she began hosting and then co-hosting Outnumbered for nearly fifty episodes, plus a few more appearances until June 2018.[22] Guilfoyle also appeared weekly on the recurring segment \"Is It Legal?\" on The O'Reilly Factor until that show was cancelled in 2017, and as a weekly Thursday guest on Brian Kilmeade's Kilmeade and Friends radio show.[14] Guilfoyle guest-hosted Hannity, On the Record, Justice with Judge Jeanine, and Fox & Friends.[23] In mid-2017, Guilfoyle signed a long-term contract extension with Fox.[24] A year later, in July 2018, Guilfoyle abruptly left Fox News;[25] she began working for a pro–Donald Trump super PAC.[26][27] HuffPost reported that, at the time of her departure, the network had been in the midst of a year-long investigation of a sexual harassment accusation against Guilfoyle. Network officials had given Guilfoyle an ultimatum: Resign by the end of July or be fired.[26] The New Yorker subsequently corroborated reports that Guilfoyle had been forced to resign rather than leaving by choice.[28] After Guilfoyle left, Fox News agreed to an out-of-court settlement with an assistant who had accused Guilfoyle of sexual harassment. Terms were not disclosed. The New Yorker reported that the settlement was at least $4 million.[28] The assistant alleged that Guilfoyle frequently displayed herself naked, showed photographs of the genitalia of men she had sex with, and required her to sleep over at Guilfoyle's apartment.[28] The New Yorker independently verified several of the assistant's allegations.[28] In 2015, Guilfoyle published a semi-autobiographical advice book published by HarperCollins, titled Making the Case: How to Be Your Own Best Advocate, on her experiences growing up, working as a prosecutor, and encouraging people to advocate for themselves.[29] In April 2024, Guilfoyle announced the upcoming publication of The Princess and her Pup, a children's book that she has authored.[30] Ten percent of its sales are slated to benefit an nonprofit dedicated to animal welfare.[31] In December 2016, it was reported that Guilfoyle was being considered for the position of press secretary for the 45th United States president Donald Trump. Sean Spicer was considered the front-runner for the position,[32] and was ultimately selected. On the May 12, 2017, edition of The Five, co-host Bob Beckel hinted that Guilfoyle turned the job down. In an interview with Bay Area News Group on May 15, 2017, Guilfoyle confirmed she was in contact with the White House about the position following Spicer's resignation. She said: \"I'm a patriot, and it would be an honor to serve the country. I think it'd be a fascinating job, it's a challenging job, and you need someone really determined and focused, a great communicator in there with deep knowledge to be able to handle that position.\"[33][34] On May 19, Guilfoyle said she was under contract with Fox, indicating she turned the White House down. One month later, she extended her contract with Fox.[35] In 2018, The Washington Post described Guilfoyle as a \"conservative cheerleader for President Trump\".[36] In 2019, Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr. jointly toured school campuses, invited by venues such as the University of Florida, where they were paid $50,000 for their appearance from student activity fees, which led to complaints by anti-Trump students. At the event, two people were arrested and five were injured. Two years earlier, white nationalist Richard B. Spencer had preceded them as an invited speaker, generating similar controversy.[37][38] In 2020, Guilfoyle was reported to be the chair of the finance committee of the Trump Victory Committee.[39] As of early 2020, the Trump campaign was secretly paying Guilfoyle $15,000 per month through the campaign manager's private company, Parscale Strategy. Guilfoyle served as a surrogate on the stump and took on broad advisory roles.[40][41] In the Trump 2020 campaign, Guilfoyle managed a fund-raising division. This division paid socialite Somers Farkas to raise money.[42] The fundraising division managed by Guilfoyle was in internal turmoil amid departures of experienced staff and accusations of irresponsible spending.[43] In November 2020, Politico's reporting alleged that Guilfoyle had engaged in sexually explicit conversations during private Trump fundraisers that had made some attendees uncomfortable. Politico reported that many campaign insiders alleged that this was part of severe human resources problems that plagued fundraising division, likely damaging the Trump campaign's ability to keep pace with the Biden campaign's fundraising.[44] At the Republican National Convention in August 2020, Guilfoyle gave a speech endorsing Trump that was widely described by some observers as unnecessarily loud,[45] or unhinged.[46][47] Others in media described it as passionate.[48] She was criticized for describing herself as a first-generation American when her mother was from Puerto Rico and thus an American citizen.[49] She is a first generation American on her father's side, as he immigrated to the United States from Ireland.[9] On January 6, 2021, Guilfoyle joined Trump, Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani, Eric Trump, and others on the Ellipse in Washington, D.C., to address the \"Save America March\". This resulted in the attack on the Capitol.[50] Having raised millions of dollars to support the rally, Guilfoyle was also involved in organizing the protest at the Capitol.[51] She was paid $60,000 for her 2.5 minute rally speech.[52] Guilfoyle was featured in a video screened at the rally by Trump Jr., \"break[ing] into the hip-shaking dance she's been showcasing at other recent pro-Trump rallies\" and \"tell[ing] Trump fans: 'Have the courage to do the right thing! Fight!'\"[53] Guilfoyle served on the platform committee of the 2024 Republican National Convention.[54] Guilfoyle delivered a speech at the convention.[55] While delivered in a similar fashion to her derided 2020 convention speech, the 2024 convention featured a in-person audience that reacted receptively to her speech.[56] Donald Trump named Guilfoyle as the new United States ambassador to the country of Greece in 2025.[57] Early into her work as a prosecutor in San Francisco, Guilfoyle briefly dated William Getty, a scion of the Getty family.[13] In December 2001, Guilfoyle married politician Gavin Newsom, then a San Francisco city supervisor. Newsom was elected mayor of San Francisco in 2003. While married to Newsom, she used the name Kimberly Guilfoyle Newsom. The couple appeared in the September 2004 issue of Harper's Bazaar; the spread had them posed at the Getty Villa, and they were referred to in the title as the \"New Kennedys\".[58] In January 2005, citing the strain of a bicoastal marriage, Guilfoyle and Newsom jointly filed for divorce.[59] Their divorce was final on February 28, 2006.[60] It later emerged that Newsom, then 39, was having an affair with Ruby Rippey-Tourk, the wife of his then-campaign manager and former deputy chief of staff, Alex Tourk.[61] It is unclear if Guilfoyle knew about the affair before the scandal broke in 2007.[61] On May 27, 2006, in Barbados, Guilfoyle married furniture heir Eric Villency.[62] On October 4, 2006, Guilfoyle gave birth to their son,[63] Ronan.[64] Guilfoyle and Villency divorced in November 2009.[65] In June 2018, Vanessa Trump, who had filed for divorce from Donald Trump Jr. three months earlier, confirmed that Guilfoyle was dating Trump Jr.[66] In mid-2019, Guilfoyle and Trump Jr. jointly purchased a $4.4 million home in The Hamptons. They sold it in March 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic for $8.14 million.[67][68] Also in March 2021, the couple jointly purchased a $9.7 million home in Jupiter, Florida.[69] Guilfoyle and Trump became engaged on December 31, 2020. The news of the engagement was not made public until January 2022.[70] Since 2021, Guilfoyle and Trump Jr. have cohabitated in their Jupiter residence.[71] Guilfoyle's 2017 departure from Fox News was due to alleged sexual harassment on her part.[26][28] Fox News later reached a settlement of at least $4 million with Guilfoyle's accuser.[28] The assistant alleged that Guilfoyle frequently displayed herself naked, showed photographs of the genitalia of men she had sex with, and required her to sleep over at Guilfoyle's apartment.[28] The New Yorker independently verified several of the assistant's allegations.[28] Guilfoyle has also faced separate allegations of making sexually explicit comments at fundraisers. In 2004, it was reported that in speaking on behalf of then-husband, Gavin Newsom, at the Empire State Pride Agenda gay rights fundraiser, Guilfoyle boasted about his attractiveness and large penis size, and implied (through innuendo and pantomiming) that she was talented at providing oral sex. This was treated in San Francisco as a political controversy. Guilfoyle subsequently denied that her arm gestures were meant to be a sexually explicit pantomime.[72] In November 2020, Politico's reporting alleged that Guilfoyle had engaged in sexually explicit conversations during private Trump fundraisers that had made some attendees uncomfortable, including explicit conversations involving Trump Jr., disclosing at a fall 2018 fundraiser that Trump Jr. liked her to cosplay as a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader, making an offer at a December 2019 fundraiser to personally reward the event's top contributor with a lap dance, and offering at a 2020 fundraiser to host a hot tub party for its top contributor. A Trump campaign spokesperson denied this, asserting that \"in context\" nothing about her remarks at fundraisers had been offensive.[44]",

                "title": "Greg Gutfeld - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Gregory John Gutfeld (born September 12, 1964) is an American television host, political commentator, comedian, and author. He is the host of the late-night comedy talk show Gutfeld!,[1] and hosted a Saturday night edition of Gutfeld! called The Greg Gutfeld Show from May 2015 until March 2021, when it was announced the show would transition to weeknights. Gutfeld is also one of five co-hosts and panelists on the political talk show The Five. Both of his shows air on the Fox News Channel. From 2007 to 2015, Gutfeld hosted the 3AM series Red Eye, a late-night talk show that also aired on the Fox News Channel.[2] Gutfeld was born in San Mateo, California, the son of Jacqueline Bernice \"Jackie\" (née Cauhape) and Alfred Jack Gutfeld.[3] Raised Catholic, he attended the all-boys Roman Catholic Junípero Serra High School[4] and the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1987 with a bachelor's degree in English.[5][6] In a 2009 interview, Gutfeld explained that he started to experience a change in his political thinking while he was attending college:[7] I became a conservative by being around liberals, and I became a libertarian by being around conservatives. You realize that there's something distinctly in common between the two groups, the left and the right; the worst part of each of them is the moralizing. After college, Gutfeld interned at The American Spectator, as an assistant to conservative writer R. Emmett Tyrrell. He then worked as a staff writer at Prevention magazine and as an editor for various Rodale Press magazines. In 1995, he became a staff writer at Men's Health. He was promoted to editor-in-chief of Men's Health in 1999. A year later, he was replaced by David Zinczenko. Gutfeld then became editor-in-chief of Stuff, then owned by Dennis Publishing. During his tenure, circulation increased from 750,000 to 1.2 million. In 2003, Gutfeld hired several dwarfs to attend a conference of the Magazine Publishers of America on the topic of \"buzz\", with instructions to be as loud and annoying as possible.[8] The stunt generated publicity but led to Gutfeld being fired soon afterward; he then became \"director of brand development\" at Dennis Publishing.[8] He edited the company's Maxim magazine in the U.K. from 2004 to 2006.[6] Gutfeld's contract expired without renewal after losses in readership under his tenure.[9] Gutfeld was one of the first posting contributors to The Huffington Post, from its launch in 2005 until October 2008. Frequent targets of his commentaries included Huffington Post colleagues Deepak Chopra, Cenk Uygur, and Arianna Huffington.[10] Beginning on February 5, 2007, Gutfeld served as host of the late-night talk show Red Eye on the Fox News Channel. The hour-long show initially aired at 2:00 A.M. ET Monday through Saturday mornings and at 11:00 P.M. on Saturday evenings. However, beginning in October 2007, the show began airing at 3:00 A.M. Monday through Saturday mornings while retaining its 11:00 P.M timeslot on Saturday evenings. From 2007 to 2013, Bill Schulz served as Gutfeld's sidekick, and Andy Levy served as the show's ombudsman. Schulz had been Gutfeld's colleague at Stuff magazine, and Levy was a fellow blogger at The Huffington Post. On July 11, 2011, Gutfeld became a co-host and panelist on the Fox News political talk show The Five, which airs weekdays at 5:00 P.M. ET.[11] Gutfeld left Red Eye in February 2015, with Tom Shillue succeeding him as host of the program.[12] On May 31, 2015, Gutfeld began hosting a new weekly late-night talk show on Fox News called The Greg Gutfeld Show; which aired at 10:00 P.M. ET on Saturdays. In February 2021, it was announced that, beginning in the second quarter, the show would move to weeknights at 11:00 P.M. ET.[13] On March 10, 2021, it was announced that the new weeknight show would be called Gutfeld! and premiere on April 5.[14] In August 2021, Gutfeld! overtook The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in the nightly ratings, becoming the highest-rated late-night talk show in the United States. It averaged 2.12 million nightly viewers, more than The Late Show, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and Jimmy Kimmel Live!.[15] By the end of 2021, the combined viewership for Gutfeld! and The Five averaged over five million viewers.[16] Gutfeld has appeared as a guest on Coffee with Scott Adams[17][18] and The Adam Carolla Show.[19] In late 2021, Gutfeld was named the 12th-most influential person in American media by the Mediaite website.[16] During a Red Eye segment that aired on March 17, 2009, Gutfeld and his panel discussed Canadian Lieutenant General Andrew Leslie's statement that the Canadian Armed Forces may require a one-year \"synchronized break\" once Canada's mission in Afghanistan ended in 2011: \"Meaning, the Canadian military wants to take a breather to do some yoga, paint landscapes, run on the beach in gorgeous white Capri pants.\"[20] The comedian panelist Doug Benson added: \"I didn't even know they were in the war.... I thought that's where you go if you don't want to fight. Go chill in Canada.\"[20] Gutfeld also said: \"Isn't this the perfect time to invade this ridiculous country? They have no army!\"[20] The segment was posted to YouTube three days after the reported deaths of four Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan, prompting widespread outrage.[21][22][23] Canada had then been in command of the NATO mission in Kandahar Province, the birthplace and former capital of the Taliban, for three years.[24] Along with Helmand Province, it was \"home to some of the fiercest opposition to coalition forces\" and reported to \"have the highest casualty rates per province.\"[25] Canadian Defence Minister Peter MacKay called on Fox to apologize for the comments and described the remarks as \"despicable, hurtful and ignorant.\"[26] Gutfeld, while maintaining that the show is satirical and irreverent, offered the following apology: \"The March 17 episode of Red Eye included a segment discussing Canada's plan for a 'synchronized break,' which was in no way an attempt to make light of troop efforts. However, I realize that my words may have been misunderstood. It was not my intent to disrespect the brave men, women, and families of the Canadian military, and for that, I apologize.\"[26][27] After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Gutfeld said that the media were emotionally manipulating viewers with footage from the conflict \"...because that makes a profit for news companies.\"[28][29] Gutfeld was rebuked by Fox News foreign affairs correspondent Benjamin Hall who was on the ground in Kyiv: \"This is not the media trying to drum up some emotional response. This is absolutely what's happening.\"[28][29] A few days later, Hall was seriously injured, while Pierre Zakrzewski (who also works for Fox) and a Ukrainian journalist were killed, in a surprise attack on the journalists by Russian forces.[30] During the July 24, 2023, broadcast of The Five, Gutfeld and co-host Jessica Tarlov discussed an educational curriculum in Florida public schools that would teach students that \"slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit\".[31] Tarlov, who said she is Jewish, disagreed with the curriculum and asked if this could be argued for those who perished in the Holocaust. Gutfeld then invoked Viktor Frankl's book Man's Search For Meaning, implying that those who survived the Holocaust had to be skilled or useful.[31] On July 25, the Auschwitz Memorial disagreed with Gutfeld's statement, writing on Twitter: \"While it is true that some Jews may have used their skills or usefulness to increase their chances of survival during the Holocaust, it is essential to contextualize this statement properly and understand that it does not represent the complex history of the genocide perpetrated by Nazi Germany.\"[32] The same day, Andrew Bates, deputy White House press secretary, called Gutfeld's comments \"a horrid, dangerous, extreme lie that insults the memory of the millions of Americans who suffered from the evil of enslavement\".[33] The Daily Beast also reported that unnamed Fox News employees strongly disagreed with Gutfeld's statements. One producer stated it was \"a disgusting thing to say\" while another insider claimed \"his career would be over.\"[34] Gutfeld said that he voted by mail in the 2016 presidential election, but The Washington Post could find no evidence in voting records. Gutfeld thinks it is possible that he missed the official deadline.[16] As of 2018[update], Gutfeld resides in New York City with his Russian wife, Elena Moussa. He met the photo editor in London, where he lived for three years.[7][35][16] On December 10, 2024, on the Fox show The Five, it was announced that Gutfeld and his wife Elena had recently welcomed a baby girl into their family. [36] Gutfeld was raised Roman Catholic and served as an altar boy.[37] He describes himself as an \"agnostic atheist\".[35] A fan of hard rock and heavy metal music, Gutfeld has spoken on-air about being a fan of many bands, including Power Trip. Gutfeld paid tribute to Power Trip's singer Riley Gale after his death in 2020.[38] Members of the heavy band GWAR have appeared several times on his show.[39] Gutfeld is also a self-described libertarian.[40]",

                "content": "Manage your account TV host Greg Gutfeld‘s long absence from his shows has made viewers wonder if Fox has fired him. He is most popularly known for hosting political talk show, The Five, and his late-night comedy show, Gutfeld, which premieres on the network. However, in recent days, he hasn’t appeared on both shows, igniting speculations. So, here is a detailed article on whether or not Gutfeld is fired from Fox. As of now, Gutfeld hasn’t been fired from Fox’s The Five. The rumors about Gutfeld’s firing stemmed from his absence from The Five. Since then, many have wondered about his whereabouts and his potential return to the network. The show has continued to air on the network despite his absence, with his other co-hosts participating in conversations about social, political, and economic issues. However, it doesn’t appear that the host has bid adieu to Fox. He recently posted an update on X (formerly Twitter) about his comedy show, which also premieres on the network, announcing the latest guests on it. It seems like he’s just on a brief hiatus and would be returning to The Five sooner. However, the reason behind his absence is not known. Nevertheless, Fox doesn’t seem to have fired him. If that happens to be the case, he or the network would likely have released an official statement. Following his absence, many have speculated the cause behind his absence from the shows. Viewers assumed that he might have taken some time off from his work to focus on his mental health. Some also believed that he might be absent due to some illness. But given that there has been no media coverage of him being sick in recent times, this possibility seems unlikely. At the time of writing, it remains unclear when Gutfeld is about to return. However, he might join The Five before Christmas or in the new year. The post No, Greg Gutfeld Has Not Been Fired From Fox’s The Five: Absence Explained appeared first on ComingSoon.net - Movie Trailers, TV & Streaming News, and More.",

The voice cast includes Arnold Schwarzenegger, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Kevin Hart, Laura Bailey, Heaven Hart, Keanu Reeves, Gabriel Luna, Ariana Greenblatt, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Michael Beach, Emily Swallow, and Claudia Doumit. The series was ordered by Amazon in August 2024 and was first revealed at Gamescom that month. It was released worldwide on December 10, 2024. The series consists of fifteen animated, standalone short stories based on the following video games and franchises:[1][2][3][4] Secret Level was created by Tim Miller, who executive produces at his company Blur Studio. Blur Studio serves as a production company along with Amazon MGM Studios. Dave Wilson serves as executive producer and supervising director. The series was ordered by Amazon Prime Video on August 14, 2024.[5] The series was announced during Gamescom on August 20, 2024. A trailer was released at the event, which featured segments from each of the episodes.[1][7] The pilot who features in the Armored Core episode was the subject of media attention and speculation due to his resemblance to actor Keanu Reeves.[8][9] Though Prime Video declined to disclose casting information at the time of the announcement, ComicBook.com reported an influx of \"nearly nothing but replies about Reeves and his potential appearance in [the series]\" under a post by Armored Core's social media account.[10] IGN's Wesley Yin-Poole said that were it not really Reeves, the actor could claim a royalty payment due to the certainty of the character's likeness to his.[11] GamesRadar+'s Ali Jones remarked that while the shot could have been \"simply be an ethnically ambiguous man with similar facial hair\", they noted the likeness, and doubted that Armored Core would place the image so prominently on their social media account if it were \"just some random actor\" and not Reeves.[12] In October 2024 Reeves's casting was officially revealed alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Kevin Hart, Heaven Hart, Gabriel Luna, Ariana Greenblatt, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Michael Beach, Emily Swallow, and Claudia Doumit.[6] The series premiered worldwide on December 10, 2024.[13] Half of the episodes were released for the premiere, and the other half releases on December 17, 2024.[6] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Secret Level has an approval rating of 67% based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 6.0/10.[14] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 50 out of 100 based on 8 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[15]",

                "content": "Taylor Lorenz is an American journalist who writes the Substack publication \"User Mag\". She was previously a columnist for The Washington Post, a technology reporter for The New York Times, The Daily Beast, and Business Insider, and social media editor for the Daily Mail. She is particularly known for covering Internet culture. In 2023, she published a book called Extremely Online: The Untold Story of Fame, Influence, and Power on the Internet. In 2024, she was a podcaster for Vox Media, hosting a show called Power User. Lorenz was born in New York City[1] and grew up in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, attending nearby Greenwich High School.[2] She attended college at the University of Colorado Boulder and later transferred to Hobart and William Smith Colleges, where she graduated with a degree in political science.[3][4] Lorenz has said that the social media site Tumblr caused her to become interested in Internet culture.[5] According to The Caret, Lorenz's reporting frequently concerns \"Silicon Valley venture capitalists, marketers and ... anyone curious about how the internet is shaping the ways in which humans express themselves and communicate\".[6] Fortune named her to its \"40 Under 40\" list in 2020, saying that she has \"cemented herself as a peerless authority\" whose name became \"synonymous with youth culture online\" during her time at The Daily Beast and The Atlantic.[7] The same year, Adweek included her on its list of \"Young Influentials Who Are Shaping Media, Marketing and Tech\", saying that she \"contextualizes the internet as we live it\".[8] Reason magazine credited her with popularizing the term \"OK boomer\" in a story declaring \"the end of friendly generational relations\".[9] According to TheWrap, \"since her time at the Times, she's attracted an inordinate amount of online criticism, particularly from those in the right-wing media\".[10] Lorenz worked as a social media editor for the Daily Mail from 2011 to 2014, becoming its head of social media.[11] After a short stint writing for The Daily Dot in 2014,[12] she was a technology reporter for Business Insider from 2014 to 2017.[13] In 2017, she wrote briefly for The Hill's blog section,[14][15] and was assaulted by a counter-protester[16] while covering the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.[17] From 2017 to 2018, she worked as a technology reporter for The Daily Beast.[18] In 2019, she was a visiting fellow at Harvard University's Nieman Foundation for Journalism.[19] From 2019 to 2022, she was a technology reporter for The New York Times.[20] In March 2022, Lorenz left the Times and joined The Washington Post as a columnist.[3][21] In April 2022, Lorenz wrote an article for the Post that publicized the identity of Chaya Raichik as the owner of the far-right Twitter account Libs of TikTok. The details were retrieved from early iterations of the account[22] as well as previous reporting.[23] In attempt to discredit the article and Lorenz herself,[23][24] Raichik attacked Lorenz, claiming that Lorenz doxxed her.[25][26] According to The Times of London, \"supporters of Lorenz meanwhile pointed out that Raichik's followers were only too enthusiastic about doxing when it came to teachers being smeared as paedophiles\".[27] In a tweet, Lorenz said that her \"whole family was doxed again this morning ... trolls have now moved on to doxing and stalking any random friends I've tagged on Instagram\".[28] Lorenz later interviewed Raichik for an article about Libs of TikTok in February 2024.[29] In June 2022, the Post published an article by Lorenz about the eco-system of online content creators and influencers covering the Depp v. Heard trial. The article incorrectly said that two YouTubers mentioned in passing in the article had been contacted for comment, when the Post later reported that only one had been before publication,[30] though this is disputed by both YouTubers.[31] Ultimately, after editorial corrections were made, the Editor's Note on the article acknowledged that only one of the creators had been contacted before publication, and that stealth editing had occurred against the paper's policy, however Lorenz did not make the stealth edit. In a tweet thread agreed upon by Lorenz, her editors, and Post management, Lorenz stated that the errors were due to a miscommunication with her editor.[10][32][33] In August 2024, The Washington Post began an internal investigation for evidence of bias after Lorenz shared an image on a private Instagram story depicting President Joe Biden with the caption \"war criminal :(\", referencing a meme.[34] Lorenz initially denied making the post, and later said that a friend created the captioned picture, which Lorenz shared. According to NPR, four people with direct knowledge of the post confirmed its authenticity.[35] Lorenz never published another article for The Post, which did not announce its findings, and in October 2024, left the paper to focus on her own ventures.[36][34] In February 2024, it was announced that Lorenz would be launching a podcast with Vox Media called Power User.[37] In December 2024, it was announced that her distribution partnership would not be renewed.[38] Lorenz left The Washington Post in October 2024 to start her own Substack publication called \"User Mag\". Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie told The Hollywood Reporter that she is an \"accomplished reporter with deep experience covering internet trends and culture\" whom the platform thinks \"will thrive...with the direct support of her audience.\"[39] In October 2023, her book Extremely Online: The Untold Story of Fame, Influence, and Power on the Internet was published by Simon & Schuster.[40] Lorenz has been the subject of online harassment, often used as a tactic to attempt to discredit her reporting and skills as a journalist.[24] The harassment has included graphic rape threats, death threats, and even threats against her parents and other family members, some of them children.[41] Some of the harassment that has targeted Lorenz has been coordinated, often boosted by right wing media personalities, such as Tucker Carlson.[42][43] The online harassment has spilled over into the physical world as well. Lorenz has been stalked,[24] and in 2022 \"a man who had been live-streaming violent threats about her turned up,\" at a conference she was speaking at, necessitating her to \"be escorted to safety\".[44] Furthermore, both she and her parents have been the victims of swatting.[44] In December 2022, Twitter owner Elon Musk temporarily suspended Lorenz's Twitter account, with Musk tweeting that the suspension was for \"prior doxxing action\".[45] Lorenz said she was suspended after asking Musk for comment on a story. The suspension followed a series of suspensions of journalists under Musk's new ownership of Twitter.[46] Lorenz announced her engagement to Christopher Mims, a technology columnist at The Wall Street Journal, in January 2015.[47] She identified herself as a vegan in 2022.[48] She has said in interviews that she is immunocompromised.[49]",

                "content": "Welcome to the Urgent Futures podcast! This podcast tries to clarify the chaos, from culture to the cosmos. Each episode, I sit down with leading thinkers for big idea dialogues about the research, concepts, and questions that animate their approaches to reality. 🎥 YouTube: 🎧 Apple Podcasts | Spotify Taylor Lorenz is a technology columnist for The Washington Post's business section covering online culture and the content creator industry. She was previously a technology reporter for The New York Times business section, The Atlantic, and The Daily Beast. Her writing has appeared in New York magazine, Rolling Stone, Outside magazine, and more. She frequently appears on NBC, CNN, MSNBC, CBS, and the BBC. She was a 2019 Knight Visiting Nieman Fellow at Harvard University and is a former affiliate at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. More bio information can be found here. Taylor's work hits one of the main goals I have in doing a podcast in the first place. I started Reality Studies because, over the past few years, I realized that a lot of us were asking variations of the same question: What happened to reality? And of course follow-ups of how and why did it get so weird? Are we living in a simulation? So I started researching these questions and even if I wasn't going to be able to answer them I wanted deeper context for them. I've written about some of the fruits of this research in the newsletter, but the podcast is a place to spotlight the folks who are doing the critical work of identifying and translating cultural shifts. Taylor epitomizes this. For years, she's been finding the niche corners of the internet and tech culture that the rest of mainstream media isn't taking seriously or outright dismissing. Her stories have documented how the commodification of attention has brought about new power structures, new economies, new creative ecosystems, new celebrities, and her book, Extremely Online, is out next week (Oct. 3). With Extremely Online, Taylor looks back more than 20 years to the early aughts to the days when bloggers first began to reshape our understandings of media, all the way through the present moment, when TikTok has become a medium for activists and political speech. Like her reporting, the book sidesteps the conventional hero narratives of Silicon Valley giants, instead foregrounding the stories of platform users and lesser-known innovators whose contributions have had deep impacts on our lives—which are now, of course, extremely online. Jesse Damiani: Taylor, thank you for being on the Reality Studies Podcast. Taylor Lorenz: Thanks for having me. JD: I'm really excited to talk about Extremely Online with you today. And the first thing that comes to mind with this book is a structural question. The history unfolds across a series of precedents that seem kind of obvious in hindsight—like the fact that YouTubers would need agents and security and sort of be treated like regular celebrities—but that wasn't necessarily clear early in the trajectory of creator culture. So these were like social experiments that were occurring in real time. What have you learned about creator culture in mapping these precedent-setting moments? TL: Yeah, well, one thing I learned is that the media is always kind of wrong and behind. It was funny to go back and read mainstream media news articles about the Internet and, literally I would say for the past 25 years they have downplayed it and minimized it every step of the way—not even just about creator culture but sort of everything and it was just interesting to reread it and just be like, God, time and time again, they keep getting it wrong, or they misread why something is compelling. I found actually that the most useful kind of coverage of that industry when I was doing my research was just not the mainstream media, it was more like blogs or some digital media and just kind of individual people that just wrote a lot about the times. It was interesting also how the industry evolved; it used to be very platform-specific. I write about this in the book, but, after Vine died, you see this era of multi-platform creators. So it's just interesting how one little event could have ripple effects across the industry. JD: My first real entry into social media was MySpace—and when I was reading this and seeing the different waves and the different ways that different companies either succeeded or didn't, I wondered: do you think these events were preordained to happen the way that they did? Or were they the type of things that were just circumstantial and we could have lived in a world where MySpace would have been the main player in the social media game? TL: I think, you know, so much of it’s about timing. I think MySpace was so ahead of its time. This is another trend that I saw in writing is that there were these people who were so early, and actually saw the future before anybody else. I think MySpace's vision of the future and how they talked about entertainment and media is 100% basically the way TikTok talks about it now—MySpace had MySpace TV but it was still very web-based back then. They were thinking about social media how it would be thought about in 15 years, but they were trying to build it at this time when being online itself was still very stigmatized and weird and people didn't necessarily want to add a lot of friends online; that wasn’t the norm yet outside of teenagers and people our age who thought it was cool. The technology itself and the social norms had to change for the right products to take off. I would say it’s 50% right place-right time, because there were a lot of people I think would’ve been very successful if they had just been a little bit later. JD: One thing that we take for granted now is this (very contested) notion of cancel culture, but you referenced this early moment from 2002 with the ‘Internet's First Scalp.’ I'd love if you could share what happened there and what you see it communicating about this clash between old and new media formats. TL: Yeah, I talk about Josh Marshall, who was an early political blogger. He worked at the American Prospect by day, but he would blog by night at Talking Points Memo, which is now actually his independent media company. It was a birthday party for Strom Thurmond. There was a toast given by Senate Majority Leader at the time, Trent Lott, who basically made a bunch of praise for some of the worst of Strom Thurmond's ideologies and seemed to support segregation. And this was something that went over the heads of a lot of inside political writers in the mainstream media, who kind of ignored those comments and just wrote a quick item about the birthday celebration. But Josh noticed that comment, he pulled it out, and he did what bloggers do best, which is do like 20 posts on it, and relentlessly cover it until Trent Lott was forced to resign. The New York Post ran a headline that was titled, “The Internet’s First Scalp,” and it was about how people on the Internet, specifically bloggers and Josh Marshall were able to get Trent Lott kicked out of office. There were so many examples of things like this, actually, I really just liked that headline—and because it affected our entire political landscape. But you saw these little moments time and time again of the insurgent power of people online to have real meaningful change and to circumvent the mainstream media and up-end politics, fashion, sports, you name it. JD: This history really looks at the past two decades, and this period is this crucible in which social media is forged. There are countless instances where the “old guard” has totally dismissed or tried to bypass social media platforms and practices. Toward the end of the book, for example, you reference venture capitalists trying to use their positions with startups like Clubhouse to burnish their own brands as influencers, but then Clubhouse didn't necessarily find the success that they were hoping for. Has this dynamic just repeated itself again and again, or have you found that the old guard ever gets savvier? TL: Yeah, it's very funny because I think venture capitalists learn that you cannot force specific people to be popular on your platform, which Elon is learning today. You can try to force-feed these people down other people's throats and you're going to lose users that way. Clubhouse found that out the hard way. My book ends a couple years into the pandemic, that's when everyone was really forced, obviously, to all be extremely online, and that's when a lot of institutional powers were forced to take it seriously, because suddenly everyone was online. And they were like, “Wait a minute, what's happening over here? This world we've ignored for literally 20 years…maybe there's something here.” So you saw VCs pour money into the dumbest startups alive, to be honest, because they had ignored it for decades, and then they were funding things that nobody wanted or needed—also there's already this robust half a trillion dollar industry that they just ignored. I was talking to a friend of mine who's a VC, and she read the book as well, and she's like, “Not all VCs,” and it's true, like The Chernin Group invested in Barstool Sports early and a bunch of other creator-driven media companies—but they're not generally the Silicon Valley tech VCs, who are notorious for coming in at the last minute and trying to make money off something they have no idea about. I think they’re all in AI world right now. So it was just kind of funny to see they had missed the boat on that so badly, because the ones that did get into it in 2010, or even 2007, and recognized this stuff early, they made a lot of money. In terms of traditional media: I work in traditional media and I can tell you they absolutely do not get it at all. I think they've tried a little bit more and they recognize that they have to use the internet. There are people within these institutions that are brilliant and amazing; it's not really the workers, it's the management that sort of is just very slow to sort of grasp that it’s not the nineties and they don't control the media. The media is the internet now. The media is not the New York Times and The Washington Post—for good or bad. There's a lot of pluses and minuses to that. [MySpace was] thinking about social media how it would be thought about in 15 years, but they were trying to build it at this time when being online itself was still very stigmatized and weird … a lot of people I think would’ve been very successful if they had just been a little bit later. JD: Would you be willing to share a little bit more about like, you're somebody who kind of dances across both of these worlds, like, when you're thinking about your work of covering creator culture, and in some ways, sort of adopting creator tactics, while also being somebody who's a columnist at, I mean, your pedigree is all these major media organizations. How are you thinking about that, that balance? TL: Yeah, I am very much from the internet and I always sort of care about the internet more than I care about traditional media. But working in traditional media has been so interesting, because I've really seen why they can’t catch up. I used to write a lot of really negative things about the mainstream media when I was a blogger, and now that I work in it, I have a lot more empathy for it, for the people inside of it. Again, it's generally not the reporters. It's this management level; it's the same as in Congress. Our whole country is like run by this gerontocracy that refuses to give up power and is not with the times, and that's true for media, it's true for politics, it's true for literally name any industry—so I think there has to be some turnover before anything really changes. JD: So you referenced blogging. One thing I was really struck by early in the book that I maybe peripherally understood, but you bring into focus, is the impact of “mommy bloggers.” Your book is chronicling the commoditization of attention as power and mommy bloggers are this first kind of, I don't know, flashpoint in that trajectory. Could you share a little bit about the role that mommy bloggers have played? TL: Yeah, I would say they were like literal mothers to this whole industry. It's kind of crazy. I think a lot of people think of the creator industry as like YouTubers, or beginning with YouTubers, and that's not true. It really began with bloggers and specifically mommy bloggers, because mommy bloggers—which itself is this very fraught term that some women came to embrace and a lot of other women felt was deeply misogynistic—they dealt with so much misogyny and hate for what they were doing. But as I mentioned, there were these other bloggers, especially in tech and politics, that were getting lauded and able to get attention online, people like Josh Marshall. And then you had moms, a lot of mothers, basically a whole generation of Gen X mothers that were shut out of the workplace and turned to blogging to express themselves. They were the first to build a personal brand online and then monetize it. And they were just brutalized for it. People were just so angry that mothers would make money online. It was like this notion that motherhood was so sacred and like, ‘How could you monetize your life as a mother?’ They were attacked as being attention seekers. Like, ‘Why do you have to blog about your life?’ You know, ‘Why aren't you just happy at home? You should be cooking for your children, why are you on the Internet?’ The thing is, the Internet was such a lifeline for these mothers because motherhood is incredibly isolating and women's media at the time was deeply misogynist. I went back and read so much women's media from the ‘90s and Aughts for this book and it was just disgusting. It's actually like bizarre; stuff from 2005 reads like it’s from the 1950s. Mommy bloggers were the ones that normalized things like postpartum depression, and, you know, not always loving your kids, and just having a hard time, struggling, coping with addiction, turning to wine during playtime to make it through, hating your husband—just all these taboo topics that had never really been expressed in traditional media, mothers were able to go online and talk about and then make money, supporting themselves through it. So it was just really liberating and fascinating. JD: And you reference some highly visible misogynistic moments, like with Julia Allison and other women throughout the book, which is a parallel stream to women and femmes being the ones who often were the innovators of particular cultural and social practices. Can you talk a little bit more about that dynamic? TL: Yeah, this whole industry was built primarily by women and then secondarily other people that were basically marginalized, a lot of LGBTQ people, people of color, just people that would have never ended up in mainstream media. That's who fostered this whole blogging ecosystem and then really used the Internet very early to monetize. I don't get it into it in my book because it was so niche and separate from this main industry, but sex workers were also really early adopters of the internet and online monetization. I talk about that later with OnlyFans, which I think was the first true creator-driven sex work platform. But yeah, it was just all women and people were obviously livid at it because I think since the beginning there's just been this deep misogyny against women and women's work and women's role in society. JD: You also brought up BIPOC creators; 2020 was this big year of reckoning around systemic oppression broadly, but within the creator subsection it was also a moment of reckoning around people of color being exploited and extracted from in social media platforms. Could you A) describe that for listeners, and then B) I'm curious what you've observed, you know, it's been three years now, what movement or not you’ve seen on that front? TL: Throughout the Aughts and 2010s, you had a lot of viral moments coming from people of color, I talk about Tay Zonday, Adam Bahner, in my book, who wrote the “Chocolate Rain” song, and there's Peaches Monroee, who created the phrase “on fleek,” and so many vines specifically, there was just a lot of obviously, culture, created from those communities. And then in 2020, obviously, there was this big reckoning and people started to talk about credit and ownership. I talk about Jalaiah Harmon, who made the “Renegade” dance, who was a story that I wrote about this 14 year old that made one of the biggest dances on the internet and also never got credit until we wrote the story for the New York Times, basically. And so, there was this moment when people started to go like, “Oh, actually we should pay these people.” Unfortunately, as with every other bit of progress that was made in 2020, it flipped back very hard the other way. And now almost no one cares—there’s no discussion of it at brands. I saw a chart released by some company recently where they show spending on creators of color has gone down from pre-2020 levels. So they're in sort of a worse position than they were previously. I think unfortunately that's just the case with all the social progress that was made in 2020. I've talked to people about why this is, and it’s because, for so many reasons, but there was no sustained pressure. Nobody wanted to make systemic change. A lot of people wanted to talk about it because it was trendy at the time, but nobody actually wanted to change the system. So we have a worse system now, which sucks. The reason I end the book where I do, which is in 2022-ish, is because I think that was the end of a certain chapter of social media. JD: Related to that, another thing that really emerged in 2020 was TikTok as a vector for political communication, both from politicians externally, but more predominantly people spreading political messaging and fostering information ecosystems. When you bring up progress, how are you feeling as we're heading into another election year, with TikTok as strong as it ever was and more vehicles for video-based messaging? TL: TikTok has always been such a really important platform for activism and activists, especially youth activism, young people who want social change have leveraged TikTok very effectively. I think that's why you see all these Republicans embracing it—Vivek Ramaswamy was out with Jake Paul on TikTok the other day—so it's just going to play a bigger and bigger role in our political system because it's the default social network for millions of young people. I always describe TikTok as a combination of Twitter and YouTube, where there was all this like academia and like political discussion and actually a lot of smart people and journalists and stuff. Actually, not as many journalists as Twitter, but you know, there's enough like media on there—and then also with YouTube culture where it's very video based. Commentary culture is really huge on TikTok. So I think it’s just going to play a bigger and bigger role in our election cycles. Not the platform itself. People like to think that it's being programmed by China or something. It's not, or there's absolutely no evidence of that. I just mean people leveraging the platform, activists and people leveraging the platform to get the word out about whatever they're trying to talk about. JD: So this is not in the book, but, just to piggyback off that question, because I've seen you speak about this elsewhere and I'd love to discuss it with you. There's a lot of geopolitical positioning around TikTok in particular. What do you make of that relative to the sort of Western tech giants? Yeah, it's so hilarious to listen to these people talk about TikTok as if it's the greatest threat when we have Facebook here in our own country. They're worried that TikTok could potentially, you know, disrupt an election, when we have actual evidence that Facebook has done that many, many times. They're worried that Tiktok could like, lead people to violence when we have so many examples of Facebook facilitating genocide in other countries. It's like all of the stuff that they're accusing that TikTok might do, that there's no evidence TikTok has actually done or facilitated, we have overwhelming with so many examples of Facebook actually doing those things and actually facilitating those things. So it's just like, ‘Oh, but it's fine because it's America.” Also, by the way, the whole data privacy thing is such a farce. If they cared about data privacy, they would pass comprehensive data privacy reform. But if you shut down TikTok tomorrow, first of all there's still so many other Chinese apps and gaming, which is the bigger form of entertainment than anything else and is like half-owned by Chinese companies. So I can't even get into that, but like, also: China could buy our data from a third-party Facebook vendor. We have no data privacy. So if you're actually caring about data privacy to the extent that you want to shut down an app, make such an unprecedented decision, then you should actually pass a lot more comprehensive data privacy reform before anything like that ever even happens. But of course, they don't want to do that. They just want to make a political bogeyman. And it is this place for young progressive activism, that's why you see the Republicans and right-wing parties wanting to shut it down, because it's a place where young people congregate and push a lot of progressive ideology. JD: You prompted me to think about that report from the Wall Street Journal about Facebook knowing that Instagram was detrimental to adolescent women's mental health. And mental health comes up in Extremely Online as well, with this metrics game-the-algorithm culture, which I think would have felt really foreign if you'd rewound to the nineties and talked to the techno-utopians and said, “People are going to feel so strung out because they're running on this hamster wheel, and that's one of the primary effects of these platforms.” Could you share a little bit about, some of what's happened relative to mental health on these platforms and among creator communities? TL: These platforms basically put their creators, as you said, on a treadmill. There's no off-ramp. Being a creator is incredibly, incredibly difficult and there's almost no respect for it. There's no like institutional respect in the sense that we don't have a social safety net in this country at all. So these, these people are essentially independent contractors for these companies, but they have no benefits. They have no support. They can't take a week off without losing followers, losing money. So it's a very hard job. And it of course affects mental health and social media. I think making metrics public was the original sin of social media. It's so negative because it puts this social pressure on everyone to like, make sure you get that extra like, or make sure you get an extra hit, a certain follower numbers, because that says something about your social value. It's just very toxic. And I don't think that the Internet is inherently toxic, or the fact that it facilitates connection, the notion of social technology, I think is not toxic. We should be more connected. I hate this idea of like, “Oh, you just have to log off and the more you log off, the more mentally healthy you are.” I think you can spend literally 24/7 online. It's just that the way that we use the Internet and most of the platforms that we're forced to rely on right now are these really predatory ones. I wish that wasn't the case, I wish we had a much better social media landscape. But I hate that the the focus is on logging off. It's like, don't tell everyone to stop logging on. Tell everyone to like, let's build better systems to facilitate better connection. Because people's lives aren't inherently better when they log off either. JD: Yeah, it's often discounted that this is a whole architecture of power. It's a driver of the entire global economy now. And you sort of make the point, like, even if you're not part of any, platform you'll still be in other people's photos, your footprint is still traveling around these platforms. I'd love to talk a little bit about fandom with you. It's funny for me as a millennial, I feel like I grew up with all these platforms, and I had varying degrees of connection to them and to what was going on. I saw this stuff happening in the background, but it was kind of in the background of my everyday life. One service that I think this book provides is it really contextualizes things and gives you this 20 year history with the flashpoint moments to engage with. One thread that I saw evolving throughout is this idea of fandom. Can you describe how you've seen fandom evolve and maybe some moments, like some of the tours, that rendered visible how different, creator culture was? Or rather, how much more social capital being a creator had than people originally realized? TL: Creators were building these fandoms online, but they were very segregated to the internet, right? People that didn't spend time online could sort of write it off, they didn't have visibility into those fandoms because they weren't spending time online. They didn't see it. So once things started to really manifest in the real world was when people started to notice. I talk about this early Vine meet up, that a bunch of Vine creators had in Central Park, and that being kind of a moment. It used to be creators meeting up with each other. There were things like the 777 Meetup on July 7th, 2007 in Washington Square Park, where a bunch of YouTubers met up. But at that time, like in, I would say 2010 and earlier, it was more about like YouTubers meeting up with each other. Even the first VidCon was still very much like YouTubers meeting up with each other, but I would say that actually the first VidCon was also this turning point because there were fans, but it was very early fandom and they had full access to the creators. There wasn't this strong delineation between who was a creator and who was a fan. It really wasn't until kind of like 2013, 2014, 2015, when you started to see these real fandoms emerge, that's when you saw tours. You had content creators going on mall tours. Companies like Buca di Beppo even had a content creator tour. That was my favorite example because I found all their signage for it and it was so funny. Like, “Hey, look, we have like Internet stars at book Buca di Beppo, come to Buca di Beppo!” Like, what? But they were trying to capitalize on this like youth fandom. Obviously Magcon, if you guys haven't watched Chasing Cameron on Netflix, it's such a time capsule. It's a documentary about Magcon from like 2015 or 2016. Magcon was one of the original influencer tourists, it stands for “meet and greet.” So yeah, you started to see fandom manifest IRL. And then now I think all the platforms are so big and everyone is online that it's very clear who has fans; like you see the fandom. It's become more pervasive and recognized. It used to be like, “Oh, those are just like internet fans,” and now it’s like, “Oh, it’s all the same.” [Misogyny] was such a through line in reporting this book: all these incredible women who have been driven off the internet by hate. JD: I remember when BeReal was having its moment in the sun, there was a lot of talk about how it was somehow not playing into some of these more complicated threads of social media. What are you thoughts on that? Do you see any other glimmers that social media is shifting toward less rankings or gamified examples, or is it really just doubling down? TL: I would say mostly it's doubling down, but yeah, there's a lot of small viral apps that haven't proven to have staying power, but they sort of tap into something. BeReal’s an example of that. The reason I end the book where I do, which is in 2022-ish, is because I think that was the end of a certain chapter of social media. As the pandemic has pushed everyone online, especially in 2020, I think there's a level of exhaustion. I think people today are starting to value privacy more. We've gone so far where like, we are in this mass surveillance culture where everyone just records everyone else. You know, “Oh, I see something crazy. I'm going to record it because that could be a viral moment online, because we all understand that that's a commodity now.” I think that's why you see people actually wanting to use these smaller platforms like BeReal where it's more contained or like group chat or Discord or places where you're not default sharing everything publicly and permanently. That era of social media, it's a little bit over. It's not really novel to like, have every thought be public. I think if you want to reach everyone, you can post on these platforms, but it's more about reaching who you want to. Even TikTok is more about reaching who you want to than Instagram, Twitter, or YouTube, because the algorithm segments you and you trust that it will deliver your content to the relevant audience. Whereas all these other problems you're posting publicly and you have to build your own subscribers and it's a lot of burden on the user. JD: Do you see part of where you chose to draw this line around 2022ish correlating it all to Gen Z officially being the “it” generation or are those two things incidental to each other? TL: I think 2017 was the moment that Gen Z became the “it” generation. I wrote a piece that year actually about Gen Z consultants and how consulting for Gen Z stuff was taking off. That's when brands really started to flip and target Gen Z. So I think we're actually more in the middle of Gen Z; it's more just like average people have all gotten very online. The pandemic accelerated a lot of change that was happening, but now we're there. Everyone has an online footprint. Everyone's online. It's not just the kids. It's affecting politics, sports, fashion, entertainment—every single aspect of our culture is so shaped and driven by the Internet now. And so I wanted to end it there because I felt like we had reached that point. It was less about a specific generation maturing. I did see some marketing report about Gen Alpha recently and I was like, “Are we even thinking about that already?” Like there's so many generations. One other thing that I thought was notable or kind of changed my own perception is I think as a millennial—I'm with you. I'm like smack—dab, like true millennial millennial. I had always thought that millennials were the first generation to really leverage the internet and grow up on social media, which is sort of true, but actually all those early bloggers were Gen X—like those mommy bloggers were Gen X—and even Keemstar or Ethan Klein at H3H3, like these big YouTubers, are Gen X. A lot of them are a little bit older than we think. The Internet is thought of as this thing that's driven by young people. I mean, Jeffree Star is Gen X! So many Gen Xers actually have shaped the Internet. And I think they deserve more credit. I know people say that they're always an overlooked generation, and I think their contributions to the Internet have been overlooked. I know they're cringy online sometimes, but they really did a lot. JD: My partner's son is a Gen Alpha and there's definitely a sense that like, no matter how cool I would ever want to try to be on the internet, that I'm always going to be cringe. So I think there's this generational thing where you sort of reject whatever the previous generation did—and I wonder how long that lasts too. Because as you're describing, Gen X bust down the walls, millennials are much more platform-oriented, and now there's this proliferation of platforms, but then how different does that become in the future? That depends on a lot of factors in terms of technology and other things that are out of our ability to accurately forecast. Thinking about your rolein this: you kind of defined the digital culture beat. It wasn't something people took seriously, before you. And now there's a whole crop of people who cite you as their main influence in this type of coverage. This being your first big book, can you talk me through a little bit of the creative process and decision-making process in picking what pieces of this puzzle to highlight? Because in some ways, there are inevitably holes, because there were so few people even covering it in the first place—so even going back to the historical work I assume was pretty complicated. TL: Yeah, it was really hard. From 2009-on, that's when I was writing and covering things. I lived through this and I have sources, so it was easy. What was very hard was the Aughts. I would say shout out to Todd Spangler at Variety. I don't know that I could have written this book without Todd's writing. He deserves more credit. I should have given him acknowledgement; I gave it to a lot of women, but like there were these writers. Josh Constine at TechCrunch was another one. They ended up covering a lot of this stuff really early and really well, on digital media sites generally. But yeah, the Aughts were what was really hard. I had to go back and just interview so many people. I have interviewed hundreds of people for the book, but there was a lot of what I've learned now is called link rot—which actually happened to me; my earliest, my first bylines are not even on the internet anymore because the websites I wrote for were like bought and defunct or pivoted or whatever. I could have never written this book without the Internet Archive. Like the internet archive is such an important resource. It's so funny because Elon Musk was saying that my family owned it or something a while ago, and the founder was like, “We don't know her and we don't claim her,” But they deserve all the money in the world because the work that they're doing to preserve websites and old pieces of media is just really important because I was relying on that heavily. I opened with this story about this blog called Socialite Rank; if that wasn't completely preserved on the Internet Archive, we would not have a historical record of it. We would have, like, maybe a New York magazine article that was written after the fact that was sort of a short piece that didn't cover everything. It's just so important to have that source material. I'll say one other thing. I'm just so glad that there's more writers now. There's not even nearly enough. I mean, there's more reporters covering Facebook—just Facebook as a company—than there are Internet culture reporters. And I think that says so much about how we view tech reporting. I wish that we had like 50 more reporters on this beat. JD: Why do you think there's resistance? When I look at your work and when I look at Kat Tenbarge’s work, Katie Notopoulos’s work, I'm assuming highly trafficked stories. It's not as if these are not proving themselves out in the metrics. What do you think the resistance is in terms of staffing appropriately to cover these stories? TL: It’s what comes with it. The attention that the attention is the problem. Every major story I do goes viral because I'm writing about huge personalities. I'm writing about people usually with millions of followers that are going to respond. I'm writing about things that everyone's talking about or has strong opinions on or that's trending or whatever. If you do the job well, you are in their world, right? You are in this content creator universe where it's crazy. You're operating in this new media ecosystem that's an attention driven ecosystem that's been weaponized by the worst people in the world. So you as a media company need to stand by your reporters. This is why the New York Times—no offense—doesn't do internet culture reporting well, because they're not willing to go into those spaces and truly cover them. You have a couple of reporters that might dip in one, you know, now and then, but they don't have anybody actually covering it. That's why they cover everything like two months too late. I will say though, Jessica Roy is very good and she's been writing for them lately, and she's extremely with it, and Joe Bernstein as well, but I think it's so funny that those two writers are on the style section. That just shows how they view it, like, “Oh, it's this silly little thing over here. It's not like a core thing that's upending everything in our political landscape and economy.” I think it's just so hard for traditional media. They're very scared of the Internet. They're very scared of it and they don't know how to react when when attention is driven their way. And they don't they don't know what to do, and the reporters themselves are often driven out of the industry. I can think of three women right now who are phenomenal, phenomenal reporters who were driven out of the industry—off of this beat specifically—because of online harassment and hate and doxing and crazy shit that they've had to deal with. So you also have to be really good at dealing with that. And I would say, I started in this world in 2009, and I feel like—what is the metaphor of the boiling frog? Like, everything that happened to me with, like, writing about Libs of TikTok, I was like, Jake Paul fans have done this to me years before. I'm old enough too where it doesn't affect my life as much, but these young reporters, they're even more online. Their lives are even more mediated by the Internet. It's very hard for them. And if they don't have institutional support they can't do their job. JD: I'm remembering this moment where, I think it was either right before or right after you had departed New York Times, there was this public exchange with Maggie Haberman that I found to be really telling. And it's not necessarily age or generational, because of course, as you sort of pointed out, there are very savvy and thoughtful, older reporters—but it was kind of an older sensibility about how a reporter is supposed to comport themselves and the certain types of objectivity they're supposed to maintain, and the persona— TL: It wasn't about objectivity, though, it was about having a personal brand. First of all, I don't believe in objectivity. It's a lie. And I think Wes Lowery has written excellent pieces dismantling that notion. But yeah. I had said in an interview—actually, I was asked the question about journalists having personal brands—and I was like, yes, journalists have to have personal brands, especially on the internet these days. It's a very talent driven industry. And Maggie, who had of course 1.7 million followers, and I would say almost no one is more of a personal brand than her, especially during the Trump administration, came after me for it and said that I was an attention-seeker and all this negative stuff. I just thought that was hilarious because, look in the mirror, what are you talking about? You are a perfect example of this. You have 1. 7 million Twitter followers; don't talk to me about personal brands. But I think as you said, it's this old-school notion—she didn't have to build her personal brand. She didn't have to do any of that because she relied on the platform of the institution. Now institutions don't have power. And if you want to survive in this landscape where we're all getting laid off 24/7, which any millennial that worked in digital media or any Gen Z person can relate to, you do actually have to have a brand on the Internet. I don't think that that's necessarily a great thing because I think there's a lot of amazing reporters that don't want to cultivate it necessarily. I talked to a friend who's actually still at the New York Times, a phenomenal investigative reporter, and he's like, “Yeah, even I have to have a personal brand. That doesn't mean that I'm on TikTok, but I'm known as this investigator and I have to be really careful to cultivate this personality around that and cultivate my image around it. You have to do that just to operate—media has always been this way. Look at Anderson Cooper. Look at Barbara Walters. Look at like any big journalist, Woodward and Bernstein, right? It's a talent business. So yes, unfortunately we have to have brands. And we all have to have brands, by the way. JD: Yeah I was very surprised to see that as well. And just building on that, do you have a heuristic or a set of boundaries in your mind for how a reporter can maintain a certain degree of reliability and authenticity with audience that you are attempting to cover something in a fair and balanced way (not in the weaponized sense)? In terms of having a brand that participates in creator culture while also being respected as somebody covering it. Are there any guardrails you can reference? TL: That's always been true for any culture reporter, right? It's like, of course, culture reporters that wrote about music and film or whatever, just culture in general, we live in culture, all of us do. You can't opt out of culture. And by the way, same with politics, like these political reporters like to think that, “Oh, I'm objective or I don't vote because I, because I'm a political reporter” It's like, what are you talking about? We all live in a political world. This is just the world that we all live in. I think the most important thing is to be fair and to be accurate and to be truthful. That's the most important thing. So sometimes I'm writing about somebody that maybe I don't personally love, but I'm accurate and truthful and fair, and I think it's better for me to be open and be like, “Look, yeah, I'm not personally a fan of this YouTuber or something, but I'm reporting on them fairly, and everything that's reported is truthful and accurate.” Just the way that a music writer, of course, they're not going to not listen to music and abstain from music because they have to be objective, like, they're going to like certain artists better than others, and that might shape what they choose to cover; they might want to cover a band that they really like that maybe wouldn't normally get covered or something. But, you know, it's their job to report on the industry, whether, you know, whether or not they like Taylor Swift, right? Like they're going to have to report on her tour being a huge success. This is what I think Wes Lowery is just so good at. He wrote this excellent piece and he's more articulate than I am on it, but it's like this false idea of objectivity where objectivity is really just one ideology and set of opinions that a lot of old white rich men hold. And that's considered the objective opinion, right? It's obviously a farce. The most important thing is to be truthful. I'm such an open book. If somebody asked me my opinion on something, I'll happily tell my opinion, but I don't let that opinion affect my work. I mean, we all decide what to cover based off things we're interested in, of course, or accountability things that we're focused on, but you know, it's so silly, all those conversations, because this has always been the case. And by the way, newspapers make political decisions all the time. Any kind of investigative journalism is inherently political, you know, if you're investigating gun violence deaths and putting together this big picture around gun violence, that says you have a specific outcome that you want. So I think we should just be more transparent about it because what readers don't trust is when you try and say that, “Oh no, I'm a completely neutral person.” It's like, well, no one is, we all live in the world. JD: You referenced rich white men and bias, and of course everybody's talking about Isaacson’s biography: the elephant in the room of media discourse is Elon Musk for the foreseeable future. Do you have any thoughts about where that is all heading? TL: Yeah. I definitely was reading all the excerpts that I could because I cover Elon sometimes and I wanted to know what he'd found. I wanted to write my book because my reporting always focuses not on those people. I wanted to write a book that was about the other side of tech, because I think so much of how we've understood the rise of social media is through these corporate narratives that center these men, like, I mean, The Social Network, right? That's the defining way that people understand the rise of social media, is through these narratives that just center Silicon Valley boy geniuses and powerful men. And every single tech book has to be like a company book. You know, we have like 10 WeWork books or we have the YouTube book and the Instagram book—which I love, by the way, Sarah Frier’s No Filter’s right behind me [referencing her bookshelf], it’s extremely good—but I think we need alternatives to that too. We need books that zoom out and tell the users’ side and look at these creators and look at the industry around it and how it's been shaped, because social platforms are very unique. They have a very symbiotic relationship with the user base. It's not like these tech geniuses just built these products and then everyone uses them how they want. In fact, quite the opposite. Usually the tech people had no idea what's going on, and a lot of them succeeded despite themselves. So for me, I didn't want to write another tech book that was just about some, you know, powerful man or some man that fell from grace, like SBF or whatever. I wanted to write about these other people who have been basically written out of history, and tell the story of social media through a cultural lens, not just through these tech Silicon Valley narratives. JD: I really appreciate that. And it makes for a much more, surprising and enriching reading experience. I have a few recurring, lightning-round style questions. You've answered them to a certain extent earlier, so feel free to repeat yourself. What's one thing you wish people paid more attention to? TL: Oh God, I mean misogyny on the internet. I'm gonna say it. Because that was such a through line in reporting this book: all these incredible women who have been driven off the internet by hate and it made me sad. JD: What's one resource you would recommend for making better sense of reality? TL: Oh, really good question. TikTok, I think people that don't use Tik Tok should spend time on it because it is a real window into culture today. It's such a defining, important platform. I think people should check it out. JD: What's one moment where your sense of reality was disrupted? TL: I guess when COVID hit, I was like, what is happening? I actually had a lot of beliefs about human nature and all this stuff before COVID that I now have completely changed my mind on. I used to think people were inherently good and I don't think that anymore. I think people are inherently evil. JD: You just feel like because of what was put on display when the pandemic came down? TL: Actually, it was what happened after in 2020. That was a really good year in the sense that people had a lot of solidarity and seem to care about other people. I'm severely immunocompromised and very sick. And so in 2020 was like, “Oh, people are having solidarity and clapping for the healthcare workers,” and now it’s like, “Oh, they’re banning masks and everyone can die. And we're going to have absolutely no systemic solutions to this virus that continues to maim and kill millions of people.” I lost another person I love to it that just several months ago, it's just horrible. It's horrible. And no one cares. In fact, there's real hostility, and I think a real eugenicist sort of thinking that's emerged out of COVID—which I learned is actually very common. Following the previous pandemic in 1919 as well, eugenics became this huge thing. I think we're seeing that now with this notion of vulnerable people where you can just die, like, hurry up and die because the rest of us are going to be fine. That's not true. Eventually you will get sick and die. That is true for everyone, whether it's old age or cancer or something. We all die, actually, and we all become vulnerable. You might not be medically vulnerable now, but you will be. And so I think it's really horrifying. The public sentiment, especially from political leaders, that’s what's really scary, the normalization of that thinking. And I'm like, “Oh damn, I thought we were better than that.” Now I think everyone is sort of inherently bad and we have to build societies to facilitate good behavior among people and caring about other people. We don't have a very collectivist society. We live in like one of the most individualistic countries in the world. And I think that's why we have, outside of China, which is just so much bigger than us, the highest rate of COVID deaths in the world still right now. JD: I remember reading—all caveats that the numbers could be off and whatever. But I remember reading something to the effect that, given the projected spread of COVID over the next 10 or 20 years or something like that, that we're essentially going to be dealing with like 20 percent of the population, in some way, large and small, affected by long term deleterious health impacts from COVID, which was really striking when you have, yeah, political leaders saying like, “It's done, let's go back to work.” TL: Yeah, sorry to all the sick and disabled people. You can just die. And by the way, there's absolutely no safety net for you. So if you do get disabled, you are dead to the world because we're living in this hyper-capitalist society where as soon as you lose value as a worker, your life loses value. And it's very sad to see leftists parrot at this stuff. Because no one has defended the capitalist state more than these leftists that also want to pretend that COVID is over. And it's scary because people have, like, socialist in their bio, and they're just like, “Oh, you can't work. You're useless.” It's like, “What are you guys talking about?” So it makes me very sad, it's one of the few things that I would have thought that nothing could get me to change my mind about previously. But now my mind is totally changed. JD: Let's rewind to pre-Covid because one thing I really did want to talk about with you is, you reference in your acknowledgements how Tumblr saved your life, and also that your taylorlorenz3.0 community was really supportive in making decisions around the book. I'd love to hear a little bit about those episodes in your life. TL: Yeah, I do think tumblr saved my life because I was so depressed before tumblr. So I got on tumblr in 2009. I wasn't really on the Internet before. I actually didn't have MySpace. I had Facebook in college, obviously, like every other person, but I wasn't really online until Tumblr and, Tumblr completely opened my world and got me everything in life. So I love Tumblr. And yeah, I have a bunch of accounts online that are just for fun, including my like, funny meme account. I've always had accounts like that. But I just love the community that I have online and my community of followers. I'm the most indecisive person ever, so when I had to make decisions about the book, I would always do polls and stuff, and they would always give me advice and help me, and obviously they're the ones that have pre-ordered my book and really supported me throughout my career and they support my work. I'm just so grateful to anyone that follows me and engages with my work and supports my work because I couldn't do it without them, you know, so shout out to all the followers. JD: Are there things that could happen at the level of creator culture or tech infrastructure of social media platforms that would maybe give you some more faith in the inherent goodness for humanity? Or maybe a cleaner way of phrasing the question is: what would you identify as something that's desperately needed in the social media creator ecosystems? TL: Well, I think because people are so inherently evil and bad that we really need technology to bring out the best in us. We need technology that brings us together and helps us create community in powerful and meaningful ways, and can help facilitate true connection between people and true understanding and empathy. Right now we have platforms that strip empathy, right? We have platforms that sew division and actually feed into the worst of human nature. My hope is that we build new, less profit-driven social technology that can help connect us and help build bonds. The Internet's power is as a connector of people. That is the whole point of the internet is to connect people. So I think we need to build more platforms that actually do that. And, you know, I don't know what that looks like, but it definitely does not look like Facebook and Twitter and Instagram, you know? JD: Definitely. All right, well, the book, I've got Extremely Online here, but you also have the official copies on your shelf. It's out October 3rd. TL: Yes, you have the rare collector's edition before I changed the cover to gold. Actually, it's out on pre-order now, so please pre-order. Pre-orders are like the only thing that matters for books, but you can get it officially in bookstores October 3rd. JD: Amazing. And where can people find you and information about the book in the meantime? TL: Yeah, on Instagram. I'm just at Taylor Lorenz on Instagram. I'm also on TikTok. And I'm on YouTube now at Taylor Lorenz. So the only platform I don't use anymore for news and tech stuff is Twitter. So everywhere else you can follow me. I'm on threads. We'll see if that goes anywhere and blue sky and all those other. JD: Amazing. Well, Taylor, thank you so much for being here. It's been a super illuminating conversation, and I really appreciate your book. TL: Thank you so much for having me. This was so fun. This podcast is edited and produced by me, Jesse Damiani.

Taylor Lorenz is the national bestselling author of Extremely Online: The Untold Story of Fame, Influence, and Power on the Internet. She is also the founder of User Mag, a tech and online culture newsletter that features reporting, interviews, and insights about the online world. She previously worked as a technology columnist for The Washington Post and as a technology reporter for The New York Times, The Atlantic, and The Daily Beast. Her writing has appeared in New York magazine, Rolling Stone, Outside magazine, and more. She frequently appears on NBC, CNN, MSNBC, CBS, and the BBC. She was a 2019 Knight Visiting Nieman Fellow at Harvard University and is a former affiliate at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. Lately I’ve been feeling extra distracted when I’m online. There’s such a ridiculous amount of stuff constantly competing for your attention. From an outside perspective, at least, it seems like you’re pretty much always online! Did you have to make changes to your routine when you were writing your book? Definitely. Having severe ADHD and managing without medication means my ability to focus is practically non-existent. I’ve missed so many deadlines, using last-minute pressure as a motivator. Writing a book under these circumstances was tough. But honestly I didn’t end up having much of a structured process, just chaotic spurts driven by the fear of my editor’s reaction if I didn’t deliver. I ended up doing everything during nights and weekends—it was intense. I noticed you seemed less active on certain social platforms for a while. Was that a strategic part of your process to enhance focus? Somewhat. I took a break from Twitter and was actually banned from it at one point. But I still stayed active on TikTok and YouTube. My online presence fluctuates depending on whatever’s happening in my life. I didn’t have a “book leave” from social media per se. When I have too many things going on, those are my most productive days. I’d end up procrastinating on a project even if you gave me all day to focus on it. I need a limited amount of time, a deadline, to get things done. Could you expand on how you use the pressure from deadlines to be productive? Well, there’s this idea: “A deadline is not a start time,” but for me, it might as well be. It’s 100% about the external pressure for me. I remember a tech executive I interviewed discussing anxiety as a motivator—it resonated very deeply. Without that anxious drive, I sometimes really struggle to accomplish tasks. During the book writing, I especially felt this. The stress and fear of missing a deadline or disappointing others are what fuel me into action. Planning doesn’t work for me; piling on work and riding the wave of urgent necessity does. It’s about creating a structure of chaos that somehow results in productivity. How do you prioritize what gets done amidst that chaos? I think I would find that process maddening, but it seems to work well for you. I think it’s the lack of predictability that keeps me engaged. If my day is too controlled or stable, I lose interest. I need my schedule packed, full of back-to-back commitments, so when a rare free hour pops up, I know it’s now or never for getting certain pieces of work done. Too much free time equals procrastination for me. By overloading my schedule, it forces me to manage time more effectively—even if it means I’m constantly putting out fires, it’s what keeps me moving forward. How do you avoid burnout? I don’t really think about slowing down. Burnout happens, sure, but I honestly just power through it. I manage by shifting my focus. If one area wears me out, I pivot to something else. If I’m tired of making videos, I switch to writing. If I’ve just finished a long feature, I’ll make TikToks or start a new project. It’s all about diversification for me. Stepping away entirely doesn’t work for me; it leads to depression and a drop in productivity. So I keep creative, often collaborating with friends on just-for-fun projects, like filming comedy skits. That kind of creativity, separate from work, is crucial for me. It’s about balance and finding joy in the creative process, not the outcome. What is it about non-work-related creative projects that rejuvenates you? Is it the different stakes, or something else? I thrive on new challenges and learning. That’s partly why I’m a journalist—I love to learn. It’s the same with hobbies; I dive into them, like I’ve been doing needlepoint recently and it’s become a big part of my day. It’s possibly an ADHD trait, this hyper-focusing on different skills, but it’s also how I keep my creativity flowing. Hobbies like that feel low-stakes because they’re not tied to my professional work, and yeah, that helps. Have you taken on projects that you’ve had to abandon? Oh, absolutely. Lots. I’ve left behind everything from TV shows that were in development to podcasts that were already several episodes in. Abandoning projects is part of the process for me. Even if a project doesn’t end up coming together the way I hoped, I get so much out of just having put in the work on it. I always approach projects like “let’s just see where this goes.” It’s important to manage expectations, too. High hopes can sometimes lead to disappointment, so I try to learn and have fun regardless of the outcome. Has your approach to setting expectations evolved with your career experiences? Definitely. I’ve come to appreciate that the best work isn’t always the result of intense effort or big expectations. Effort is important, but it doesn’t guarantee that others will resonate with your work. You have to do it for yourself first. A valuable lesson from art school was to always create art for yourself, as it might end up being just for you—and that’s okay. You have to try to enjoy the process of creating. Of course that isn’t to say you shouldn’t get paid for your work, but its value to you shouldn’t only depend on whether it’s commercially successful. I wanted to ask about the financial side of your work. As a journalist, you study how online creators make money, and you’re also a content creator yourself. What insights from your journalism have helped you in the content creator side of your career? One thing about money is that I don’t actually make any from my internet content because of my role as a journalist. I’m make a lot more money if I wasn’t a journalist. From starting out as a blogger I learned how important it is to interact with your audience, which is not at all like how traditional journalism worked. I work on stories together with my audience, asking for their feedback and sources, which makes them feel more involved and actually improves the quality and accountability of my work. Sharing my work process and thoughts openly has also improved my work due to the interaction and feedback from the community, which is something traditional journalism could benefit from learning more about. How do you approach using social media positively for audience interaction for your work despite all the toxicity out there? For me, it’s about really engaging with people and making them a genuine part of the conversation. Not just treating them like an audience, but like people. I ask for input because I genuinely want it and it helps my work. It’s about creating meaningful dialogue and connections, even with all the negativity online. What’s your personal work environment like? Do you have a specific place or tools you prefer for your best work? I’ve said this before, but I do all my writing from bed. That’s where I’m able to focus and be most productive. I need that quiet, cozy environment. If I have to edit video, especially on Premiere, I might use a desktop for the convenience of a bigger screen, but all my writing happens in bed. Desks make me feel like I’m supposed to be on a call or something—it’s just too formal and stressful. Back when I was in a newsroom, I couldn’t write at my desk; I could only socialize or manage emails and messages. My best writing happens away from a desk. Does working from bed affect your ability to disconnect from work during off hours? The boundary between work and life is pretty much gone for me. Being on social media is such a big part of my work that I check my phone first thing in the morning in bed. It’s probably not ideal, but that’s how things are. I do have a “work side” of the bed, if that makes sense [laughs]. If I could, I’d have a separate daybed in an office just for work and keep my own bed for rest. But for now, I just switch sides. Does it ever worry you that you don’t do more to separate your work and personal life? Honestly, I don’t dwell on it. I’ve tried different productivity methods before that were supposed to help deal with that stuff, and they just added stress. I found that when I stopped worrying about following a set of “shoulds,” I was less dragged down by stress. I fully realize my approach isn’t for everyone. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it, but it works for me. Your point about productivity methods adding stress really resonates. My wife and I listen to productivity podcasts, almost as a weird form of comfort listening, but it’s funny how they can make optimizing efficiency feel like a second job. The other day I was listening to a guy talk about using all these tips and tricks in Gmail, and I thought, this is definitely more work than just replying to your emails! Oh, totally! I’ve actually thought a lot about this topic. My approach to email is “inbox infinity.” I refuse to let email become a stressor. That mindset of not trying to over-manage everything also applies to my general outlook on making things. I’ve accepted that I’ll drop the ball sometimes. That’s just how it is. A story might not work out. I might have an unproductive day. I’ve learned to be at peace with it. The alternative, trying to keep up with everything, just adds too much negative pressure. With your projects, especially the book, but also with all your content creation online, how do you decide when something is finished? Is that where deadlines come into play, because it’s “done” simply by necessity? Exactly, it’s the deadline that calls it. I’ll be deep into something right up until the moment it needs to be submitted or I need to publish it online. Sometimes, it’s just a matter of being so tired of interacting with it that I can’t stand to look at it any longer—that’s when I decide it’s finished. There’s also this sense of urgency tied to the internet. Creating content for the web, I feel this constant push against time. I’ll think, “Could I redo this video and improve it? Sure, but it’ll lose traction if I delay. Better to just release it.” I try to remember to not let perfect be the enemy of good.

Tags: The Federal Trade Commission today sued to block the largest proposed supermarket merger in U.S. history—Kroger Company’s $24.6 billion acquisition of the Albertsons Companies, Inc.—alleging that the deal is anticompetitive. The FTC charges that the proposed deal will eliminate fierce competition between Kroger and Albertsons, leading to higher prices for groceries and other essential household items for millions of Americans. The loss of competition will also lead to lower quality products and services, while also narrowing consumers’ choices for where to shop for groceries. For thousands of grocery store workers, Kroger’s proposed acquisition of Albertsons would immediately erase aggressive competition for workers, threatening the ability of employees to secure higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions. “This supermarket mega merger comes as American consumers have seen the cost of groceries rise steadily over the past few years. Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons would lead to additional grocery price hikes for everyday goods, further exacerbating the financial strain consumers across the country face today,” said Henry Liu, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. “Essential grocery store workers would also suffer under this deal, facing the threat of their wages dwindling, benefits diminishing, and their working conditions deteriorating.” The FTC issued an administrative complaint and authorized a lawsuit in federal court to block the proposed acquisition pending the Commission’s administrative proceedings. A bipartisan group of nine attorneys general is joining the FTC’s federal court complaint. Kroger operates thousands of stores across 36 states, which includes regional banners such as Fred Meyer, Fry’s, Harris Teeter, King Soopers, Kroger, and Quality Food Centers (QFC). Albertsons also operates thousands of stores across 35 states under regional names including Albertsons, Haggen, Jewel-Osco, Pavilions, Safeway, and Vons. If the merger were completed, Kroger and Albertsons would operate more than 5,000 stores and approximately 4,000 retail pharmacies and would employ nearly 700,000 employees across 48 states. Executives for both Kroger and Albertsons have acknowledged that the two supermarkets are direct competitors, forcing each other to aggressively compete for customers by lowering prices and for employees by providing better pay and benefits across the country. Similarly, executives for both supermarket chains have conceded that Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons is anticompetitive, with one executive reacting candidly to the proposed deal: “you are basically creating a monopoly in grocery with the merger.” Inadequate Divestiture Offering To try to secure antitrust approval of their merger, Kroger and Albertsons have proposed to divest several hundred stores and select other assets to C&S Wholesale Grocers (C&S), which today operates just 23 supermarkets and a single retail pharmacy. The FTC’s administrative complaint alleges that Kroger and Albertsons’s inadequate divestiture proposal is a hodgepodge of unconnected stores, banners, brands, and other assets that Kroger’s antitrust lawyers have cobbled together and falls far short of mitigating the lost competition between Kroger and Albertsons. The FTC says the proposed divestitures are not a standalone business, and C&S would face significant obstacles stitching together the various parts and pieces from Kroger and Albertsons into a functioning business—let alone a successful competitor against a combined Kroger and Albertsons. The proposal completely ignores many affected regional and local markets where Kroger and Albertsons compete today. In areas where there are divestitures, the proposal fails to include all of the assets, resources, and capabilities that C&S would need to replicate the competitive intensity that exists today between Kroger and Albertsons. Even if C&S were to survive as an operator, Kroger and Albertsons’s proposed divestitures still do not solve the multitude of competitive issues created by the proposed acquisition, according to the complaint. Harm to Consumers In addition to raising grocery prices, the FTC alleges that Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons would also diminish their incentive to compete on quality. Today, Kroger and Albertsons compete to improve their stores in many ways, including offering fresher produce, higher quality products, improved private label offerings, a broader array of in-store services, flexible store and pharmacy hours, and curbside pickup services. The FTC charges that the deal would eliminate head-to-head price and quality competition, which have driven both supermarkets to lower their prices and improve their product and service offerings. If the merger takes place, grocery prices will increase, and Kroger and Albertsons’ incentive to improve product quality and customer service will decrease, further harming customers. Harm to Workers Kroger and Albertsons are the two largest employers of union grocery labor in the United States. They actively compete against one another for workers. The two companies also try to poach grocery workers from each other, especially in local markets where they overlap. Currently, most workers for both supermarket chains are members of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union. Today, UFCW and other unions leverage the fact that Kroger and Albertsons are separate and competing companies. Unions push for both supermarket chains to negotiate better employment terms for union grocery workers, especially when negotiating over collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). A combined Kroger/Albertsons, however, would gain increased leverage over workers and their unions—to the detriment of workers, the FTC alleges. The combined Kroger and Albertsons would have more leverage to impose subpar terms on union grocery workers that slow improvements to wages, worsen benefits, and potentially degrade working conditions. In some regions, such as in Denver, the combined Kroger/Albertsons would be the only employer of union grocery labor. Union grocery workers ability to leverage the threat of a boycott or strike to negotiate better CBA terms would also be weakened. The Offices of the Attorneys General of Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming are joining the Commission’s federal lawsuit. The Commission vote to issue the administrative complaint and authorize staff to seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in federal district court was 3-0. The federal court complaint and request for preliminary relief will be filed jointly with the state attorneys general in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. NOTE: The Commission issues an administrative complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The issuance of the administrative complaint marks the beginning of a proceeding in which the allegations will be tried in a formal hearing before an administrative law judge. The Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition, and protect and educate consumers. The FTC will never demand money, make threats, tell you to transfer money, or promise you a prize.

        "Mitch McConnell": [
            {
                "title": "Mitch McConnell - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Addison Mitchell McConnell III[1] (/məˈkɒnəl/; born February 20, 1942) is an American politician and retired attorney who has been serving as Senate minority leader since 2021 and the senior United States senator from Kentucky since 1985, the longest-serving senator in Kentucky history. McConnell has been the leader of the Senate Republican Conference since 2007, including as majority leader from 2015 to 2021, making him the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history. McConnell holds conservative political positions, although he was known as a pragmatist and a moderate Republican early in his political career. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the U.S. Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. FEC, which partially overturned the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold) in 2010. McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives during the Obama administration, making frequent use of the filibuster, and blocked many of President Obama's judicial nominees, including Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. During the Trump administration, the Senate Republican majority under McConnell's leadership passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in 2018, the First Step Act, and the Great American Outdoors Act, and confirmed a record number of federal appeals court judges during a president's first two years. McConnell invoked the nuclear option to eliminate the 60-vote requirement to end a filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, after his predecessor Harry Reid had eliminated the filibuster for all other presidential nominations; Trump subsequently won Supreme Court confirmation battles over Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. While supportive of most of Trump's domestic and foreign policies, McConnell criticized Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and despite voting to acquit in Trump's second impeachment trial for reasons related to the constitutionality of impeaching a former president, deemed him \"practically and morally responsible\" for the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[2] In 2015, 2019 and 2023, Time listed McConnell as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[3][4] On February 28, 2024, McConnell announced that he would step down as the Senate Republican Conference Leader in January 2025, but would serve the remainder of his Senate term.[5][6][7] An internal election to fill the post of Senate Republican Leader was held on November 13, in which South Dakota senator John Thune was selected.[8] McConnell was born on February 20, 1942, to Julia Odene \"Dean\" (née Shockley) and Addison Mitchell \"A.M.\" McConnell II[9] at Colbert County Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama, and grew up in Athens, Alabama, where his grandfather, Robert Hayes McConnell Sr., and his great-uncle, Addison Mitchell McConnell, owned McConnell Funeral Home.[9][10] He is of Scots-Irish and English descent. His ancestor James McConnell fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War.[9][11] In 1944, at the age of two, McConnell's upper left leg was paralyzed by a polio attack.[9][12] He and his mother were living with an aunt in Five Points, Alabama, at the time, and he received treatment at the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation.[13] The treatment potentially saved him from being disabled for the rest of his life.[14] McConnell said his family \"almost went broke\" because of costs related to his illness.[15] In 1950, when he was eight, McConnell moved with his family from Athens to Augusta, Georgia, where his father, who was in the Army, was stationed at Fort Gordon.[16] In 1956, his family moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where he attended duPont Manual High School.[16] McConnell was elected student council president at his high school during his junior year.[16] He graduated Omicron Delta Kappa from the University of Louisville with a B.A. in political science in 1964 with honors.[17] He was president of the Student Council of the College of Arts and Sciences and a member of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity.[18] McConnell attended the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave the \"I Have a Dream\" speech.[19] In 1964, at the age of 22, he attended civil rights rallies,[20] and interned with Senator John Sherman Cooper. He has said his time with Cooper inspired him to run for the Senate later in life.[21][22] In 1967, McConnell graduated from the University of Kentucky College of Law, where he was president of the Student Bar Association.[18][23] In March 1967, shortly before the expiration of his educational draft deferment upon graduation from law school, McConnell enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve as a private at Louisville.[24] This was a coveted position because the Reserve units were mostly kept out of combat during the Vietnam War.[24][25]: 11–12 His first day of training at Fort Knox, Kentucky, was July 9, 1967, two days after taking the bar exam, and his last day was August 15, 1967.[18][24] Shortly after his arrival he was diagnosed with optic neuritis and deemed medically unfit for military service, and was honorably discharged.[24][26] McConnell's political opponents have repeatedly made an issue of his brief time in service during his electoral campaigns.[24][26][27] McConnell first served as a Deputy United States Assistant Attorney General under President Gerald Ford from 1974 until 1975 and then as Jefferson County Judge/Executive from 1977 until 1984 in Kentucky. He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1984 and is the second Kentuckian to serve as a party leader in the Senate.[28] During the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, he was chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He was elected Majority Whip to Bill Frist in the 108th Congress and reelected to the post in 2004. In November 2006 he was elected Senate minority leader, the post he held until Republicans took control of the Senate in 2015. From 1968 to 1970, McConnell worked as chief legislative assistant to Senator Marlow Cook in Washington, D.C., managing a legislative department consisting of five members as well as assisting with speechwriting and constituent services.[29] In 1971, McConnell returned to Louisville, where he worked on Tom Emberton's campaign for governor of Kentucky, which was unsuccessful.[29] McConnell attempted to run for a seat in the state legislature but was disqualified because he did not meet the residency requirements for the office.[29] He then worked for the Louisville law firm Segal, Isenberg, Sales and Stewart for a few years.[30][29] During the same period, he taught a night class on political science at the University of Louisville.[23][31][32] In October 1974, McConnell returned to Washington to fill a position as Deputy Assistant Attorney General under President Ford, where he worked alongside Robert Bork, Laurence Silberman, and Antonin Scalia.[23][29] He also served as acting United States Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs under President Ford in 1975.[33][34] In 1977, McConnell was elected the Jefferson County judge/executive, the top political office in Jefferson County, Kentucky, at the time, defeating incumbent Democrat Todd Hollenbach III, 53% to 47%. He was reelected in 1981 against Jefferson County Commissioner Jim \"Pop\" Malone, 51% to 47%, outspending Malone 3–1, and occupied the office until his election to the U.S. Senate in 1984.[21][29] In his early years as a politician in Kentucky, McConnell was known as a pragmatist and a moderate Republican.[21][25] Over time he became more conservative.[21][25] According to one of his biographers, McConnell transformed \"from a moderate Republican who supported abortion rights and public employee unions to the embodiment of partisan obstructionism and conservative orthodoxy on Capitol Hill.\"[25] McConnell has widely been described as an obstructionist.[35] From 1997 to 2001, McConnell chaired the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the body charged with securing electoral victories for Republicans.[36][37] On February 12, 1999, he was one of 50 senators to vote to convict and remove Bill Clinton from office.[38] He was first elected Majority Whip in the 108th Congress.[39] Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist did not seek reelection in the 2006 elections. In November, after Republicans lost control of the Senate, they elected McConnell minority leader.[40] After Republicans took control of the Senate following the 2014 Senate elections, McConnell became the Senate Majority Leader.[41] In June 2018 he became the longest-serving Senate Republican leader in U.S. history.[42] McConnell is the second Kentuckian to serve as a party leader in the Senate (after Alben W. Barkley led the Democrats from 1937 to 1949)[17] and the longest-serving U.S. senator from Kentucky.[43] McConnell has a reputation as a skilled political strategist and tactician.[44][45][46][47] This reputation dimmed after Republicans failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in 2017 during consolidated Republican control of government.[48][49][50][51] McConnell regularly obtained earmarks for businesses and institutions in Kentucky until Congress banned the practice in 2010.[52] He has been criticized for funding \"temporary patches\" to Kentucky's long-term healthcare problems while simultaneously opposing and obstructing national programs that seek to improve healthcare more systematically, such as Obamacare and Medicaid expansion.[32] Defunct Newspapers Journals TV channels Websites Other Economics Gun rights Identity politics Nativist Religion Watchdog groups Youth/student groups Miscellaneous Other As the leading Republican senator, McConnell confronted and pressured other Republican senators who were willing to negotiate with Democrats and the Obama administration.[53] According to Purdue University political scientist Bert A. Rockman, \"pure party line voting has been evident now for some time ... but rarely has the tactic of 'oppositionism' been so boldly stated as McConnell did.\"[54] According to University of Texas legal scholar Sanford Levinson, McConnell learned that obstruction and Republican unity were the optimal ways to ensure Republican gains in upcoming elections after he observed how Democratic cooperation with the Bush administration on No Child Left Behind and Medicare Part D helped Bush's 2004 reelection.[55] Levinson noted, \"McConnell altogether rationally ... concluded that Republicans have nothing to gain, as a political party, from collaborating in anything that the president could then claim as an achievement.\"[55] A number of political scientists, historians, and legal scholars have characterized McConnell's obstructionism and constitutional hardball as contributors to democratic erosion in the United States.[56][57][58][59] In October 2010, McConnell said, \"the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\" Asked whether this meant \"endless, or at least frequent, confrontation with the president\", McConnell said, \"if [Obama is] willing to meet us halfway on some of the biggest issues, it's not inappropriate for us to do business with him.\"[60] According to political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson, \"Facing off against Obama, [McConnell] worked to deny even minimal Republican support for major presidential initiatives—initiatives that were, as a rule, in keeping with the moderate model of decades past, and often with moderate Republican stances of a few years past.\"[61] The New York Times wrote early in Obama's administration that \"on the major issues—not just health care, but financial regulation and the economic stimulus package, among others—Mr. McConnell has held Republican defections to somewhere between minimal and nonexistent, allowing him to slow the Democratic agenda if not defeat aspects of it.\"[62] The Republican caucus threatened repeatedly to force the United States to default on its debt, McConnell saying he had learned from the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis that \"it's a hostage that's worth ransoming\".[63][64] McConnell worked to delay and obstruct health care reform and banking reform, two of the most notable pieces of legislation that Democrats navigated through Congress early in Obama's tenure.[65][66] Political scientists noted that \"by slowing action even on measures supported by many Republicans, McConnell capitalized on the scarcity of floor time, forcing Democratic leaders into difficult trade-offs concerning which measures were worth pursuing. ... Slowing the Senate's ability to process even routine measures limited the sheer volume of liberal bills that could be adopted.\"[66] One of McConnell's most common tactics as minority leader to delay or obstruct legislation and judicial appointments was the filibuster. A filibuster is an attempt to \"talk a bill to death\", forcing Senate leadership to abandon a proposed measure instead of waiting out the filibuster―or at least to delay the measure's passage. In the Senate, any senator may speak for unlimited duration unless a 60-person majority votes to invoke cloture, or end debate, and proceed to a final vote. Political scientists have referred to McConnell's use of the filibuster as \"constitutional hardball\", referring to the misuse of procedural tools in a way that undermines democracy.[61][64][57][67] Political scientists Hacker and Pierson describe the rationale behind McConnell's filibusters: \"Filibusters left no fingerprints. When voters heard that legislation had been 'defeated', journalists rarely highlighted that this defeat meant a minority had blocked a majority. Not only did this strategy produce an atmosphere of gridlock and dysfunction; it also chewed up the Senate calendar, restricting the range of issues on which Democrats could progress.\"[61] In 2013, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid eliminated the filibuster for all presidential nominations except the Supreme Court. By that time, nearly half of all votes to invoke cloture in the history of the Senate had occurred during Obama's presidency.[58] In April 2017, Senate Republicans led by McConnell eliminated the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations in order to end debate on the nomination of Neil Gorsuch.[68][69][70] In August 2019, McConnell wrote an editorial for The New York Times strongly opposing the elimination of the filibuster on legislation.[71] McConnell initially endorsed fellow Kentucky senator Rand Paul for president in 2016. Paul withdrew from the race after the Iowa caucuses, and McConnell endorsed presumptive nominee Donald Trump on May 4, 2016.[72] But McConnell disagreed with Trump on many occasions. In May 2016, after Trump suggested that federal judge Gonzalo P. Curiel was biased against Trump because of his Mexican heritage, McConnell said: \"I don't agree with what [Trump] had to say. This is a man who was born in Indiana. All of us came here from somewhere else.\" In July 2016, after Trump criticized the parents of Humayun Khan, a Muslim-American soldier who was killed in Iraq, McConnell said, \"All Americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services.\" On October 7, 2016, following the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy, McConnell said, \"As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape.\"[73] In private, McConnell reportedly expresses disdain for Trump[74] and \"abhors\" his behavior.[75] In October 2017, White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon and other Trump allies blamed McConnell for stalling the Trump administration's legislation. In response, McConnell cited Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court to show that the Senate supported Trump's agenda.[76] After Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election, McConnell at first refused to recognize Biden as the winner.[77][78][79] In his public statements, McConnell did not repeat any of Trump's false claims of voter fraud, but did not contradict them, ignoring questions about evidence and instead arguing that Trump had the right to challenge the results.[78][80][81] At the same time that McConnell refused to recognize Biden, he celebrated Republicans who won their Senate and House races in the same elections.[78][80][82] On December 15, the day after the electoral college vote, McConnell reversed his stance and publicly acknowledged Biden's win, saying, \"Today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden.\"[83] On January 6, during the Electoral College vote count, McConnell spoke out against the efforts of Trump and his allies to overturn the election: Trump claims the election was stolen. The assertions range from specific local allegations to constitutional arguments to sweeping conspiracy theories ... nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale—the massive scale—that would have tipped the entire election. ... If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral. We'd never see the whole nation accept an election again. Every four years would be a scramble for power at any cost.[84] Later that day, he described the storming of the Capitol building (which occurred while the Electoral College votes were being counted) as a \"failed insurrection\" that \"tried to disrupt our democracy\".[85] On April 10, 2021, Trump called McConnell a \"dumb son of a bitch\". Trump added: \"I hired his wife. Did he ever say thank you?\"[86] Trump has continued to attack McConnell in personal terms since then, but McConnell has not responded publicly.[87][88] On November 5, 2019, as the House of Representatives began public hearings on the impeachment of President Trump, McConnell said, \"I'm pretty sure how [an impeachment trial is] likely to end. ... If it were today, I don't think there's any question. It would not lead to a removal.\"[89] On December 14, 2019, McConnell met with White House counsel Pat Cipollone and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland. Later that day, he said that for Trump's impeachment trial, he would be in \"total coordination with the White House counsel's office\" and Trump's representatives.[90][91] He also said there was \"no chance\" the Senate would convict Trump and remove him from office.[92] On December 17, 2019, McConnell rejected a request to call four witnesses for Trump's impeachment trial because, according to McConnell, the Senate's role was to \"act as judge and jury\", not to investigate. Later that day, McConnell told the media: \"I'm not an impartial juror [in this impeachment trial]. This is a political process. There's not anything judicial about it.\"[93][94] After Trump's acquittal, McConnell was noted for his ability to block witnesses, to secure Trump's acquittal, and to maintain party unity during the impeachment process. Commentators noted that he had kept Republican senators \"marching in lockstep\" throughout the process.[95][96][97] On January 12, 2021, it was reported that McConnell supported impeaching Trump for his role in inciting the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, believing it would make it easier for Republicans to purge the party of Trump and rebuild the party.[98] On January 13, despite having the authority to call for an emergency meeting of the Senate to hold the Senate trial,[failed verification] McConnell did not reconvene the chamber, claiming unanimous consent was required.[99] He called for delaying the Senate trial until after Biden's inauguration.[100] Once the Senate trial started, McConnell voted to acquit Trump on February 13, 2021, saying it was unconstitutional to convict a president who was no longer in office.[101] The vote to convict was a bipartisan majority (57–43) but not enough to pass the two-thirds threshold.[102] After the vote, McConnell lambasted and condemned Trump in a 20-minute speech on the Senate floor, saying he believed Trump was guilty of everything the House managers alleged.[103][104] He said: Former President Trump's actions preceding the riot were a disgraceful dereliction of duty ... There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day ... If President Trump were still in office, I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge.[105] He explained why he nonetheless voted to acquit: \"Article II, Section 4 must have force. It tells us the President, Vice President, and civil officers may be impeached and convicted. Donald Trump is no longer the president. Clearly that mandatory sentence cannot be applied to somebody who has left office. The entire process revolves around removal. If removal becomes impossible, conviction becomes insensible.\" Yet he said that Trump \"didn't get away with anything yet\" since Trump would remain subject to the country's criminal and civil laws.[105] When there was a proposal for an independent commission to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack, McConnell sought to organize Republican senators to filibuster it,[106] and on May 28, 2021, he voted against its creation.[107] McConnell's relationship with the Biden administration has been portrayed in media as one of comity. Biden has described McConnell as \"a friend, colleague and 'man of his word.'\" McConnell has praised bipartisan legislation they worked on together, and was the only Republican to attend the 2015 funeral of Biden's son Beau Biden.[108] In October 2021, McConnell helped pass a bill that extended the debt ceiling. He convinced 11 Republicans to vote with the Democrats for it, without which the United States would have defaulted on its debts.[109] Throughout Obama's tenure, McConnell led Senate Republicans in what has been called \"a disciplined, sustained, at times underhanded campaign to deny the Democratic president the opportunity to appoint federal judges\".[110] In June 2009, after Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor as associate justice, McConnell and Jeff Sessions opined that Sotomayor's 17 years as a federal judge and over 3,600 judicial opinions would require lengthy review and advocated against Democrats hastening the confirmation process.[111] On July 17, McConnell announced that he would vote against Sotomayor's confirmation.[112] In August, McConnell called Sotomayor \"a fine person with an impressive story and a distinguished background\" but said he did not believe she would withhold her personal or political views while serving as a justice. Sotomayor was confirmed days later.[113] In May 2010, after President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to succeed the retiring John Paul Stevens, McConnell said in a Senate speech that Americans wanted to make sure Kagan would be independent of influence from White House as an associate justice and noted that Obama called Kagan a friend of his in announcing her nomination.[114] McConnell announced his opposition to Kagan's confirmation, saying she was not forthcoming enough about her \"views on basic principles of American constitutional law\".[115] Kagan was confirmed the next month.[116] In 2014, Republicans gained control of the Senate, and McConnell became majority leader; he used his new power to start what was considered \"a near blockade\" of Obama's judicial appointments. According to The New York Times, Obama's final two years as president saw 18 district court judges and one appeals court judge confirmed, the fewest since President Harry S. Truman. In comparison, the final two years of the presidencies of George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Ronald Reagan had between 55 and 70 district court judges each confirmed and between 10 and 15 appeals court judges confirmed.[110] The Los Angeles Times wrote that McConnell brought about an \"extraordinary two-year slowdown in judicial confirmations\", detailing 22 confirmations of Obama's judicial nominees, the lowest since Truman in 1951–1952. The number of federal judicial vacancies at the end of Obama's term was more than twice the number at the end of George W. Bush's term.[117][118] In a 2019 interview, McConnell credited himself for the large number of judicial vacancies created in the last two years of Obama's presidency.[90] On February 13, 2016, Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia died.[119] Shortly thereafter, McConnell issued a statement indicating that the Senate would not consider any Supreme Court nominee Obama put forth.[22][120] \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president\", McConnell said.[120] On March 16, 2016, Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a Judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, to the Supreme Court.[121] Under McConnell's direction, Senate Republicans refused to take any action on the nomination.[122] Garland's nomination expired on January 3, 2017, with the end of the 114th Congress.[123] In an August 2016 speech in Kentucky, McConnell said, \"one of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.'\"[124][125] In April 2018, McConnell said the decision not to act on Garland's nomination was \"the most consequential decision I've made in my entire public career\".[126] Political scientists and legal scholars called McConnell's refusal to hold Senate hearings on Garland \"unprecedented\",[127][128] a \"culmination of [his] confrontational style\",[129] a \"blatant abuse of constitutional norms\",[59] and a \"classic example of constitutional hardball\".[64] In January 2017, President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left after Scalia's death.[130] Gorsuch's nomination was confirmed on April 7, 2017, after McConnell eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees.[131] On July 18, 2018, with Andy Oldham's Senate confirmation, Senate Republicans broke a record for largest number of appeals court judiciary confirmations during a president's first two years; Oldham became the 23rd appeals court judge confirmed in Trump's term.[132] McConnell said he considers the judiciary to be the item of Trump's first two years with the longest-lasting impact on the country. The record for the number of circuit court judges confirmed during a president's first year was broken in 2017, while the previous two-year record of 22 confirmations took place under President George H. W. Bush.[133] By March 2020, McConnell had contacted an unknown number of judges, encouraging them to retire before the 2020 election.[134][135] He confirmed 260 federal judges during Trump's four-year term, shifting the federal judiciary to the right. In July 2018, Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Anthony Kennedy as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. McConnell accused Democrats of creating an \"extreme\" distortion of Kavanaugh's record during his hearings.[136] In September 2018, Christine Blasey Ford publicly alleged that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in 1982. After it was reported that Democrats were investigating a second allegation against Kavanaugh, McConnell said, \"I want to make it perfectly clear. ... Judge Kavanaugh will be voted on here on the Senate floor.\"[137] Kavanaugh was confirmed on October 6.[138][139] McConnell said the confirmation process was a low point for the Senate, but also downplayed reports of dysfunction in the Senate; he said claims that the Senate was \"somehow broken over this [were] simply inaccurate\".[140] In October 2018, McConnell said if a Supreme Court vacancy were to occur in 2020, he would not repeat his 2016 decision to let the winner of the upcoming presidential election nominate a justice. He argued that because in 2016 the Senate was controlled by a party other than the president's, the 2016 precedent was not applicable in 2020, when Republicans controlled both the presidency and Senate.[141] In September 2020, after Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, he announced the Senate would vote on Trump's nominated replacement.[142] On October 23, McConnell set in place the Senate debate on the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to fill Ginsburg's seat. Barrett was confirmed on October 26.[143] The federal government shut down on October 1–17, 2013, after Congress failed to enact legislation to fund it. McConnell later vowed Republicans would not force the U.S. to default on its debt or shut down the government in 2014, when stopgap funding measures were set to expire. He also said he would not allow other Republicans to obstruct the budget-making process.[144][145] In July 2018, McConnell said funding for the Mexico–United States border wall would likely have to wait until the midterms had concluded. Trump tweeted two days later that he was willing to allow a government shutdown to get funding.[146] Several spending bills were approved that August; the approvals were seen as a victory for McConnell in his attempts to prevent another government shutdown.[147] From December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019, the federal government shut down when Congress refused to give in to Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.[148] In December 2018, the Republican-controlled Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump appeared likely to approve the bill. After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to \"build the wall\", he said he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund the wall.[149] During this shutdown, McConnell blocked the Senate from voting on appropriations legislation and said it was not his place to mediate between the Senate and Trump.[150][151][152] Privately, McConnell had advised Trump against initiating the shutdown.[22] Democrats criticized McConnell for not putting appropriations legislation up for a vote, noting that the Republican-controlled Senate had unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding and that the Senate could override Trump's veto.[150][151][152] By January 23, McConnell had blocked four Senate bills to reopen the government and a bill funding the Homeland Security Department through February 8. He called for Democrats to support a Trump administration-backed measure that included $5.7 billion in wall funding, together with a temporary extension of protections for DACA recipients, a Democratic priority.[153] Privately, other Republican senators pressured McConnell to stop blocking appropriations legislation.[154][155] The shutdown ended on January 25, when Trump signed a three-week funding measure reopening the government until February 15 without funds for a border wall.[156] This was the longest government shutdown in American history.[22][157] In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, McConnell initially opposed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, calling it a Democratic \"ideological wish list\".[158][159] He reversed his position when Trump endorsed the proposed package.[160] The bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 90–8. McConnell also directed Senate Republicans in negotiations for two other COVID-19 response packages: the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 and the CARES Act. The CARES Act was the largest economic stimulus package in U.S. history,[161] amounting to 10% of total U.S. gross domestic product.[162] It passed both houses of Congress with bipartisan support.[163] Speaking on the Hugh Hewitt radio show on April 22, 2020, McConnell suggested that states should be able to declare bankruptcy instead of receiving additional COVID-19 aid funds—funds he implied would be used to save insolvent state pension funds instead of for COVID-19 relief. His comments were sharply criticized by various state and local officials. States cannot declare bankruptcy.[164] After the CARES Act passed, McConnell waited several months before advancing any additional COVID-19 relief measures in the Senate, saying in May, \"I don't think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately\" and that Congress should \"[hit] pause\" to evaluate how the allocated funds were working before approving more.[165] He was absent from negotiations between congressional Democrats and White House officials for an additional aid package.[166][167][168] On September 10, 2020, a pared-down COVID-19 relief bill crafted by McConnell failed to pass the Senate because of a Democratic filibuster.[169] Democrats called the bill \"completely inadequate\" given the scope of the COVID-19 crisis[170] and a partisan maneuver to help Republican senators up for reelection.[171] McConnell called the bill a choice between \"do[ing] something\" and \"do[ing] nothing\",[172] and said he was holding the procedural vote to get lawmakers on the record about their willingness to compromise on COVID-19 legislation.[173] As the leader of the Senate Republicans, McConnell has received much of the criticism and disapproval that Republicans receive from Democratic voters, receiving near uniform disapproval from left-of-center voters. Furthermore, as a result of his unpopularity with Trump and the more populist base, McConnell has had historically low approval for a senator by the electorate as a whole: a 2012 poll and a 2016 poll each found that McConnell had the lowest home-state approval rating of any sitting senator.[174][175] With a 49% disapproval rate in 2017, McConnell had the highest disapproval rating of any senator.[176] In September 2019, the Morning Consult found that McConnell's approval rating had been underwater since the first quarter of 2017, when it was 44% positive and 47% negative. The worst rating since that time was in the fourth quarter of 2018, when he had a 38% positive rating and a 47% negative rating among Kentuckians.[177] At that time he was briefly not the least popular senator, surpassed by Claire McCaskill and Jeff Flake.[178] But as of the second quarter of 2019, McConnell's ratings were 36% positive and 50% negative. He netted −56 among Democrats, +29 among Republicans, and −24 among Independents.[177] An average of polls by the Economist/YouGov, Politico/Morning Consult, and Harvard-Harris from the end of July through August 2019 (7/31–8/27), was 23% favorable and 48% unfavorable (−25.0 spread).[179] In 2020, according to Morning Consult, Susan Collins edged out McConnell as the least popular senator with a 52% unfavorable rating from Maine voters compared to 50% for McConnell.[180] McConnell's committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows:[181] McConnell has taken conservative stances for the past several decades. During his Senate tenure, McConnell led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws,[182] culminating in the Supreme Court ruling that partially overturned the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold) in 2010. He led opposition against Obamacare,[183] first through efforts to delay or prevent the law's passage, and later to repeal or replace it, including via the American Healthcare Reform Act. McConnell has opposed stronger regulations, gun control measures and efforts to mitigate climate change. He has criticized proposed legislation by House Democrats such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All,[184] and was criticized by Nancy Pelosi for withholding votes on measures passed by the Democratic-controlled House during his time as Senate Majority Leader, including the For the People Act of 2019, the Equality Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act.[185] McConnell has supported stronger border security, free trade agreements and reductions in taxes. As Senate Majority Leader, he led the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in 2018. His foreign policy views have included support of sanctions on Cuba, Iran and Russia,[186] support of Ukraine during its invasion by Russia,[187] opposition to the Iran nuclear deal and support of Israel in its war with Hamas.[188] He voted for the Iraq Resolution, which authorized military action against Iraq,[189] and supported the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 in public.[190] Earlier in his political career, during the 1960s and 1970s, McConnell held moderate stances, including support of abortions, support of unions, and support of the civil rights movement.[191] Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, McConnell expressed his opposition to same-sex marriage stating “I’ve always felt that marriage is between one man and one woman and the Supreme Court has held otherwise. That’s the law of the land.”[192] In 1984, McConnell ran for the U.S. Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent Walter Dee Huddleston. The election race was not decided until the last returns came in, when McConnell won by 3,437 votes out of more than 1.2 million votes cast, just over 0.4%.[193] McConnell was the only Republican Senate challenger to win that year, despite Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in the presidential election.[194] McConnell's campaign was noted for a series of television campaign spots called \"Where's Dee\", which featured a group of bloodhounds trying to find Huddleston,[195][better source needed][196] implying that Huddleston's attendance record in the Senate was poor.[197][198] He was the first Republican to win a statewide election in Kentucky since 1968, and benefited from the popularity of President Ronald Reagan, up for re-election, who was supported by 60% of Kentucky voters in the same year.[44] In 1990, McConnell faced former Louisville Mayor Harvey I. Sloane, winning by 4.4%.[199] In 1996, he defeated Steve Beshear by 12.6%,[200] even as Bill Clinton narrowly carried the state. McConnell's campaign ran television ads warning voters to not \"Get BeSheared\" and included images of sheep being sheared.[198] In 2002, he was unopposed in the Republican primary. He then defeated Lois Combs Weinberg by 29.4%.[201] In 2008, McConnell faced his closest contest since 1990. He defeated Bruce Lunsford by 6%.[23] In 2014, McConnell faced Louisville businessman Matt Bevin in the Republican primary.[202] The 60.2% won by McConnell was the lowest voter support for a Kentucky U.S. senator in a primary since 1938.[203] He faced Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes in the general election, and defeated Grimes, 56.2–40.7%.[204][205] In the November 2020 general election, McConnell faced Democratic nominee Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot; and Libertarian nominee Brad Barron, a businessman and farmer.[206][207] During the campaign, McConnell and McGrath agreed to one hour-long, socially distanced debate on October 12.[208][209] McConnell was elected to his seventh term on November 3 when he defeated McGrath by nearly 20 percentage points.[210] McConnell is a Southern Baptist, baptized at age 8.[211] He was married to his first wife, Sherrill Redmon, from 1968 to 1980 and had three daughters, Porter, Eleanor (Elly), and Claire.[212][213][214] Porter McConnell is the campaign director for Take on Wall Street, a left-wing advocacy coalition.[215][216] Following her divorce from McConnell, Redmon became a feminist scholar at Smith College and director of the Sophia Smith Collection.[217][218] McConnell's second wife, whom he married in 1993, is Elaine Chao, Secretary of Labor under President George W. Bush and Secretary of Transportation under President Donald Trump.[219] In May 2019, McConnell's brother-in-law Gordon Hartogensis, who is married to Chao's sister Grace, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), a part of the Labor Department.[220][221][222] McConnell voted to confirm.[223] In February 2003, McConnell underwent a triple heart bypass surgery in relation to blocked arteries, at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.[224] In August 2019, McConnell suffered a fall at his Louisville home; he fractured his shoulder.[225] In March 2023, he was hospitalized for five days after a fall; he was treated for a concussion and a minor rib fracture,[226] and did not return to the Senate for almost six weeks.[227] In July 2023, he fell while disembarking from a plane at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.[228] On July 26, 2023, McConnell prompted worldwide media reports when he froze, unspeaking, for around 20 seconds while addressing a press conference.[229] He was escorted away by aides, but later returned and said he was \"fine\".[230] Two days after the incident, his spokespersons said that McConnell would continue in his leadership role; he is the institution's longest-serving party leader.[231] On August 30, 2023, he again froze during a press conference in Covington, Kentucky and was eventually led away by staff.[232] A day later, McConnell released a letter from the attending physician of Congress that said that he was \"medically clear\" to continue his schedule as planned;[233] the letter said that the physician had talked to McConnell and \"conferred with his neurology team\", but did not indicate that he had physically examined McConnell.[234] In 1997, McConnell founded the James Madison Center for Free Speech, a legal-defense organization based in Washington, D.C.[235][236] He was inducted into the Sons of the American Revolution on March 1, 2013.[237] He is on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service.[238] In 2018, the OpenSecrets website ranked McConnell one of the wealthiest members of the U.S. Senate, with a net worth of more than $25 million.[239] His personal wealth grew in 2008, when he and his wife received a gift worth about $5 million to about $25 million from her father, James S. C. Chao, after the death of his wife.[240] McConnell's detractors have called him by a number of nicknames, including \"Moscow Mitch\",[241] \"Cocaine Mitch\",[241] the \"Grim Reaper\",[184] \"Darth Vader\",[242] \"Rich Mitch\",[243] \"Nuclear Mitch\",[242] \"Midnight Mitch\",[244] and \"Old Crow\".[245] McConnell embraces several of them, but he has objected strenuously to \"Moscow Mitch\".[241][246] Jon Stewart repeatedly mocked McConnell on The Daily Show for resembling a turtle or tortoise.[247][248] McConnell has been portrayed by Beck Bennett in sketches on Saturday Night Live.[249] In 2017, McConnell was portrayed satirically in South Park's season 21 episode \"Doubling Down\".[250] During the 2014 election campaign, McConnell was lampooned for posting campaign B-roll footage online for use by allied PACs. Various Internet posters satirically interspersed the B-roll with footage from sitcoms and movies and with popular music. The practice of posting B-roll footage online for use by PACs or of lampooning the B-roll was termed \"McConnelling\".[251][252][253] In 2015, 2019, and 2023, Time listed McConnell as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[3][4][254]",

                "content": "Addison Mitchell \"Mitch\" McConnell, Jr. (born February 20, 1942) is the senior United States Senator from Kentucky. A member of the Republican Party, he is the Minority Leader of the Senate, succeeding Chuck Schumer. He is the longest-serving U.S. Senator in Kentucky history.[2] McConnell holds conservative positions, despite regarding as a moderate Republican early in his career. Mitch McConnell was born to Julia (née Shockley) and Addison Mitchell McConnell at Helen Keller Memorial Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama on February 20, 1942.[3][4] [5]He grew up in segregated Athens, Alabama.[6] They moved to southern Louisville, Kentucky and McConnell attended the duPont Manual High School. In 1964, he graduated with honors from the University of Louisville with a B.A. in political science. He graduated in 1967 from the University of Kentucky College of Law. In 1984, McConnell ran for the United States Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent Walter \"Dee\" Huddleston. The election race wasn't decided until the last polls returned came in, and McConnell won by a thin margin—only 5,200 votes out of more than 1.8 million votes cast, just over 0.4%.[7] McConnell was the only Republican Senate challenger to win that year, despite Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in the presidential election. Part of McConnell's success came from a series of television campaign spots called \"Where's Dee\", which featured a group of bloodhounds trying to find Huddleston,[8][9] implying that Huddleston's attendance record in the Senate was less than stellar. It is likely that he was helped by Ronald Reagan's 21-point win in Kentucky that year. His campaign bumper stickers and television ads asked voters to \"Switch to Mitch\". McConnell has repeatedly been found to have the lowest home state approval rating of any sitting senator.[10][11] McConnell is a member of the Baptist Church. His first wife was Sherrill Redmon,[12] from whom he was later divorced; they have three daughters. His second wife, whom he married in 1993, is Elaine Chao, the Secretary of Transportation under Donald Trump and the former Secretary of Labor under George W. Bush (the first Asian American woman to serve in the Cabinet). Senator McConnell's personal fortune was between $9,839,049 to $44,587,000 in 2010 and he was ranked as the 10th wealthiest member of the U.S. Senate.[13] In October 2024, the first autobiographical book, \"The Price of Power: How Mitch McConnell Mastered the Senate, Changed America, and Lost His Party\", about Mitch McConnell, will be released in the United States.[14]",

                "content": "Manage your account WASHINGTON — Outgoing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, 82, is recovering from minor injuries after he fell following Senate Republicans' weekly lunch Tuesday, his office said. “Leader McConnell tripped following lunch. He sustained a minor cut to the face and sprained his wrist. He has been cleared to resume his schedule,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. On his way to the Senate floor later Tuesday, McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters he is \"feeling good.\" He had bandages under his left eye and on his left wrist. Medical personnel were seen leaving McConnell's office just after 2 p.m. Tuesday following Senate Republicans' weekly lunch. An ambulance was spotted on Capitol grounds not far from the Senate doors at that time, but it left shortly after. \"He is fine. He's in his office,\" McConnell's deputy, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters. McConnell has had health issues in recent years. He is stepping down as minority leader after this year but will remain in the Senate next term when Thune takes over the GOP conference. McConnell last year pledged to serve out the remaining two years of his six-year Senate term, which ends in January 2027, without making an announcement beyond that. He also said he plans to use his seniority to chair the Senate Rules Committee for the next two years. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.

                "title": "Mitch McConnell: From polio survivor to political titan - BBC News",
                "content": "In an era when many politicians pride themselves on being outsiders, Mitch McConnell has a reputation as a consummate creature of the DC establishment. Representing Kentucky in the Senate since 1985, Mr McConnell has won a reputation as a shrewd and tactical campaigner - even if few have found him a particularly charismatic figure. On Wednesday he announced that he would be giving up his post as Republican leader in the US Senate, which he has held for nearly two decades, after November's elections. Mr McConnell is already the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, having been elected to the leadership post a record nine times by his fellow Senate Republicans. As leader, he's been at the helm of some of Washington's most consequential decisions. Inscrutable, adaptable and a hard-charging deal-maker, Mr McConnell has earned both begrudging admirers and loathing critics. But in recent years, the 82-year-old has faced questions about his health, and he's regularly sparred with Donald Trump and the former president's supporters. In making the announcement that he was stepping down from the leadership post, Mr McConnell said: \"It's time for the next generation of leadership.\" Addison Mitchell McConnell III was born in Alabama in 1942 to working-class parents of English and Scots-Irish descent. At the age of two, he contracted polio, which left a portion of his left leg paralysed and saw him bullied by other kids. He has credited extensive physical rehabilitation and a protective mother with making sure he could walk again, adding that his family \"almost went broke\" covering his treatment. The McConnells moved to Kentucky in 1956 and their son went on to serve as student council president both in high school and at the University of Louisville, where he graduated with honours in 1964. His first foray on Capitol Hill came as a 22-year-old intern to Republican Senator John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky - an experience that convinced him to \"give [the Senate] a shot if I ever had a chance\". It was also a period of time that he has said bolstered his commitment to civil rights. He watched Martin Luther King Jr's \"I Have a Dream\" speech from the steps of the Capitol, and stood beside his boss in the Capitol rotunda as the Voting Rights Act was signed into law. Mitch McConnell as a young senator After graduating from the University of Kentucky Law School, where he led the Student Bar Association, he went on to serve as an assistant attorney general under President Gerald Ford. In 1977, he successfully ran for judge-executive, the top political office in his home county in Kentucky. He has never lost an election since. As a young Republican from what was then a Democratic-leaning state, Mr McConnell was far more of a pragmatic centrist than he is today. When he won his first Senate race, upsetting a Democratic incumbent in 1984, it was the first time a Republican had won state-wide in Kentucky in 16 years. In the Senate, Mr McConnell gradually shifted toward the conservatism pulling his state and his party to the right. He had been supported by labour groups in his early career, but he turned his back on fights for collective bargaining rights and minimum wage increases. Under the banner of free speech, he fiercely resisted efforts to limit spending on political campaigns. And as a representative for coal-rich Kentucky, he vocally denied the impacts of global warming for years and opposed climate regulations he often claimed were a threat to the economy. In 1993, Mr McConnell married Elaine Chao, a Taiwanese-American immigrant who later joined the cabinet of Presidents George W Bush and Donald Trump. Mr McConnell with his wife Elaine Chao His profile grew after he was elected by his Republican colleagues in 2006 to lead their Senate caucus. As Barack Obama entered the White House, and the populist Tea Party movement reshaped the Republican Party in its anti-establishment, norm-breaking image, Mr McConnell took the hint. He railed against the president's signature healthcare and financial reforms, and set records with his use of a procedural tool called the filibuster to thwart the Obama agenda, helping transform a collegial Senate into the fiercely partisan chamber it is today. In 2010, he made headlines when he famously declared his party's \"number one priority\" was to make Mr Obama a one-term president. But he also knew when to reach across the aisle for compromise. In 2012, he cut an 11th-hour deal with then-Vice President Joe Biden to save the country from a catastrophic default on its public debt. The following year, his meetings with Democratic leaders helped end a government shutdown. Republicans retook control of the Senate in 2014 and Mr McConnell fulfilled his dream of becoming the chamber's majority leader. The pattern of Mr McConnell routinely blocking Democratic-led initiatives in the Senate has earned him the moniker of the \"Grim Reaper\", a nickname he embraces. Perhaps his most famous act of obstruction came in 2016 when he refused to allow Mr Obama, in his final year in office, to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat. The move infuriated Democrats, but paid off the following year when the newly elected President Trump filled the seat with a conservative jurist. The Trump years saw two more justices added to the nation's top court, cementing a 6-3 conservative majority that has since made consequential rulings on abortion, gun rights and several other issues. The majority leader's intense focus on transforming the judiciary also contributed to Mr Trump appointing more than 200 new federal judges during his four-year term. Mr McConnell had a consequential, albeit uneasy, alliance with President Donald Trump But the McConnell-Trump alliance was uneasy from the outset and their increasing disagreements burst into the open after the then-president falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from him. Mr McConnell slammed him as being \"morally responsible\" for the January 2021 attack on the US Capitol, although he did not vote to impeach Mr Trump over it. The feud has only intensified since then, with Mr Trump attacking Mr McConnell's wife and the senator mocking his \"diminished\" status. Mr McConnell has never faced serious opposition for his Senate seat or his leadership role, but surveys show he is one of the most unpopular politicians in the country. His tactics have earned him few Democratic fans, though one Kentucky colleague once described him as \"the Tiger Woods of politics\", while the right flank of his own party increasingly reviles someone they view as an establishment swamp monster. Recently he has advocated rather forcefully for his party to keep defending Ukraine in its war against Russia and to turn away from its Trumpian inclinations towards a platform with broader appeal to voters. But like the presidential front-runners, he has faced increasing questions about his health and advancing age. This video can not be played Watch: McConnell freezes during press event The lawmaker missed nearly six weeks of Senate votes last year after falling at a DC hotel and suffering a concussion. US media also reported on three other falls in 2023, with NBC News reporting he sometimes uses a wheelchair to navigate airports. And in two other incidents, he froze abruptly at press conferences. On both occasions, his office said he had simply paused because he \"felt light-headed\". The reports led to speculation about whether he was still capable of the job. But it now appears that instead of facing another leadership contest after the upcoming elections, he has decided to give up the post at a time of his own choosing. Mr McConnell has, however, said he will serve out the remainder of his Senate term, which runs until January 2027.

                "content": "Jimmy Butler III (born September 14, 1989) is an American professional basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"Jimmy Buckets\", he is a six-time NBA All-Star, a five-time All-NBA Team member, and a five-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. He won a gold medal as a member of the 2016 U.S. Olympic team. Butler played one year of college basketball for Tyler Junior College before transferring to Marquette University. He was selected with the 30th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. In 2015, he was named the NBA Most Improved Player. After six seasons in Chicago, he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in June 2017, and was then again traded in November 2018, this time to the Philadelphia 76ers. In July 2019, he signed with the Heat. During his first season with the team, Butler reached the NBA Finals. In 2021, he led the league in steals. In 2023, Butler and the eighth-seeded Heat played in the 2023 NBA Finals, their second appearance in four years. Butler was born in Houston on September 14, 1989.[1][2] His father, Jimmy Butler Jr., left the family when Butler was an infant. When he was 13 years old and living in the Houston suburb of Tomball, his mother kicked him out of the house. As Butler remembered it in a 2011 interview, she told him, \"I don't like the look of you. You gotta go.\" He moved between the homes of various friends, staying for a few weeks at a time before moving to another house.[3] Butler maintains a relationship with his parents, saying, \"I don't hold grudges. I still talk to my family. My mom. My father. We love each other. That's never going to change.\"[4][5] In a summer basketball league before his senior year at Tomball High School, he was noticed by Jordan Leslie, a freshman football and basketball player at the school, who challenged him to a three-point shooting contest. The two became friends, and Butler stayed at Leslie's house for a few months, Leslie's mother and stepfather had six other children between them. Butler would later say, \"They accepted me into their family. And it wasn't because of basketball. She [Michelle Lambert, Leslie's mother] was just very loving. She just did stuff like that. I couldn't believe it.\"[3] As a junior at Tomball High, Butler averaged 10 points per game. As a senior and team captain in 2006–07, Butler averaged 19.9 points and 8.7 rebounds per game and was subsequently voted his team's most valuable player. Butler was not recruited coming out of high school and chose to attend Tyler Junior College in Tyler, Texas. After his freshman season at Tyler Junior College, where he had averaged 18.1 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per game, Butler received interest from Division I programs. Considered a two-star recruit by 247Sports.com,[6] he was listed as the No. 127 junior college prospect in 2008.[7] Butler accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Marquette, where, as a sophomore in the 2008–09 season, he averaged 5.6 points and 3.9 rebounds per game and recorded a free-throw percentage of 76.8%. He moved into the starting lineup as a junior during the 2009–10 season to average 14.7 points and 6.4 rebounds per game and received All-Big East Honorable Mention honors. Butler had two game-winning shots versus UConn and St. John's, to help Marquette finish 11–7 in the Big East and earn its fifth consecutive NCAA tournament appearance. As a senior in 2010–11, he averaged 15.7 points per game and received All-Big East Honorable Mention for the second straight year. Butler was selected with the 30th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls.[8] He played 42 games during the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season.[9] The following season, he played all 82 games for the Bulls. Butler played limited minutes to begin the 2012–13 season. His minutes increased over the second half of the season and he started in all 12 playoff games.[9][10] In an April 9, 2013, regular season game, Butler scored a then career-high 28 points in a 101–98 loss against the Toronto Raptors.[9][11] Two days later, he recorded his first NBA double-double game with 22 points and a then career-high 14 rebounds against the New York Knicks.[9] In the 2013–14 season, Butler missed 15 games due to injury, he played in 67 games.[9] He averaged a career-high 38.7 minutes per game, which ranked first in the NBA.[9] He scored a season-high 26 points against the Memphis Grizzlies on December 30.[9] He set a franchise record when he played 60:20 in a triple-overtime game against the Orlando Magic on January 15 and finished with 21 points, seven rebounds and six assists.[9] At the season's end, he was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team.[12] On November 25, 2014, Butler tied a career high with 32 points in a loss to the Denver Nuggets.[13] On December 3, 2014, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for games played in October/November.[14] He set a new career high of 35 points in a 103–97 win over the New York Knicks on December 18.[15] On January 29, 2015, Butler was named a reserve for the Eastern Conference in the 2015 NBA All-Star Game.[16] On March 2, 2015, he was ruled out for three to six weeks with a left elbow injury.[17] He returned to play on March 23 against the Charlotte Hornets, recording 19 points and 9 rebounds in a 98–86 win.[18] On April 20, Butler set a playoff career high for the second straight game, scoring 31 points in the Bulls' 91–82 win over the Milwaukee Bucks to take a 2–0 lead in their first-round series.[19] On April 25, Butler again set a playoff career high with 33 points, in a Bulls' 92–90 loss to the Bucks, holding their series lead to 3–2.[20] They went on to win Game 6 of the series, moving them onto the semi-finals where they lost 4–2 to the Cleveland Cavaliers.

He finished with three points on 1-for-13 shooting.[47] On February 25, 2017, he recorded his third career triple-double with 18 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 117–99 win over the Cleveland

prioritizing the stretch run of the season and thought the rest would benefit him.[59] In the Timberwolves' first game after the All-Star break, on February 23 against the Houston Rockets, Butler left the game late in the third quarter with a right knee injury.[60] Two days later, he underwent meniscus surgery and was ruled out indefinitely.[61] Butler returned to play on April 6 and scored 18

usual starters.[67] When a trade was not achieved prior to the start of the regular season, Butler opted to play for Minnesota in 2018–19.[66] He appeared in 10 of the Timberwolves' first 13 games before being traded in early November.[65][68] On November 12, 2018, Butler was traded, along with Justin Patton, to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario

76ers force a Game 7.[77] In Game 7, he made a layup with 4.2 seconds in the fourth quarter to tie the score at 90–all, but the 76ers eventually lost the game 92–90 following Kawhi Leonard's game-winning buzzer beater.[78] On July 6, 2019, Butler signed with the Miami Heat via a sign and trade with the 76ers in a four-team trade.[79] On December 9, Butler was named Eastern Conference

reached the NBA Finals after defeating the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games, earning Butler his first finals appearance.[86] In Game 3 of the NBA Finals, Butler finished with 40 points, 11 rebounds, and 13 assists and became the third player in finals history to record a 40+ point triple-double, joining LeBron James (then with Cleveland) in 2015 and Jerry West with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1969.[87] Butler also became the first player to have more points, rebounds and assists in a finals game than James, who finished with 25 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists.

In the playoffs, the Heat were eliminated in a four-game sweep by the Milwaukee Bucks who would go on to win the NBA Finals.

He became the first player in NBA postseason history to meet all of those benchmarks since steals and blocks were first recorded in 1974.

MILWAUKEE (AP) Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 37 points, Damian Lillard had nine of his 28 in the final minute and the Milwaukee Bucks returned to the NBA Cup semifinals in Las Vegas by beating the Orlando Magic 114-109 on Tuesday night. Milwaukee reached the semifinals of the in-season tournament in Las Vegas last December and will be the only returning team in Year 2. They will play Saturday against the winner of Wednesday’s quarterfinal between the New York Knicks and Atlanta Hawks. Jalen Suggs led a short-handed Orlando team with 32 points but missed a potential go-ahead 3-pointer with 12 seconds left. Lillard was fouled and sank two free throws with 9.1 seconds remaining and Suggs missed a potential tying 3. Antetokounmpo then made both free throws with 5 seconds left and the Bucks held on. The Magic were missing forwards Paolo Banchero (torn right oblique), Jonathan Isaac (right hamstring strain) and Franz Wagner, who suffered a torn right oblique on Friday against Philadelphia; along with guard Gary Harris (left hamstring strain). Magic: Orlando’s bench scored 28 points in the first half, including 13 by Moritz Wagner and 10 from Anthony Black. But Wagner did not score in the second half. Bucks: Bobby Portis helped the Bucks erase an early 11-point deficit as he hit his first seven shots and scored 16 points in the first half. He finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds. Bucks forward Khris Middleton registered three consecutive assists - the first two on passes to Antetokounmpo and the third to set up a 3-pointer by Gary Trent Jr - as the Bucks took a 78-70 lead as part of an 11-0 Milwaukee run. Middleton did not score but had eight assists. Antetokounmpo extended his streak to 22 straight games with 20 or more points on 50% shooting, the longest streak to open a season in league history and the third-longest at any point in a season (Shaquille O’Neal and Zion Williamson, both 25 games). Antetokounmpo was 15 of 24 from the field. The Magic will play New York or Atlanta on Sunday. Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

When Micah Parsons and DeMarvion Overshown have shared the field in 2024 for the Cowboys, it's led to good defense being played, and highlight plays being made. As each game goes by, DeMarvion Overshown seemingly finds a new way to produce a \"wow\" play for the Dallas defense, and is establishing his identity as one of their best players. He's not only impacting games for the Dallas Cowboys but, as seen in the Thanksgiving win over the Giants, DeMarvion Overshown is a force of nature. DeMarvion Overshown is flying around in Dallas' defense in his first NFL season, and doesn't look to be slowing down anytime soon. The Cowboys have shown improvements defensively in 'spurts' over the last few weeks, but now they need to find consistency. Things didn't end well for the Dallas Cowboys against the Philadelphia Eagles, but what DeMarvion Overshown did can not be dismissed or overlooked. Though he's been a revelation at the linebacker position in only six NFL games, DeMarvion Overshown understands the Dallas Cowboys' defense needs to get better, and fast. The Cowboys were able to use a \"spy\" on defense for a running QB in Cleveland, although Sunday will be a different beast in Lamar Jackson. Do the Cowboys have plans to use a spy again? Welcome to \"The Science Lab\", a place where football facts and in-depth analysis always triumph over feelings. The things DeMarvion Overshown put on film in his NFL debut against the Cleveland Browns has the Dallas Cowboys grinning from ear to ear, but he's already moving on to Week 2. Among the Cowboys players making their NFL debuts, who had the most impact in the win at Cleveland? The season opener will mark the first time DeMarvion Overshown and Marist Liufau take the field for the Dallas Cowboys, and they provided deep insight into the outlook versus the Browns. It's been a long journey back for DeMarvion Overshown, but he's locked and loaded for his first NFL regular season game for the Dallas Cowboys — a lifelong dream made true. Almost a year removed from a season-ending torn ACL in the preseason, DeMarvion Overshown reflected on his journey back to the field on Sunday afternoon. With the team getting settled into padded practices in Oxnard, Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones called out a few early training camp favorites. There is a ton of excitement beaming from the aura of DeMarvion Overshown as he prepares to put the pads back on for the Dallas Cowboys in his return from injury. DeMarvion Overshown made his return on Thursday from a torn ACL suffered last preseason, as he takes a more developed game on and off the field into Oxnard. DeMarvion Overshown is returning from a devastating injury as a second-year player and Damone Clark can empathize — offering priceless advice to his fellow linebacker. From the addition of Erick Kendricks to the return of DeMarvion Overshown and lots in-between, the linebackers group owns a laundry list of questions on the Dallas Cowboys' depth chart. When last DeMarvion Overshown took to the practice field, he was lighter and leaner than the version the Dallas Cowboys will see in 2024 training camp, in his return from injury. With OTAs beginning on Tuesday, head coach Mike McCarthy shared the latest on the injury front with multiple players on both sides of the ball. A few players have switched jersey numbers this offseason, including Jalen Tolbert, who has moved to No. 1, along with a couple of linebackers that went into the teens.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. FRISCO, Texas -- Things have not gone well for the Dallas Cowboys this year, especially in the injury department. And they got even worse on that front Monday night. Linebacker DeMarvion Overshown, who has been one of the team's few bright spots this season, suffered a knee injury early in the fourth quarter of the Cowboys' \"Monday Night Football\" loss against the Bengals. That injury will require surgery and put an end to his season, owner Jerry Jones told 105.3 The Fan on Tuesday. And according to coach Mike McCarthy, there's a chance Overshown misses the entire 2025 season, too. \"DeMarvion is getting ready to have a big surgery in front of him,\" McCarthy said Tuesday. \"Significant knee injury. You could feel it on the sidelines. Just being on the field for part of the exam, I knew it was serious. but, obviously, his physical and football talents speak for itself. He's just such a bright light. He's got a great, infectious personality. Tough, tough young man. We're definitely going to miss him. He's got a long road of rehab in front of him. He will obviously be loved and supported every step of the way.\" ESPN reported on Tuesday that Overshown tore his ACL, MCL and PCL. With that severe of an injury, McCarthy felt it was \"fair\" to say Overshown could miss the entire 2025 season given how late in 2024 his knee injury occurred. \"I think that's fair. The time of year. Obviously we're in December. I think like anything, you have the surgery and the rehab is a long process. I think that's very realistic,\" McCarthy said. Overshown got rolled up on by multiple players while trying to wade through the muck and make a tackle, and his right knee got pinned under the scrum of bodies. Overshown, who missed his entire rookie season with a torn left ACL, was helped off the field by trainers and quickly ruled out. After the game, McCarthy labeled the injury as serious while adding that the initial reports did not look encouraging. Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons was reduced to tears when discussing Overshown's injury. \"He's like my little bro,\" Parsons said. \"He don't deserve that, he really don't. To understand what he's going to have to have to go through. ... He's so talented, the year he was having. I really don't think it's fair.\" The 24-year-old linebacker ends his 2024 season with 90 tackles, five sacks, an interception, a pick-six, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery for a Cowboys team that has dealt with a barrage of injuries on both sides of the ball. Prior to getting hurt, Overshown had a key pass breakup that forced a turnover on downs. \"We're just seeing the tip of the iceberg, really,\" McCarthy recently said of Overshown. \"I'm so impressed with him, and in his consistency, in his approach, and that's just going to keep putting him in the position to progress.\" Dallas defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer sees parallels between Overshown and Cowboys Ring of Honor defensive back Darren Woodson. \"Different positions, but kind of like Darren Woodson. Just the impact, the different things he can do and the speed that he has and physicality,\" Zimmer said of Overshown on Tuesday. \"He would probably be the closest that I can think of off the top of my head.\" © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "DallasCowboys.com Staff Writer ARLINGTON, Texas – In a year where the Cowboys have already faced injuries to stars like Dak Prescott, Zack Martin and DeMarcus Lawrence, the injury bug bit yet again on one of Dallas' young stars in DeMarvion Overshown during a 27-20 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. Overshown's right leg was rolled up on by a Bengals offensive lineman in the fourth quarter. He stayed on the ground in serious pain, and his teammates immediately motioned for help from the training staff on the sidelines. Following the loss, head coach Mike McCarthy confirmed that Overshown's injury was severe. \"It's of serious nature I'm told, that's really all I know. It didn't look good.\" McCarthy said. Overshown will undergo more testing on Tuesday to determine the extent of his knee injury. Before the start of his rookie season last year, Overshown tore his ACL in his left knee, where he was forced to missed the entirety of the season. If this injury keeps him out of Dallas' last four games, the Cowboys would be losing their second leading player in both tackles and sacks. Once Overshown was helped back into the locker room, there was a notable energy shift for the Dallas defense as his teammates and coaches felt his absence, and the thought of the severity of the injury hit them hard. \"I think the whole sideline felt that because it didn't look good…\" McCarthy said. \"I know it definitely hit a lot of the guys.\" In the locker room after the game, Micah Parsons had tears in his eyes talking about the injury to his new partner in crime and \"little bro,\" who he's meshed extremely well with when both are on the field at the same time. \"He don't deserve that. He don't. That's my little bro, man…\" Parsons said. \"He's been through so much. It's not fair to him.\" Overshown took to social media after the game seemingly confirming the severity of his injury in a post on X. \"Wouldn't want this for anyone else! One of God's toughest soldiers… Keep me in your prayers…\" Overshown said in his post. Cowboys special teams coordinator John \"Bones\" Fassel explained the ins and outs of what occurred during Dallas' blocked punt late in the fourth quarter that was touched by Amani Oruwariye and recovered by the Bengals to set up their go-ahead drive. DeMarvion Overshown will undergo surgery and begin his road to recovery, and the Dallas Cowboys know exactly what they're losing to his injury. As @spags52 writes in his postgame column, yesterday's loss was enough to make you sick with so many \"what ifs\" not going the Cowboys way. Things are starting to come together for Rico Dowdle in 2024, and the Bengals couldn't get a handle on him — despite defeating the Cowboys. Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones confirmed on 105.3 The Fan that DeMarvion Overshown would undergo season-ending knee surgery after injuring his right leg on Monday night against the Bengals. Micah Parsons could hardly hold back tears after the Cowboys' loss to the Bengals — overcome by emotion, also worried about DeMarvion Overshown. After a game-changing mistake, the Cowboys teammates showed support for Amani Oruwariye in the post-game locker room. The postgame locker room told the emotional story of a game that could have went to the Dallas Cowboys, but found a last-minute way to escape them. Plays that might be forgotten include the two chances to recover fourth-quarter fumbles on back-to-back plays. Desperately fighting to keep their playoff hopes alive, the Cowboys fall late to the Bengals, 27-20, while suffering injuries to even more key players. In life, everyone needs a buddy.
