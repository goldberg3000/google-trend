### [Notre Dame vs. Penn State where to watch: TV channel, Orange Bowl kickoff time, College Football Playoff odds - CBSSports.com](https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/notre-dame-vs-penn-state-where-to-watch-tv-channel-orange-bowl-kickoff-time-college-football-playoff-odds/)

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The semifinals of the first-ever 12-team College Football Playoff begin Thursday with a blockbuster Orange Bowl matchup between (6) Penn State and (7) Notre Dame. Both teams have leaned heavily on their defenses and run games to reach the doorstep of the College Football Playoff National Championship. They will pit their similar styles against each other in what appears to be an evenly matched game. Penn State will have a two-day rest advantage after the Nittany Lions beat Boise State 31-14 on Dec. 31 in the Fiesta Bowl. The Fighting Irish were originally scheduled to play on Jan. 1 but had their Sugar Bowl showdown with Georgia was pushed back a day following the tragic attack in New Orleans. The Fighting Irish outlasted the Bulldogs 23-10 in a physically demanding contest that showcased the toughness which has come to define the program under third-year coach Marcus Freeman. At 38 years old Freeman is the youngest coach among the four remaining CFP teams. He will pit his wit against 11-year veteran James Franklin. Franklin has already guided Penn State to a record 13 wins. Adding a 14th on this stage and against an opponent of this caliber would solidify 2024 as the best season of his tenure. Date: Thursday, Jan. 9 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami, FloridaTV: ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free) Riley Leonard, QB, Notre Dame: The Duke transfer elevated Notre Dame's offense this season. His mobility makes Notre Dame a nightmare to defend. Though he's not an elite passer, Leonard has completed a career-high 66.5% of his throws this season and proved himself capable of making plays through the air when needed. Drew Allar, QB, Penn State: First-year offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki has helped elevate Allar's game. His yards per attempt average has jumped from 6.8 in 2023 to 8.6 this year. While the Nittany Lions are throwing the football less than they did in 2023, they are generating more explosive plays. That aerial competency was on display early in a quarterfinal win over Boise State as Allar dissected the Broncos with a hot start that included big passing plays. Xavier Watts, S, Notre Dame: Watts is tied for second nationally with six interceptions. The consensus first-team All-American is a team captain and fifth-year player who has been a mainstay on the back of the Fighting Irish's defense for three seasons. He's totaled 13 career picks and is regarded as a potential mid-round selection in the 2025 NFL Draft. With star corner Benjamin Morrison out for the season due to injury, Watts' leadership in the secondary is critical. Abdul Carter, DE, Penn State: Carter has been an absolute menace off the edge for Penn State, ranking No. 2 nationally in tackles for loss with 22. He's been wrecking opposing offenses since stepping foot on campus in 2022 as a four-star prospect and has blossomed into a likely first-round NFL Draft prospect in the process. Though the junior has not officially declared for the draft, he ranks No. 8 in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings. Carter's injury status will be a key issue to monitor after he missed most of the quarterfinal win over Boise State with an apparent left arm/shoulder issue. Jeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame: Notre Dame's leading rusher has been dealing with a knee injury that he suffered in the regular-season finale against USC. The injury limited Love to just six carries in a 23-10 Sugar Bowl win against Georgia and limited him in practice leading up to the Orange Bowl. However, the talented sophomore is expected to be available against Penn State. In addition to rushing for more than1,000 yards, Love is also a receiving threat with 25 catches for 226 yards and two touchdowns. Notre Dame used a kickoff return for a touchdown and costly Georgia turnovers to outlast Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. It was an impressive showing, but was it replicable? The Fighting Irish enter the Orange Bowl with two fewer days of rest than the Nittany Lions, and that could make a difference considering how physical this game will be. Penn State wants to run the football, and Notre Dame is still grappling with the absence of star defensive lineman Rylie Mills. The Nittany Lions have demonstrated offensive improvement this season under Kotelnicki and have enough versatility to keep the Fighting Irish off balance in what should be a tight game.

Penn State (13-2) took care of No. 11 SMU and No. 3 Boise State in the first two rounds, overwhelming the opposition with a suffocating defense. The sixth-seeded Nittany Lions have forced seven turnovers — keyed by six interceptions — through two games. Similarly, the seventh-seeded Fighting Irish (13-1) breezed through their first two CFP matchups, notching victories over No. 10 Indiana and No. 2 Georgia.

### [What is national day of mourning? Explaining the Jimmy Carter honor](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/09/what-national-day-of-mourning-jimmy-carter/77431827007/)

The late former President Jimmy Carter will be honored with a national day of mourning Thursday on the same day as a state funeral is planned in Washington, D.C. Services began Saturday to honor Carter, who died Dec. 29 at the age of 100. After lying in repose at the Carter Presidential Center in Georgia, Carter's remains arrived Tuesday in D.C., where he is scheduled to lie in state at the United States Capitol rotunda ahead of funeral services. President Joe Biden declared Jan. 9 as a national day of mourning for Carter, who served one term as U.S. president from 1977 to 1981 before becoming a renowned world humanitarian. Here's what to know about a national day of mourning, including the history of the honor, what it means and what federal agencies will be closed Thursday. When is Jimmy Carter's funeral?See full schedule as remains are transported to DC this week A national day of mourning is a day to honor and pay respects to a revered public figure who has died, most commonly a U.S. president. In the case of Jimmy Carter, the national day of mourning will be held on the same day as the 39th president's funeral at Washington National Cathedral. The most recent president to be honored with a national day of mourning was George H.W. Bush after his death in December 2018. The tradition began in 1865 with a one-day government shutdown six weeks after Abraham Lincoln's assassination, according to the New York Times. While several presidents have been honored with a day of mourning in the subsequent years, others have been commemorated as well. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were each honored with a national day of mourning after they were assassinated in 1968. President Biden, who will deliver a eulogy at the funeral, has also ordered for U.S. flags to fly at half-staff for Carter for 30 days following his death. The honor is one granted to all sitting or former presidents under a 1954 proclamation signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. For Carter, flags will fly at half-staff – or half-mast, in the case of ships and naval stations – until Jan. 28. That means the flags will still be at half-staff during President-elect Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. Biden issued an executive order Dec. 30 that “all executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government shall be closed on Jan. 9,” except those necessary for “national security, defense, or other public need.” That means federal employees will have a paid day off. Here's a list of agencies and services that will briefly close for the day: Eric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY. Reach him at elagatta@gannett.com

Success For Each Child & Eliminate the Opportunity Gap by Leading with Racial Equity The National Day of Mourning takes place each year on the fourth Thursday of November, and is a day that provides a respectful counterpoint to Thanksgiving by recognizing that a historical moment may have been assumed to be a joyful occasion on one side, but it was also the catalyst for tragedy on the other. This is why, for many in the Indigenous and Native American community, this date is not a celebrated beginning, but an ending of an era, and an all too brutal reminder of genocide, theft, and centuries of active violence and erasure against our country’s ancient Indigenous culture. Most of all, the day remembers the unjust treatment of the Indigenous and Native American people since that first Plymouth landing in 1620. Commemorated with events, marches, speeches, and protests, the National Day of Mourning honors the deaths of millions while also providing the catharsis of remembrance and spiritual connection – and a call to action against the continued racism and oppression experienced by Indigenous and Native Americans today.

September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, offering an ideal opportunity to speak out and raise awareness on this vital topic — an awareness that is urgently required, with suicide the tenth leading cause of death among adults in the U.S. — and the second leading cause of death among children and young people aged 10–24. Unfortunately, these rates are increasing, and those who are young, LGBTQ, or BIPOC are especially vulnerable. LGBTQ youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide, while transgender adults, meanwhile, are almost 12 times more likely than the general population to attempt suicide. Celebrated every August 26, Women’s Equality Day provides an essential and poignant remembrance of the passage of women’s suffrage in the U.S. It is also a reminder of the heroic women who suffered violence, torture, death and discrimination as they fought for equal rights for women, including the right to vote. Created by UNESCO to memorialize the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade, Slavery Remembrance Day, also known as International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, is observed on August 23 worldwide. Upon this day, it's important that we remember that this observance is not only a reminder of the horrors of slavery as we honor its victims—it's also about our dedication across the globe to ensure that slavery, and the racism that caused it, is abolished once and for all. Celebrated each August 14, Navajo Code Talkers Day honors the courageous achievements of the over 400 Navajo men who were recruited to the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II. Unfortunately today, K-12 Education is a declining state priority: Immediately following the McCleary “Solution,” more than half of Washington's general fund budget was dedicated to K-12 education. Since then, K-12 spending in the state’s general fund budget has continued to grow but K-12 education is no longer the funding priority. Commemorating the historic meeting of the first United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations in 1982, International Day of the World’s Indigenous People (August 9) provides us with the chance to promote the rights of Indigenous People worldwide, while also amplifying their voices, cultures, and accomplishments. In these days of increased concern over climate change, the knowledge and commitment of many indigenous peoples to sustainability and biodiversity may in fact prove crucial to protecting the earth for future generations. As a haunting reminder of the destructive power of the atomic bomb, August 6 is Hiroshima Day, when the city of Hiroshima holds the Peace Memorial Ceremony to mourn and commemorate the victims of the detonation of the atomic bomb in that city by the United States on August 6, 1945. Far too often, the history books seem to focus on the men who made the impacts, the men who made the achievements—and then men who looked to the stars. Yet throughout history, the eyes of women have focused on the stars as intensively as men, and to them belong many great achievements and discoveries as they played essential roles in a variety of scientific and astronomical breakthroughs. Which is why, every August 1, we celebrate Women Astronomers Day. © 2022 Puget Sound Educational Service District

### [National Day of Mourning (United States protest) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Day_of_Mourning_(United_States_protest))

The National Day of Mourning is an annual demonstration, held on the fourth Thursday in November, that aims to educate the public about Native Americans in the United States, notably the Wampanoag and other tribes of the Eastern United States; dispel myths surrounding the Thanksgiving story in the United States; and raise awareness toward historical and ongoing struggles facing Native American tribes. The first National Day of Mourning demonstration was held in 1970 after Frank "Wamsutta" James's speaking invitation was rescinded from a Massachusetts Thanksgiving Day celebration commemorating the 350th anniversary of the landing of the Mayflower. James instead delivered his speech on Cole's Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts next to a statue of Ousamequin, where he described Native American perspectives on the Thanksgiving celebrations. The gathering became an annual event organized by the United American Indians of New England (UAINE) and coincides with both Thanksgiving Day in the United States and with Unthanksgiving Day, an annual ceremony held on Alcatraz Island in California. In the fall of 1970, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts held a commemorative Thanksgiving celebration on the 350th anniversary of the first landing of the Mayflower. The event's organizers, including Governor Francis Sargent, invited Frank "Wamsutta" James to speak at the event. James was the leader of the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head and president of the Federated Eastern Indian League.[1][2][3][4] The event's organizers requested to review James' speech in advance of the event. Once it had been reviewed, James was informed that he would not be permitted to give the speech as written. Of particular dispute was James's depiction of the winter of 1620-21, in which Pilgrims scavenged corn and beans found in burial grounds in a desperate bid to fend off starvation; James had planned to use his speech to accuse the Pilgrims of grave robbing and theft.[5] An alternate speech, written by the event's public relations team, was provided to him.[3][2][4] A representative from the Department of Commerce and Development explained to James that According to a recollection from Tall Oak, who continues to participate in modern National Days of Mourning, the event organizers anticipated that James's accusations would have been rejected by most of those in attendance, had he been allowed to issue them: "we can’t allow you to read that (be)cause 90% of the people would walk out."[5] Wamsutta Frank James, Tall Oak Weeden, Gary Parker, Shirley Mills, Rayleen Bey, and several other people organized speakers, recruited attendees on a national scale, and arranged accommodations for out-of-town guests. The first National Day of Mourning event was held on Thanksgiving Day, November 26, 1970, on Cole's Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts. James delivered an amended speech[1] beside a statue of Ousamequin, including You the white man are celebrating an anniversary.

James' speech was one of the first public criticisms of the Thanksgiving story from Native American groups.[2] The United American Indians of New England (UAINE), founded by James in 1970, continues to organize the annual National Day of Mourning rally at Cole's Hill.[6] The event's objectives include At the 1995 event, protestors dumped sand and seaweed on Plymouth Rock as part of the demonstration. In 1997, police attacked peaceful National Day of Mourning marchers, which included the use of pepper spray. Twenty-five marchers were arrested and charged with misdemeanor as well as felony crimes. Plymouth agreed to drop the charges in a 1998 settlement with UAINE. The National Day of Mourning protest is held annually at Cole's Hill and is attended by several hundred participants.[9][4] Estimates of attendance in 2021 range from 1,000 – 2,000.[10] Frank James' son Roland Moonanum James continued to be involved in the event until his death in December 2020[11][2], and Frank's granddaughter Kisha James helps organize it in her role as UAINE youth coordinator. Mahtowin Munro has been co-leader since the 1990s.[9] During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rally was held both in-person and virtually, and over 1600 people tuned in to the livestream and more than 20,000 to the online video.[9]

克利夫兰骑士队，通常被称为骑士，是一支位于克利夫兰的美国职业篮球队。骑士队作为东部联盟中央赛区成员，参加美国国家篮球协会（NBA）的比赛。该球队于1970年作为一支扩张球队开始比赛，与波特兰开拓者队和布法罗勇士队一起。主场比赛最初于1970年至1974年在克利夫兰竞技场举行，之后于1974年至1994年在里奇菲尔德体育馆举行。自1994年以来，骑士队在克利夫兰市中心的火箭抵押贷款球馆进行主场比赛，该球馆与美国冰球联盟的克利夫兰怪兽队共享。丹·吉尔伯特自2005年3月起拥有该球队。骑士队在他们的首个赛季中以15连败开局，并在早期几年苦苦挣扎，在前五个赛季中从未排名高于东部联盟第六。球队在1976年赢得了他们的第一个中央赛区冠军，这也标志着球队历史上第一个胜率赛季和季后赛之旅，他们晋级到东部联盟决赛。该特许经营权于1980年被特德·斯蒂皮恩收购。斯蒂皮恩作为老板的任期以六次教练变更、有问题的交易和选秀决定以及糟糕的出席率为标志，导致1500万美元的财务损失。骑士队在这三个赛季中取得了66胜180负的战绩，并经历了跨越1981-82赛季和1982-83赛季的24连败。乔治和戈登·冈德在1983年收购了球队。在20世纪80年代后期和整个90年代的大部分时间里，骑士队一直是季后赛的有力竞争者——由马克·普莱斯和布拉德·道蒂等球员领衔——并在1992年晋级到东部联盟决赛。然而，在球队在1997-98赛季进入季后赛之后，骑士队连续六个赛季未能进入季后赛。克利夫兰在2003年的选秀中获得了第一顺位选秀权，并选中了勒布朗·詹姆斯。在詹姆斯和扎伊德鲁纳斯·伊尔戈斯卡斯的带领下，骑士队在2005年再次成为季后赛的常客。他们在2007年首次进入NBA总决赛，此前他们赢得了球队历史上第一个东部联盟冠军。在接下来的三个赛季中未能重返NBA总决赛后，詹姆斯在2010年加入了迈阿密热火队。因此，骑士队在2010-11赛季以联盟垫底的成绩结束，经历了26连败，这是NBA历史上第三长的连败。然而，在2010年至2014年间，球队在NBA选秀抽签中三次获得第一顺位选秀权——第一次是在2011年，他们选中了凯里·欧文，第二次是在2013年和2014年。在与热火队合作了四个赛季，并在2011-12赛季和2012-13赛季连续获得冠军后，詹姆斯在2014年重返骑士队，并带领球队连续四年进入NBA总决赛。在2016年，骑士队赢得了他们的第一个NBA总冠军，标志着克利夫兰自1964年以来首次赢得主要体育赛事冠军。2016年NBA总决赛战胜金州勇士队的胜利，标志着总决赛历史上首次有球队在1-3落后的情况下逆转夺冠。骑士队共23次进入季后赛，赢得过7个中央赛区冠军、5个东部联盟冠军和1个NBA冠军。骑士队在1970-71赛季作为一支扩张球队开始比赛。他们在前五个赛季中都创下了负场记录，然后在1976年赢得了他们的第一个分区冠军。1976年的球队由奥斯汀·卡尔、鲍比“宾果”史密斯、吉姆·乔恩斯、迪克·斯奈德、奈特·瑟蒙德和主教练比尔·菲奇领衔。他们以“里奇菲尔德奇迹”而闻名，当时骑士队在东部联盟半决赛中以4-3战胜了华盛顿子弹队。他们在第七场比赛中以87-85获胜，斯奈德在比赛结束前4秒投进了一球。

### [Scouse - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouse)

Scouse (/skaʊs/ 斯考斯)，正式名称为利物浦英语[2]或默西塞德郡英语[3][4][5]，是与利物浦市和周围的利物浦城市地区相关的英语口音和方言。Scouse 口音非常独特，因为它受到通过利物浦码头抵达的爱尔兰和威尔士移民的强烈影响，以及同样使用码头的斯堪的纳维亚水手的强烈影响[6]，因此与英格兰其他地区的口音几乎没有共同点[7]。来自利物浦的人被称为利物浦人，但通常被称为Scousers；这个名字来自scouse，一种源自斯堪的纳维亚式lobscouse的炖菜，水手和当地人都会吃[8][9][10][11]。自 1950 年代以来，利物浦的发展使这种口音蔓延到附近的地区，如朗科恩和斯凯尔默斯代尔镇[12]。Scouse 中存在差异：利物浦市中心和北部街区的口音通常被描述为快速、尖锐和鼻音[13]，而利物浦南部郊区发现的“披头士风格”的口音通常被称为缓慢、柔和和深沉[14]。流行的口语显示出与以前在利物浦发现的历史悠久的兰开夏郡方言越来越大的偏差[12]，以及这种口音在更广泛区域的影响力不断增强[7][15][16][17][18]。Scouse 经常被其他英国人认为是英国最不受欢迎的口音之一，因为它很难，但相反，它在人们认为快乐友好的英国口音民意调查中表现非常出色[19]。Scouse 一词是 lobscouse 的缩写形式，其起源尚不确定[20]。它与挪威的 lapskaus、瑞典的 lapskojs 和丹麦的 labskovs（skipperlabskovs）有关，以及低地德语的 labskaus，指的是水手们常吃的同名炖菜。在 19 世纪，利物浦、伯肯黑德、布特尔和沃拉西的穷人经常吃 scouse，因为它是一种便宜的食物，而且航海者家庭熟悉它。外地人倾向于称这些人为“scousers”。[21] 在《兰开夏郡方言、传统和民间传说词典》中，艾伦·克罗斯比认为，这个词只有在 BBC 情景喜剧《直到死亡将我们分开》（1965-1975）流行起来之后才在全国范围内广为人知，该剧以一位利物浦社会主义者和一位伦敦东区保守派为主角，经常发生争吵[10]。利物浦最初是一个小渔村，后来发展成为一个港口。在 18 世纪之后，它发展成为一个主要的国际贸易和工业中心。因此，这座城市成为多种口音和方言的熔炉，因为来自不同地区（特别是威尔士和爱尔兰）的水手和商人在此定居。直到 19 世纪中叶，主要的当地口音与邻近的兰开夏郡地区相似。例如，喜剧演员和演员罗布·威尔顿（1881-1957），尽管来自利物浦的埃弗顿区，但他说的却是干巴巴的兰开夏郡口音，而不是 Scouse 口音[22][需要更好的来源]。来自爱尔兰（尤其是都柏林）和北威尔士的移民以及来访的斯堪的纳维亚水手的影響，促成了利物浦独特的本地口音[23][24]。第一次提到利物浦独特的口音是在 1890 年。语言学家杰拉尔德·诺尔斯认为，这种口音的鼻音可能源于 19 世纪的公共卫生状况不佳，长期以来许多人患感冒，导致鼻音口音被认为是常态，并被学习当地方言的新来者模仿[25]。Scousers 的说话语调往往比大多数其他英语使用者高，有时接近假声。维多利亚时代的语音学家亚历山大·约翰·埃利斯说，利物浦和伯肯黑德“没有适当的方言”，因为他认为方言是世代相传，从最早的英语使用者那里传承下来的语音。埃利斯确实研究了威拉尔的一些地方，但这些受访者当时说的是传统的柴郡方言，而不是 Scouse[26]。1950 年代的英语方言调查记录了来自哈利伍德镇的传统兰开夏郡方言，

利物浦，位于英格兰西北部，是一座城市和海港，沿着默西河口北岸呈不规则的新月形分布，距离爱尔兰海仅几英里。它是默西塞德郡大都市郡的核心，位于历史上的兰开夏郡。利物浦这座城市所在的地区于 1207 年由英格兰国王约翰颁布宪章，成为一个规划中的新城镇。1830 年，利物浦和曼彻斯特铁路开通，这是英格兰第一条连接两座主要城市的铁路。很快，一个铁路网建成，为所有主要英国工业中心提供便捷且廉价的交通。披头士乐队的四位成员——约翰·列侬、保罗·麦卡特尼、乔治·哈里森和林戈·斯塔尔——都出生在利物浦，并在那里开始了他们的音乐生涯。

利物浦，城市和海港，位于英格兰西北部，是默西塞德郡大都市郡的核心，位于历史上的兰开夏郡。这座城市本身是默西塞德郡的一个大都市自治市，沿着默西河口北岸呈不规则的新月形分布，距离爱尔兰海仅几英里。利物浦历史上的第一个重要日期是 1207 年，当时英格兰国王约翰颁布宪章，在那里建立一个规划中的新城镇。这座城镇在中世纪发展缓慢，但在 18 世纪，由于与美洲和西印度群岛之间有利可图的贸易，它迅速扩张，成为英国第二大重要港口。利物浦三角洲是其总体贸易模式中的一个主要元素——将默西河腹地生产的制造商品换取西非的奴隶，而奴隶又被用来换取西印度群岛的糖、糖蜜、香料和其他种植园作物。利物浦的第一座码头建于 1715 年。到本世纪末，默西河沿岸又建了四个码头，使该港口的码头面积甚至超过了伦敦。1830 年，利物浦和曼彻斯特铁路开通，这是英格兰第一条连接两座主要城市的铁路。很快，一个铁路网建成，为所有主要英国工业中心提供便捷且廉价的交通，以及连接利物浦和威拉尔（横跨默西河口）的蒸汽轮渡。这种增长伴随着来自周边地区以及来自爱尔兰（特别是在爱尔兰马铃薯饥荒期间和之后）的大量移民。到 20 世纪初，利物浦已成为 7 英里（11 公里）码头的中心，这些码头沿着默西河从北部的霍恩比（1884 年）延伸到南部的赫库拉尼姆（1866 年）。码头得到了进一步的改进，但在第二次世界大战后，利物浦作为出口港和客运港的地位下降。这种变化主要归因于利物浦工业腹地及其与美国和西非传统贸易在英国经济生活中的地位不断下降。码头的低资本投资和失业加剧了这种情况。

利物浦仍然对周围的大都市区具有很大的统治力。尽管交通运输、通信、配送和航运的传统活动有所下降，但它们在该市的经济生活中仍然很重要。除了处理一般货物外，该港口还发展成为一个主要的集装箱运输设施，并且在 2012 年成为邮轮的终点站。2004 年，码头区和城市历史中心的几个区域被联合国教科文组织列为世界遗产。然而，由于“不可逆转地丧失了属性”，该指定在 2021 年被取消。

利物浦对 20 世纪流行文化的重要贡献，首推披头士乐队，他们从洞穴（一家在 1960 年代是该市音乐场景一部分的夜总会）走出来，成为世界上最著名的摇滚乐队。罗杰·麦高、艾德里安·亨利和布莱恩·帕滕等当地“表演”诗人帮助诗歌在 1960 年代流行起来。从音乐厅的全盛时期到 1940 年代汤米·汉德利的广播喜剧，利物浦人对英国喜剧传统做出了贡献。旅游业越来越重要，包括人们对参观与披头士乐队有关地点的兴趣日益浓厚。建筑地标包括 18 世纪的市政厅和 19 世纪的圣乔治大厅；始建于 1904 年、于 1978 年竣工的新哥特式圣公会大教堂；

## Barcelona

### [Barcelona - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona)

Barcelona (/ˌbɑːrsəˈloʊnə/ ⓘ BAR-sə-LOH-nə; Catalan: [bəɾsəˈlonə] ⓘ; Spanish: [baɾθeˈlona] ⓘ) is a city on the northeastern coast of Spain. It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[8] its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 5.3 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area of the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range. According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by either the Phoenicians or the Carthaginians, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.[9] In the Middle Ages, Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Moorish control by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492. Barcelona became the centre of Catalan separatism, briefly becoming part of France during the 17th century Reapers' War and again in 1812 until 1814 under Napoleon. It was the capital of Revolutionary Catalonia during the Spanish Revolution of 1936, and the seat of government of the Second Spanish Republic later in the Spanish Civil War, until its capture by the fascists in 1939. After the Spanish transition to democracy in the 1970s, Barcelona once again became the capital of an autonomous Catalonia. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is home to two of the most prestigious universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions. In addition, many international sport tournaments have been played here. Barcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe,[10] as well as the main biotech hub in Spain.[11] As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).[12] Barcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port,[13] an international airport, Barcelona–El Prat Airport, which handles over 50-million passengers per year,[14] an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.[15] The name Barcelona comes from the ancient Iberian Baŕkeno, attested in an ancient coin inscription found on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as ,[16] in Ancient Greek sources as Βαρκινών, Barkinṓn;[17][18] and in Latin as Barcino,[19] Barcilonum[20] and Barcenona.[21][22][23] Other sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC,[9][24] but there is no evidence its name in antiquity, Barcino, was connected with the Barcid family of Hamilcar.[25] During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as Barchinona, Barçalona, Barchelonaa, and Barchenona. An abbreviated form sometimes used by locals for the city is Barna. Barça is only applied to the local football club FC Barcelona, not to the city. Another common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat Airport. The city is referred to as the Ciutat Comtal in Catalan and Ciudad Condal in Spanish (i.e., "Comital City" or "City of Counts"), owing to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona.[26] The origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been found, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC.[27][28] In Greek mythology, the founding of Barcelona had been attributed to the mythological Hercules. According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by Punic (Phoenician) settlers, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.[9][29][30] In particular, some historians attribute the foundation of the city directly to the historical Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly named the city Barcino after his family in the 3rd century BC,[9][31] but this theory has been questioned.[25] Archeological evidence in the form of coins from the 3rd century BC have been found on the hills at the foot of Montjuïc with the name Bárkeno written in an ancient script in the Iberian language[citation needed]. Thus, we can conclude[clarification needed] that the Laietani[citation needed], an ancient Iberian (pre-Roman) people of the Iberian peninsula, who inhabited the area occupied by the city of Barcelona around 3–2 BC[clarification needed], called the area Bàrkeno, which means "The Place of the Plains" (Barrke = plains/terrace).[32][better source needed] In about 15 BC, the Romans redrew the town as a castrum (Roman military camp) centred on the "Mons Taber", a little hill near the Generalitat (Catalan Government) and city hall buildings. The Roman Forum, at the crossing of the Cardo Maximus and Decumanus Maximus, was approximately placed where current Plaça de Sant Jaume is. Thus, the political centre of the city, Catalonia, and its domains has remained in the same place for over 2,000 years. Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of Faventia,[33] or, in full, Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino[34] or Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino. Pomponius Mela[35] mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour Tarraco (modern Tarragona), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.[36] It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens.[37] The city minted its own coins; some from the era of Galba survive. Important Roman vestiges are displayed in Plaça del Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral.[38] The cathedral, Catedral Basílica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called La Seu, which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in Catalan.[39][40] It is said to have been founded in 343. The city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being conquered by the Umayyads in the early 8th century, it was conquered after a siege in 801 by Charlemagne's son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian "Hispanic March" (Marca Hispanica), a buffer zone ruled by the Count of Barcelona.[41] The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include much of modern Catalonia, although in 985, Barcelona was sacked by the army of Almanzor.[42] The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's population was either killed or enslaved.[43] In 1137, Aragon and the County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union[44][45] by the marriage of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon, their titles finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon, which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as far as Athens in the 13th century. Barcelona was the leading slave trade centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was eclipsed by Valencia.[46] It initially fed from eastern and Balkan slave stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of slaves.[47] The Bank or Taula de canvi de Barcelona, often viewed as the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the Bank of Venice (1402) and the Bank of Genoa (1407).[48] In the beginning of the Early Modern period, Barcelona lost political primacy, but the economy managed to achieve a balance between production capacity and imports.[49] In the context of the wider early recovery of Catalonia from the 17th-century crisis in the second half of the century, increasing maritime activity since 1675 doubled traffic in the port of Barcelona compared to figures from the beginning of the 17th century.[50] In the late 17th and early 18th century, Barcelona repeatedly endured the effects of war, including the 1691 bombing, the sieges of 1697, 1704, 1705, 1706, and the 1713 blockade and ensuing 1714 siege and assault.[51] In the 18th century, the population grew from 30,000 to about 100,000 inhabitants, as the city became one of the key mercantile centres in the Western Mediterranean, with inland influence up to Zaragoza, and to the south up to Alicante.[52] A fortress was built at Montjuïc that overlooked the harbour. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars, but the start of industrialization saw the fortunes of the province improve. In the mid-1850s, Barcelona was struggling with population density as it became an industrial, port city and European capital. The city's density was at 856 people per hectare, more than double that of Paris. Mortality rates were on the rise and any outbreaks of disease would devastate the population. To solve the issue, a civil engineer named Ildefons Cerdà proposed a plan for a new district known as the Eixample. The citizens of Barcelona had begun to demolish the medieval wall surrounding and constricting the city. Cerdà thought it best to transform the land outside the walls into an area characterized by a scientific approach to urbanization. His proposal consisted of a grid of streets to unite the old city and surrounding villages. There would also be wide streets to allow people to breathe clean air, gardens in the centre of each street block, integration of rich and poor giving both groups access to the same services, and smooth-flowing traffic. Urban quality, egalitarianism, hygiene, sunlight, and efficiency were all major keys for Cerdà's vision. Not everything he imagined would be realized within the Eixample district, but the iconic octagonal superblocks with chamfered corners for better visibility are his direct brainchild and remain immensely helpful even 170 years later. The district and its ideals were not appreciated at the time. The city council awarded the design of the extension plan to another architect. The Spanish government was the one to step in and impose Cerdà's plan, laying the groundwork for many more tensions between the Spanish and Catalan administrations. Regardless, some of the upper class citizens of Barcelona were excited by the new plan and began a race to build "the biggest, tallest, most attractive house" in the district. Their interest and money fueled the rich diversity that we now see in the district's architecture. In the end, Cerdà's ideas would have a lasting impact on Barcelona's development, earning it international recognition for its highly efficient approach to urban planning and design.[53][54] During the Spanish Civil War, the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were collectivized by the CNT and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco's coup d'état was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished,[57] and the use of the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialized and prosperous, despite the devastation of the civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanization. In 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and 3 km (2 mi) of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.[58][59][60][61][62] The death of Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratization throughout Spain. Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government.[63] Massive, but peaceful, demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It was granted less than a month later.[64] The development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics.[65][66] The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (−16.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[67] In 1987, an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed 21 people. On 17 August 2017, a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla, killing 14 and injuring at least 100, one of whom later died. Other attacks took place elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, called the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack. Amaq News Agency attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).[68][69][70] During the 2010s, Barcelona became the focus city[citation needed] for the ongoing Catalan independence movement, its consequent standoff between the regional and national government and later protests.[71] In July 2023, Barcelona was announced as the UNESCO-UIA World Capital of Architecture for the 2024–2026 term. This means it will be the hub for discussion around global challenges including culture, heritage, urban planning and architecture. In addition to being the capital through 2026, it will also host the UIA World Congress of Architects for that year. The honour is befitting of Barcelona, as its history is peppered with architectural achievement and various iconic styles and influences. From its ancient Roman roots, to the Gothic and Modernisme movements, Barcelona has thrived through the way it ties together architecture and culture.[72] Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately 5 km (3 mi) wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river to the southwest and the Besòs river to the north.[73] This plain covers an area of 170 km2 (66 sq mi),[73] of which 101 km2 (39.0 sq mi)[74] are occupied by the city itself. It is 120 km (75 mi) south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France. Tibidabo, 512 m (1,680 ft) high, offers striking views over the city[75] and is topped by the 288.4 m (946.2 ft) Torre de Collserola, a telecommunications tower that is visible from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanized, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as Carmel (267 m or 876 ft), Putxet (es) (181 m or 594 ft) and Rovira (261 m or 856 ft). The escarpment of Montjuïc (173 m or 568 ft), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by Montjuïc Castle, a fortress built in the 17–18th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montjuïc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens. The city borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adrià de Besòs to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del Vallès, and Montcada i Reixac to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited exclaves to the north-west. According to the Köppen climate classification, Barcelona has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), with mild winters and warm to hot summers,[76] while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterized by a short (3 months) dry season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. However, both June and August are wetter than February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as "Portuguese" by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne[77] and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) found in inland areas. Barcelona is densely populated, thus heavily influenced by the urban heat island effect. Areas outside of the urbanized districts can have as much as 2 °C of difference in temperatures throughout the year.[78] Its average annual temperature is 21.2 °C (70.2 °F) during the day and 15.1 °C (59.2 °F) at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about 20 °C (68 °F). In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from 12 to 18 °C (54 to 64 °F) during the day, 6 to 12 °C (43 to 54 °F) at night and the average sea temperature is 13 °C (55 °F).[79] In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from 27 to 31 °C (81 to 88 °F) during the day, about 23 °C (73 °F) at night and the average sea temperature is 26 °C (79 °F).[79] Generally, the summer or "holiday" season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months – April and November – are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds 20 °C (68 °F), with an average temperature of 18–19 °C (64–66 °F) during the day and 11–13 °C (52–55 °F) at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around 15 °C (59 °F) during the day and 9 °C (48 °F) at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea plus the urban heat island, frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent in the city of Barcelona, but light snowfalls can occur yearly in the nearby Collserola mountains, such as in the Fabra Observatory located in a nearby mountain.[80] Barcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (≥ 1 mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September–November) and lowest in early and mid-summer (June–August), with a secondary winter minimum (February–March). Sunshine duration is 2,524 hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5 hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10 hours of sunshine a day) in July.[81] According to Barcelona's City Council, the city's population as of 1 January 2016[update] was 1,608,746 people,[86] on a land area of 101.4 km2 (39 sq mi). It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of 636 km2 (246 sq mi) (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000.[3] It is the central nucleus of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of 5,474,482.[4] In 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000,[73] which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialized parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 at 1,906,998, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 residents, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.[87] Spanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it.[88] Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system. After Catalan and Spanish, the most spoken languages in Barcelona are those from North Africa, such as Amazigh and Arabic, followed by Bengali, Urdu, Panjabi, Mandarin Chinese, Romanian, English, Russian and Quechua, according to data collected by the University of Barcelona.[89] Barcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2 km2 sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with Eixample being the most populated district.[90][full citation needed] In the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2 km2, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area and Montjuïc forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining 52 km2 (20 sq mi) at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.[90][full citation needed] Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6 km2 at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square kilometre. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of la Sagrada Família where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.[90][full citation needed] In 1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9 percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6 percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed 56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just 6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5 percent of the population.[91][92] In 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% and 3.9% respectively.[86] The most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).[86] Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.[94] There exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.[95] Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China and the Philippines.[86] There is a Japanese community clustered in Bonanova, Les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and other northern neighbourhoods, and a Japanese international school serves that community.[96] In 2007, most of the inhabitants stated they are Roman Catholic (208 churches).[97] In a 2011 survey conducted by InfoCatólica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all ages identified themselves as Catholic.[98] This was the first time that more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic Christians.[98] The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined.[98] In 2019, a survey by Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas showed that 53.2% of residents in Barcelona identified themselves as Catholic (9.9% practising Catholics, 43.3% non-practising Catholics).[99] The province has the largest Muslim community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion.[100] A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169 locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain).[97] In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5 million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim,[100] which makes 5.6% of the total population. The city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated 3,500 Jews living in the city.[101] There are also a number of other groups, including Evangelical (71 locations, mostly professed by Roma), Jehovah's Witnesses (21 Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13 locations),[102] and Eastern Orthodox.[103] The Barcelona metropolitan area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with a GDP per capita amounting to €28,400 (16% more than the EU average). The greater Barcelona metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $177 billion (equivalent to $34,821 in per capita terms, 44% more than the EU average), making it the 4th most economically powerful city by gross GDP in the European Union, and 35th in the world in 2009.[104] Barcelona city had a very high GDP of €80,894 per head in 2004, according to Eurostat.[105] Furthermore, Barcelona was Europe's fourth best business city and fastest improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year as of 2009[update].[106] Barcelona was the 24th most "livable city" in the world in 2015 according to lifestyle magazine Monocle.[107] Similarly, according to Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world on Innovation Cities™ Global Index.[108] At the same time it is according to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020 one of the most affordable cities in the world for a luxury lifestyle.[109] Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialized early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history. Borsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. Barcelona was recognized as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential,[110] by FDi Magazine in their bi-annual rankings.[111] It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona – the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is 405,000 m2 (41 ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre. An important business centre, the World Trade Center Barcelona, is located in Barcelona's Port Vell harbour. The city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 Exposición Universal de Barcelona, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo 1929), the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the 2004 World Urban Forum.[112] Barcelona was the 20th-most-visited city in the world by international visitors and the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome, with 5.5 million international visitors in 2011.[113] By 2015, both Prague and Milan had more international visitors.[114] With its popular tree-lined pedestrian street, Les Rambles (Las Ramblas), Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain.[115] Barcelona is an internationally renowned tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world,[116][117] mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 519 hotels as of March 2016[update][118] including 35 five-star hotels,[119] and developed tourist infrastructure. Due to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of security and personal safety,[120] mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by Business Insider in 2016.[121] While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report,[citation needed] the city is "overrun [by] hordes of tourists". In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included "Tourists go home", "Barcelona is not for sale" and "We will not be driven out". By then, the number of visitors had increased from 1.7 million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62 million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated €30 billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.[122] A May 2017 article in the British online daily The Independent included Barcelona among the "Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most" and included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, "We don't want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop", citing Venice as an example.[123] To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb €30,000. The mayor has suggested introducing a new tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors.[123] One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an "overtourism crisis" in several major European cities. "Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city's success", he said.[124] "Managing tourism more responsibly can help", Francis later told a journalist, "but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that".[125] Industry generates 21% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the region,[126] with the energy, chemical and metallurgy industries accounting for 47% of industrial production.[127] The Barcelona metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments in Catalonia as of 1997.[128] Barcelona has long been an important European automobile manufacturing centre. Formerly there were automobile factories of AFA, Abadal, Actividades Industriales, Alvarez, America, Artés de Arcos, Balandrás, Baradat-Esteve, Biscúter, J. Castro, Clúa, David, Delfín, Díaz y Grilló, Ebro trucks, Edis [ca], Elizalde, Automóviles España, Eucort, Fenix, Fábrica Hispano, Auto Academia Garriga, Fábrica Española de Automóviles Hebe, Hispano-Suiza, Huracán Motors, Talleres Hereter, Junior SL, Kapi, La Cuadra, M.A., Automóviles Matas, Motores y Motos, Nacional Custals, National Pescara, Nacional RG, Nacional Rubi, Nacional Sitjes, Automóviles Nike, Orix, Otro Ford, Patria, Pegaso, PTV, Ricart, Ricart-España, Industrias Salvador, Siata Española, Stevenson, Romagosa y Compañía, Garaje Storm, Talleres Hereter, Trimak, Automóviles Victoria, Manufacturas Mecánicas Aleu.[129][130] Today, the headquarters and a large factory of SEAT (the largest Spanish automobile manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a Nissan factory in the logistics and industrial area of the city.[131] The factory of Derbi, a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near the city.[132] As in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress, and information technology services. The traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion capital, notably Gaudi Home.[citation needed] Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the Bread & Butter urban fashion fair until 2009, when its organizers announced that it would be returning to Berlin. This was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought €100 m to the city in just three days.[133][134] From 2009, The Brandery, an urban fashion show, was held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the Global Language Monitor's annual ranking of the world's top fifty fashion capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important fashion capital of the world right after Milan and before Berlin in 2015.[135] As the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the Generalitat de Catalunya; of particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the Province of Barcelona and the Barcelonès comarca (district). Barcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the Carta Municipal (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.[136] According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organized in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administers the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level.[137] This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions.[138] It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.[136] The Comissió de Govern (Government Commission) is the executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors.[139] The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions.[140] The six Commissions del Consell Municipal (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the plenary.[141] The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the Guàrdia Urbana (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the Generalitat to plan and manage services.[142] The executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.[143] The seat of the city council is on the Plaça de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the coming of the Spanish democracy, Barcelona had been governed by the PSC, first with an absolute majority and later in coalition with ERC and ICV. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner. After 32 years, on 22 May 2011, CiU gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The PP hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2. Since 1987, the city has been divided into 10 administrative districts (districtes in Catalan, distritos in Spanish): The districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council. Barcelona has a well-developed higher education system of public universities. Most prominent among these are the University of Barcelona (established in 1450) and the more modern Pompeu Fabra University.[144][145] Barcelona is also home to the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and in the private sector the EADA Business School (founded in 1957), which became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. IESE Business School, as well as the largest private educational institution, the Ramon Llull University, which encompasses schools and institutes such as the ESADE Business School. The Autonomous University of Barcelona, another public university, is located in Bellaterra, a town in the Metropolitan Area. Toulouse Business School and the Open University of Catalonia (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona. The city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as escoles concertades, they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (escoles privades). The language of instruction at public schools and escoles concertades is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or escola concertada in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or escola concertada offer International Baccalaureate programmes. Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network.[146] It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.[147] Barcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la Música Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue.[148] It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers. Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the Sónar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. The city also has a thriving alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving international attention.[149] Barcelona is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.[150] El Periódico de Catalunya, La Vanguardia and Ara are Barcelona's three major daily newspapers (the first two with Catalan and Spanish editions, Ara only in Catalan) while Sport and El Mundo Deportivo (both in Spanish) are the city's two major sports daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served by a number of smaller publications such as Ara and El Punt Avui (in Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions such as El País (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and El Mundo (in Spanish), and by several free newspapers like 20 minutos and Què (all bilingual). Barcelona's oldest and main online newspaper VilaWeb is also the oldest one in Europe[citation needed] (with Catalan and English editions). Several major FM stations include Catalunya Ràdio, RAC 1, RAC 105 and Cadena SER. Barcelona also has a local TV station, Betevé, owned by city council. The headquarters of Televisió de Catalunya, Catalonia's public network, are located in Sant Joan Despí, in Barcelona's metropolitan area. Barcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums). It has hosted about 30 sports events of international significance.[citation needed] FC Barcelona is a sports club best known worldwide for its football team, one of the largest and the wealthiest in the world.[151] It has 74 national trophies (while finishing 46 times as runners-up) and 17 continental prizes (with being runners-up 11 times), including five UEFA Champions League trophies out of eight finals and three FIFA Club World Cup wins out of four finals. The club won six trophies in a calendar year in 2009, becoming one of only 2 male football teams in the world to win the coveted sextuple, apart from FC Bayern Munich in 2020. FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national or European competitions. The club's museum is the second most visited in Catalonia. The matches against cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol are of particular interest, but there are other Barcelonan football clubs in lower categories, like CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. FC Barcelona's basketball team has a noted rivalry in the Liga ACB with nearby Joventut Badalona. Barcelona has three UEFA elite stadiums: FC Barcelona's Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 99,354; the publicly owned Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, with a capacity of 55,926; used for the 1992 Olympics; and Estadi Cornellà-El Prat, with a capacity of 40,500. Furthermore, the city has several smaller stadiums such as Mini Estadi (also owned by FC Barcelona) with a capacity of 15,000, Camp Municipal Narcís Sala with a capacity of 6,563 and Nou Sardenya with a capacity of 7,000. The city has a further three multifunctional venues for sports and concerts: the Palau Sant Jordi with a capacity of 12,000 to 24,000 (depending on use), the Palau Blaugrana with a capacity of 7,500, and the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona with a capacity of 3,500. Barcelona was the host city for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, which were held at the Palau San Jordi.[152] Several road running competitions are organized year-round in Barcelona: the Barcelona Marathon every March with over 10,000 participants in 2010, the Cursa de Bombers in April, the Cursa de El Corte Inglés in May (with about 60,000 participants each year), the Cursa de la Mercè, the Cursa Jean Bouin, the Milla Sagrada Família and the San Silvestre. There is also the Ultratrail Collserola which passes 85 km (53 mi) through the Collserola forest. The Open Seat Godó, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. Each year on Christmas Day, a 200-meter swimming race across the Old Port of Barcelona takes place.[153] Near Barcelona, in Montmeló, the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. Skateboarding and cycling are also very popular in Barcelona; in and around the city there are dozens of kilometers of bicycle paths.[citation needed] Barcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and autonomists.[154] Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a number of social services to the surrounding residents, including bicycle repair workshops, carpentry workshops, self-defense classes, free libraries, community gardens, free meals, computer labs, language classes, theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services.[155] The squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organize various protests throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include Can Vies and Can Masdeu.[citation needed] Barcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about 17 km (11 mi) south-west of the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17 million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend.[156] It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009. Some low-cost airlines, also use Girona-Costa Brava Airport, about 90 km (56 mi) to the north, Reus Airport, 77 km (48 mi) to the south, or Lleida-Alguaire Airport, about 150 km (93 mi) to the west, of the city. Sabadell Airport is a smaller airport in the nearby town of Sabadell, devoted to pilot training, aerotaxi and private flights. The Port of Barcelona has a 2000-year-old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in 2013.[157] The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its 10 km2 (4 sq mi) are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the Llobregat river 2 km (1 mi) to the south.[158] The Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a very important Mediterranean turnaround base.[159] In 2013, 3.6 million pleasure cruise passengers used the Port of Barcelona.[157] The Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums – Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays. Barcelona is a major hub for the Spanish rail network. The city's main Inter-city rail station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst Estació de França terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona. RENFE's AVE high-speed rail system, which is designed for speeds of 310 km/h (193 mph), was extended from Madrid to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (Paris, Marseille and Toulouse, through Perpignan–Barcelona high-speed rail line) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.[160][161] Barcelona is served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a metro system, a bus network, a regional railway system, trams, funiculars, rack railways, a Gondola lift and aerial cable cars. These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolità (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.[162] The Barcelona Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an "L" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines. In addition to the city Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's Rodalies de Catalunya run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in the surrounding region. The city's two modern tram systems, Trambaix and Trambesòs, are operated by TRAMMET.[163] A heritage tram line, the Tramvia Blau, also operates between the metro Line 7 and the Funicular del Tibidabo.[164] Barcelona's metro and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de Montjuïc up Montjuïc. The city has two aerial cable cars: the Montjuïc Cable Car, which serves Montjuïc castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant Sebastià over the port. Buses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. There are 21 night lines, 19 of them go through Plaça de Catalunya, where you can change to other lines. The frequency is 15/20 minutes between 22:20 and 06:00. A separate private bus line, known as Aerobús, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure. The Estació del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services. Barcelona has a metered taxi fleet governed by the Institut Metropolità del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of self-employed drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many taxi ranks, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.[165][166] On 22 March 2007,[167] Barcelona's City Council started the Bicing service, a bicycle service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and then leave it at another station.[168] The service has been a success, with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.[169] Barcelona lies on three international routes, including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast, European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including A-2, A-7/AP-7, C-16, C-17, C-31, C-32, C-33, C-60. The city is circled by three half ring roads or bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the mountain side), Ronda del Litoral (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts: Travessera de Dalt in the north and the Gran Via de Carles III), two partially covered[170] fast highways with several exits that bypass the city. The city's main arteries include Diagonal Avenue, which crosses it diagonally, Meridiana Avenue which leads to Glòries and connects with Diagonal Avenue and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of La Rambla, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route. The Barri Gòtic (Catalan for "Gothic Quarter") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan modernista architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaudí, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada Família, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of 2015[update], completion is planned for 2026.[171] Barcelona was also home to Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion. Designed in 1929 for the International Exposition for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolize modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms "less is more" and "God is in the details".[172] The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986. Barcelona won the 1999 RIBA Royal Gold Medal for its architecture,[173] the first (and as of 2015[update], only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect. Barcelona is the home of many points of interest declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO:[174] Barcelona has a great number of museums, which cover different areas and eras. The National Museum of Art of Catalonia possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art. The Fundació Joan Miró, Picasso Museum, and Fundació Antoni Tàpies hold important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the Can Framis Museum, focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by Fundació Vila Casas. Several museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA), the Museum of the History of Catalonia, the Archeology Museum of Catalonia, the Maritime Museum of Barcelona, the Music Museum of Barcelona and the privately owned Egyptian Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones, while CosmoCaixa is a science museum that received the European Museum of the Year Award in 2006.[175] The Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona was founded in 1882 under the name of "Museo Martorell de Arqueología y Ciencias Naturales"[176][177] (Spanish for "Martorell Museum of Archaeology and Natural Sciences"). In 2011 the Museum of Natural Sciences ended up with a merge of five institutions: the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the Forum Building), the Martorell Museum (the historical seat of the Museum, opened to the public from 1924 to 2010 as a geology museum), the Laboratori de Natura, at the Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum), the Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona, founded 1930, and the Botanical garden of Barcelona, founded 1999. Those two gardens are a part of the Botanical Institute of Barcelona too. The FC Barcelona Museum is the third most popular tourist attraction in Catalonia, with 1,51 million visitors in 2013.[178] Barcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and six of which are forest.[179] They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7 ha or 1,358.3 acres).[74] The total park surface grows about 10 ha (25 acres) per year,[180] with a proportion of 18.1 m2 (195 sq ft) of park area per inhabitant.[181] Of Barcelona's parks, Montjuïc is the largest, with 203 ha located on the mountain of the same name, and includes the Botanical Garden of Barcelona, the Mossèn Costa i Llobera Gardens, and more.[74] It is followed by Parc de la Ciutadella (which occupies the site of the old citadel and which houses the Parliament building, the Barcelona Zoo, and several museums); 31 ha or 76.6 acres including the zoo), the Guinardó Park (19 ha or 47.0 acres), Park Güell (designed by Antoni Gaudí; 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Oreneta Castle Park (also 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Diagonal Mar Park (13.3 ha or 32.9 acres, inaugurated in 2002), Nou Barris Central Park (13.2 ha or 32.6 acres), Can Dragó Sports Park and Poblenou Park (both 11.9 ha or 29.4 acres), the Labyrinth Park (9.10 ha or 22.5 acres), named after the garden maze it contains.[74] There are also several smaller parks, for example, the Parc de Les Aigües (2 ha or 4.9 acres). A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. PortAventura World, one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona.[182][183] Also, within the city lies Tibidabo Amusement Park, a smaller amusement park in Plaza del Tibidabo, with the Muntanya Russa amusement ride. Barcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top ten city beaches in the world according to National Geographic[116] and Discovery Channel.[184] Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling 4.5 km (2+3⁄4 mi) of coastline. Sant Sebastià, Barceloneta and Somorrostro beaches, both 1,100 m (3,610 ft) in length,[74] are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona. The Olympic Harbour separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Icària, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from 400 to 640 m (1,310 to 2,100 ft) were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline. Most recently, Llevant is the first beach to allow dogs access during summer season. Barcelona is twinned with:[185] Barcelona also cooperates with:[185]

### [Incidents | CAL FIRE](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/)

Ongoing emergency responses in California, including all 10+ acre wildfires. December, 2024- Following recent rainfall that has moderated fire activity, CAL FIRE is transitioning to Winter Preparedness staffing levels statewide. This adjustment aligns with a seasonal decrease in fire activity and aims to strategically optimize resources as fire risks lessen during the cooler months. Although California experienced a higher-than-usual number of fires this year, total acreage burned remains slightly below the five-year average but exceeds last year's figures. Forecasts indicate that above-normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation will persist through February, sustaining elevated fire risk, particularly in Southern California. An increased frequency of offshore wind events may also heighten fire concerns in specific areas. Over the next several months, an active Jet Stream is expected to bring cool, moist conditions, encouraging the growth of lowland vegetation and snow in higher elevations. These conditions, combined with a shift toward greener fuels, are expected to lower the potential for significant fires over the next 2-3 months. Southern California remains the exception, where some heightened fire risk may persist. Despite these seasonal shifts, CAL FIRE remains vigilant and prepared to respond to any challenges posed by the ongoing elevated fire risk. The resources that CAL FIRE staffs year-round will spend these months engaged in fuel reduction projects and other fire prevention efforts as weather permits. Incident data is provided in raw, computer readable formats and requires further processing using specialized software. Two additional API parameters include year (values include a year in the YYYY format) and inactive (values include true and false). CAL FIRE doesn’t provide software development support at this time. Information presented on the departments website is a representation of the existing wildfire situation, based on the information readily available to CAL FIRE. We make every effort to provide accurate and complete information, however the data is subject to review and change. This site provides general information concerning an incident. All of our information comes from the firelines and must be approved by the Incident Commander in charge of managing the incident prior to release. As battling a fire, or handling any other disaster is the priority, updates to these sites cannot be guaranteed on a set time schedule. Please use the information on these pages only as a reference. The sites are not meant to provide up-to-the-minute evacuation or fire behavior information. Please refer to the fire information phone numbers provided on this site, and website links for additional information, and monitor your local radio stations for emergency broadcasts. If you live in a wildland area always have an evacuation plan in place. Fires occur throughout the State within CAL FIRE jurisdiction on a daily basis during fire season. However, the majority of those fires are contained quickly and no information will generally be provided on these incidents at this site if the fire burns less than 10 acres. If you would like to obtain information about a CAL FIRE fire burning in your area that is not included on this web site, please contact the CAL FIRE Unit that services your county.

### [California wildfires live updates: 5 killed, Palisades Fire grows as Sunset Fire spreads through Hollywood Hills, 180,000 people evacuated](https://www.yahoo.com/news/live/california-wildfires-live-updates-5-killed-palisades-fire-grows-as-sunset-fire-spreads-through-hollywood-hills-141555564.html)

Manage your account The deadly fires roaring through Los Angeles County continued Thursday, leaving at least five people dead, over 1,000 structures destroyed and around 180,000 people forced to evacuate, and prompting thousands of firefighters to descend on the region to try to extinguish the flames. The Palisades Fire, which has burned more than 17,000 acres, has become the most destructive wildfire to ever hit L.A. “Damage assessments are ongoing at the Palisades fire. Preliminary reports estimate the damage or destroyed structures to be in the thousands,” Los Angeles city Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said during a news conference Thursday morning. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, in addition to the Palisades Fire, four other blazes are currently burning: the Eaton Fire, which has torched 10,600 acres so far; the Hurst Fire, which has burned around 855 acres but is 10% contained; the Lidia Fire, which has grown to 348 acres but has 40% containment; and the Sunset Fire, around 43 acres. Aside from the Lidia and Hurst fires, officials say these wildfires are 0% contained. The Sunset Fire erupted in the densely populated Hollywood Hills late Wednesday, prompting more evacuations in areas like Hollywood Boulevard and Runyon Canyon Park. Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) CEO and Chief Engineer Janisse Quiñones told reporters that power to about 200,000 customers has been restored since the wind storm started, while about 95,000 customers in Los Angeles remained without power as of Thursday morning. There are about 118 DWP crews working to restore power, prioritizing downed power lines. Power restoration has been ranging between 24 to 48 hours. "If you see a wire down, please call 911," Quiñones advised. A boil water advisory is still in place for the Pacific Palisades zip code of 90272 and will remain in effect for at least 48 hours. "I have water quality engineers taking samples around the system to ensure that the water quality remains a priority for our customers," Quiñones said. In addition to another round of Santa Ana winds, relative humidity is expected to drop this afternoon throughout Southern California — potentially to as low as 5%, according to ABC7 LA. Wind, humidity and temperature all influence fire behavior, the Western Fire Chiefs Association explains. Fires spread in hot, dry and windy conditions. Low humidity levels can cause a spike in fire danger because they make wildfire fuels — anything and everything combustible — more receptive to ignite on fire. "Unfortunately I think the death toll will rise," L.A. County Sheriff Robert Luna told the press Thursday morning. "I hope I'm wrong, but I think it's going to rise." Officials have reported that at least five people have been killed by the fires over the last few days, all of those in the Eaton Fire. At least 180,000 people are under mandatory evacuation orders and thousands of homes and structures are estimated to have been destroyed. At a press conference Thursday morning, Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley said the Palisades Fire has destroyed "thousands" of structures, a dramatic revision from the initial estimate of 1,000 thought to be burned. “Damage assessments are ongoing at the Palisades Fire. However, preliminary reports estimate the damage or destroyed structures to be in the thousands,” Crowley said. The Palisades Fire had already been named one of the most destructive fires in Los Angeles history, but the new estimate on the number of structures destroyed means that it could end up being one of the most destructive fires in state history. "Destructive" fires are defined by how many structures were destroyed in a given event, not by how many acres the fire covers. "Structures" specifically refer to homes and commercial properties. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, here's a list of the most destructive wildfires recorded in the state — before the Palisades and Eaton fires — including the year they occurred, the acres burned and the number of structures destroyed. A red flag warning remains in effect for L.A. County and the majority of Ventura County through Friday, fire officials said Thursday morning. "Today we expect winds to subside somewhat, which will allow fire crews to increase containment lines," said Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley. "We are still under red flag warning with extreme fire behavior possibilities," she stressed. In the Pacific Palisades region, wind gusts are up to 60 mph and will continue throughout the day. The National Weather Service says, "A Red Flag Warning is issued to indicate the imminent danger of severe fire weather with a relatively high probability of occurrence. Usually the fire danger is in the very high to extreme category. A Red Flag Warning will normally be issued for potential severe fire weather events in less than 12 hours." Fire officials provided updates Thursday morning on the wildfires raging across Southern California. Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley told reporters the Palisades Fire is "one of the most destructive natural disasters in the history of Los Angeles." Here are the latest updates Crowley and Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony Marrone provided: Palisades Fire: 17,234 acres with 0% containment as "extreme fire behavior" continues to challenge firefighting efforts in the area as wind gusts are up to 60 mph. Damage assessments are ongoing, but destroyed structures are estimated to be in the thousands, according to Crowley. Eaton Fire: 10,600 acres and 0% containment, but growth has been significantly stopped. There are several reported injuries and over 1,000 structures damaged and destroyed, according to Marrone. Hurst Fire: 855 acres with 0% containment and a containment perimeter has been established. Lidia Fire: 348 acres, 40% contained, forward progress has been stopped. Sunset Fire: 42.8 acres and 0% contained. Woodley Fire: 30 acres and fully contained, no current threats. Sunswept Fire: LAFD firefighters stopped forward progress at just under 1 acre. The cause of all the wildfires listed above are under active investigation. Slide the divider across the images below to see how several locations in the Pacific Palisades area have been devastated by the Palisades Fire, which has spread across more than 17,000 acres and was at 0% containment as of Thursday morning. The Los Angeles Fire Department has lifted all remaining evacuation orders for the Sunset Fire, which has covered 43 acres, and is advising residents to be careful when returning to their homes. One of the five Eaton Fire victims was identified by his family on Wednesday morning after they found him lying on the side of the road near his home holding a garden hose, KTLA reported. “It looks like he was trying to save the home that his parents had for almost 55 years,” a family friend told the outlet. The 66-year-old man lived in the house with his younger sister who said she could not convince him to evacuate the area with her on Tuesday night. Others close to the victim explained to KTLA that he had health problems that "prevented him from moving around very well." Another wave of Santa Ana winds is anticipated to enter Los Angeles tonight and continue into Friday morning, according to the National Weather Service. This includes widespread winds of 35 mph to 55 mph in mountain areas and the foothills. With the forecast of more winds, most of the Los Angeles area will continue to be under serious fire risk for the rest of the week as five wildfires keep spreading. The wildfires have led numerous school districts in Los Angeles County to close schools for the second straight day. Here's the updated list of closures as of 6:30 a.m. local time: Alhambra Unified School District Arcadia Unified School District Beverly Hills Unified School District Burbank Unified School District (closed through Jan. 10) Duarte Unified School District Garvey School District Glendale Unified School District (closed through Jan. 10) Glendora Unified School District La Canada Unified (closed through Jan. 10) LAUSD: All schools are closed on Jan. 9. View LAUSD updates on its website Monrovia Unified School District Pasadena Unified School District (closed through Jan. 10) San Gabriel Unified School District Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District South Pasadena Unified School District Temple City Unified School District The wildfires tearing through Los Angeles are creating surreal, apocalyptic scenes, including for TV reporters on the ground covering them. Robert Kovacik, a correspondent for NBC's Los Angeles affiliate, was reporting live from the Palisades Fire when a resident who was evacuating his home on a bike asked him to hold onto his paintings. "Listen, I'll take them for you, I work at NBC, I'll make sure you get them," Kovacik told the unidentified man, who rode away. If you're looking to contribute to those affected by the California wildfires, there are a host of options. GoFundMe has a centralized page of verified fundraisers related to the disasters. The Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation is requesting emergency funds to provide hydration backpacks, personal fire shelters and wildland brush tools to local firefighters. The Canine Rescue Club is seeking volunteers to temporarily foster dogs displaced by the fires. There are many more ways to help out. The Los Angeles Times has a list here. Wildfires continue to burn in Los Angeles, scorching tens of thousands of acres, destroying hundreds if not thousands of homes, forcing more than 100,000 evacuations and leaving at least five people dead, officials say. • There are five active wildfires in Los Angeles County, according to Cal Fire: Palisades Fire: 17,234 acres, 0% containment Eaton Fire: 10,600 acres, 0% containment Hurst Fire: 855 acres, 10% containment Lidia Fire: 348 acres, 40% containment Sunset Fire: 43 acres, 0% containment • More than 130,000 people are under evacuation orders. • The fires have destroyed more than 1,100 structures. • More than 250,000 customers remain without power. • The Los Angeles Unified School District announced the closure of all public schools on Thursday. • President Biden approved California Gov. Gavin Newsom's request for a major disaster declaration, pledging more federal resources to support ongoing response efforts. Another fire-scarred day in Los Angeles ended with fresh evacuations and fears that the worst might not yet be over when the Sunset Fire in the Hollywood Hills erupted in the late afternoon, sparking more evacuations and devastation. Here's a recap of what transpired Wednesday in what Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called "the big one in magnitude”: Five of seven major wildfires burning across the region had 0% containment as of Wednesday evening At least five people were reported killed in the Eaton Fire More than 1,000 structures were destroyed, although that could be a conservative estimate More than 130,000 were forced to evacuate their homes and businesses The Los Angeles Unified School District announced the closure of all public schools on Thursday Fire crews from neighboring states began arriving to help exhausted local firefighters Power outages topped 1.5 million in the state A fast-moving fire in the Hollywood Hills erupted early Wednesday evening. I took the above photo from the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles around 5:45 p.m. local time. The Palisades Fire is to the left and the Hollywood sign is to the right. Runyon Canyon and the historic Hollywood Bowl are in the densely populated area located near where the flames broke out. They reached about two blocks north of the Chateau Marmont. Because the wind had died down from earlier in the day, helicopters were quickly deployed to the scene and about 10 could seen in the air. Within an hour, from about 7 miles away, it seemed like the fire was mostly contained. As residents heeded evacuation orders for the Sunset Fire and attempted to leave the Hollywood Hills area, traffic was snarled for miles. CBS reporter Andre Tinoco posted footage of the gridlock on Franklin and La Brea avenues about half an hour after mandatory evacuation orders were sent out. A new wildfire erupted Wednesday evening, this one in the Hollywood Hills area, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said at a press conference. She noted that the fire department was already responding to the situation and excused herself from the meeting to join in the effort. Sunset Fire, which it has been named as has covered 20 acres already. Chris Christi, a helicopter reporter for ABC7 Los Angeles, shared a photo of the fire on X. The LAFD sent out an emergency alert to residents and posted mandatory evacuations for the area of the new fire. "A wildfire is burning at Runyon Canyon," the alert read. "Those nearby should get set for a potential evacuation. Monitor local news, LAFD social media, and lafd.org/alerts for updates. Evacuation preparation info here: lafd.org/ready-set-go." Eyewitnesses say the latest blaze is rapidly expanding in a densely populated area. All Los Angeles public schools and offices will be closed Thursday, Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said at a Wednesday evening press conference. A decision on whether schools and offices will remain closed on Friday will be announced Thursday at 4 p.m. PST. "The confluence of factors" from the wildfires have "created dangerous, complex situations that present unsafe conditions for our school communities," a statement posted to social media said. Some meals and mental health services will be available for Los Angeles Unified School District students despite the school closings.

### [L.A. fires: At least 5 dead, over 100,000 forced to flee](https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/wildfires/live-blog/california-wildfires-live-updates-least-2-dead-1000-structures-destroy-rcna186814)

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time This live blog has now ended — the follow the latest updates here. Phil Helsel A large house fire that erupted in the Studio City area of Los Angeles tonight, causing fears that it could spread to vegetation, has been knocked down, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Around 50 firefighters extinguished the fire, which broke out at around 8:52 p.m. on North Sunswept Drive, the LAFD said. No injuries were reported. The fire erupted amid dry conditions that are causing a high risk of wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Firefighters placed a priority on not only defending the structure but also keeping the flames from spreading into the brush, the fire department said. Two major wildfires, the Palisades Fire and the Eaton Fire, have burned more than 26,000 acres combined and destroyed many homes. Both are still burning. Five people died in the Eaton Fire, officials said. Phil Helsel The Pasadena Humane Society said it has taken in over 300 animals, some of them injured, as people fled the Eaton Fire, which has destroyed homes and killed five people. “We are starting to see many animals coming in with burns and injuries,” the organization said on Facebook. “These animals are being treated in our ICU. We are providing them with pain medications, wound care, fluid, and oxygen as needed.” Dia DuVernet, president and CEO of the Pasadena Humane Society, said her heart goes out to all those affected. Many of the people fled with their animals. One of the members of the shelter's board of directors lost her home and her two cats, DuVernet said. Shelters in the area have been working with the group to save animals, and neighbors have been helping out by saving pets that got lost during the confusion, she said at a news conference earlier today. “It really has been heartwarming to see even our staff members who have been evacuated and who are losing their homes coming to the shelter to shelter with their pets and take care of other people’s pets,” DuVernet said. Dennis Romero A new blaze in the hills of the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles is drawing on firefighters already spread thin as L.A. is in the midst of multiple wildfires fanned by Santa Ana winds. The Los Angeles Fire Department reported that the focus of the fire was a four-story home on or near Sunswept Drive. The fire has since expanded and is now called the Sunswept Fire. "The Sunswept Fire is burning near Laurel Cyn [Canyon]/Mulholland/Coldwater Cyn/Ventura Blvd.," a city alert said tonight. "Those nearby should get set for a potential evacuation by gathering supplies and loved ones." The fire department said in an update that the residential fire included "exposures and vegetation." "Firefighters are in the defensive mode against the fire unit with priority of defending the exposures and preventing extension into the brush," it said. The area is northwest of the Sunset Fire in Hollywood, north of Franklin Canyon and Beverly Hills, amid the high vistas on the San Fernando Valley side of the Santa Monica Mountains. The range is also the focus of the Palisades Fire and the Sunset Fire. Anthony Correia Color infrared satellite images released by Maxar Technologies show the fires burning in Altadena on Wednesday, in stark comparison to the same location captured on Monday. The Eaton Fire has burned 10,600 acres and damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and other buildings. Phil Helsel More than 7,500 people are fighting the wildfires in Southern California, Gov. Gavin Newsom said tonight as fires continued to burn in the Los Angeles area. Newsom this week toured the devastation wrought by the Palisades Fire and said many homes were destroyed. The Palisades Fire is the largest of the fires burning in the Los Angeles region, with more than 15,800 acres scorched, according to fire officials. The Eaton Fire, burning in the Altadena and Pasadena areas, has killed five people and burned more than 10,000 acres. Dennis Romero This week's windstorm-driven fires have put a spotlight on million-dollar family homes lost to flames, but the L.A. mayor's office says it's trying to make sure people without four walls are evacuated and sheltered. "The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) has been conducting outreach to individuals living on the streets in high fire severity zones since Friday, January 3rd, and will continue to do so in the coming days," Mayor Karen Bass' office said in an evening update on the city's wildfires. Her office said it will make vouchers for hotel stays available to homeless people, distributed through outreach workers and volunteers and the city's 211 helpline. The update said vouchers would be limited "based on capacity." Last year the city had nearly 30,000 people living outdoors and outside shelters, more than 10% fewer than in 2023, the homelessness authority said in a statement last year about the latest figures. The phenomenon, which correlates to untenable housing costs in the state, has a visible footprint on the sidewalks and streets of Hollywood, where the Sunset Fire was burning in the neighborhoods and hills north of Hollywood Boulevard. Dennis Romero The Pacific Palisades community at the center of the Palisades Fire remained under a boil water notice tonight, the Los Angeles mayor's office said in an update. The L.A. Department of Water and Power ordered the notice for the entire community and warned adjacent areas served by the utility to boil water before using it, too. It identified the Pacific Palisades ZIP code, 90272, as the focus of the notice. The ZIP code follows the community's boundaries. The department said the firefight has depleted water and the city system's usual water pressure, the latter of which thwarts contamination by keeping bacteria and foreign substances outside a water system even as it harbors some cracks and breaches. "Until adequate water pressure can be re-established, and water is tested and confirmed to be safe, this notice is in effect. It is possible that disease-causing organisms could be present," the department said in a statement. "These organisms include bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause symptoms such as nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and associated headaches," LADWP said. Dana Varinsky Although the ferocious winds that have fueled the Los Angeles-area fires should gradually diminish tonight, dangerous fire conditions are expected to persist through at least Friday. A high wind warning remains in effect until 10 p.m. PT for parts of greater Los Angeles, including the Malibu coast and the Santa Monica Mountains, according to the National Weather Service. Forecasts suggest wind speeds up to 40 mph in the affected areas, with gusts up to 60 mph. Red flag warnings will remain in effect across parts of Southern California through at least 6 p.m. Friday. Such warnings refer to an expected combination of warm temperatures, low humidity and strong winds that raises the risk of fire danger. Humidity levels are expected to stay low, and they could dip into single digits in some areas into Friday. “Prolonged elevated to critical fire weather is expected,” according to the fire weather outlook from the NWS Storm Prediction Center. Dennis Romero Wildfires are supposed to be wild. But the reach of this week's windstorm-driven blazes in Southern California has served as a reminder that flames don't stop at the wildland-urban interface. And if that's the case, few in this region of 25 million are truly safe from the ravages of such blazes. Mandatory evacuations for the Palisades Fire yesterday and the Sunset Fire tonight spread into century-old rectangular street grids and well-worn Main Streets seemingly insulated from fire by miles of concrete and steel structures. Authorities last night put the northern part of Santa Monica's North of Montana neighborhood under mandatory evacuation orders. The area included the city from San Vicente to the border with Los Angeles and its Pacific Palisades community. It's not in the hills, and it's not amid woods or brush. It's part of a larger Santa Monica neighborhood known for its expensive homes and Rodeo Drive-style boutiques. "This is staggering," Los Angeles Times reporter Julia Wick said on X last night, commenting on the Santa Monica part of the Palisades Fire evacuations. "For those unfamiliar with L.A. geography, the area in the evacuation warning is not in the hills." Likewise, evacuations tonight covered the western part of the Hollywood Hills, west of the 101 Freeway, from Mulholland Drive — which twists along the top of the mountains — to Hollywood Boulevard, a flatlands thoroughfare to the south that takes tourists to the El Capitan Entertainment Center, TCL Chinese Theatre, the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Madame Tussauds Hollywood and Ripley’s Believe It or Not! Some of the city's oldest multifamily structures line the boulevard in one of its densest neighborhoods. Just east of the boulevard's evacuation zone are Thai Town and its critically acclaimed eateries and Little Armenia, a location celebrating Armenian settlement in East Hollywood. The overlapping ethnic communities found life and commerce in the boulevard's vintage buildings. It's generally not a place where children learn how to hunt or fish or even about preparing for wildfires. But the lesson of wildfire crushing urban development is one told previously, when the Camp Fire in 2018 destroyed 85% of Paradise, California, 470 miles north of L.A. in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. A National Institute of Standards and Technology analysis of the Paradise Fire found that the density of the town actually made the fire worse and accelerated flames. "Propelling the Camp Fire’s structure-destroying spree were fires that spread within and between plots of land, or parcels, rather than from the fire front," said the analysis, published in 2021. "Sources such as burning sheds, plants, vehicles and neighboring houses caused many buildings to catch fire, either through direct contact with flames or embers generated in parcels." Gov. Gavin Newsom told NBC News today that the rapid devastation of the last two days in Southern California was something he could compare only to the Paradise Fire. "It's stunning," he said. "Nothing comes close." NBC News The Sunset Fire, which sparked tonight, has grown to 50 acres in the Hollywood Hills, but crews report progress in keeping it contained and are attacking it with aerial water drops. "There are active flames within the interior of the fire, but the perimeter is holding well thanks to a fire road and ground crews in place," the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department posted on social media this evening. "At the heel of the fire, active flames have been extinguished, though smoldering continues within the interior." An evacuation center has been set up at the Pan Pacific Recreational Center, at 7600 Beverly Blvd. Tom Llamas Marissa Hermer recalled being on a hike yesterday when she saw smoke and flames coming from behind her kids' school. That's when, she said, she raced down the mountain and picked up her kids and "got them out of there." As she tried driving into her neighborhood, Hermer said, she had to leave her car behind. "I walked into my neighborhood then — I wasn't able to drive — and got everything I could collect in my hands and walked out," she said. Since then, Hermer said, her kids have been asking her where they'll live and where they'll go to school. She doesn't have an answer for them right now. Hermer is the owner of multiple restaurants in the Los Angeles area and the founder of “You Give, We Cook, They Eat,” a program she started during the pandemic. The program will now provide food to shelters and families in need. “We’re just holding each other right now, and that’s community. So even though the Palisades is burning down, we’re here,” Hermer said. Anthony Correia Conditions tonight mean fire crews can battle the new fire in the Hollywood Hills, the Sunset Fire, by air. When the deadly Eaton Fire exploded near Paseneda last night, the extreme wind kept the air crews on the ground. Dennis Romero Alicia Victoria Lozano Los Angeles police are being enlisted in the fight against the Sunset Fire in the Hollywood Hills, Mayor Karen Bass said. Police will help fleeing evacuees, direct traffic, close roads near the flames and expand street access for firefighters, she said tonight on X. She said officers are a part of city efforts to "urgently" ease evacuations and fire response in a part of the city that includes steep hills and narrow, winding streets. "We are deploying LAPD officers to respond to Hollywood to help alleviate evacuation traffic," Bass said. Rebecca Cohen "This is the night when my house might burn down," Lawrence O’Donnell said on MSNBC tonight. "It is being threatened by fire now in a way that wasn't possible even yesterday or earlier today that we did not know about." "This situation really is happening in a way that we have never seen before," O'Donnell said. When he delivered his remarks on his show, O'Donnell said he had no idea what is happening to his house or whether it is still standing — an experience he shares with everyone who had to evacuate. But he also noted a luxury that many do not have: being able to monitor the situation in L.A. from the comfort of his second home in New York City, thousands of miles away. "If you have a home in Los Angeles, if you have an apartment, if you have anything in Los Angeles now, you do not know anymore whether you're going to see it again," O'Donnell said. Rudy Chinchilla Undergraduate classes will be canceled while graduate classes will be taught remotely tomorrow and Friday, UCLA announced. Classes for UCLA Extension, the university's continuing education division, will also be remote tomorrow and Friday, the school said. The Geffen Academy, UCLA Lab School and Early Care and Education PreK-12 programs will be closed on those days. There is no immediate fire danger to the campus, in Los Angeles' Westwood community, but the air quality in the area is likely to worsen in the hours ahead, the university said. "The first week of classes is typically a joyous occasion, and I am deeply sorry that the fires in our region have instead brought so much pain and caused so much devastation," Chancellor Julio Frenk said in a letter to the school community. Megan Lebowitz President Joe Biden has canceled his coming trip to Italy to deal with the wildfires, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. "After returning this evening from Los Angeles, where earlier today he had met with police, fire and emergency personnel fighting the historic fires raging in the area and approved a Major Disaster declaration for California, President Biden made the decision to cancel his upcoming trip to Italy to remain focused on directing the full federal response in the days ahead," she said. He had initially planned to meet with Pope Francis, Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during the trip. Read the full story here. Rebecca Cohen The Sunset Fire, which sparked this evening in the Hollywood Hills, is under aerial assault by firefighters. Unlike last night, crews tonight are able to drop water on the blaze and the wind is less severe — advantages for firefighters. NBC Los Angeles reporters on the scene and in the air reported that it appeared as though crews were making progress in battling the blaze but warned that embers could easily spark new fires. The Sunset Fire, which has prompted evacuations, is at 20 acres. Tom Llamas Gregg Champion evacuated from the Palisades Fire with his wife and three daughters, but his house could not be saved. Awards, pictures, sports memorabilia, memories of going to the ranch and on ski trips — all went up in flames. “All the memories are gone," Champion said. Champion said he is on a text chain with about 11 other families of kids with whom his children play soccer and volleyball. All those families lost their homes, too, he said. "There's nothing left in the Palisades," Champion said. "Nothing." Rudy Chinchilla The Sunset Fire broke out shortly before 6 p.m. in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles near the popular Runyon Canyon. It quickly grew to 20 acres, prompting mandatory evacuations from Laurel Canyon Boulevard on the west to Mulholland Drive on the north to the 101 Freeway on the east down to Hollywood Boulevard on the south. Kalhan Rosenblatt Los Angeles residents are turning to a free nonprofit-run app to help them navigate the catastrophic fires ravaging the area. Watch Duty, which launched in 2021 and is now in 22 states, provides live updates to users about nearby wildfires and firefighting efforts. The app is powered by a team of volunteers and staff members — active and retired firefighters, dispatchers and veteran storm watchers, according to its website. Throughout yesterday and into today, many Angelenos circulated screenshots of the app across social media, encouraging others to download it and calling it a lifeline amid rapidly changing weather conditions. Read the full story here. Chloe Melas Rebecca Cohen Celebrities who live in Southern California are sharing the news that they have lost their homes in the fires. Billy and Janice Crystal said in a statement that the home they have lived in since 1979 was gone. "Words cannot describe the enormity of the devastation we are witnessing and experiencing," the Crystals said. "We ache for our friends and neighbors who have also lost their homes and businesses in this tragedy." "The Pacific Palisades is a resilient community of amazing people and we know in time it will rise again." The Crystals said they are praying for “the safety of the firefighters and first responders, and Paris Hilton, too, shared her appreciation for rescuers and her community amid the devastation. Hilton said on X that she was "heartbroken beyond words" after she watched her Malibu home burn down on live TV. She described the loss as "overwhelming" but added she is "holding onto gratitude that my family is safe." She said she is looking into how "we can best support the communities impacted by these fires" and hopes to make a "meaningful difference" as soon as possible. "We're in this together, LA," Hilton wrote. Phil Helsel A brush fire has broken out in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles near Runyon Canyon, the city’s fire chief said at a news conference this evening. The new fire had broken out within five minutes of Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley's announcement around 5:50 p.m. “I don’t have a lot of information. I can tell you we’re throwing all of our available resources at it as we speak,” Crowley said before she excused herself from the news event. “I am seeing active water drops as we speak.” Phil Helsel Three smaller fires that broke out in Los Angeles and Ventura counties have been contained or had their forward progress stopped, fire officials said. The Woodley Fire in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles has been controlled at around 30 acres, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said at a news conference. The Lidia Fire, which broke out near the community of Acton in a region between the Sierra Pelona and San Gabriel mountains, was an estimated 80 to 100 acres but 30% contained, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said. “Thankfully, forward progress has been stopped,” he said. The fire in Ventura County, the Olivas Fire, burned 28 acres after it started today, but its forward progress was stopped and firefighters were mopping up this afternoon, the Ventura County Fire Department said. But there are still major wildfires burning in Los Angeles and Los Angeles County: the Palisades Fire in Pacific Palisades, the Hurst Fire in the Sylmar area of Los Angeles and the Eaton Fire in the Altadena and Pasadena area. Morgan Chesky Reporting from Altadena, California Kymm Snowden traveled back to Altadena after his mother fled the Eaton Fire, which erupted yesterday, to check on her home — but the fire was close by. “It’s mind-blowing. I don’t even have words for it. I’m just hoping they can put that out,” said Snowden, whose grandfather and other family members have lived in the foothills before he was born. The Eaton Fire has grown to more than 10,000 acres after it broke out at around 6:30 p.m. yesterday near Altadena, a city at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains, officials have said. Five people have died, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said. Hundreds of structures have been destroyed, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said. Snowden said that usually fires are in the mountains, not in the city. He was taken aback by the devastation. “Every street you go, houses on both sides are leveled,” he said. Several family members have lost homes in the fire, he said. Eric Leonard, NBC Los Angeles The Los Angeles fire chief warned in the weeks before the devastating Palisades Fire that the decision to cut the fire department’s budget by nearly $18 million would diminish its ability to prepare for and respond to large-scale emergencies. The budget reduction, which Mayor Karen Bass approved last year, was mostly absorbed by leaving many administrative jobs unfilled, but that left about $7 million that was cut from the overtime budget that was used for training, fire prevention and other key functions. “The reduction ... has severely limited the department’s capacity to prepare for, train for, and respond to large-scale emergencies, including wildfires,” Chief Kristin Crowley wrote in a memo on Dec. 4. The variable overtime hours, called “V-Hours” within the LAFD, were used to pay for Federal Aviation Administration-mandated pilot training and helicopter coordination staffing for wildfire suppression, the memo said. “Without this funding, pilot compliance and readiness are jeopardized, and aerial firefighting capabilities are diminished,” it said. “Changes to the Air Operations Section impact the Department’s ability to adhere to current automatic and mutual aid agreements, provide air ambulance service, and quickly respond to woodland fires with water dropping helicopters.” The memo also highlighted other programs that would suffer under the cuts, including the Disaster Response Section, which funds the bulldozer teams that cut breaks and control lines around wildfires, and the Critical Incident Planning and Training Section, which develops plans for major emergencies. Fanned by powerful winds, the Palisades Fire, which started yesterday, destroyed hundreds of buildings and burned about 15,800 acres. It is one of five wildfires burning in Southern California. Rebecca Cohen More than 100,000 people have been evacuated, Pasadena Mayor Victor Gordo told reporters this afternoon in discussing the Eaton Fire at a news conference, and 100,000 have been told they may need to evacuate because they live in a danger zone. Five people have died and hundreds of homes have been lost, Gordo said. The Eaton Fire is more 10,600 acres large and at 0% containment, Pasadena Fire Chief Chad Augustine said. He said 200 to 500 structures have been damaged or lost. Sixty strike teams have been requested — around 15 have arrived, and Augustine expects that to grow to 50 within 24 hours. There are 750 firefighters combating the blaze. Augustine said that wind gusts of 70-plus mph have driven the fire and that embers have been spotted 2 to 3 miles ahead of it, sparking small fires of their own. The area remains in red flag conditions, and Augustine expects it to be that way until tomorrow. But, he said, thanks to the current forecast, aircraft are now able to come in to fight the fire. Aircraft have been dropping water since about 10 a.m. PT in an attempt to limit the spread. "We expect, with favorable conditions over the next couple days, to start making good progress on this fire," Augustine said. Tonight's wind conditions will be "very mild," he said, which gives him "confidence that we're going to get a handle on this fire. He later added: "Do I expect a risk of fire spread tomorrow? Yes. Do I expect erratic fire weather like we saw last night? No." Augustine also noted the "rarity" it is to have two major brush fires in L.A. County in one day. Rudy Chinchilla Southern California’s deadly, raging wildfires are affecting the Hollywood awards season as flames and smoke put a halt to the usual glitz and glamour. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Writers Guild of America today announced that they will delay announcing their awards nominees. The academy, which hands out the Oscars, will announce nominees on Jan. 19 — two days later than originally scheduled — to give its members affected by the fires an extended window to vote for nominees, The Associated Press reported. The WGA West and the WGA East said in a statement that nominees will be announced Monday. Yesterday, the Screen Actors Guild announced that it had canceled its planned in-person awards nomination ceremony because of the extreme fire conditions. Instead, nominees were announced today on its website. Phil Helsel Pasadena has seen “a brutal 22 hours” since the Eaton Fire broke out yesterday but will rebuild, City Manager Miguel Márquez said. Winds were gusting around 80 mph after the Eaton Fire broke out in Eaton Canyon near Altadena around 6:30 p.m., he said, and first responders went door to door to get people to safety. “We will put out the fire. And then it will be time to rebuild,” Márquez said at a news conference this afternoon. The Eaton Fire has grown to more than 10,600 acres and destroyed more than 100 structures, officials said earlier today. At least five people have died. Curtis Bunn A man in Pacific Palisades captured on video how he and his elderly relative escaped nearby raging fires. Aaron Samson used his phone to record the drama. They were directed by law enforcement to leave their car on a street where traffic had stalled and a number of vehicles were abandoned. Samson's father-in-law appeared unstable for a moment when he emerged into the air, which was laden with smoke. Samson gathered his rolling walker, and they made their way up the street, where a “good Samaritan” gave them a ride to safety in Santa Monica. The video also captures a distraught women yelling into her cellphone, apparently devastated by the destruction. Antonio Planas Nearly 330,000 customers are still without power in in Southern California. The latest figures provided by the tracking website PowerOutage.us show there were 329,457 power outages at 4:15 p.m. local time (7:15 p.m. ET). That represents a significant drop. Only hours earlier in the afternoon, the website said about 1.5 million Southern California customers were without power. Steve Patterson Reporting from Altadena, Calif. Part of a home collapsed during a live report, an in-the-moment example of the wreckage that has engulfed this town. Gusting winds of up to 100 mph make it feel like a hurricane in a city. Instead of wind, it's fire you have to worry about. And because of that combination, the extent of the damage to the community, which was hit “hard and fast,” will be devastating. The stress firefighters are experiencing is substantial. They are trying to save more structures, which could lead to more embers, which could lead to more fires, which lead to more tears. Rudy Chinchilla Owners of horses and other large livestock can take their animals to the Pico Rivera Sports Arena for free emergency shelter, the city announced today. The city said owners can take their animals to the arena at any time and someone will be there to assist them. Pico Rivera is on the southern edge of the San Gabriel Valley, where the Eaton Fire is burning in the Pasadena and Altadena area, north of the city. The sports arena, on Pico Rivera’s northeast edge, is known for its concerts, rodeos and other Hispanic cultural events. “The Pico Rivera Sports Arena is uniquely equipped to provide safe, secure and accessible boarding for horses and other large animals,” Mayor John Garcia said in a statement. “It gives families peace of mind as they prioritize their safety and recovery.” Phil Helsel Three schools suffered “significant damage” in the Palisades Fire, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles school district said. Palisades Charter High School, Palisades Charter Elementary School and Marquez Elementary School were all damaged, the spokesperson for Los Angeles Unified School District said. NBC Los Angeles recorded the scene as flames roared from multiple structures at Palisades Charter High School last night. “We are currently working with local authorities and emergency response teams to assess the situation and determine next steps. Plans are being developed to minimize disruption to instruction,” the school district spokesperson said in an email. Morgan Chesky Stephanie Fuerte Reporting from Altadena, California Firefighters battling the Eaton Fire, which is burning homes in the Altadena area, say they are having issues with hydrants or low water pressure at hydrants. “Right now, we’re finding most of them are down or low-pressure, and we’re having to commit resources to provide water,” Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Josh DeJournett said as they worked to combat a fire at a home today. “If we had a hydrant for this building, we might have been able to save the back half,” he said. There have been issues with water pressure in fighting the Palisades Fire, burning on the other side of Los Angeles County by the Pacific Ocean, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Fire spokesperson Erik Scott said fire crews on that fire did have problems with water. “Water availability was impacted at higher elevations, which affected some fire hydrants due to limited replenishment of water tanks in those areas,” Scott wrote on X today. “The extreme demand caused a slower refill rate for these tanks which created a challenge for our firefighting effort.” Rebecca Cohen Airbnb is working with 211 L.A. to offer free temporary housing for people affected by the wildfires and forced to evacuate their homes. The company said all stays will be fully funded by Airbnb and the guests who are offering their homes. To be eligible, you must have been displaced from your home, you must live in an evacuation zone, you must have an active Airbnb account, and you must be 18 years old. More information on the program can be found here. Melissa Chan Jennifer Schweitzer had to pull her husband away from staring at the burning Altadena home he had loved and lived in for decades. But even then, the two couldn’t bear to go too far away. “We didn’t even leave,” she told NBC Los Angeles reporter Lolita Lopez. The couple moved to the parking lot of a nearby supermarket, hoping for the best. “It’s gonna pass. We’re gonna still have our home,” she said she recalled thinking. But fierce winds pushed them farther away from the home her husband, 49, grew up in and inherited once his father died. As flames further engulfed the home that the couple raised their own children in, Schweitzer and her husband relocated to another parking lot that was still close by. “We still could not leave,” Schweitzer said. “You know that’s — that’s our home.” Schweitzer said that they tried to hose their house down before they left but that their efforts did not stand a chance against the sheer destruction of the Eaton fire. “It’s gone,” she said in tears. "It's all we've got." Within minutes, Schweitzer said, the fire also destroyed their children's school, their neighborhood park and as their local post office, smoke shop and hamburger stand. Now, at the Pasadena Convention Center, a stunned Schweitzer is waiting for more resources and guidance from officials about what to do next. “I’m hoping I just wake up and it’s a dream,” she said. Antonio Planas Lilia Wood The NFL is monitoring wildfires in Southern California as the wildcard playoff game between the Minnesota Vikings and the Los Angeles Rams is scheduled for Monday night. The playoff game is slated for 8 p.m. at the Rams’ home field, SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. “The NFL continues to closely monitor developments in the area and will remain in contact with both clubs and the NFLPA,” the league said in a statement. However, the NFL added, if the game has to be relocated, it will be moved to State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The stadium is home to the Arizona Cardinals. The NFL also said the league’s “priority is the safety of the Los Angeles community. We are grateful for the tireless efforts of the first responders. Our hearts are with Los Angeles and everyone affected by the fires.” The Rams posted today on X about the wildfires. “Our hearts are with those affected by the Eaton Fire in Altadena/Pasadena and the first responders in our community. Be safe,” the team said. The Vikings responded to the Rams’ post with one of their own, saying, “We’re thinking of our Rams friends, their community and the first responders during this time.” Daniel Arkin Mendy Piekarski, a rabbi at a Chabad Lubavitch synagogue and cultural center in Topanga Canyon, rushed to evacuate people from the facility today. He and his colleagues called the parents of 25 preschool students there, and within an hour, all the kids had been picked up and driven out of the evacuation zone. Piekarski, 27, said he and his wife loaded the Chabad’s sacred Torah scrolls into their car before they left the building, wrapping the bundles of parchment in tallit, a fringed garment worn as a prayer shawl. “We cherish them very much, and they’re very valuable, so we made sure to bring them to a safe location outside Topanga,” he said. “We would have loved to take other holy objects, like prayer books, though we didn’t have enough time. It was about taking the most important things: our family and the Torah scrolls. “Of course, it would have been nice to also take some photo albums and pictures,” he added. “But safety is the main thing.” Antonio Planas FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell called the roaring wildfires in the Los Angeles area a “very dynamic and dangerous situation” and said she would be in Southern California on Friday to assess the damage. She told Nicolle Wallace on “Deadline: White House” that authorities are trying to determine what the “maximum impact” could be to get victims of the wildfires the resources they need. Criswell compared the wildfires in Southern California to the 2023 wildfires in Maui that killed more than 100 and destroyed the former capital of the kingdom of Hawaii. Criswell said resources provided to California may end up topping resources provided to Hawaiians affected by the wildfires. She reflected on a recent trip to Maui to check the recovery status and said temporary schools and housing have been set up. "Those are the types of things that we’re going to have to do here, maybe even on a grander scale than what we saw in Maui. But we just don’t know yet," she said. Criswell also urged affected residents to lean on the government and their neighbors, assuring them these dark days will pass. "They can rely on their federal government to come in and support them. They can rely on their neighbors, their friends to help them. There are resources that are out there, whether it’s the federal government and our nonprofit or churches," she said. "We are going to bring all of these together to help you through this." Andrew Blankstein The number of people killed in the Eaton Fire has risen to five, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said. Additional details about the deaths were not immediately available. Earlier today, officials said the blaze had killed two people. The Eaton Fire has burned about 10,600 acres since it started yesterday and is 0% contained, according to Cal Fire. Phil Helsel Two additional brush fires broke out today, one in a community between two mountain ranges in Los Angeles County and one in Ventura County west of Los Angeles, officials said. The fire in Ventura County, the Olivas Fire, was around 28 acres and the Ventura County Fire Department said that firefighters have stopped its forward progress. “Crews will be remaining on scene for the next few hours mopping up hotspots within the fire footprint,” the Ventura County Fire Department said on X. The Lidia Fire broke out in Los Angeles County in a region between the Sierra Pelona Mountains and San Gabriel Mountains. It has burned around 50 acres and has begun burning into the Angeles National Forest, the U.S. Forest Service said. That fire was reported off of Soledad Canyon Road in Acton, a community of around 7,000, the Angeles National Forest said. The Woodley Fire, which broke out today in the San Fernando Valley, was previously reported. That fire has burned around 30 acres, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. The three fires are all zero percent contained, according to Cal Fire. Jesse Rodriguez Antonio Planas The raging wildfires in the Los Angeles area prompted the postponement of the 30th annual Critics Choice Awards in Santa Monica, organizers said today. The award ceremony that was scheduled for Sunday will now be held on Jan. 26, organizers said in a statement. The location of the event will remain at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica and will broadcast live on E!. It will also be available on Peacock the next day, organizers said. “This unfolding tragedy has already had a profound impact on our community,” event CEO Joey Berlin said in the statement. “All our thoughts and prayers are with those battling the devastating fires and with all who have been affected.” Rebecca Cohen The Music Center in Los Angeles said in a statement it has closed its buildings to the public "out of an abundance of caution" amid the wildfire threat in the area. The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Mark Taper Forum, Ahmanson Theatre and Walt Disney Concert Hall have been closed, the center said. There were no performances or events on the campus today. The center said it hopes to resume normal operations tomorrow. NBC News KNBC helicopter reporter Julia Deng describes frightening turbulence and extreme winds as she provides an aerial view of California's raging Palisades Fire. Melissa Chan The city of Los Angeles needs more than 60 new fire stations to meet its average daily need and is not equipped to deal with a catastrophic wildfire emergency of this level, a local official said today. In a live interview with KNBC, Councilwoman Traci Park criticized the city’s lack of resources and manpower to fight even everyday fires, saying she was frustrated with the “chronic underinvestment in our critical infrastructure and our public safety partners.” “The demands that we are putting on our public safety resources is absolutely untenable, and we can’t continue this way,” Park told KNBC reporter Hetty Chang. A report recently found that the city needs at least 62 new fire stations, Park said, adding that there are 100 out-of-service fire engines and ambulances at the mechanics yard because “we don’t have mechanics to repair them.” “We are not staffed to deal with this level of emergency or this number of emergencies spread around a geographic footprint like we have here in the city, in the county of Los Angeles,” Park said. “And as we look forward to the World Cup in 2026 and the Olympics in 2028, this is a painful and tragic reminder of how much work we have ahead.” Antonio Planas Firefighters battling the Palisades Fire are not only fighting the roaring inferno, but also facing challenges with water pressure, an official said today. Erik Scott, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department, posted on X about problems firefighters are facing getting water to the flames. Scott said in the post that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power proactively filled all available water storage tanks, including three 1 million-gallon tanks in the Palisades area. "However, water availability was impacted at higher elevations, which affected some fire hydrants due to limited replenishment of water tanks in those areas," he said. "The extreme demand caused a slower refill rate for these tanks which created a challenge for our firefighting effort." Elizabeth Maline Wildfires across Los Angeles may affect clinic and outpatient appointments at Keck Medicine of USC, it said in a post on X. The Southern California medical system consists of hospitals, clinics and primary care providers. "We continue to monitor the situation to ensure the safety of our patients and staff," Keck Medicine said on X. All Keck Medicine of USC hospitals are open, and all patients with affected appointments will be contacted with additional information, the hospital system said. Jo Yurcaba Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the impact of the fires and winds in the city “devastating” in a statement today on X, adding that she spoke with President Biden “and discussed an urgent path forward towards recovery for the thousands of families impacted.” She thanked Gov. Gavin Newsom and Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., “for your continued support for our city.” Akshay Syal Antonio Planas UCLA Health hospitals treated over 20 patients for fire-related injuries, officials said today. As of 11 a.m. local time, 21 patients were treated and released, and one patient remained hospitalized in critical condition, according to UCLA. Gadi Schwartz Curtis Bunn Reporting from Pacific Palisades, Calif. NBC News correspondent Gadi Schwartz drove through Pacific Palisades and provided an up-close view of the wildfire carnage that roars through the town. Through thick segments of ash, Schwartz points out homes and an apartment building that were engulfed in flames. Landmarks were destroyed, like the once-majestic Pacific Palisades Presbyterian Church and Gelson’s grocery store. The next mile showed utter devastation, including a prominent home that sat on a hill overlooking Sunset Boulevard. Most people had evacuated, although there were a few people riding bicycles. Liz Kreutz California Gov. Gavin Newsom told NBC News the closest thing he's seen to the fires blazing in his state was the deadly fire in Paradise, but at this stage, just 24 hours in, he said he's never seen anything like this, in size and scope. "It's stunning. Nothing comes close," he said. Newsom said they'll need to start focusing on clean-up efforts soon, but said right now "it's about keeping people safe, making sure people are heeding the evacuation orders." He said the Palisades Fire is 0% contained and noted the "great challenge" intense winds are bringing to fighting the fires. Newsom said they were as prepared as they could be. On Sunday night, he directed 110 fire engines to the area of the Palisades Fire, in addition to water tenders and helicopters among other firefighting resources. Despite that, the governor thinks this could be one of the costliest fires in history, something he said he was discussing with President Joe Biden today, pointing to the complexities of the multiple fires, the wind and humidity forecast, and that they have pulled resources from not only around California but from other states as well. "I think that says everything there is to know about the magnitude of it," Newsom said. Antonio Planas More than 1.5 million customers are without power in Southern California as wildfires burn throughout the Los Angeles area, according to PowerOutage.us. The outage numbers leapt from the 400,000 without power about two hours prior. In Los Angeles County alone, about 957,000 customers were without electricity, according to the site. Saba Hamedy Reporting from Los Angeles A handful of L.A. restaurants are preparing food for first responders in an effort to help the community amid the devastating fires. Yeastie Boys Bagels, a popular food truck known for its New York-style bagels, posted that it is going to evacuation centers in Pasadena, Pacoima, Westwood and downtown Los Angeles to provide meals. The business posted a series of images of people receiving the food. Jon & Vinnys, another L.A. staple, wrote a note on Instagram saying it is "working on ways to support you, our amazing first responders and the broader community." "At this time, all our restaurant locations are open for those seeking refuge and regular dine-ins," the Italian restaurant wrote in its post. "Wait times may be a bit longer (only a bit!) as some of our teams are preparing food for first responders." Le Great Outdoor, a restaurant in Santa Monica, wrote on its Instagram story that today it is "focusing on helping fire fighters and first responders." The business asked people to purchase a firefighter meal on the restaurant website, noting that for every meal purchased, the restaurant will provide an additional meal. NBC News The Palisades Fire put a serious “strain” on the city’s water system after three million gallons were used in just 15 hours, according to officials. Sheila Kelliher, captain of the Los Angeles Fire Department, detailed the challenges of putting out the fires and explained how the department decides to deploy resources. Elizabeth Maline The NASA Jet Propulsion Lab, managed by CalTech and located in La Cañada Flintridge, will be closed to employees and visitors until Monday, according to to the lab's emergency website. Deep Space Network operations normally conducted at JPL have been moved offsite to a backup operations center. A "small number" of critical personnel remained on site this morning. Although the lab has sustained some wind damage, there are no damages as a result of the ongoing fires, JPL Director Laurie Leshin said in a post on X. Phil Helsel The Los Angeles Kings home game against the Calgary Flames scheduled for tonight has been postponed, the NHL team said, as fires in the region continue to burn amid high winds. “Our hearts are with the entire Los Angeles community,” the team said in a statement. “We appreciate the hard working First Responders who are diligently working to contain the fire and protect our community.” A new date was not announced. Tickets for tonight’s game will be valid for the rescheduled game, the team said. Kyla Guilfoil President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration for California that will clear the way for federal funds and resources to be accessed in recovery efforts, according to the White House. The declaration will allow "survivors to immediately access funds and resources to jumpstart their recovery," a White House statement said. Biden is "focused on mobilizing life-saving and life-sustaining resources across the region," the statement added, as the president is "praying for those who lost loved ones, had property damaged, were injured, and for everyone affected by this and other devastating fires in the area." Alongside the president's declaration, FEMA has approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant to reimburse California for its firefighting costs overnight. The administration also said that five large air tankers, 10 federal firefighting helicopters and dozens of fire engines from the U.S. Forest Service are being deployed to the efforts in the state. Four Modular Air Firefighting System (MAFFS) are on their way from the Department of Defense, along with 10 Navy helicopters with water delivery buckets to assist with aerial suppression, the statement added. The resources will add to the two Modular Air Firefighting System units coming from the California National Guard, which expects another two to be on the way from Nevada's National Guard. NBC News Startling video captured the grounds of the Villa de Leon on fire. The historic mansion has been featured in many high-profile music videos and commercials. The mansion is located near the Getty Villa, an educational center and art museum housing a vast collection of Ancient Greek and Roman works and artifacts. Annemarie Bonner During a briefing today with President Joe Biden and Gov. Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Tony Marrone announced that states including Arizona, Nevada and Washington are deploying their resources to assist. "We requested 250 additional engines into L.A. County with 1,000 personnel. We also are using our compacts with other states like Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Firefighters from those regions are on their way down to Los Angeles County right now to assist us," he said. The Oregon Fire Marshall also posted that they have mobilized 12 strike teams from the Oregon fire service to the wildfires. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also shared that he has offered to send resources from his state, which he shared on X. "When disaster strikes, we must come together to help our fellow Americans in any way we can. The state of Florida has offered help to assist the people of California in responding to these fires and in rebuilding communities that have been devastated," he wrote. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul also shared that her state is ready to deploy resources if they are needed, saying she has been in touch with the state of California. She also called the wildfires "horrific" and said they are "praying for all who are impacted." Kyla Guilfoil At a briefing at a Santa Monica firehouse this afternoon, President Joe Biden called the ongoing wildfires in Southern California "astounding." "We're prepared to [do] anything and everything as long as it takes to contain these fires and help reconstruct, make sure that we get back to normal," the president said at the briefing. Biden said that he plans to sign a declaration today to "provide for everything the federal government can do," adding that he's directed the Department of Defense to "rapidly provide additional firefighting personnel and capabilities." "It's going to be a hell of a long way. It's going to take time, federal government is here to stay, as long as it needs," he added. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who attended the briefing, told the president he had "next level appreciation" for the federal support. Marlene Lenthang Actor and Pacific Palisades resident Steve Guttenberg is on the ground trying to offer a helping hand, attempting to move abandoned cars and help lost pets. “I’m OK … yesterday morning everything was fine. About 10 o’clock, this crazy fire was occurring,” he recalled, saying the winds were “the hardest I've ever seen in my life.” “People are really panicking and really scared right now. Most people have evacuated their homes. But the fire is really raging. These winds are terrible, the winds are so hot,” he told MSNBC’s Chris Jansing. “It was like a volcano.” He recalled trying to save a dog in the street last night and seeing grocery stores and the local high school on fire. He urged people to help each other through the devastation. “I want to use this moment to tell people in a crisis, anytime there’s a crisis and you abandon your car, leave the keys in the car so guys like me can move the car to the curb so that fire fighters can get through with fire trucks,” he said. “We should use kindness and this compassion not only during a crisis but we should remember to use it all the time,” he added. Elizabeth Maline There are over 400,000 customers without power across the state of California as of 11:15 a.m. local time (2:15 p.m. ET), according to poweroutage.us, which tracks power outages across the United States. In Los Angeles County alone, there are currently over 260,000 customers without power. Marlene Lenthang Mayor Karen Bass said all Los Angeles Fire Department air operations in the Palisades have resumed after they were halted due to extreme weather conditions overnight. “LAFD helicopters are back to dropping water and hundreds of firefighters continue to be on the scene to help respond to the #PalisadesFire and #HurstFire,” she wrote on X. Marlene Lenthang The Palisades Fire has grown to 11,802 acres, as of 11:30 a.m. local time (2:30 p.m. ET). L.A. Fire Chief Kristin M. Crowley briefed President Biden on the new numbers this afternoon. "High, high, high winds. I've never seen the winds (like this) in my 25 year career," she said. "It's an active, active fire fight with our firefighters, and they're doing the very best to protect our people within this area." Marlene Lenthang President Joe Biden appeared at a Santa Monica fire station this afternoon to receive an in-person briefing on the wildfires raging across the Los Angeles area. He was joined by Gov. Gavin Newsom. Melissa Chan In a live broadcast, NBC Los Angeles photographer Alex Vasquez said he saw about 30 people who decided not to evacuate or had left the area but then came back in an attempt to save their homes. One of them was a woman who said she returned after seeing her neighbor’s home in flames while watching TV. “I’m determined to save my home,” she told NBC Los Angeles. Another neighbor told the news station he was “exhausted” after helping his neighbors douse their homes with water. “Just trying to do what I can,” he said. Vasquez said firefighters do not want homeowners to do this. He said the area is barricaded and that law enforcement has been telling people to turn around when they arrive. At the Pasadena Convention Center, people who evacuated the Eaton Fire were offered bottles of water and Gatorade, according to a woman who fled there with her husband, mother, sister and dog. The woman told NBC Los Angeles reporter Lolita Lopez that she woke up at 4 a.m. and saw texts on her phone from her loved ones asking if she was OK. She said she read about the fire and immediately jumped out of bed, ran to her closet and started packing. She and her husband picked up her mother and sister who live nearby and headed for the convention center. “The wind was blowing really hard at that point. There was just smoke everywhere,” she said. While trucks outside the convention center today were offering food, the woman, who was sitting on the floor with her family, said she had no appetite because it’s been “intense.” “I’m just waiting to see what happens,” she said. Annemarie Bonner Maria Shriver, former first lady of California and ex-wife of Arnold Schwarzenegger, posted a lengthy social media statement sharing that everything in her local community is now gone from the fires. “Heartbreaking, devastating, beyond belief. Everything is gone. Our neighborhood, our restaurants. All our friends have lost everything. We have evacuated, but are safe. But people have lost everything, “ she wrote. She also encouraged her followers and community members to “stay safe, stay out of harms way, and allow firefighters do what they can to help those who need immediate assistance.” Other celebrities have also chimed on, including actress Mandy Moore, who shared that she’s unsure whether or not her home is still standing. “Grateful for the kindness of friends that we had a place to land last night.

## Elvis Presley

### [Elvis Presley - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley)

Elvis Aaron Presley[a] (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), often known mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Known as the "King of Rock and Roll", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Presley's energized performances and interpretations of songs, and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, brought both great success and initial controversy. Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi; his family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, when he was 13. His music career began there in 1954, at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who managed him for the rest of his career. Presley's first RCA Victor single, "Heartbreak Hotel", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the US. Within a year, RCA Victor would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular rock and roll; though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans[6] led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral well-being of white American youth.[7] In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, he relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. Presley held few concerts, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of Presley's most famous films included Jailhouse Rock (1957), Blue Hawaii (1961), and Viva Las Vegas (1964). In 1968, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed NBC television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. Years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating severely compromised his health, and Presley died unexpectedly in August 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is one of the best-selling music artists in history, with sale estimates ranging from 500 million records to over a billion worldwide.[b] He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, rock and roll, rockabilly, rhythm and blues, adult contemporary, and gospel. He won three Grammy Awards, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. He holds several records, including the most RIAA-certified gold and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the Billboard 200, the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart, and the most number-one singles by any act on the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, to Gladys Love (née Smith) and Vernon Presley.[8][9] Elvis' twin Jesse Garon was delivered 35 minutes before, stillborn.[10] Presley became close to both parents, especially his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration.[11] Vernon moved from one odd job to the next,[12][13] and the family often relied on neighbors and government food assistance. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of altering a check and was jailed for eight months.[11] In September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his teachers regarded him as "average".[14] His first public performance was a singing contest at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, when he was 10; he sang "Old Shep" and recalled placing fifth.[15] A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday;[16][17] he received guitar lessons from two uncles and a pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, "I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it."[18] In September 1946, Presley entered a new school, Milam, for sixth grade. The following year, he began singing and playing his guitar at school. He was often teased as a "trashy" kid who played hillbilly music.[19] Presley was a devotee of Mississippi Slim's radio show. He was described as "crazy about music" by Slim's younger brother, one of Presley's classmates. Slim showed Presley chord techniques.[20] When his protégé was 12, Slim scheduled him for two on-air performances. Presley was overcome by stage fright the first time but performed the following week.[21] In November 1948, the family moved to Memphis, Tennessee.[22] Enrolled at L. C. Humes High School, Presley received a C in music in eighth grade. When his music teacher said he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar and sang a recent hit, "Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me".[23] He was usually too shy to perform openly and was occasionally bullied by classmates for being a "mama's boy".[24] In 1950, Presley began practicing guitar under the tutelage of Lee Denson, a neighbor. They and three other boys, including two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers Dorsey and Johnny Burnette—formed a loose musical collective.[25] During his junior year, Presley began to stand out among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew his sideburns and styled his hair. He would head down to Beale Street, the heart of Memphis' thriving blues scene, and admire the wild, flashy clothes at Lansky Brothers. By his senior year, he was wearing those clothes.[26] He competed in Humes' Annual "Minstrel" Show in 1953, singing and playing "Till I Waltz Again with You", a recent hit for Teresa Brewer. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: I wasn't popular in school ... I failed music—only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show ... when I came onstage, I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became in school after that.[27] Presley, who could not read music, played by ear and frequented record stores that provided jukeboxes and listening booths. He knew all of Hank Snow's songs,[28] and he loved records by other country singers such as Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, Ted Daffan, Jimmie Rodgers, Jimmie Davis, and Bob Wills.[29] The Southern gospel singer Jake Hess, one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his ballad-singing style.[30][31] Presley was a regular audience member at the monthly, all-night singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African American spirituals.[32] Presley listened to regional radio stations, such as WDIA, that played what were then called "race records": spirituals, blues, and the modern, backbeat-heavy rhythm and blues.[33] Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues venues only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences.[34] Many of his future recordings were inspired by local African-American musicians such as Arthur Crudup and Rufus Thomas.[35][36] B.B. King recalled that he had known Presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent Beale Street.[37] By the time he graduated high school in June 1953, Presley had singled out music as his future.[38][39] In August 1953, Presley checked into Memphis Recording Service, the company run by Sam Phillips before he started Sun Records. He aimed to pay for studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc: "My Happiness" and "That's When Your Heartaches Begin". He later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he "sounded like". Biographer Peter Guralnick argued that Presley chose Sun in the hope of being discovered.[40] In January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sun—"I'll Never Stand in Your Way" and "It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You"—but again nothing came of it.[41] Not long after, he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows,[42] and another for the band of Eddie Bond.[43] Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused.[45] In June, he acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad, "Without You", that he thought might suit Presley. The teenaged singer came by the studio but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing other numbers and was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield "Scotty" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work with Presley for a recording session.[46] The session, held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to abort and go home, Presley launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's "That's All Right". Moore recalled, "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them." Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.[47] Three days later, popular Memphis disc jockey Dewey Phillips played "That's All Right" on his Red, Hot, and Blue show.[48] Listener interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black.[49] During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass song, Bill Monroe's "Blue Moon of Kentucky", again in a distinctive style and employing a jury-rigged echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed "slapback". A single was pressed with "That's All Right" on the A-side and "Blue Moon of Kentucky" on the reverse.[50] The trio played publicly for the first time at the Bon Air club on July 17, 1954.[51] Later that month, they appeared at the Overton Park Shell, with Slim Whitman headlining. Here Elvis pioneered "Rubber Legs", his signature dance movement.[52][53] A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: His wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.[54] Moore recalled, "During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mic and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild."[55] Soon after, Moore and Black left their old band to play with Presley regularly, and disc jockey/promoter Bob Neal became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club, a dance venue in Memphis. When Presley played, teenagers rushed from the pool to fill the club, then left again as the house western swing band resumed.[56] Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, "His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick."[57] Amid these live performances, Presley returned to Sun studio for more recording sessions.[58] Presley made what would be his only appearance on Nashville's Grand Ole Opry on October 2; Opry manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was "not bad" but did not suit the program.[59][60] In November 1954, Presley performed on Louisiana Hayride—the Opry's chief, and more adventurous, rival. The show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. His nervous first set drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response.[61] Soon after the show, the Hayride engaged Presley for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8, he purchased a Martin instrument for $175 (equivalent to $2,000 in 2023) and his trio began playing in new locales, including Houston, Texas, and Texarkana, Arkansas.[62] Presley made his first television appearance on the KSLA-TV broadcast of Louisiana Hayride. Soon after, he failed an audition for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts on the CBS television network. By early 1955, Presley's regular Hayride appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a regional star.[63][64] In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought him to the attention of Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Having successfully managed the top country star Eddy Arnold, Parker was working with the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow. Parker booked Presley on Snow's February tour.[63][64] By August, Sun had released 10 sides credited to "Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill"; the latest recordings included a drummer. Some of the songs, like "That's All Right", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the "R&B idiom of negro field jazz"; others, like "Blue Moon of Kentucky", were "more in the country field", "but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both".[65] This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because Presley sounded too much like a black artist and none of the R&B stations would touch him because "he sounded too much like a hillbilly."[66] The blend came to be known as "rockabilly". At the time, Presley was billed as "The King of Western Bop", "The Hillbilly Cat", and "The Memphis Flash".[67] Presley renewed Neal's management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser.[68] The group maintained an extensive touring schedule.[69] Neal recalled, "It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys. So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him."[70] The trio became a quartet when Hayride drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of Bill Haley, whose "Rock Around the Clock" track had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.[71] At the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the year's most promising male artist.[72] After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with RCA Victor on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000.[73][c] Presley, aged 20, was legally still a minor, so his father signed the contract.[74] Parker arranged with the owners of Hill & Range Publishing, Jean and Julian Aberbach, to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley. Songwriters were obliged to forgo one-third of their customary royalties in exchange for having Presley perform their compositions.[75][d] By December, RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before month's end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.[78] On January 10, 1956, Presley made his first recordings for RCA Victor in Nashville.[79] Extending his by-now customary backup of Moore, Black, Fontana, and Hayride pianist Floyd Cramer—who had been performing at live club dates with Presley—RCA Victor enlisted guitarist Chet Atkins and three background singers, including Gordon Stoker of the popular Jordanaires quartet.[80] The session produced the moody "Heartbreak Hotel", released as a single on January 27.[79] Parker brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS's Stage Show for six appearances over two months. The program, produced in New York City, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. After his first appearance on January 28, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA Victor's New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a cover of Carl Perkins' rockabilly anthem "Blue Suede Shoes". In February, Presley's "I Forgot to Remember to Forget", a Sun recording released the previous August, reached the top of the Billboard country chart.[81] Neal's contract was terminated and Parker became Presley's manager.[82] RCA Victor released Presley's self-titled debut album on March 23. Joined by five previously unreleased Sun recordings, its seven recently recorded tracks included two country songs, a bouncy pop tune, and what would centrally define the evolving sound of rock and roll: "Blue Suede Shoes"—"an improvement over Perkins' in almost every way", according to critic Robert Hilburn—and three R&B numbers that had been part of Presley's stage repertoire, covers of Little Richard, Ray Charles, and The Drifters. As described by Hilburn, these were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists ... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases.[83] It became the first rock and roll album to top the Billboard chart, a position it held for ten weeks.[79] While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argued that the album's cover image, "of Elvis having the time of his life on stage with a guitar in his hands played a crucial role in positioning the guitar ... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music."[84] On April 3, Presley made the first of two appearances on NBC's The Milton Berle Show. His performance, on the deck of the USS Hancock in San Diego, California, prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates.[85] A few days later, Presley and his band were flying to Nashville, Tennessee, for a recording session when an engine died and the plane almost went down over Arkansas.[86] Twelve weeks after its original release, "Heartbreak Hotel" became Presley's first number-one pop hit. In late April, Presley began a two-week residency at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.[87] The shows were poorly received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guests, "like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party", a Newsweek critic wrote.[88] Amid his Vegas tenure, Presley, who had acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures.[89] He began a tour of the Midwest in mid-May, covering 15 cities in as many days.[90] He had attended several shows by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys in Vegas and was struck by their cover of "Hound Dog", a hit in 1953 for blues singer Big Mama Thornton by songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. It became his new closing number.[91] After a show in La Crosse, Wisconsin, an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic diocese's newspaper was sent to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. It warned that Presley is a definite danger to the security of the United States. ... [His] actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth. ... After the show, more than 1,000 teenagers tried to gang into Presley's room at the auditorium. ... Indications of the harm Presley did just in La Crosse were the two high school girls ... whose abdomen and thigh had Presley's autograph.[92] Presley's second Milton Berle Show appearance came on June 5 at NBC's Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour. Milton Berle persuaded Presley to leave his guitar backstage.[93] During the performance, Presley abruptly halted an up-tempo rendition of "Hound Dog" and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with exaggerated body movements.[93] His gyrations created a storm of controversy.[94] Jack Gould of The New York Times wrote, Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability. ... His phrasing, if it can be called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner's aria in a bathtub. ... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body ... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway.[95] Ben Gross of the New York Daily News opined that popular music "has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley. ... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis ... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos".[96] Ed Sullivan, whose variety show was the nation's most popular, declared Presley "unfit for family viewing".[97] To Presley's displeasure, he soon found himself being referred to as "Elvis the Pelvis", which he called "childish".[98] The Berle shows drew such high ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 appearance on NBC's The Steve Allen Show in New York. Allen, who was no fan of rock and roll, introduced a "new Elvis" in a white bowtie and black tails. Presley sang "Hound Dog" for less than a minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bowtie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd ... [he] set things up so that Presley would show his contrition".[99] Allen later wrote that he found Presley's "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" and worked him into the "comedy fabric" of his program.[100] Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, "I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance."[101] Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career.[102] Later that night, he appeared on Hy Gardner Calling, a popular local television show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism of him, Presley responded, "No, I haven't ... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music. ... how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?"[96] The next day, Presley recorded "Hound Dog", "Any Way You Want Me" and "Don't Be Cruel". The Jordanaires sang harmony, as they had on The Steve Allen Show; they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later, Presley made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis, at which he announced, "You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight."[103] In August, a judge in Jacksonville, Florida, ordered Presley to tame his act. Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order.[104] The single pairing "Don't Be Cruel" with "Hound Dog" ruled the top of the charts for eleven weeks—a mark that would not be surpassed for 36 years.[105] Recording sessions for Presley's second album took place in Hollywood in early September. Leiber and Stoller, the writers of "Hound Dog", contributed "Love Me".[106] Allen's show with Presley had, for the first time, beaten The Ed Sullivan Show in the ratings. Sullivan booked Presley for three appearances for an unprecedented $50,000.[107] The first, on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewers—a record 82.6 percent of the television audience.[108] Actor Charles Laughton hosted the show, filling in while Sullivan was recovering from a car accident.[97] According to legend, Presley was shot only from the waist up. Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows, Sullivan had opined that Presley "got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants—so when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock. ... I think it's a Coke bottle. ... We just can't have this on a Sunday night. This is a family show!"[109] Sullivan publicly told TV Guide, "As for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots."[107] In fact, Presley was shown head-to-toe. Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted with screams.[110][111] Presley's performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad "Love Me Tender", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders.[112] More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show that made Presley a national celebrity.[97] Accompanying Presley's rise to fame, a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize. The historian Marty Jezer wrote that Presley began the "biggest pop craze" since Glenn Miller and Frank Sinatra and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture: As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed. ... Presley, more than anyone else, gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generation—the first in America ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture.[113] The audience response at Presley's live shows became increasingly fevered. Moore recalled, "He'd start out, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog,' and they'd just go to pieces. They'd always react the same way. There'd be a riot every time."[114] At the two concerts he performed in September at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, fifty National Guardsmen were added to the police detail to prevent a ruckus.[115] Elvis, Presley's second RCA Victor album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one. The album includes "Old Shep", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA Victor session. According to Guralnick, "the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm" showed "the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique."[116] Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from "That's All Right" through Elvis, rock critic Dave Marsh wrote that "these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become."[117] Presley returned to The Ed Sullivan Show, hosted this time by its namesake, on October 28. After the performance, crowds in Nashville and St. Louis burned him in effigy.[97] His first motion picture, Love Me Tender, was released on November 21. Though he was not top-billed, the film's original title—The Reno Brothers—was changed to capitalize on his latest number-one record: "Love Me Tender" had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. To further take advantage of Presley's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role. The film was panned by critics but did very well at the box office.[89] Presley would receive top billing on every subsequent film he made.[118] On December 4, Presley dropped into Sun Records, where Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis were recording, and had an impromptu jam session along with Johnny Cash. Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any Presley material, he made sure that the session was captured on tape. The results, none officially released for twenty-five years, became known as the "Million Dollar Quartet" recordings.[119] The year ended with a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in $22 million on top of his record sales,[120] and Billboard's declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted.[121] In his first full year at RCA Victor, then the record industry's largest company, Presley had accounted for over fifty percent of the label's singles sales.[112] Presley made his third and final Ed Sullivan Show appearance on January 6, 1957—on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist. Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity.[111][122] In any event, as critic Greil Marcus describes, Presley "did not tie himself down. Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows, he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out."[97] To close, displaying his range and defying Sullivan's wishes, Presley sang a gentle black spiritual, "Peace in the Valley". At the end of the show, Sullivan declared Presley "a real decent, fine boy".[123] Two days later, the Memphis draft board announced that Presley would be classified 1-A and would probably be drafted sometime that year.[124] Each of the three Presley singles released in the first half of 1957 went to number one: "Too Much", "All Shook Up", and "(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear". Already an international star, he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released: The New York Times reported that pressings of his music on discarded X-ray plates were commanding high prices in Leningrad.[125] Presley purchased his 18-room mansion, Graceland, on March 19, 1957.[126] Before the purchase, Elvis recorded Loving You—the soundtrack to his second film, which was released in July. It was his third straight number-one album. The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for Jailhouse Rock, Presley's next film. The songwriting team effectively produced the Jailhouse sessions and developed a close working relationship with Presley, who came to regard them as his "good-luck charm".[127] "He was fast," said Leiber. "Any demo you gave him he knew by heart in ten minutes."[128] The title track became another number-one hit, as was the Jailhouse Rock EP.[129] Presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response.[130] A Detroit newspaper suggested that "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed".[131] Villanova students pelted the singer with eggs in Philadelphia,[131] and in Vancouver the crowd rioted after the show ended, destroying the stage.[132] Frank Sinatra, who had inspired the swooning and screaming of teenage girls in the 1940s, decried rock and roll as "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious. ... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore."[133] Asked for a response, Presley said: I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it. ... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago.[134] Leiber and Stoller were again in the studio for the recording of Elvis' Christmas Album. Toward the end of the session, they wrote a song on the spot at Presley's request: "Santa Claus Is Back in Town", an innuendo-laden blues.[135] The holiday release stretched Presley's string of number-one albums to four and would become the best-selling Christmas album ever in the United States,[136][137] with eventual sales of over 20 million worldwide.[138] After the session, Moore and Black—drawing only modest weekly salaries, sharing in none of Presley's massive financial success—resigned, though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later.[139] On December 20, Presley received his draft notice, though he was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming film King Creole. A couple of weeks into the new year, "Don't", another Leiber and Stoller tune, became Presley's tenth number-one seller. Recording sessions for the King Creole soundtrack were held in Hollywood in mid-January 1958. Leiber and Stoller provided three songs, but it would be the last time Presley and the duo worked closely together.[140] As Stoller later recalled, Presley's manager and entourage sought to wall him off.[141] A brief soundtrack session on February 11 marked the final occasion on which Black was to perform with Presley.[142] On March 24, 1958, Presley was drafted into the United States Army at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers accompanied him into the installation.[143] Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military service, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else.[144] Between March 28 and September 17, 1958, Presley completed basic and advanced training at Fort Hood, Texas, where he was temporarily assigned to Company A, 2d Medium Tank Battalion, 37th Armor. During the two weeks' leave between his basic and advanced training in early June, he recorded five songs in Nashville.[145] In early August, Presley's mother was diagnosed with hepatitis, and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley was granted emergency leave to visit her and arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure at age 46. Presley was devastated and never the same;[146][147] their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.[4] On October 1, 1958, Presley was assigned to the 1st Medium Tank Battalion, 32d Armor, 3d Armored Division, at Ray Barracks, West Germany, where he served as an armor intelligence specialist.[1] On November 27, he was promoted to private first class and on June 1, 1959, to specialist fourth class. While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to amphetamines and became "practically evangelical about their benefits", not only for energy but for "strength" and weight loss.[148] Karate became a lifelong interest: he studied with Jürgen Seydel,[149][150] and later included it in his live performances.[151][152][153] Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier despite his fame, and to his generosity. He donated his Army pay to charity, purchased television sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit.[154] Presley was promoted to sergeant on February 11, 1960.[1] While in Bad Nauheim, Presley, aged 24, met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu.[155] They would marry after a seven-and-a-half-year courtship. In her autobiography, Priscilla said that Presley was concerned that his 24 months in the military would ruin his career. In Special Services, he would have been able to perform and remain in touch with the public, but Parker had convinced him that to gain popular respect, he should serve as a regular soldier.[156] Media reports echoed Presley's concerns about his career, but RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes and Freddy Bienstock of Hill and Range had carefully prepared: armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material, they kept up a regular stream of successful releases.[157] Between his induction and discharge, Presley had ten top-40 hits, including "Wear My Ring Around Your Neck", the bestselling "Hard Headed Woman", and "One Night" in 1958, and "(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I" and the number-one "A Big Hunk o' Love" in 1959.[158] RCA Victor also generated four albums compiling previously issued material during this period, most successfully Elvis' Golden Records (1958), which hit number three on the LP chart.[159] Presley returned to the U.S. on March 2, 1960, and was honorably discharged three days later.[161] The train that carried him from New Jersey to Tennessee was mobbed all the way, and Presley was called upon to appear at scheduled stops to please his fans.[162] On the night of March 20, he entered RCA's Nashville studio to cut tracks for a new album along with a single, "Stuck on You", which was rushed into release and swiftly became a number-one hit.[163] Another Nashville session two weeks later yielded a pair of bestselling singles, the ballads "It's Now or Never" and "Are You Lonesome Tonight?", along with the rest of Elvis Is Back! The album features several songs described by Greil Marcus as full of Chicago blues "menace, driven by Presley's own super-miked acoustic guitar, brilliant playing by Scotty Moore, and demonic sax work from Boots Randolph. Elvis' singing wasn't sexy, it was pornographic."[164] The record "conjured up the vision of a performer who could be all things", according to music historian John Robertson: "a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold; a tempestuous, dangerous lover; a gutbucket blues singer; a sophisticated nightclub entertainer; [a] raucous rocker".[165] Released only days after recording was complete, it reached number two on the album chart.[166][167] Presley returned to television on May 12 as a guest on The Frank Sinatra Timex Special. Also known as Welcome Home Elvis, the show had been taped in late March, the only time all year Presley performed in front of an audience. Parker secured an unheard-of $125,000 for eight minutes of singing. The broadcast drew an enormous viewership.[168] G.I. Blues, the soundtrack to Presley's first film since his return, was a number-one album in October. His first LP of sacred material, His Hand in Mine, followed two months later; it reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the United Kingdom, remarkable figures for a gospel album. In February 1961, Presley performed two shows in Memphis, for a benefit for 24 local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA Victor presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records.[169] A twelve-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album, Something for Everybody.[170] According to John Robertson, it exemplifies the Nashville sound, the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. Presaging much of what was to come from Presley over the next half-decade, the album is largely "a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been Elvis' birthright".[171] It would be his sixth number-one LP. Another benefit concert, for a Pearl Harbor memorial, was staged on March 25 in Hawaii. It was to be Presley's last public performance for seven years.[172] Parker had by now pushed Presley into a heavy filmmaking schedule, focused on formulaic, modestly budgeted musical comedies. Presley initially insisted on pursuing higher roles, but when two films in a more dramatic vein—Flaming Star (1960) and Wild in the Country (1961)—were less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula. Among the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s, there were a few further exceptions.[173] His films were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine dismissed them as a "pantheon of bad taste".[174] Nonetheless, they were virtually all profitable. Hal Wallis, who produced nine, declared, "A Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood."[175] Of Presley's films in the 1960s, 15 were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another five by soundtrack EPs. The films' rapid production and release schedules—Presley frequently starred in three a year—affected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: "three ballads, one medium-tempo [number], one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie".[176] As the decade wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew "progressively worse".[177] Julie Parrish, who appeared in Paradise, Hawaiian Style (1966), says that Presley disliked many of the songs.[178] The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how he would retreat from the studio microphone: "The material was so bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it."[179] Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman. But by and large, according to biographer Jerry Hopkins, the numbers seemed to be "written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll".[180] In the first half of the decade, three of Presley's soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts, and a few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as "Can't Help Falling in Love" (1961) and "Return to Sender" (1962). However, the commercial returns steadily diminished. From 1964 to 1968, Presley had only one top-ten hit: "Crying in the Chapel" (1965), a gospel number recorded in 1960. As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release of Pot Luck and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album How Great Thou Art (1967). It won him his first Grammy Award, for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was "arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs".[181] Shortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met, Presley proposed to Priscilla Beaulieu. They were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in their suite at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas.[182] The flow of formulaic films and assembly-line soundtracks continued. It was not until October 1967, when the Clambake soundtrack LP registered record low sales for a new Presley album, that RCA Victor executives recognized a problem. "By then, of course, the damage had been done", as historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it. "Elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a has-been to all but his most loyal fans."[183] Presley's only child, Lisa Marie, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career.[186] Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, none higher than number 28.[187] His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82. Parker had already shifted his plans to television: he maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.[188] Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned.[189] The show, NBC's highest-rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience.[190] Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked: There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.[191] Marsh calls the performance one of "emotional grandeur and historical resonance".[192] By January 1969, the single "If I Can Dream", written for the special, reached number 12. The soundtrack album rose into the top ten. According to friend Jerry Schilling, the special reminded Presley of what "he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack. ... He was out of prison, man."[190] Binder said of Presley's reaction, "I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life. I give you my word I will never sing a song I don't believe in.'"[190] Buoyed by the experience of the Comeback Special, Presley engaged in a prolific series of recording sessions at American Sound Studio, which led to the acclaimed From Elvis in Memphis. Released in June 1969, it was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Marsh, it is "a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement."[194] The album featured the hit single "In the Ghetto", issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chart—Presley's first non-gospel top ten hit since "Bossa Nova Baby" in 1963. Further hit singles were culled from the American Sound sessions: "Suspicious Minds", "Don't Cry Daddy", and "Kentucky Rain".[195] Presley was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of the Comeback Special, offers came in from around the world. The London Palladium offered Parker US$28,000 (equivalent to $233,000 in 2023) for a one-week engagement. He responded, "That's fine for me, now how much can you get for Elvis?"[196] In May, the brand-new International Hotel in Las Vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, booked Presley for fifty-seven shows over four weeks, beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. Presley assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist James Burton and including two gospel groups, The Imperials and Sweet Inspirations.[197] Costume designer Bill Belew, responsible for the intense leather styling of the Comeback Special, created a new stage look for Presley, inspired by his passion for karate.[198] Nonetheless, Presley was nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal. Parker oversaw a major promotional push, and International Hotel owner Kirk Kerkorian arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.[199] Presley took to the stage without introduction. The audience of 2,200, including many celebrities, gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. A third followed his encore, "Can't Help Falling in Love" (which would be his closing number for much of his remaining life).[200] At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as "The King", Presley gestured toward Fats Domino, who was taking in the scene. "No," Presley said, "that's the real king of rock and roll."[201] The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1 million.[202] Newsweek commented, "There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars."[203] Rolling Stone called Presley "supernatural, his own resurrection."[204] In November, Presley's final non-concert film, Change of Habit, opened. The double album From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. "Suspicious Minds" reached the top of the charts—Presley's first U.S. pop number-one in over seven years, and his last.[205] Cassandra Peterson, later television's Elvira, met Presley during this period in Las Vegas. She recalled of their encounter, "He was so anti-drug when I met him. I mentioned to him that I smoked marijuana, and he was just appalled."[206] Presley also rarely drank—several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.[207] Presley returned to the International early in 1970 for the first of the year's two-month-long engagements, performing two shows a night. Recordings from these shows were issued on the album On Stage.[208] In late February, Presley performed six attendance-record–breaking shows at the Houston Astrodome.[209] In April, the single "The Wonder of You" was issued—a number one hit in the UK, it topped the U.S. adult contemporary chart as well. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the International during August for the documentary Elvis: That's the Way It Is. Presley was performing in a jumpsuit, which would become a trademark of his live act. During this engagement, he was threatened with murder unless US$50,000 (equivalent to $392,000 in 2023) was paid. Presley had been the target of many threats since the 1950s, often without his knowledge.[210] The FBI took the threat seriously and security was increased for the next two shows. Presley went onstage with a Derringer in his right boot and a .45 caliber pistol in his waistband, but the concerts succeeded without any incidents.[211][212] That's the Way It Is, produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings, marked a stylistic shift. As music historian John Robertson noted, The authority of Presley's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R&B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white pop—perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis.[213] After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the South, his first since 1958. Another week-long tour, of the West Coast, followed in November.[214] On December 21, 1970, Presley engineered a meeting with U.S. President Richard Nixon at the White House, where he explained how he believed he could reach out to the hippies to help combat the drug culture he and the president abhorred. He asked Nixon for a Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs badge, to signify official sanction of his efforts. Nixon, who apparently found the encounter awkward, expressed a belief that Presley could send a positive message to young people and that it was, therefore, important that he "retain his credibility".[215] Presley told Nixon that the Beatles, whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era,[216] exemplified what he saw as a trend of anti-Americanism.[217] Presley and his friends previously had a four-hour get-together with the Beatles at his home in Bel Air, California, in August 1965. Paul McCartney later said that he "felt a bit betrayed. ... The great joke was that we were taking [illegal] drugs, and look what happened to him", a reference to Presley's early death linked to prescription drug abuse.[218] The U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce named Presley one of its annual Ten Most Outstanding Young Men of the Nation on January 16, 1971.[219] Not long after, the City of Memphis named the stretch of Highway 51 South on which Graceland is located "Elvis Presley Boulevard". The same year, Presley became the first rock and roll singer to be awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (then known as the Bing Crosby Award).[220][221] Three new, non-film Presley studio albums were released in 1971. Best received by critics was Elvis Country, a concept record that focused on genre standards.[222] The biggest seller was Elvis Sings The Wonderful World of Christmas. According to Greil Marcus, In the midst of ten painfully genteel Christmas songs, every one sung with appalling sincerity and humility, one could find Elvis tom-catting his way through six blazing minutes of "Merry Christmas Baby", a raunchy old Charles Brown blues. [...] If [Presley's] sin was his lifelessness, it was his sinfulness that brought him to life.[223] MGM filmed Presley in April 1972 for Elvis on Tour, which went on to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Documentary Film for that year's Golden Globe Awards. His gospel album He Touched Me, released that month, would earn him his second Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance. A fourteen-date tour commenced with an unprecedented four consecutive sold-out shows at New York's Madison Square Garden.[224] The evening concert on July 10 was issued in LP form a week later. Elvis: As Recorded at Madison Square Garden became one of Presley's biggest-selling albums. After the tour, the single "Burning Love" was released—Presley's last top ten hit on the U.S. pop chart. "The most exciting single Elvis has made since 'All Shook Up'", wrote rock critic Robert Christgau.[225] Presley and his wife had become increasingly distant, barely cohabiting. In 1971, an affair he had with Joyce Bova resulted—unbeknownst to him—in her pregnancy and an abortion.[226] He often raised the possibility of Joyce moving into Graceland.[227] The Presleys separated on February 23, 1972, after Priscilla disclosed her relationship with Mike Stone, a karate instructor Presley had recommended to her. Priscilla related that when she told him, Presley forcefully made love to her, declaring, "This is how a real man makes love to his woman".[228] She later stated in an interview that she regretted her choice of words in describing the incident, and said it had been an overstatement.[229] Five months later, Presley's new girlfriend, Linda Thompson, a songwriter and one-time Memphis beauty queen, moved in with him.[230] Presley and his wife filed for divorce on August 18.[231] According to Joe Moscheo of the Imperials, the failure of Presley's marriage "was a blow from which he never recovered".[232] At a rare press conference that June, a reporter had asked Presley whether he was satisfied with his image. Presley replied, "Well, the image is one thing and the human being another ... it's very hard to live up to an image."[233] In January 1973, Presley performed two benefit concerts for the Kui Lee Cancer Fund in connection with a groundbreaking television special, Aloha from Hawaii, which would be the first concert by a solo artist to be aired globally. The first show served as a practice run and backup should technical problems affect the live broadcast two days later. On January 14, Aloha from Hawaii aired live via satellite to prime-time audiences in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as to U.S. servicemen based across Southeast Asia. In Japan, where it capped a nationwide Elvis Presley Week, it smashed viewing records. The next night, it was simulcast to twenty-eight European countries, and in April an extended version aired in the U.S., receiving a fifty-seven percent share of the TV audience.[235] Over time, Parker's claim that it was seen by one billion or more people[236] would be broadly accepted,[237][238][239] but that figure appeared to have been sheer invention.[240][241] Presley's stage costume became the most recognized example of the elaborate concert garb with which his latter-day persona became closely associated. As described by Bobbie Ann Mason, "At the end of the show, when he spreads out his American Eagle cape, with the full stretched wings of the eagle studded on the back, he becomes a god figure."[242] The accompanying double album, released in February, went to number one and eventually sold over 5 million copies in the U.S.[243] It was Presley's last U.S. number-one pop album during his lifetime.[244] At a midnight show that same month, four men rushed onto the stage in an apparent attack. Security personnel came to Presley's defense, and he ejected one invader from the stage himself. Following the show, Presley became obsessed with the idea that the men had been sent by Mike Stone to kill him. Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, Presley raged, "There's too much pain in me ... Stone [must] die." His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging, Red West, his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when Presley decided, "Aw hell, let's just leave it for now. Maybe it's a bit heavy."[245] Presley's divorce was finalized on October 9, 1973.[246] He and Priscilla would remain close friends until his death, even holding hands while leaving the courtroom where they finalized their divorce. Priscilla recalled that they lived life together "like we were never divorced. Elvis and I still hugged each other, still had love. We would say, 'Mommy said this' and 'Daddy said that.' That helped Lisa to feel stable. There was never any arguing or bitterness."[247] By this time, his health was in serious decline. Twice during the year he overdosed on barbiturates, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. In late 1973, he was hospitalized from the effects of a pethidine addiction. According to his primary care physician, George C. Nichopoulos, Presley "felt that by getting drugs from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the street".[248] Since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and 1973 saw 168 concerts, his busiest schedule ever.[249] Despite his failing health, he undertook another intensive touring schedule in 1974.[250] Presley's condition declined precipitously that September. Keyboardist Tony Brown remembered his arrival at a University of Maryland concert: "He fell out of the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mic for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, 'Is the tour gonna happen'?"[251] Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled: He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up. ... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible. ... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions.[252] On July 13, 1976, Vernon Presley—who had become deeply involved in his son's financial affairs—had fired "Memphis Mafia" bodyguards Red West (Presley's friend since the 1950s), Sonny West, and David Hebler, citing the need to "cut back on expenses".[253][254][255] Presley was in Palm Springs at the time, and some suggest the singer was too cowardly to face the three himself. Another associate of Presley's, John O'Grady, argued that the bodyguards were dropped because their rough treatment of fans had prompted too many lawsuits.[256] Presley's stepbrother David Stanley has claimed that the bodyguards were fired because they were becoming more outspoken about Presley's drug dependency.[257] RCA began to grow anxious as his interest in the recording studio waned. After a session in December 1973 that produced eighteen songs, enough for almost two albums, Presley made no official studio recordings in 1974.[258] Parker delivered RCA another concert record, Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis.[259] Recorded on March 20, it included a version of "How Great Thou Art" that won Presley his third and final Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance.[260][261] All three of his competitive Grammy wins – out of fourteen total nominations – were for gospel recordings.[261] Presley returned to the recording studio in March 1975, but Parker's attempts to arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful.[262] In 1976, RCA sent a mobile recording unit to Graceland that made possible two full-scale recording sessions,[263] but the recording process had become a struggle for him.[264] After Presley's relationship with Linda Thompson ended,[266] he began dating Ginger Alden in November 1976; he proposed marriage to Alden two months later.[267] Journalist Tony Scherman wrote that, by early 1977, "Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Grossly overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopoeia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts."[268] According to Andy Greene of Rolling Stone, Presley's final performances were mostly "sad, sloppy affairs where a bloated, drugged Presley struggled to remember his lyrics and get through the night without collapsing ... Most everything from the final three years of his life is sad and hard to watch."[269] In Alexandria, Louisiana, he was on stage for less than an hour and "was impossible to understand".[270] On March 31, he canceled a performance in Baton Rouge, unable to get out of his hotel bed; four shows had to be canceled and rescheduled.[271] Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, Presley fulfilled most of his touring commitments. According to Guralnick, fans "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past Presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books".[272] Presley's cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how he would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite Monty Python sketches and his past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions.[273] "Way Down", Presley's last single issued during his lifetime, was released on June 6, 1977. That month, CBS taped two concerts for a television special, Elvis in Concert, to be broadcast in October. In the first, shot in Omaha on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, "is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project".[274] Two days later, in Rapid City, South Dakota, "he looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too", though, by the conclusion of the performance, his face was "framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks".[274] Presley's final concert was held in Indianapolis at Market Square Arena, on June 26, 1977.[275] The book Elvis: What Happened?, co-written by the three bodyguards fired a year prior, was published on August 1.[276] It was the first exposé to detail Presley's years of drug misuse. He was devastated by the book and tried unsuccessfully to halt its release by offering money to the publishers.[277] By this point, he suffered from multiple ailments: glaucoma, high blood pressure, liver damage, and an enlarged colon, each aggravated—and possibly caused—by drug abuse.[248] On August 16, 1977, Presley was scheduled on an evening flight out of Memphis to Portland, Maine, to begin another tour. That afternoon his fiancée Ginger Alden discovered him unresponsive on the bathroom floor of his Graceland mansion.[278] Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at Baptist Memorial Hospital at 3:30 p.m.;[279] he was 42.[280] President Jimmy Carter issued a statement that credited Presley with having "permanently changed the face of American popular culture".[281] Thousands of people gathered outside Graceland to view the open casket. One of Presley's cousins, Billy Mann, accepted US$18,000 (equivalent to $91,000 in 2023) to secretly photograph the body; the picture appeared on the cover of the National Enquirer's biggest-selling issue ever.[282] Alden struck a $105,000 (equivalent to $528,000 in 2023) deal with the Enquirer for her story, but settled for less when she broke her exclusivity agreement.[283] Presley left her nothing in his will.[284] Presley's funeral was held at Graceland on August 18. Outside the gates, a car crashed into a group of fans, killing two young women and critically injuring a third.[285] About 80,000 people lined the processional route to Forest Hill Cemetery, where Presley was buried next to his mother.[286] Within a few weeks, "Way Down" topped the country and UK singles chart.[287][288] Following an attempt to steal Presley's body in late August, the remains of both Presley and his mother were exhumed and reburied in Graceland's Meditation Garden on October 2.[283] While an autopsy undertaken the same day Presley died was still in progress, Memphis medical examiner Jerry Francisco announced that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest and declared that "drugs played no role in Presley's death".[289] In fact, "drug use was heavily implicated" in Presley's death, writes Guralnick. The pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible, for instance, that he had suffered "anaphylactic shock brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist, to which he was known to have had a mild allergy". Lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that polypharmacy was the primary cause of death; one reported "fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant quantity".[290] In 1979, forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht reviewed the reports and concluded that a combination of depressants had resulted in Presley's accidental death.[289] Forensic historian and pathologist Michael Baden viewed the situation as complicated: "Elvis had an enlarged heart for a long time. That, together with his drug habit, caused his death. But he was difficult to diagnose; it was a judgment call."[291] The competence and ethics of two of the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned. Francisco had offered a cause of death before the autopsy was complete; claimed the underlying ailment was cardiac arrhythmia, a condition that can be determined only in a living person; and denied drugs played any part in Presley's death before the toxicology results were known.[289] Allegations of a cover-up were widespread.[291] While a 1981 trial of Presley's main physician, George C. Nichopoulos, exonerated him of criminal liability, the facts were startling: "In the first eight months of 1977 alone, he had [prescribed] more than 10,000 doses of sedatives, amphetamines, and narcotics: all in Elvis' name." Nichopoulos' license was suspended for three months. It was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the Tennessee Medical Board brought new charges of over-prescription.[248] In 1994, the Presley autopsy report was reopened. Joseph Davis, who had conducted thousands of autopsies as Miami-Dade County coroner,[292] declared at its completion, "There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack."[248] More recent research has revealed that Francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team. Other staff "could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then."[293] One of the examiners, E. Eric Muirhead, could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached. ... Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body ... confirmed [that] Elvis was chronically ill with diabetes, glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs. They had also studied his hospital records, which included two admissions for drug detoxification and methadone treatments.[293] Between 1977 and 1981, six of Presley's posthumously released singles were top-ten country hits.[287] Graceland was opened to the public in 1982. Attracting over half a million visitors annually, it became the second-most-visited home in the United States, after the White House.[294] The residence was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2006.[295] Presley has been inducted into five music halls of fame: the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1986), the Country Music Hall of Fame (1998), the Gospel Music Hall of Fame (2001), the Rockabilly Hall of Fame (2007), and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame (2012). In 1984, he received the W. C. Handy Award from the Blues Foundation and the Academy of Country Music's first Golden Hat Award. In 1987, he received the American Music Awards' Award of Merit.[296] A Junkie XL remix of Presley's "A Little Less Conversation" (credited as "Elvis Vs JXL") was used in a Nike advertising campaign during the 2002 FIFA World Cup. It topped the charts in over twenty countries and was included in a compilation of Presley's number-one hits, ELV1S, which was also an international success. The album returned Presley to the top of the Billboard chart for the first time in almost three decades.[297] In 2003, a remix of "Rubberneckin'", a 1969 recording, topped the U.S. sales chart, as did a 50th-anniversary re-release of "That's All Right" the following year.[298] The latter was an outright hit in Britain, debuting at number three on the pop chart; it also made the top ten in Canada.[299] In 2005, another three reissued singles, "Jailhouse Rock", "One Night"/"I Got Stung", and "It's Now or Never", went to number one in the UK. They were part of a campaign that saw the re-release of all eighteen of Presley's previous chart-topping UK singles. The first, "All Shook Up", came with a collectors' box that made it ineligible to chart again; each of the other seventeen reissues hit the British top five.[300] In 2005, Forbes magazine named Presley the top-earning deceased celebrity for the fifth straight year, with a gross income of $45 million.[301] He was placed second in 2006,[302] returned to the top spot the next two years,[303][304] and ranked fourth in 2009.[305] The following year, he was ranked second, with his highest annual income ever—$60 million—spurred by the celebration of his 75th birthday and the launch of Cirque du Soleil's Viva Elvis show in Las Vegas.[306] In November 2010, Viva Elvis: The Album was released, setting his voice to newly recorded instrumental tracks.[307][308] As of mid-2011, there were an estimated 15,000 licensed Presley products,[309] and he was again the second-highest-earning deceased celebrity.[310] Six years later, he ranked fourth with earnings of $35 million, up $8 million from 2016 due in part to the opening of a new entertainment complex, Elvis Presley's Memphis, and hotel, The Guest House at Graceland.[311] In 2018, RCA/Legacy released Elvis Presley – Where No One Stands Alone, a new album focused on Presley's love of gospel music. Produced by Joel Weinshanker, Lisa Marie Presley and Andy Childs, the album introduced newly recorded instrumentation along with vocals from singers who had performed in the past with Elvis. It included a reimagined duet with Lisa Marie, on the album's title track.[312] In 2022, Baz Luhrmann's film Elvis, a biographical film about Presley's life, was released. Presley is portrayed by Austin Butler and Parker by Tom Hanks. As of August 2022, the film had grossed $261.8 million worldwide on a $85 million budget, becoming the second-highest-grossing music biopic of all-time behind Bohemian Rhapsody (2018), and the fifth-highest-grossing Australian-produced film. For his portrayal of Presley, Butler won the Golden Globe and was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor.[313] In January 2023, his 1962 Lockheed 1329 JetStar sold at an auction for $260,000.[314] Presley's earliest musical influence came from gospel. His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, "he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them."[315] In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium, where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act: The Statesmen were an electric combination ... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world ... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of Lansky's. ... Bass singer Jim Wetherington, known universally as the Big Chief, maintained a steady bottom, ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg, then his right, with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering. "He went about as far as you could go in gospel music," said Jake Hess. "The women would jump up, just like they do for the pop shows." Preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements ... but audiences reacted with screams and swoons.[316] As a teenager, Presley's musical interests were wide-ranging, and he was deeply informed about both white and African-American musical idioms. Though he never had any formal training, he had a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues,[317] and, as Stoller put it, "He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music."[141] At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, "I know practically every religious song that's ever been written."[132] Presley played guitar, bass, and piano; he received his first guitar when he was 11 years old. He could not read or write music and had no formal lessons, and played everything by ear.[318] Presley often played an instrument on his recordings and produced his own music. Presley played rhythm acoustic guitar on most of his Sun recordings and his 1950s RCA Victor albums. Presley played piano on songs such as "Old Shep" and "First in Line" from his 1956 album Elvis.[319] He is credited with playing piano on later albums such as From Elvis in Memphis and "Moody Blue", and on "Unchained Melody", which was one of the last songs that he recorded.[320] Presley played lead guitar on one of his successful singles called "Are You Lonesome Tonight".[321] At one point during the '68 Comeback Special, Elvis took over on lead electric guitar, the first time he had ever been seen with the instrument in public, playing it on songs such as "Baby What You Want Me to Do" and "One Night".[322] The album Elvis is Back! features Presley playing a lot of acoustic guitar on songs such as "I Will Be Home Again" and "Like a Baby".[323] Presley was a central figure in the development of rockabilly, according to music historians. "Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label," writes Craig Morrison.[324] Paul Friedlander described rockabilly as "essentially ... an Elvis Presley construction", with the defining elements as "the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country".[325] In "That's All Right", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, "a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion".[325] While Katherine Charlton calls Presley "rockabilly's originator",[326] Carl Perkins, another pioneer of rock'n'roll, said that "[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly".[327] According to Michael Campbell, the first major rockabilly song was recorded by Bill Haley.[328] In Moore's view, "It had been there for quite a while, really. Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson, and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old."[329] At RCA Victor, Presley's rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars,[330] and a tougher, more intense manner.[331] While he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career, from the pop standard "Blue Moon" at Sun Records to the country ballad "How's the World Treating You?" on his second RCA Victor LP to the blues of "Santa Claus Is Back in Town". In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP Peace in the Valley. Certified as a million-seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history.[332] After his return from military service in 1960, Presley continued to perform rock and roll, but the characteristic style was substantially toned down. His first post-Army single, the number-one hit "Stuck on You", is typical of this shift. RCA Victor publicity referred to its "mild rock beat"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it "upbeat pop".[335] The number five "She's Not You" (1962) "integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it's practically doo-wop".[336] The modern blues/R&B sound captured with success on Elvis Is Back! was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966–67 recordings as "Down in the Alley" and "Hi-Heel Sneakers".[337] Presley's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as "Are You Lonesome Tonight?", a number-one in 1960. "It's Now or Never", which also topped the chart that year, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan song "'O sole mio" and concluding with a "full-voiced operatic cadence".[338] These were both dramatic numbers, but most of what Presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.[339] While Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the '68 Comeback Special, the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they had become "hard to find".[340] A significant exception was "Burning Love", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and funk. Much of Elvis in Memphis, as well as "Suspicious Minds", cut at the same sessions, reflected this new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.[341] The developmental arc of Presley's singing voice, as described by critic Dave Marsh, goes from "high and thrilled in the early days, [to] lower and perplexed in the final months."[342] Marsh credits Presley with the introduction of the "vocal stutter" on 1955's "Baby Let's Play House".[343] When on "Don't Be Cruel", Presley "slides into a 'mmmmm' that marks the transition between the first two verses," he shows "how masterful his relaxed style really is."[344] Marsh describes the vocal performance on "Can't Help Falling in Love" as one of "gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing", with the line "'Shall I stay' pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal".[345] Jorgensen calls the 1966 recording of "How Great Thou Art" "an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions", as Presley "crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax", becoming "a kind of one-man quartet".[346] Guralnick finds "Stand by Me" from the same gospel sessions "a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance", but, by contrast, feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on "Where No One Stands Alone", resorting "to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound" that Jake Hess of the Statesmen Quartet had in his command. Hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of Presley's, "he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime."[347] Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: "The warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort."[348] Marsh praises his 1968 reading of "U.S. Male", "bearing down on the hard guy lyrics, not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his Sun records."[349] The performance on "In the Ghetto" is, according to Jorgensen, "devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms", instead relying on the exceptional "clarity and sensitivity of his voice".[350] Guralnick describes the song's delivery as of "almost translucent eloquence ... so quietly confident in its simplicity".[351] On "Suspicious Minds", Guralnick hears essentially the same "remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise", but supplemented with "an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism (at suspected infidelity) and anguish (over impending loss)".[352] Music critic Henry Pleasants observes that "Presley has been described variously as a baritone and a tenor. An extraordinary compass ... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion."[353] He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two octaves and a third, "from the baritone low G to the tenor high B, with an upward extension in falsetto to at least a D-flat. Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down."[353] In Pleasants' view, his voice was "variable and unpredictable" at the bottom, "often brilliant" at the top, with the capacity for "full-voiced high Gs and As that an opera baritone might envy".[353] Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as two-and-a-quarter octaves, emphasizes that "his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear. His voice can not be measured in octaves, but in decibels; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all."[354] Presley was always "able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers", writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.[353] When Dewey Phillips first aired "That's All Right" on Memphis' WHBQ, many listeners who contacted the station to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black.[49] From the beginning of his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African-American performers and their music, and disregard for the segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudup—the originator of "That's All Right"—"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw."[35] The Memphis World, an African-American newspaper, reported that Presley "cracked Memphis' segregation laws" by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its "colored night".[35] Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during his early stardom.[35] In contrast, many white adults "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex."[6] Despite the largely positive view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 that he had announced, "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of Jailhouse Rock, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement: I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it. ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that.[355] Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist.[35][356] Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland, reported of Presley, "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest."[357] Though the rumored remark was discredited, it was still being used against Presley decades later.[358] The persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African-American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers.[356] Into the twenty-first century, the notion that Presley had "stolen" black music still found adherents.[359][358][360] Notable among African-American entertainers expressly rejecting this view was Jackie Wilson, who argued, "A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis."[361] Moreover, Presley acknowledged his debt to African-American musicians throughout his career. Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, "Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. People have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it, but it all boils down to [that]."[362] Nine years earlier, he had said, "Rock 'n' roll has been around for many years. It used to be called rhythm and blues."[363] Presley's physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. "He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful", according to critic Mark Feeney.[364] Television director Steve Binder reported, "I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence."[365] His performance style was equally responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Critic George Melly described him as "the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl".[366] In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him with bringing "overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America".[367] Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.[368] While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, Sight and Sound's Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as "aggressively bisexual in appeal".[369] Brett Farmer places the "orgasmic gyrations" of the title dance sequence in Jailhouse Rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a "spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image".[370] In the analysis of Yvonne Tasker, "Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display."[371] Reinforcing Presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with Hollywood stars and starlets, from Natalie Wood in the 1950s to Connie Stevens and Ann-Margret in the 1960s to Candice Bergen and Cybill Shepherd in the 1970s. June Juanico of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind.[206] Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, and most of these relationships were insubstantial.[372] I know he invented rock and roll, in a manner of speaking, but ... that's not why he's worshiped as a god today. He's worshiped as a god today because in addition to inventing rock and roll he was the greatest ballad singer this side of Frank Sinatra—because the spiritual translucence and reined-in gut sexuality of his slow weeper and torchy pop blues still activate the hormones and slavish devotion of millions of female human beings worldwide. Presley's rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture.[374] As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude.[375] With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture.[376] In this regard, Little Richard said of Presley, "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music."[377] Al Green agreed: "He broke the ice for all of us."[378] President Jimmy Carter remarked on Presley's legacy in 1977: "His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture."[281] Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: within a year of his first appearance on American network television, he was regarded as one of the most famous people in the world.[379] Presley's name, image, and voice are recognized around the world.[380] He has inspired a legion of impersonators.[381] In polls and surveys, he is recognized as one of the most important popular music artists and influential Americans.[e] American composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein said, "Elvis Presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century. He introduced the beat to everything and he changed everything—music, language, clothes."[390] John Lennon said that "Nothing really affected me until Elvis."[391] Bob Dylan described the sensation of first hearing Presley as "like busting out of jail".[378] For much of his adult life, Presley, with his rise from poverty to riches and fame, had seemed to epitomize the American Dream.[392][393] In his final years, and following the revelations about his circumstances after his death, he became a symbol of excess and gluttony.[394][395] Increasing attention was paid to his appetite for the rich, heavy Southern cooking of his upbringing, foods such as chicken-fried steak and biscuits and gravy.[396][397] In particular, his love of fried peanut butter, banana, and (sometimes) bacon sandwiches,[398][396] now known as "Elvis sandwiches",[399] came to symbolize this characteristic.[400] Since 1977, there have been numerous alleged sightings of Presley. A long-standing conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death.[401][402] Adherents cite alleged discrepancies in the death certificate, reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin, and accounts of Presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace.[403] An unusually large number of fans have domestic shrines devoted to Presley and journey to sites with which he is connected, however faintly.[404] On the anniversary of his death, thousands of people gather outside Graceland for a candlelight ritual.[405] "With Elvis, it is not just his music that has survived death", writes Ted Harrison. "He himself has been raised, like a medieval saint, to a figure of cultic status. It is as if he has been canonized by acclamation."[404] On the 25th anniversary of Presley's death, The New York Times asserted: All the talentless impersonators and appalling black velvet paintings on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant memory. But before Elvis was camp, he was its opposite: a genuine cultural force. ... Elvis' breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely.[406] He was ranked third on Rolling Stone's list of greatest artists. Bono wrote in appreciation: In Elvis, you have the blueprint for rock & roll. The highness — the gospel highs. The mud — the Delta mud, the blues. Sexual liberation. Controversy. Changing the way people feel about the world. It's all there with Elvis.[407] Not only Presley's achievements but his failings as well, are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy, as in this description by Greil Marcus: Elvis Presley is a supreme figure in American life, one whose presence, no matter how banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons. ... The cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues. ... Elvis has emerged as a great artist, a great rocker, a great purveyor of schlock, a great heart throb, a great bore, a great symbol of potency, a great ham, a great nice person, and, yes, a great American.[408] With a billion estimated record sales, Guinness World Records ranks Presley as the best-selling solo artist of all time.[b] Presley's rankings for top ten and number-one hits vary depending on how the double-sided "Hound Dog/Don't Be Cruel" and "Don't/I Beg of You" singles, which precede the inception of Billboard's unified Hot 100 chart, are analyzed.[f] According to Whitburn's analysis, Presley holds the record with 38, tying with Madonna;[413] per Billboard's current assessment, he ranks second with 36.[414] Whitburn and Billboard concur that the Beatles hold the record for most number-one hits with 20, and that Mariah Carey is second with 19.[415] Whitburn has Presley with 18:[413] Billboard has him third with 17.[416] According to Billboard, Presley has 79 cumulative weeks at number one: alone at 80, according to Whitburn and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,[417][418] with only Mariah Carey having more with 91 weeks.[419] He holds the records for most number-one singles on the UK chart with 21 and singles reaching the top ten with 76.[420][421] As an album artist, Presley is credited by Billboard with the record for the most albums charting in the Billboard 200: 129, far ahead of second-place Frank Sinatra's 82. He also holds the record for most cumulative weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 for a male solo artists: 67 weeks[422] In 2015 and 2016, two albums setting Presley's vocals against music by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, If I Can Dream and The Wonder of You, both reached number one in the UK. This gave him a new record for number-one UK albums by a solo artist with 13, and extended his record for longest span between number-one albums by anybody—Presley had first topped the British chart in 1956 with his self-titled debut.[423] As of 2023[update], the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) credits Presley with 146.5 million certified album sales in the US, third all time behind the Beatles and Garth Brooks.[424] He holds the records for most gold albums (101, nearly double second-place Barbra Streisand's 51),[425] and most platinum albums (57).[426] His 25 multi-platinum albums is second behind the Beatles' 26.[427] His total of 197 album certification awards (including one diamond award), far outpaces the Beatles' second-best 122.[428] He has the 9th-most gold singles (54, tied with Justin Bieber),[429] and the 16th-most platinum singles (27).[430] In 2012, the spider Paradonea presleyi was named in his honor.[431] In 2018, President Donald Trump awarded Presley the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously.[432] There is a street named after Presley in San Antonio, Texas.[433] A vast number of recordings have been issued under Presley's name. The number of his original master recordings has been variously calculated as 665[434] and 711.[364] Studio albums Soundtrack albums (original material) The correct spelling of his middle name has long been a matter of debate. The physician who delivered him wrote "Elvis Aaron Presley" in his ledger.[3] The state-issued birth certificate reads "Elvis Aron Presley". The name was chosen after the Presleys' friend and fellow congregation member Aaron Kennedy, though a single-A spelling was probably intended by Presley's parents to parallel the middle name of Presley's stillborn brother, Jesse Garon.[4] It reads Aron on most official documents produced during his lifetime, including his high school diploma, RCA Victor record contract, and marriage license, and this was generally taken to be the proper spelling.[5] In 1966, Presley expressed the desire to his father that the more traditional biblical rendering, Aaron, be used henceforth, "especially on legal documents".[3] Five years later, the Jaycees citation honoring him as one of the country's Outstanding Young Men used Aaron. Late in his life, he sought to officially change the spelling to Aaron and discovered that state records already listed it that way. Knowing his wishes for his middle name, Aaron is the spelling his father chose for Presley's tombstone, and it is the spelling his estate has designated as official.[5]

### [Elvis Presley - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley)

Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer, musician and actor. He is widely considered as one of the most influential and most famous musicians of the 20th century, widely regarded as one of the 20th century’s greatest cultural icons. Presley is one of the biggest selling musical artists of all time.[2] He was one of the first and the most famous recording artist in rock and roll music. He also starred in over 30 movies. His global fame has continued till today almost 47 years after his death. He’s considered by many to be one of the most popular men in history.[3] He is so popular that some people know him as only "Elvis". He is also referred to as the "King of Rock and Roll", or simply "The King". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi. He and his family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954. He first started to work with Sam Phillips who was the owner of Sun Records. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker. Presley's first RCA single, "Heartbreak Hotel" was released in January 1956. It was a number-one hit in the US. Presley became the leading figure of rock and roll after many TV appearances and chart-topping records. His energetic attitude towards his music and his performance style, made him very popular—and controversial. In November 1956, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958, he was drafted into military service. When he resumed his recording career two years later, he made some of his most successful work. In the 1960s, Presley gave most of his time to making Hollywood movies. After a long seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in 1968. In 1973, Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert. Several years of prescription drug abuse damaged his health, and he died in 1977 at the age of 42. Before Presley died, he had type 2 diabetes, Hypertension and Cholesterol that he was diagnosed with on April 29, 1974, due to his weight gain and after a medical check-up Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935 in Tupelo, Mississippi to 18-year-old Vernon Elvis Presley and 22-year-old Gladys Love Presley (born Smith), in the two-room shotgun house built by Vernon's father in preparation for the child's birth. Jesse Aaron Presley, his identical twin brother, was delivered stillborn 35 minutes before him. As an only child, Presley became close to both parents and formed an unusually tight bond with his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration. Presley's ancestry was primarily a Western European mix: on his mother's side, he was Scots-Irish, with some French Norman; one of Gladys' great-great-grandmothers was Cherokee. According to a third cousin of Presley's, one of Gladys's great-grandmothers was Jewish. There is no evidence that Presley or his mother shared this belief in a Jewish heritage. Syndicated columnist Nate Bloom has challenged the cousin's account, which he calls a "tall tale". Presley's father's forebears were of Scottish[4] and German ancestry. Gladys was regarded by relatives and friends as the dominant member of the small family. Vernon moved from one odd job to the next, evidencing little ambition. The family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance. The Presleys survived the F5 tornado in the 1936 Tupelo-Gainesville tornado outbreak. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of altering a check written by the landowner. He was jailed for eight months, and Gladys and Elvis moved in with relatives. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. Presley was one of the first musicians to play a type of music called rock and roll, which combined rhythm and blues with country music. His first No. 1 hit, "Heartbreak Hotel", was released in 1956, and was one of the first popular rock and roll songs. Presley entered the military in 1958, and was stationed in Germany. He was honorably discharged from the military, and returned to the United States in 1960. In Germany, he met Priscilla Beaulieu, whom he married in 1967. They had a female child which they named Lisa Marie (who was married to pop singer MJ). In 1973, Priscilla and Elvis divorced. By this point, he was addicted to many prescription drugs. Presley’s personal doctor was George C. Nichopoulos who was of Greek descent. In November 2018, Presley received posthumous the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump.[5] His daughter Lisa Marie Presley was found dead on January 12, 2023 in Calabasas. Presley's rise to enormous worldwide success in 1956 changed the field of popular music forever. It also had a great effect on popular culture. Presley was one of the first celebrities in the era of mass communication: at age 21, within a year of his first appearance on the American television network, he was already one of the most famous men in the world. He is one of the best-selling music artists in history, with worldwide sales of 500 million records,[6] His name, image and voice are instantly recognizable worldwide. It has inspired many imitators. Being an Elvis impersonator can be a professional job. In polls and surveys, he is recognized as one of the most important and influential American musical artists. On August 16, 1977, Presley was scheduled on an evening flight out of Memphis to Portland, Maine, to begin another tour. That afternoon, however, his fiancée Ginger Alden discovered him unresponsive on the bathroom floor of his Graceland mansion. Attempts to revive him failed and he died on August 16, 1977 from heart disease by drug intoxication. He was discovered dead in his bathroom.

See additional information The incredible Elvis Presley life story began when Elvis Aaron Presley was born to Vernon and Gladys Presley in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi, on January 8, 1935. His twin brother, Jessie Garon, was stillborn, leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child. He and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1948, and Elvis graduated from Humes High School there in 1953. Elvis’ musical influences were the pop and country music of the time, the gospel music he heard in church and at the all-night gospel sings he frequently attended, and the black R&B he absorbed on historic Beale Street as a Memphis teenager. In 1954, Elvis began his singing career with the legendary Sun Records label in Memphis. In late 1955, his recording contract was sold to RCA Victor. By 1956, he was an international sensation. With a sound and style that uniquely combined his diverse musical influences and blurred and challenged the social and racial barriers of the time, he ushered in a whole new era of American music and popular culture. Here are a few Elvis Presley facts: he starred in 33 successful films, made history with his television appearances and specials, and knew great acclaim through his many, often record-breaking, live concert performances on tour and in Las Vegas. Globally, he has sold over one billion records, more than any other artist. His American sales have earned him gold, platinum or multi-platinum awards. Among his many achievements were 14 Grammy nominations (3 wins) from the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award which he received at age 36, and his being named One of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Nation for 1970 by the United States Jaycees. Without any of the special privileges, his celebrity status might have afforded him, Elvis honorably served his country in the U.S. Army. His talent, good looks, sensuality, charisma, and good humor endeared him to millions, as did the humility and human kindness he demonstrated throughout his life. Known the world over by his first name, he is regarded as one of the most important figures of twentieth century popular culture. Elvis died at his Memphis home, Graceland, on August 16, 1977. He was 42. This brief Elvis Presley biography doesn’t begin to fully capture the personality of the king.

Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records, a local blues label, was the first to record Elvis Presley. He responded to Presley's audition tape with a phone call, and several week's of recording sessions ensued with a band consisting of Presley, guitarist Scotty Moore, and bassist Bill Black. Their repertoire consisted of blues and country songs and gospel hymns. Graceland is Elvis Presley's estate in Memphis, Tennessee, and remains one of the the U.S.'s top tourist attractions. Elvis Presley died of a heart attack in 1977 brought on largely by drug abuse. He was 42 years old. In early 1958 Elvis Presley was drafted by the U.S. Army. Presley returned from the army in 1960, where he had served as a soldier in Germany rather than joining the Special Services entertainment division. Colonel Tom Parker was a Dutch-born American show business promoter who was best known for managing the career of Elvis Presley. Elvis Presley (born January 8, 1935, Tupelo, Mississippi, U.S.—died August 16, 1977, Memphis, Tennessee) was an American popular singer widely known as the “King of Rock and Roll” and one of rock music’s dominant performers from the mid-1950s until his death. Presley grew up dirt-poor in Tupelo, Mississippi, moved to Memphis as a teenager, and, with his family, was off welfare for only a few weeks when producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records, a local blues label, responded to his audition tape with a phone call. Several weeks worth of recording sessions ensued with a band consisting of Presley, guitarist Scotty Moore, and bassist Bill Black. Their repertoire consisted of the kind of material for which Presley would become famous: blues and country songs, Tin Pan Alley ballads, and gospel hymns. Presley knew some of this music from the radio, some of it from his parents’ Pentecostal church and the group sings he attended at the Rev. H.W. Brewster’s Black Memphis church, and some of it from the Beale Street blues clubs he began frequenting as a teenager. Presley was already a flamboyant personality, with relatively long greased-back hair and wild-colored clothing combinations, but his full musical personality did not emerge until he and the band began playing with blues singer Arthur (“Big Boy”) Crudup’s song “That’s All Right Mama” in July 1954. They arrived at a startling synthesis, eventually dubbed rockabilly, retaining many of the original’s blues inflections but with Presley’s high tenor voice adding a lighter touch and with the basic rhythm striking a much more supple groove. This sound was the hallmark of the five singles Presley released on Sun over the next year. Although none of them became a national hit, by August 1955, when he released the fifth, “Mystery Train,” arguably his greatest record ever, he had attracted a substantial Southern following for his recordings, his live appearances in regional roadhouses and clubs, and his radio performances on the nationally aired Louisiana Hayride. (A key musical change came when drummer D.J. Fontana was added, first for the Hayride shows but also on records beginning with “Mystery Train.”) Presley’s management was then turned over to Colonel Tom Parker, a country music hustler who had made stars of Eddy Arnold and Hank Snow. Parker arranged for Presley’s song catalog and recording contract to be sold to major New York City-based enterprises, Hill and Range and RCA Victor, respectively. Sun received a total of $35,000; Elvis got $5,000. He began recording at RCA’s studios in Nashville, Tennessee, with a somewhat larger group of musicians but still including Moore, Black, and Fontana, and began to create a national sensation with a series of hits: “Heartbreak Hotel,” “Don’t Be Cruel,” and “Love Me Tender” (all 1956), “All Shook Up” (1957), and more. From 1956 through 1958 he completely dominated the pop music charts and ushered in the age of rock and roll, opening doors for both white and Black rock artists. His television appearances, especially those on Ed Sullivan’s Sunday night variety show, set records for the size of the audiences. Even his films, a few slight vehicles, were box office smashes. Presley became the teen idol of his decade, greeted everywhere by screaming hordes of young women, and, when it was announced in early 1958 that he had been drafted and would enter the U.S. Army, there was that rarest of all pop culture events, a moment of true grief. More important, he served as the great cultural catalyst of his period. Elvis projected a mixed vision of humility and self-confidence, of intense commitment and comic disbelief in his ability to inspire frenzy. He inspired literally thousands of musicians—initially those more or less like-minded Southerners, from Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins on down, who were the first generation of rockabillies, and, later, people who had far different combinations of musical and cultural influences and ambitions. From John Lennon to Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan to Prince, it was impossible to think of a rock star of any importance who did not owe an explicit debt to Presley. Beyond even that, Presley inspired his audience. “It was like he whispered his dream in all our ears and then we dreamed it,” said Springsteen at the time of Presley’s death. You did not have to want to be a rock and roll star or even a musician to want to be like Elvis—which meant, ultimately, to be free and uninhibited and yet still a part of the everyday. Literally millions of people—an entire generation or two—defined their sense of personal style and ambition in terms that Elvis first personified. As a result, he was anything but universally adored. Those who did not worship him found him despicable (no one found him ignorable). Preachers and pundits declared him an anathema, his Pentecostally derived hip-swinging stage style and breathy vocal asides obscene. Racists denounced him for mingling Black music with white (and Presley was always scrupulous in crediting his Black sources, one of the things that made him different from the Tin Pan Alley writers and singers who had for decades lifted Black musical styles without credit). He was pronounced responsible for all teenage hooliganism and juvenile delinquency. Yet, in every appearance on television, he appeared affable, polite, and soft-spoken, almost shy. It was only with a band at his back and a beat in his ear that he became “Elvis the Pelvis.” In 1959, while stationed in West Germany—where he served as a soldier rather than joining the Special Services entertainment division—Presley met Priscilla Beaulieu, who was 14 years old at the time (Presley was 24). They started a romantic relationship that continued after Presley returned to the United States in 1960. When he resumed his musical career, those who regarded him as commercial hype without talent expected him to fade away. Instead, he continued to have hits from recordings stockpiled just before he entered the army. Presley picked up pretty much where he had left off, churning out a series of more than 30 movies (from Blue Hawaii [1961] to Change of Habit [1969]) over the next eight years, almost none of which fit any genre other than “Elvis movie,” which meant a light comedic romance with musical interludes. Most had accompanying soundtrack albums, and together the movies and the records made him a rich man, although they nearly ruined him as any kind of artist. Presley did his best work in the 1960s on singles either unconnected to the films or only marginally stuck into them, recordings such as “It’s Now or Never (‘O Sole Mio’)” (1960), “Are You Lonesome Tonight?” and “Little Sister” (both 1961), “Can’t Help Falling in Love” and “Return to Sender” (both 1962), and “Viva Las Vegas” (1964). Presley was no longer a controversial figure: he had become one more predictable mass entertainer, a personage of virtually no interest to the rock audience that had expanded so much with the advent of the new sounds of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan. By 1968 the changes in the music world had overtaken Presley—both movie grosses and record sales had fallen. In December his one-man Christmas TV special aired: a tour de force of rock and roll and rhythm and blues, it restored much of his dissipated credibility. In 1969 he released a single having nothing to do with a film, “Suspicious Minds”; it went to number one. He also began doing concerts again and quickly won back a sizable following, although it was not nearly as universal as his audience in the 1950s; in the main, it was Southern and Midwestern, working-class, and overwhelmingly female. For much of the next decade, he was again one of the top live attractions in the United States. (For a variety of reasons, he never performed outside North America.) Presley was now a mainstream American entertainer, an icon but not so much an idol. In 1967 he married Priscilla Beaulieu without much furor. The next year he became a parent with the birth of their daughter, Lisa Marie Presley. Elvis Presley and Priscilla Presley eventually grew apart separating in 1972 and divorcing the following year. Presley made no more movies, although there was a good concert film, Elvis on Tour (1972). His recordings were of uneven quality, but on each album he included a song or two that had focus and energy. Hit songs were harder to come by—“Suspicious Minds” was his last number one and “Burning Love” (1972) his final Top Ten entry. But, thanks to concerts, spectaculars best described by critic Jon Landau as an apotheosis of American musical comedy, he remained a big money earner. He now lacked the ambition and power of his early work, but that may have been a good thing: he never seemed a dated relic of the 1950s trying to catch up to trends but was just a performer, unrelentingly himself. However, Presley had also developed a lethal lifestyle. Spending almost all his time when not on the road in Graceland, his Memphis estate (actually just a big Southern colonial house decorated somewhere between banal modernity and garish faux-Vegas opulence), he lived nocturnally, surrounded by sycophants and stuffed with greasy foods and a variety of prescription drugs. His shows deteriorated in the final two years of his life, and his recording career came to a virtual standstill. Presley never seemed confident in his status, never entirely certain that he would not collapse back into sharecropper poverty, and, as a result, he seems to have become immobilized; the man who had risked everything, including potential ridicule, to make himself a success now lived in the lockstep regimen of an addict and recluse. Finally, in the summer of 1977, the night before he was to begin yet another concert tour, he died of a heart attack brought on largely by drug abuse. He was 42 years old. Almost immediately upon hearing of his death, mourners from around the world gathered at Graceland to say farewell to the poor boy who had lived out the American dream. In a way, that mourning has never ceased: Graceland remains one of the country’s top tourist attractions, and Presley’s albums and other artifacts continue to sell briskly. Each August crowds flock to Graceland—which, under the direction of Priscilla Presley, first opened to the public in 1982—to honor him on the anniversary not of his birth but of his death. From time to time, rumors cropped up that he did not really die, that his death was a fake designed to free him from fame. Elvis impersonators are legion. His biggest fans—working-class white women, almost exclusively—passed their fanaticism on to their children, or at least to a surprising number of daughters. “Elvis has left the building,” but those who are still inside have decided to carry on regardless. Once more, Elvis Presley is triumphant, although this triumph is shadowed by something far less than happiness.

### [Studio City House Fire Puts an L.A. Neighborhood on Edge - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/studio-city-los-angeles-fire-sunset-sunswept.html)

Los Angeles Wildfires Advertisement Aghast at their city burning, residents of Studio City endured harrowing moments of uncertainty when a house caught fire in the neighborhood. By Isabella Kwai Even in parts of Los Angeles that had not been touched by the multiple wildfires raging across the area, residents were on edge on Thursday. The dry and windy conditions that had helped the fires spread persisted, meaning a small blaze could quickly turn destructive. Just before 9 p.m. on Wednesday, those fears seemed to be realized in Studio City, a neighborhood north of Hollywood, when a four-story home on a hillside caught fire and sent embers swirling through the air. The Los Angeles Fire Department warned residents of a potential evacuation. Sean Ingalsbe had been anxious about that scenario all day. Mr. Ingalsbe, 24, is a caretaker for his bedridden father and lives with his siblings and several pets in Studio City. “I’ve been so stressed and so worried,” he said. “If we have to evacuate, it’s hard to get him up,” he added of his father. Earlier in the day, while loading a car in case he had to leave, he felt a panic attack overwhelm him. Several homes were caught up in the fire in Studio City, according to overhead footage broadcast by KTLA 5, a local television station. Firefighters battled the blaze, which was dubbed the Sunswept fire, and video showed a firefighting aircraft passing over the burning home. Around 10 p.m. came relief: The fire had been extinguished, the fire department said, with no injuries reported. The extent of the damage to some nearby homes was still being assessed. It was a reprieve for Mr. Ingalsbe, but sleep was still elusive. Hours later, he said, he was still shaken from his panic attack, which had sent his pulse rising and given him a headache. Many of his neighbors had already left the area, he said, and as of 1 a.m. Thursday there was still no power. “My entire neighborhood pretty much is pitch-black,” he said. A generator that he had bought for the family would not arrive until Friday, and until then he was worried about other things: power for the oxygen machine that his father used, the food in the refrigerator that could spoil and the future of the city he had grown up in. “People are never going to forget this,” he said.

### [Video Shows Studio City Home Collapse After Being Engulfed By Wildfire - Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/studio-city-home-collapse-los-angeles-wildfires-2012154)

A dramatic video has surfaced showing a Studio City home collapsing into flames as wildfires tear through the area. Wildfires, caused by powerful Santa Ana winds, are currently engulfing much of Los Angeles. Known for their hot, dry nature, Santa Ana winds rapidly sap moisture from vegetation, leaving grasses, shrubs and trees highly combustible. Under such conditions, any spark—whether from downed power lines, machinery or natural events such as lightning—can ignite an inferno, with containment efforts significantly hindered by the winds' ferocity. So far, at least 5 people have died as a result of the wildfires, and several have been injured, authorities said in a press conference Wednesday. At least 2,000 structures have been destroyed across the city. A large house fire erupted in the Studio City area of Los Angeles on Wednesday night. Video footage of a live broadcast of the fire showed the four-story house collapse as flames engulfed the structure. WATCH: Building collapses during new fire in Studio City, Los Angeles pic.twitter.com/wPD7gw2pZR LAFD reported the fire on the 3000 block of North Sunswept Drive at 8:52 p.m., saying the residence was "well involved in fire with exposures and vegetation." The fire reportedly engulfed the home and spread to the nearby brush and jumped to neighboring houses. Firefighters quickly shifted to a defensive strategy to contain the blaze and prevent it from spreading further into the surrounding vegetation. The flames consumed the stilts supporting the home, causing it to collapse onto the hillside. Meanwhile, embers scattered into nearby brush, prompting crews to act swiftly with water hoses to extinguish them. LAFD deployed over 50 firefighters, who brought the fire under control within two hours. No injuries were reported in the immediate aftermath of the incident. The fire took place shortly after another blaze was reported on the other side of the mountains in Hollywood Hills. The two fires were not related, LAFD said. Studio City is located in Hollywood. Notable residents have included Zac Efron, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Ryan Gosling, among others. The wildfires began on Tuesday around 11 a.m. when fire broke out in the Santa Monica mountains. The exact cause is still under investigation, but it is believed they are being fueled by strong Santa Ana winds and dry conditions after low rainfall this season. By 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the fire had burnt more than 1,260 acres, and hours later the authorities reported that it had spread to 2,900 acres. At least seven fires have occurred in Los Angeles. Those include the Palisades Fire in Pacific Palisades, which has already burned through more than 15,800 acres, as well as the Eaton Fire, which is raging inland close to Pasadena across 10,600 acres. Neither fire has been contained. The third fire, named the Hurst fire, is burning in Sylmar, in the San Fernando Valley northwest of Los Angeles. That has affected 855 acres but is now 10 percent contained. Meanwhile, the Lidia Fire began on Wednesday in Acton, to the northeast of Santa Clarita, and was at nearly 350 acres with 40 percent containment. A fifth fire, the Woodley Fire in the Sepulveda Basin, was quickly brought under control on Wednesday, burning across 30 acres. The Tyler Fire, in Coachella, was fully contained on Wednesday after spreading across 15 acres and destroying 2 structures. The Sunset fire burned across 60 acres in the Hollywood hills on Wednesday night. The wildfires have prompted the mandatory evacuation of more than 130,000 people so far. Evacuation orders are currently in place in Pasadena, Altadena and Sierra Madre, as well as in Calabasas, Malibu, parts of Los Angeles, Pacific Palisades and Topanga Canyon. Los Angeles Fire Department said: "Over 50 firefighters extinguished the fire with no injuries reported. The fire extended into the surrounding vegetation, created small spot fires and caused some (extent not known at this time) damage to exposed buildings." Adam Vangerpen, a spokesperson with LAFD, told KTLA: "We did just have the winds pick up again so we are seeing some ember casting from that four-story structure. Our hope is to hit it hard, and we're trying to keep it out of the brush right now." Firefighters and other emergency workers continue battling the major fires burning in and around Los Angeles and assisting in evacuation efforts. While the potent winds driving the fires to rapidly escalate were expected to die down by Thursday night, the initial causes of all the blazes remain under investigation.

## Bonnaroo

### [Bonnaroo - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnaroo)

邦纳鲁音乐与艺术节（Bonnaroo），又称邦纳鲁（Bonnaroo），是美国一年一度为期四天的音乐节，由 Superfly Presents 和 AC Entertainment 共同开发和创办。自2002年首届举办以来，该音乐节一直都在田纳西州曼彻斯特一个占地700英亩（280公顷）的农场（现称为大舞台公园）举行。音乐节通常从6月的第二个星期四开始，持续四天。除了2020年因新冠肺炎疫情而取消[2]和2021年因飓风艾达带来的暴雨导致营地被淹而取消[3]之外，该音乐节每年都会举办。该音乐节的主要亮点是多个舞台上的现场音乐表演，涵盖多种音乐风格，包括独立摇滚、经典摇滚、世界音乐、嘻哈、爵士、美国民谣、蓝草、乡村音乐、民谣、福音、雷鬼、流行、电子音乐和其他另类音乐。音乐表演从周三晚上就开始，供提前到达的游客观看，并持续整个音乐节，每天中午开始表演，一些舞台直到日出才会结束[4]。该音乐节在2003年被《滚石》杂志评为“改变摇滚乐的50个时刻”之一[5]，被《后果之声》杂志评为“十年音乐节”，并被《GQ》杂志评为十大最佳音乐节之一。AC Entertainment 的联合创始人阿什利·卡普斯（Ashley Capps）在1999年田纳西州诺克斯维尔市“炎炎夏日之夜”摇滚音乐节取消后创办了邦纳鲁音乐节。该音乐节在诺克斯维尔的世博会公园举办过，但在市政府官员进行建设后，便永久停止运营。卡普斯表示，该音乐节的取消是邦纳鲁音乐节诞生的主要动力，“世博会公园不再举办音乐会，这让我们不得不去想，‘好吧，如果我们不能再做这件事了，我们如何在夏季户外音乐会行业继续参与呢？’正是从这个想法出发，邦纳鲁音乐节最终诞生了。”[6]1999年，邦纳鲁音乐节未来的举办地举办了“痒痒酷公园音乐节”（Itchycoo Park Festival，以小脸乐队（Small Faces）的歌曲“痒痒酷公园”命名），被认为是邦纳鲁音乐节的“精神前身”。与邦纳鲁音乐节不同的是， “痒痒酷公园音乐节”被认为是一个彻头彻尾的失败[7]。首届邦纳鲁音乐节于2002年举行。创始人选择了“bonnaroo”（克里奥尔语俚语，意思是“非常好的时光”）作为音乐节的名字，既因为它字面的意思，也为了纪念他们在大学时就喜欢的、充满活力的新奥尔良音乐传统。邦纳鲁音乐节因新奥尔良节奏布鲁斯歌手约翰医生（Dr. John）1974年发行的专辑《绝对的邦纳鲁》（Desitively Bonnaroo）而变得流行[8][9]。“Bonnaroo”源于法语“bonne”（读音为[bɔn]，是“bon”（读音为[bɔ̃]，意思是“好”）的阴性词尾变化形式）和法语“rue”（读音为[ʁy]，意思是“街道”），大致翻译为“街道上最好的”。[10]音乐节场地被音乐节参与者和当地人称为“农场”，因为它位于以前的一个占地700英亩的农场。2019年，在创纪录的音乐节门票售罄之后，宣布Live Nation将收购Superfly在邦纳鲁音乐节的股份[11]。2020年的音乐节最初被推迟了三个月，直到2020年9月举行，但最终因美国新冠肺炎疫情的健康问题而取消。2021年的音乐节因飓风艾达带来的暴雨而取消，这场暴雨导致舞台区域、营地和收费站区域被水浸泡，在音乐节开始前几天，地面状况不适合车辆通行[12]。Hulu从2022年到2024年独家直播了该音乐节，以及奥斯汀城市极限音乐节（Austin City Limits Music Festival）和洛拉帕鲁扎音乐节（Lollapalooza）[13]。2009年，邦纳鲁作品基金（Bonnaroo Works Fund）作为一家501(c)(3)非营利组织为该音乐节成立[14

邦纳鲁音乐与艺术节 [ bon-uh-roo ] 邦纳鲁是邦纳鲁音乐与艺术节的简称，该音乐节每年在田纳西州曼彻斯特举行，在多个舞台上举办数十场音乐会，邀请来自嘻哈、摇滚、流行等各种流派的热门艺术家参加。该音乐节在改造成节日场地之前是农田。许多音乐节参与者在活动期间露营。尽管邦纳鲁主要以音乐节而闻名，但也举办美食节、喜剧表演和电影节。邦纳鲁通常在六月持续四天。2023 年的邦纳鲁将在 6 月 15 日至 18 日举行。第一届邦纳鲁音乐节于 2002 年举行。据说它的名字取自 1974 年约翰博士 (他在邦纳鲁多次演出) 的专辑《Desitively Bonnaroo》的标题。邦纳鲁是新奥尔良俚语，指美好时光（或许字面意思是“街上最好的”——结合了法语中的 bonne，意思是“好”，和 rue，意思是“街道”）。邦纳鲁以举办来自不同流派的主流和鲜为人知的艺术家而闻名。邦纳鲁历史上值得注意的表演者包括布鲁斯·斯普林斯汀、杰伊·Z、珍珠果酱、电台司令、坎耶·韦斯特、佛罗伦萨与机器、我的早晨外套和机会说唱歌手。 你知道吗？… 讨论邦纳鲁时还有哪些词语？ 这并非像我们在 Dictionary.com 上定义的大多数词语那样对邦纳鲁的正式定义，而是一个非正式的词语总结，希望它能触及邦纳鲁意义和用法的关键方面，帮助我们的用户扩展词汇量。

**当前问题详情 发布时间：2005 年 5 月 11 日**

**“Bonnaroo” 这个名字的由来是什么？**

“Bonnaroo” 这个词，由新奥尔良 R&B 巨星 Dr. John 在他 1974 年的专辑《Desitively Bonnaroo》中推广，是卡津俚语，意思是“一段非常美好的时光”。我们之所以选择这个名字，是因为它的字面意思，以及为了向丰富的路易斯安那音乐传统致敬，正是这种传统激发了我们想要为欣赏音乐的粉丝提供多种风格的高质量现场音乐的愿望。我们很高兴 “Bonnaroo” 这个词对于成千上万喜欢“一段非常美好的时光”的人来说，有了全新的意义。

**你们是如何决定音乐节的规模？**

有很多因素帮助我们确定音乐节周末允许多少顾客进入场地。我们与包括安保、交通、停车和医疗人员在内的运营团队一起，绘制了场地地图。我们考虑了场地整体的规模和布局，以及每个汽车和露营区域所需的占地面积（我们的露营区域分配超过了田纳西州大型集会法典的要求）。我们还考虑了我们所有员工和参与者关于 Bonnaroo 体验质量的反馈意见。在综合考虑所有这些因素之后，我们确定了活动的容量上限。

## Gavin Newsom

### [Gavin Newsom - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom)

加文·克里斯托弗·纽森（Gavin Christopher Newsom，1967 年 10 月 10 日出生）是一位美国政治家和商人，自 2019 年起担任加州第 40 任州长。他是民主党成员，曾于 2011 年至 2019 年担任加州第 49 任副州长，并于 2004 年至 2011 年担任旧金山第 42 任市长。纽森于 1989 年毕业于圣克拉拉大学，获得政治学理学士学位。之后，他与亿万富翁继承人兼家族朋友戈登·盖蒂（Gordon Getty）作为投资者，在加州奥克维尔创办了精品酒庄普朗杰克集团（PlumpJack Group）。该公司发展壮大，管理着 23 家企业，包括酒庄、餐厅和酒店。纽森的政治生涯始于 1996 年，当时旧金山市长威利·布朗（Willie Brown）任命他进入该市的停车和交通委员会。[1] 次年，布朗任命纽森填补了旧金山监督委员会的空缺，纽森于 1998 年首次当选该委员会成员。纽森于 2003 年当选旧金山市长，并在 2007 年连任。他于 2010 年当选加州副州长。作为副州长，纽森从 2012 年到 2013 年主持了《加文·纽森秀》（The Gavin Newsom Show）。他还于 2013 年撰写了《公民之城》（Citizenville）一书，该书重点关注使用数字工具进行民主变革。他在 2014 年连任，并在 2018 年当选加州州长。在他担任州长期间，纽森因其在 COVID-19 大流行期间的个人行为和领导风格而受到批评，尤其是在一些人认为过于严格和对经济造成损害的严格封锁措施方面。争议以及公众对其领导力的失望情绪导致了 2021 年对纽森的一次不成功的罢免行动。他在 2022 年以超过 59% 的得票率成功连任。

纽森于 1967 年 10 月 10 日出生，是泰莎·托马斯（Tessa Thomas，娘家姓门济斯，Menzies）和威廉·阿尔弗雷德·纽森三世（William Alfred Newsom III，州上诉法院法官兼盖蒂石油公司律师）的儿子。[2] 他是旧金山的第四代人。纽森的外曾祖父之一，苏格兰人托马斯·阿迪斯（Thomas Addis），是肾脏学领域的先驱科学家，也是斯坦福大学的医学教授。纽森是音乐家乔安娜·纽森（Joanna Newsom）的远房堂兄弟。[3] 纽森的姑姑嫁给了罗恩·佩洛西（Ron Pelosi），他是前美国众议院议长南希·佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）的兄弟。[4] 纽森的父母于 1971 年离婚，当时他只有三岁。[5] 纽森说他的童年并不容易，部分原因是“相当严重的”阅读障碍。[4] 他在旧金山的一所法美双语天主教学校——圣母无染原罪学校（École Notre Dame Des Victoires）上幼儿园和一年级，但最终转学，因为他严重的阅读障碍一直困扰着他。这让他在写作、拼写、阅读和数字运算方面都遇到了挑战。[4] 在整个求学过程中，纽森不得不依靠有声读物、摘要和非正式的口头指导。直到今天，他仍然更喜欢通过音频来解读文件和报告。[6] 纽森在圣母无染原罪学校上了三年级到五年级，在那里他被安排进了补习阅读班。他在高中时打篮球和棒球，并于 1985 年毕业于红杉高中（Redwood High School）。纽森是篮球队的得分后卫，棒球队的外野手。他的出色表现使他登上了《马林独立报》（Marin Independent Journal）的封面。[7] 泰莎·纽森打三份工作来供养加文和他的妹妹希拉里·纽森·卡兰（Hilary Newsom Callan）。在接受《旧金山纪事报》（San Francisco Chronicle）采访时，他的妹妹回忆起圣诞节时，他们的母亲告诉他们他们不会收到任何礼物。[7] 泰莎

加文·纽森（左），与查尔斯·施瓦布、莎莉·谢伊维茨博士和贝内特·谢伊维茨博士

2003 年至 2011 年，纽森担任旧金山市长，是该职位百年来最年轻的当选者。纽森实施了“健康选择计划”，为城市贫困和无保险居民提供全民医疗保健，并签署了美国首批菜单标注法案之一，要求连锁餐厅在其菜单上显著显示营养信息。2009 年，纽森与纽约市长迈克尔·布隆伯格共同获得了“健康社区领导力奖”，表彰他们为儿童和家庭提供更便捷的健康食品和体育活动选择。2013 年，纽森出版了《公民城》，这是一本关于普通公民使用技术工具将政府改造成现代数字民主的书籍，反映了他对现代化、创新型政府结构的必要性的看法。

加文·纽森五岁时被诊断出患有阅读障碍，但他母亲没有告诉他，因为担心他会把自己的残疾当作借口。所以，虽然他费力地阅读、拼写和做数字运算，但他的妹妹却轻松地学习。纽森说：“作为哥哥，这比你能想象的还要困难。我一直想知道为什么她能很快完成作业，而我却还在努力完成，为什么我父母对我要求如此严格，而对她却很宽容。”

当纽森上五年级时，他在母亲的办公室里发现了一堆文件，这些文件报告了他的糟糕的学习成绩，并描述了一种叫做阅读障碍的东西。纽森说：“这真的让我大开眼界，它解释了为什么其他人都放学后跑进父母的怀抱，而我每个星期一、星期三和星期五都被困在学校后面的那个棚子里，和其他四五个学生一起。”

纽森说，在他所有学习上的困难中，大声朗读是最让他感到羞辱的。他仍然记得他五年级的教室和他的座位，他说：“我的心一直沉下去，砰砰直跳，希望那一节课快点结束，我们能赶快离开那里，然后站起来开始朗读，让全班同学都笑话我。那时候我基本上放弃了任何阅读。我做读书报告的方法就是直接读封底，然后抄写上面的文字，心想老师永远不会发现。”

高中更糟糕。纽森说：“成绩很差，我的自尊心开始崩溃，我记得经常假装生病以避免上数学课，因为我真的无法应付。”

但是，因为他的父母期望他上大学，所以纽森开始上夏季课程来赶进度，他知道他永远进不了“一所正规的大学。我参加了 SAT 考试，结果是一场彻底的灾难，他们甚至没有让我再考一次，因为那太有压力了。说实话，如果不是我母亲和一些补习培训，我永远不会上大学。”

多亏了这些和他在棒球方面的出色才能，纽森开始收到许多大学的奖学金邀请，并凭借一项棒球奖学金进入了加州圣克拉拉大学。他说：“棒球给了我一些自尊心和自信，然后我在政治中找到了我的快乐和激情。”

纽森宣布主修政治学，并改变了自己的生活。他说：“突然间，我的成绩变好了，因为我喜欢这些科目。我发现政治有现实意义，不是政治理论，而是现实生活中正在发生的事情。尽管学习起来很困难，但我真的足够关心它，愿意付出更多努力。所以我开始把报纸当作课本，直到现在，我仍然会给报纸划线，否则我会读五页却记不住一件事。”

虽然他从未读过小说，但纽森却沉迷于非虚构作品，他拥有无数关于政治和政治学的文章和书籍的“简明读本”的图书馆。他说：“由于过度补偿和你在挣扎中学习到的东西，我的记忆力非凡。从政治角度来看，没有比这更好的礼物了，因为你真的可以随机应变。”

从大学毕业后，纽森曾在销售和房地产行业短暂工作，之后成为一名成功的企业家。在一位家族朋友和其他投资者的支持下，他于 1991 年成立了一家名为 PlumpJack Associates 的公司。公司最初是一家位于旧金山菲尔莫尔街的葡萄酒商店，后来发展到在整个加利福尼亚州拥有酿酒厂、餐厅、旅馆和零售服装店。

纽森将他在商业上的成功归功于“一种热情，我认为这是所有成功的秘诀——找到激励我胜过任何事物的东西，并因此愿意失败和尝试新事物。”

纽森于 1995 年首次涉足政坛，当时他自愿参加了威利·

加文·克里斯托弗·纽瑟姆（Gavin Christopher Newsom，1967年10月10日出生）是一位美国政治家和商人，自2019年起担任加州第40任州长。作为民主党成员，他曾在2011年至2019年间担任加州第49任副州长，并在2004年至2011年间担任旧金山第42任市长。[1][2]

加文·克里斯托弗·纽瑟姆于1967年10月10日出生于加州旧金山，父母是特莎·门齐斯·纽瑟姆（Tessa Menzies Newsom）和威廉·A·纽瑟姆三世（William A. Newsom lll）。在他童年时，他被诊断出患有阅读障碍，这使得他很难阅读、写作、拼写和处理数字。他的父母于1972年他五岁时离婚。在青少年时期，纽瑟姆不得不做几份工作来养家，并且还是高中篮球队的得分后卫。[3] 他就读于埃科尔·诺特尔·达姆·德斯·维克托里斯（Ecole Notre Dames Des Victories）、红杉高中（Redwood High School）、圣克拉拉大学（Santa Clara University），并在意大利罗马留学后获得了理学学士学位。[4][5]

2010年3月，纽瑟姆正式宣布竞选副州长，并于2010年6月赢得民主党初选。在与前加州州长杰里·布朗（Jerry Brown）一起赢得大选后，他于2011年1月10日宣誓就任加州第49任副州长。2014年，他再次竞选连任，并于2015年1月宣誓就职。纽瑟姆从2011年起担任加州副州长，直到2019年1月任期结束。[7][8]

2015年，纽瑟姆还在担任副州长期间，宣布将在2018年竞选州长。2018年6月，他赢得民主党初选，并选择前大使埃莱尼·库纳拉基斯（Eleni Kounalakis）作为他的副州长竞选搭档。2018年11月，他击败共和党候选人约翰·H·考克斯（John H. Cox），并被确认赢得竞选。[9][10] 纽瑟姆于2019年1月7日正式宣誓就任加州第40任州长。[11][12][13]

2021年底，纽瑟姆启动了他的连任竞选，争取担任第二任州长。[14][15][16] 2022年11月8日，他击败了州参议员和共和党候选人布莱恩·达赫尔（Brian Dahle），并在2022年大选中以埃莱尼·库纳拉基斯为竞选搭档，再次当选州长。[17][18][19][20][21][22] 纽瑟姆于2023年1月6日宣誓就任第二任州长。[23]

纽瑟姆曾与律师金伯利·吉尔福伊尔（Kimberly Guilfoyle）结婚，两人于2001年结婚，于2006年离婚。[24] 他于2006年10月在耶尔巴布埃纳艺术中心（Yerba Buena Center for the Arts）的一次相亲中认识了女演员詹妮弗·西贝尔（Jennifer Siebel）。[25][26] 两人开始约会，并于2008年1月正式订婚。同年7月，两人结婚。[27][28] 他们育有四个孩子：两个女儿，

《漫威对决》第一赛季即将到来，重大更新将于2025年1月10日上线，网易游戏开发团队已经公布了更新补丁中将进行的平衡性调整。从先锋、决斗者、策略家到团队协作技能，开发人员根据收集的数据和社区反馈，对游戏进行了大量的调整。“我们的战斗数据分析表明，常规比赛中的队伍构成发生了显著变化，展现出阵容的多样性，”开发人员写道。“然而，随着技能水平的提升，以双盾和远程攻击为中心的阵容展现出强大的实力。尽管如此，玩家们不断地磨练和尝试新的阵容和策略，进一步丰富了战场。”第一赛季更改的目标是“让更广泛的阵容参与到更复杂的游戏中，确保所有玩家都能获得更丰富、更具吸引力和多样化的游戏体验。”以下是更新20250110补丁说明中包含的《漫威对决》第一赛季的所有平衡性调整：

* 鹰眼 + 黑寡妇：
* 海拉 + 雷神 + 洛基：
* 月光雪 + 海王：
* 火箭浣熊 + 惩罚者 + 冬兵：
* 绯红女巫 + 万磁王：
* 雷神 + 风暴女 + 美国队长：

网易已经确认，将在第二赛季开始时对团队协作技能进行更全面的评估，届时将有更多关于其使用的数据可用。

### [Marvel Rivals Version 20250110 Balance Post – Season 1 Begins! _Marvel Rivals -  The Super Hero Team-based PVP Shooter](https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250108/41548_1205103.html)

2025年1月9日，各位对手们，随着第0赛季即将结束，我们对战斗数据的分析揭示了常规比赛中队伍阵容的显著变化，展示了阵容的多样性。然而，随着游戏水平的提升，以双重护盾和远程攻击为核心的阵容表现出了强大的实力。尽管如此，玩家们不断地磨练和尝试新的阵容和策略，进一步丰富了战场。例如，由幻影猫和星爵组成的强力组合通过高机动性和强大的中程伤害带来了无与伦比的战场控制能力，而纳摩和冬兵的组合则强调防御反击，巩固后方并抓住战机获得优势。无论阵容是围绕浩克的力量还是亚当·沃洛克的团队能力，还是针对特定场景定制的英雄组合，都清楚地表明玩家们正在更深入地探索漫威对决的世界。因此，在第1赛季的前半段，我们将对某些英雄进行平衡调整，让更多英雄参与到更复杂的游戏中，为所有玩家提供更丰富、更具吸引力和更具多样性的游戏体验。

同时，关于赛季奖励和团队联动，我们想澄清的是，鉴于第0赛季持续时间较短，以及大家最近才适应漫威对决，我们不会在第1赛季对团队联动能力进行大规模调整或更改。相反，我们将对现有的团队联动数值进行微调。不用担心，我们计划在第2赛季对团队联动能力进行激动人心的重新设计和调整！

以下我们将详细介绍第1赛季前半段的平衡调整！穿上你的战衣，对手们，准备点燃战火！

**美国队长史蒂夫**将获得一些生存能力增强，让他能更频繁地进出战斗。

*  将释放“不朽传奇”后护盾恢复的延迟时间从3秒减少到2秒。
*  将“自由冲刺”的冷却时间从12秒减少到10秒。
*  将基础生命值从650提高到675。
*  将释放“自由冲击”（终极技能）的能量消耗从3400降低到3100；将释放后每秒为自己提供的额外生命值从110降低到100。

**奇异博士**我们将减少至高法师的威胁范围并增加防御时间。

*  将“疯狂风暴”和“伽马疯狂风暴”添加伤害衰减。从5米开始，到8米时衰减至70%。
*  将释放“炽天使之盾”后护盾值的恢复速度从80/秒略微降低到70/秒。

**雷神**雷神需要一些轻微的生存能力增强，并提高终极技能的成功率。

*  将基础生命值从500提高到525。
*  在“雷神”（终极技能）期间，添加对控制效果的免疫。

**浩克**班纳博士一直很强大，但进入战场后持续战斗能力有所下降，将让他与其他先锋更加一致。

*  将“英雄浩克”的“坚不可摧的护卫”伽马护盾值从250降低到200。

**毒液**随着生存能力的提升以及终极技能的威胁，共生体将给所有敌方队伍的后方带来恐惧。

*  将“共生韧性”每损失1点生命值获得的额外生命值比例从1提高到1.2。
*  将“深渊盛宴”（终极技能）的基础伤害从40提高到50。

**黑豹**我们将稍微降低特查拉的战斗生存能力。

*  将使用“灵魂撕裂”刷新“振金标记”后为自己提供的额外生命值从40降低到30，并将额外生命值的上限从120降低到75。

**黑寡妇**在评估娜塔莎的技能释放体验以及略微提高终极技能的威胁时，她急需优化。

*  将“边缘舞者”的第一个效果的范围从3米半径增加到5米半径。
*  将“轻盈步伐”从0体力恢复到满体力所需的时间从12秒减少到4秒。
*  将“电浆爆炸”（终极技能）达到最大功率所需的时间从1秒减少到0.6秒。

**鹰眼**我们将降低其中远程伤害能力，减少威胁战斗半径，并略微提高近战抗性。

*  略微减少每两支“爆裂箭”之间的散射角度。
*  将被动技能“射手专注”的触发距离从60米降低到40

## David Bowie

### [David Bowie - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie)

大卫·罗伯特·琼斯（David Robert Jones，1947年1月8日 - 2016年1月10日），艺名大卫·鲍伊（David Bowie，/ˈboʊi/ BOH-ee），[1] 是一位英国歌手、词曲作者、音乐家和演员。他被认为是20世纪最具影响力的音乐家之一，并因其在20世纪70年代的创新作品而受到评论家和音乐家的广泛赞誉。他的职业生涯以不断重塑自我和视觉呈现为标志，他对流行音乐的音乐和舞台表演产生了重大影响。

鲍伊从小就对音乐产生了兴趣。在开始职业音乐生涯之前，他学习了艺术、音乐和设计。1963年，他开始了职业音乐生涯。他与当地乐队合作发行了一系列不成功的单曲，并发布了以自己名字命名的首张个人专辑（1967年），之后凭借“太空怪人”（Space Oddity，1969年）首次进入英国单曲排行榜前五名。在经历了一段时间的实验之后，他在1972年的华丽摇滚时代以华丽且中性的化身“齐格吉·斯塔德斯特”（Ziggy Stardust）重新出现。这个角色由“星人”（Starman）及其专辑《齐格吉·斯塔德斯特的兴衰与火星蜘蛛乐队》（The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars，两张专辑均于1972年发行）的成功推动，为他赢得了广泛的知名度。

1975年，鲍伊的风格转变为一种他称之为“塑料灵魂”（plastic soul）的声音，这最初让他的许多英国粉丝疏远，但却为他带来了在美国的首次重大跨界成功，凭借《名声》（Fame）单曲和《年轻美国人》（Young Americans）专辑（两张专辑均于1975年发行）登上排行榜冠军。1976年，鲍伊出演了Cult电影《来自地球的男人》（The Man Who Fell to Earth），并发布了《前往车站》（Station to Station）专辑。1977年，他再次改变方向，发行了带有电子乐元素的专辑《低》（Low），这是他与布莱恩·伊诺合作的三张专辑中的第一张，被称为“柏林三部曲”。紧随其后的还有《英雄》（Heroes，1977年）和《房客》（Lodger，1979年）；每张专辑都进入了英国排行榜前五名，并获得了持久的评论赞誉。

在20世纪70年代后期商业成功不稳定之后，鲍伊有三首单曲登顶排行榜冠军：1980年的单曲《灰飞烟灭》（Ashes to Ashes），其专辑《怪兽惊魂》（Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)）以及《压力之下》（Under Pressure，与皇后乐队合作，1981年）。他在20世纪80年代凭借《让我们跳舞》（Let's Dance，1983年）取得了最大的商业成功。在1988年至1992年间，他领导着硬摇滚乐队“锡罐乐队”（Tin Machine），之后于1993年恢复个人音乐生涯。在整个20世纪90年代和2000年代，鲍伊继续尝试不同的音乐风格，包括工业音乐和丛林音乐。他还继续表演，他的角色包括《快乐圣诞，劳伦斯先生》（Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence，1983年）中的杰克·赛利尔斯少校，《迷宫》（Labyrinth，1986年）中的妖精王杰瑞斯，《双峰：与火同行》（Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me，1992年）中的菲利普·杰弗里斯，《巴斯奎亚》（Basquiat，1996年，传记片）中的安迪·沃霍尔，《致命魔术》（The Prestige，2006年）中的尼古拉·特斯拉，以及其他电影和电视作品中的客串角色。

他在2004年之后停止巡演，他的最后一次现场演出是在2006年的一次慈善活动中。他于2013年凭借《下一天》（The Next Day）结束了长达十年的录音休整，并一直活跃在音乐领域，直到2016年因肝癌去世。他去世前两天，正好是他69岁生日和他的最后一张专辑《黑星》（Blackstar）发行日。在他的一生中，他的唱片销量估计超过了全球1亿张，这使他成为有史以来最畅销的音乐家之一。他

### [David Bowie - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie)

大卫·鲍伊（David Bowie），艺名，原名大卫·罗伯特·琼斯（David Robert Jones，1947年1月8日 - 2016年1月10日），是一位英国摇滚音乐家和演员。大卫·罗伯特·琼斯于1947年1月8日出生于伦敦布里克斯顿的斯坦斯菲尔德路40号[1]，在肯特郡布罗姆利长大。他吹萨克斯，在伦敦的蓝调乐队担任歌手。他用艺名“大卫·鲍伊”，因为“大卫·琼斯”听起来太像“戴维·琼斯”（“猴王”乐队的成员）。他从发明了“鲍伊刀”的吉姆·鲍伊那里获得了这个名字。鲍伊凭借1969年的歌曲《太空怪人》（Space Oddity）而为公众所知。这首单曲是在人类首次登上月球时发行的。这首歌的标题来源于斯坦利·库布里克的电影《2001太空漫游》。1970年，鲍伊凭借《太空怪人》获得了艾弗·诺维洛奖。

1972年，鲍伊发行了专辑《齐柏林飞船的兴衰》（The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars），这是他最著名的专辑之一。凭借他在专辑中的表演，鲍伊成为了华丽摇滚的领军人物。齐柏林飞船成为了鲍伊的第二个身份（替身）。在新闻发布会上，他会以齐柏林飞船的形象出现。1973年7月3日，鲍伊在汉默史密斯奥德翁剧院的现场演唱会上结束了齐柏林飞船的形象。1983年，这场演出被拍成电影并发行原声带（《齐柏林飞船——电影》）。鲍伊还制作了卢·里德的《变形金刚》。他发行了《阿拉丁·圣徒》（Aladdin Sane），这是他在英国的第一张冠军专辑。

1974年，发行完专辑《钻石狗》（Diamond Dogs）后，鲍伊定居洛杉矶。他沉迷于毒品，尤其是可卡因。1975年，《名声》（Fame）（来自专辑《美国青年》），这首与约翰·列侬合写的歌曲在美国排行榜上排名第一。鲍伊在电影《来自地球的男人》中扮演一个外星人。一个新的第二个身份——“瘦白公爵”出现了。这是在1976年的《车站到车站》专辑中引入的。《金色岁月》这首歌在流行榜上排名很高。2003年，这张专辑在《滚石》杂志评选的“史上500张最伟大专辑”中排名第323位。发行完《车站到车站》后，鲍伊搬到了柏林。他对德国音乐很感兴趣。他想要戒掉毒瘾。在柏林，他开始与制作人托尼·维斯康蒂以及“斜向策略之王”布莱恩·伊诺合作。鲍伊也是伊基·波普的制作人。柏林三部曲包括《低》（Low）（1977年）、《英雄》（Heroes）（1977年）和《房客》（Lodger）（1979年），不过只有《英雄》是在柏林完全录制的。

1980年，鲍伊离开了柏林。1980年，他录制并发行了专辑《恐怖怪兽与超级怪人》（Scary Monsters And Super Creeps），其中包括英国冠军单曲《灰飞烟灭》（Ashes To Ashes）。1981年，他与皇后乐队合作推出了大热单曲《压力之下》（Under Pressure）：这首歌在英国排行榜上排名第一。1983年，鲍伊发行了《让我们跳舞》（Let's Dance），这是他销量最高的专辑。《让我们跳舞》这首歌在英国和美国都排在排行榜第一位。1984年，鲍伊获得了英国音乐奖最佳男歌手奖。1985年，他获得了格莱美最佳音乐录影带（短片）奖。然而，1985年，大卫·鲍伊和米克·贾格尔合作推出了慈善单曲《在街上跳舞》（Dancing In The Street）。1986年，鲍伊发行了热门单曲《绝对初学者》（Absolute Beginners）。1989年，鲍伊组建了乐队“锡制机器”。这是他自上世纪70年代以来第一支真正的乐队。与这支乐队，鲍伊录制了三张专辑：《锡制机器

### [About — David Bowie](https://www.davidbowie.com/about)

大卫·罗伯特·琼斯于1947年1月8日出生在布里克斯顿。13岁时，受伦敦西区爵士乐的启发，他拿起萨克斯风，并打电话给罗尼·罗斯学习。他早期加入过的乐队——Kon-Rads、King Bees、Mannish Boys和Lower Third——让他初尝流行乐和摩登乐的浮华世界，到1966年，他已成为大卫·鲍伊，留着长发，满怀着对明星梦的憧憬。肯尼斯·皮特成为他的经纪人，他的职业生涯始于几首大多被遗忘的单曲和一颗充满创意的头脑。直到1969年，他凭借传奇的《太空怪人》（在英国排行榜上排名第五）才开始声名鹊起。在20世纪60年代末的音乐探索中，年轻的鲍伊尝试了混合媒体、电影、哑剧、藏传佛教、表演和爱情。他的第一张摇滚专辑，最初名为《大卫·鲍伊》，后来改名为《词语的人，音乐的人》，再次改名为《太空怪人》，向伦敦艺术界的万花筒般的影響致敬，同时暗示着他的创作才华即将迎来摇滚乐史上最杰出、最独特的作品，尽管世界其他地区还需要几年时间才能赶上。

20世纪70年代初，《卖出世界的男人》是第一张以大卫·鲍伊为名义独立录制的专辑，标志着第一段明确的创作阶段的起点。米克·朗森的吉他经常被认为是重金属的诞生点，当然，华丽摇滚的辉煌开端也可以追溯到此。这张专辑于1971年4月由水星唱片公司发行，反响平平，鲍伊在那年春天首次前往美国宣传。同年5月，邓肯·佐伊·海伍德·鲍伊出生，他的父亲是大卫，母亲是当时的妻子安吉拉。RCA唱片公司是下一个签下鲍伊的唱片公司，在前往美国完成法律程序后，他回到伦敦，几乎背靠背地录制了两张专辑。《洪水猛兽》以一首六首歌的演示版为基础，正是它吸引了唱片公司与他签约，其中包括《变革》和《火星上的生命》。几乎在同一时间，这张专辑紧随其后的是永恒经典的《齐格吉·斯塔德与火星蜘蛛的兴衰》——任何“史上最伟大专辑”榜单上都不可缺少的一张专辑。1972年，鲍伊登上了国际巨星的宝座。例如，英国《GQ》杂志主编迪伦·琼斯谈到1972年7月6日标志性的《榜上榜》节目，齐格吉首次出现在数百万毫无戒心的观众客厅里，演唱了专辑的主打单曲《星尘》，他说：“正是这场演出让鲍伊成为了明星，将他的齐格吉·斯塔德形象深深地烙印在国民的意识中。”

在伦敦的那年春天，鲍伊的来自外太空的摇滚明星形象齐格吉·斯塔德举办了迄今为止最壮观、最具创新性的现场演出之一，拓展了现场摇滚演出的边界，单枪匹马地掀起了全球华丽摇滚的热潮。国际聚光灯的照耀并没有分散鲍伊对创作的狂热和高产的注意力。1972年夏天，他担任了两张经典专辑的制作人：卢·里德的《变压器》——纽约音乐史上的里程碑式专辑，催生了意外的另类热门歌曲《在狂野中行走》——以及伊基·波普与The Stooges的恐怖而极具影响力的原始朋克华丽摇滚融合专辑《原始力量》（鲍伊后来继续制作了伊基的《白痴》和《对生命的渴望》，前者收录了《中国女孩》，这首歌是他与波普共同创作的，后来又出现在《让我们跳舞》中）。仿佛他1972年的行程还不够满，鲍伊还制作了Mott the Hoople的《所有年轻的混蛋》，并为其创作了热门同名主题曲。美国齐格吉巡演于1972年9月开始，场场爆满，服装华丽，从日本戏剧到星际科幻，处处灵感闪耀，米克·朗森嘶吼的吉他，以及大胆而敢于突破的表演风格，将观众推向了狂热的摇滚狂欢，为他们来自异世界的救世主欢呼。到1973年春天，齐格吉已走遍全球，从伦敦到日本，无数

波士顿棕熊队是一支位于波士顿的职业冰球球队，隶属于国家冰球联盟 (NHL)，是东部联盟大西洋赛区的成员。球队成立于 1924 年，是 NHL 中第三古老的现役球队，也是美国最古老的球队。棕熊队是 NHL 的“六大元老”球队之一，其他五支球队分别是底特律红翼队、芝加哥黑鹰队、蒙特利尔加拿大人队、纽约游骑兵队和多伦多枫叶队。他们已赢得六座斯坦利杯冠军，与黑鹰队并列第四多（落后于加拿大人队、枫叶队和红翼队，分别拥有 24 座、13 座和 11 座），也是美国 NHL 球队中并列第二多。棕熊队还四次获得总统杯，最近一次是在 2022-23 赛季，他们以 135 分的成绩领先联盟，创造了 NHL 历史上单赛季最高得分纪录。棕熊队最初的比赛场地是波士顿体育馆（现称为马修斯体育馆），它是世界上最古老的室内冰球比赛场地，至今仍被用于各种级别的比赛。[3][4] 棕熊队离开波士顿体育馆后，在波士顿花园球馆举办了 67 个赛季的比赛，从 1928 年开始，到 1995 年结束，之后他们搬到了 TD 花园球馆。1924 年，NHL 决定将球队扩展到美国。[5] 1923 年，体育推广人托马斯·达根获得了美国三个 NHL 球队特许经营权，并将其中一个出售给了波士顿杂货业巨头查尔斯·亚当斯。[6] 棕熊队是 NHL 首批扩张球队之一，也是首支进驻美国的 NHL 球队。亚当斯担任球队老板后的第一件事就是聘请了前球星兼创新者阿特·罗斯担任总经理。[7] 罗斯给球队起了“棕熊”的昵称，这是经典民间故事中用来指代棕熊的名称。球队的昵称也与他们最初的制服颜色棕色和黄色相呼应，这些颜色源自亚当斯的杂货连锁店，即第一国家商店。[7][8] 1924 年 12 月 1 日，棕熊队在美国举办了首场 NHL 比赛，对手是蒙特利尔马龙队，斯莫基·哈里斯打进了棕熊队史上的首个进球，[9] 并帮助棕熊队以 2-1 获胜。[10] 这是该赛季为数不多的亮点之一，因为棕熊队在接下来的 11 场比赛中都输了，而且只取得了 6-24-0 的战绩，在他们的首个赛季中排名垫底。[11] 棕熊队在体育馆打了三个赛季，之后他们成为了波士顿花园球馆的主要租户。[12] 棕熊队在第二个赛季的战绩有所提升，取得了 17-15-4 的成绩，这原本是 NHL 历史上单赛季最大幅度提升的纪录，现在排在第三。[13] 但是，他们以一分之差错失了第三个也是最后一个季后赛名额，而这个名额被扩张球队匹兹堡海盗队获得。[14] 在他们的第三个赛季中，罗斯利用西部冰球联盟 (WHL) 的崩溃，买下了多名西部球星，其中包括球队的首位巨星后卫埃迪·肖尔。在棕熊队效力期间，他成为了 NHL 历史上最伟大的球员之一。[15] 波士顿以较大优势获得了当时已经扩大了的季后赛资格。在他们的首个季后赛征程中，棕熊队杀入了斯坦利杯决赛，但在首场完全由 NHL 球队参加的斯坦利杯决赛中输给了渥太华参议员队。[16] 参议员队夺冠的比赛中，棕熊队的比利·库图攻击了裁判，因此被 NHL 终身禁赛，这是联盟历史上唯一一次。[17] 1928-29 赛季是他们在波士顿花园球馆的首个赛季。1929 年，棕熊队在两场比赛中击败了纽约游骑兵队，获得了他们的首个斯坦利杯冠军。[18] 首支夺冠球队中的杰出球员包括肖尔、哈里·奥利弗、迪特·克莱珀、达奇·盖诺尔
