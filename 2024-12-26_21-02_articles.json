                "content": "Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (/biˈɒnseɪ/ ⓘ, bee-ON-say;[6] born September 4, 1981)[7] is an American singer, songwriter, and businesswoman. Regarded as one of the most influential cultural figures in music history,[8] she has transformed the sound of popular music with her vocal ability, live performances and artistic innovations. Her work is considered to be amongst the greatest of all time.[9] As a child, Beyoncé began performing through various singing and dancing competitions. She debuted in the late 1990s and rose to fame as a member of Destiny's Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Her debut solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003), became one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century and spawned the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\". Beyoncé's commercial success continued with the albums B'Day (2006), I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008) and 4 (2011), all of which featured hit singles including \"Irreplaceable\", \"Check on It\", \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on it)\", \"If I Were a Boy\", \"Halo\", \"Run the World (Girls)\" and \"Love On Top\". She has also ventured into acting, with leading roles in the films Dreamgirls (2006), Cadillac Records (2008) and Obsessed (2009). Beyoncé's career shifted after forming her own management company Parkwood Entertainment, creating monocultural events through acclaimed concept albums.[10] She explored personal and sociopolitical themes on Beyoncé (2013) and Lemonade (2016), which are credited with popularizing the surprise album and visual album. The former inspired setting Friday as the Global Release Day, while the latter became the best-selling album of 2016 worldwide. Her ongoing trilogy project – currently consisting of queer-inspired dance album Renaissance (2022) and Americana epic Cowboy Carter (2024) – has highlighted the contributions of Black pioneers to American musical and cultural history, spawning the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Break My Soul\" and \"Texas Hold 'Em\". Beyoncé is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold 200 million records worldwide, making her the most Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)-certified female artist in history.[11][12][13] Her accolades include the most Grammy Awards (32), NAACP Image Awards (25), BET Awards (32) and Soul Train Music Awards (25) of any artist. Billboard ranked her as the greatest pop star of the 21st century and Rolling Stone named her among the best singers of all time.[14][15] She was repeatedly named artist of the decade for both the 2000s and 2010s, including recognition as the RIAA's Top Certified Artist of the Decade and Pollstar's Touring Artist of the Decade.[16] She is the only female artist to debut all of her eight solo albums at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, and she is the only artist to release new Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits in four different decades (including group achievements).[17] She is a ubiquitous figure within popular culture and has influenced various other artists. Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born on September 4, 1981, at the Park Plaza Hospital[18] in Houston, Texas, to Tina Knowles (née Beyoncé), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager.[19] Tina is Louisiana Creole and Mathew is African American.[20][21][22][23] Beyoncé's younger sister, Solange Knowles, is also a singer and a former backup dancer for Destiny's Child. Solange and Beyoncé are the first sisters to have both had number one solo albums.[24] Beyoncé's maternal grandparents, Lumis Albert Beyincé and Agnéz Deréon (daughter of Odilia Broussard and Eugène DeRouen),[25] were French-speaking Louisiana Creoles, with roots in New Iberia;[26][25][27] She is a descendant of Acadian militia officer Joseph Broussard, who was exiled to French Louisiana after the expulsion of the Acadians, and of the French military officer and Abenaki chief Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie, Baron de Saint-Castin.[21][28] She has additional Breton heritage. Beyoncé's fourth great-grandmother, Marie-Françoise Trahan, was born in 1774 in Bangor, located on Belle Île, France. Trahan was a daughter of Acadians who had taken refuge on Belle Île after the Acadian expulsion. The Estates of Brittany had divided the lands of Belle Île to distribute them among 78 other Acadian families and the already settled inhabitants. The Trahan family lived on Belle Île for over ten years before migrating to Louisiana, where she married a Broussard descendant.[29] Beyoncé researched her ancestry and discovered that she is descended from a slave owner who married his slave.[30] Her mother is also of distant Irish and Jewish ancestry.[31][32][33][26] Beyoncé also has Belgian ancestry from Hainaut Province, Wallonia and is related to a former mayor of Froidchapelle, Belgium.[34][35] Beyoncé was raised with multiple religious traditions, attending St. John's United Methodist Church in Houston as well as St. Mary of the Purification Catholic Church.[36][37][38] She went to St. Mary's Catholic Montessori School in Houston and enrolled in dance classes there.[39] Her singing ability was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and Beyoncé finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes.[40] Beyoncé's interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven, singing John Lennon's \"Imagine\" to beat 15/16-year-olds.[41][42] In the fall of 1990, Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she performed with the school's choir.[43] She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts[44] and later Alief Elsik High School.[20][45] Beyoncé was also a member of the choir at St. John's United Methodist Church where she sang her first solo and was a soloist for two years.[37][46] When Beyoncé was eight, she met LaTavia Roberson at an audition for an all-girl entertainment group.[47] They were placed into a group called Girl's Tyme with three other girls, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston.[48] After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good.[49][50] In 1995, Beyoncé's father, Mathew, resigned from his job to manage the group.[51] The move reduced the family's income by half, and Beyoncé's parents were forced to sell their house and cars and move into separated apartments.[20][52] Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups.[47] The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company.[20] This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records with the assistance of Columbia talent scout Teresa LaBarbera Whites.[41] The group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.[53] In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song \"Killing Time\" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film Men in Black.[50] In November, the group released their debut single and first major hit, \"No, No, No\". They released their self-titled debut album in February 1998, which established the group as a viable act in the music industry.[47] The group released their Multi-Platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features songs such as \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", the group's first number-one single, \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\" and \"Say My Name\", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. \"Say My Name\" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.[47] The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide.[49] During this time, Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song \"After All Is Said and Done\" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man, as well as \"Ways To Get Cut Off\", a collaboration with fellow Columbia Records signee JoJo Robinson that was later shelved.[54][55] The remaining band members recorded \"Independent Women Part I\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film Charlie's Angels. It became their best-charting single, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks.[47] In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Beyoncé landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th-century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet.[56] When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them.[47] The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold.[57] The album spawned other number-one hits, \"Bootylicious\" and the title track, \"Survivor\", the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.[58] After releasing their holiday album 8 Days of Christmas in October 2001, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.[47] In July 2002, Beyoncé made her theatrical film debut, playing Foxxy Cleopatra alongside Mike Myers in the comedy film Austin Powers in Goldmember,[59] which spent its first weekend atop the U.S. box office and grossed $73 million.[60] Beyoncé released \"Work It Out\" as the lead single from its soundtrack album which entered the top ten in the UK, Norway, and Belgium.[61] In 2003, Beyoncé starred opposite Cuba Gooding Jr. in the musical comedy The Fighting Temptations as Lilly, a single mother with whom Gooding's character falls in love.[62] The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed $30 million in the U.S.[63][64] Beyoncé released \"Fighting Temptation\" as the lead single from the film's soundtrack album, with Missy Elliott, MC Lyte, and Free which was also used to promote the film.[65] Another of Beyoncé's contributions to the soundtrack, \"Summertime\", fared better on the U.S. charts.[66] Beyoncé's first solo recording was a feature on Jay-Z's song \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" that was released in October 2002, peaking at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.[68] On June 14, 2003, Beyoncé premiered songs from her first solo album Dangerously in Love during her first solo concert and the pay-per-view television special, \"Ford Presents Beyoncé Knowles, Friends & Family, Live From Ford's 100th Anniversary Celebration in Dearborn, Michigan\".[69] The album was released on June 24, 2003, after Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland had released their solo efforts.[70] The album sold 317,000 copies in its first week, debuted atop the Billboard 200,[71] and has since sold 11 million copies worldwide.[72] The album's lead single, \"Crazy in Love\", featuring Jay-Z, became Beyoncé's first number-one single as a solo artist in the US.[73] The single \"Baby Boy\" also reached number one,[67] and singles, \"Me, Myself and I\" and \"Naughty Girl\", both reached the top-five.[74] The album earned Beyoncé a then record-tying five awards at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards; Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \"Dangerously in Love 2\", Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Crazy in Love\", and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for \"The Closer I Get to You\" with Luther Vandross. During the ceremony, she performed with Prince.[75] In November 2003, she embarked on the Dangerously in Love Tour in Europe and later toured alongside Missy Elliott and Alicia Keys for the Verizon Ladies First Tour in North America.[76] On February 1, 2004, Beyoncé performed the American national anthem at Super Bowl XXXVIII, at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas.[77] After the release of Dangerously in Love, Beyoncé had planned to produce a follow-up album using several of the left-over tracks. However, this was put on hold so she could concentrate on recording Destiny Fulfilled, the final studio album by Destiny's Child.[78] Released on November 15, 2004, in the U.S.[79] and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200,[80][81] Destiny Fulfilled included the singles \"Lose My Breath\" and \"Soldier\", which reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[82] Destiny's Child embarked on a worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It sponsored by McDonald's Corporation,[83] and performed songs such as \"No, No, No\", \"Survivor\", \"Say My Name\", \"Independent Women\" and \"Lose My Breath\". In addition to renditions of the group's recorded material, they also performed songs from each singer's solo careers, including numbers from Dangerously in Love. During the last stop of their European tour, in Barcelona on June 11, 2005, Rowland announced that Destiny's Child would disband following the North American leg of the tour.[84] The group released their first compilation album Number 1's on October 25, 2005, in the U.S.[85] and accepted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in March 2006.[86] The group has sold 60 million records worldwide.[87][88] Beyoncé's second solo album B'Day was released on September 4, 2006, in the U.S., to coincide with her twenty-fifth birthday.[89] It sold 541,000 copies in its first week and debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming Beyoncé's second consecutive number-one album in the United States.[90] The album's lead single \"Déjà Vu\", featuring Jay-Z, reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[74] The second international single \"Irreplaceable\" was a commercial success worldwide, reaching number one in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, New Zealand and the United States.[74][91] B'Day also produced three other singles; \"Ring the Alarm\",[92] \"Get Me Bodied\",[93] and \"Green Light\" (released in the United Kingdom only).[94] At the 49th Annual Grammy Awards (2007), B'Day was nominated for five Grammy Awards, including Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \"Ring the Alarm\" and Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration\"for \"Déjà Vu\"; the Freemasons club mix of \"Déjà Vu\" without the rap was put forward in the Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical category.

A one-hour film which aired on HBO on April 23, a corresponding album with the same title was released on the same day exclusively on Tidal.[178] Lemonade debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, making Beyoncé the first act in Billboard history to have their first six studio albums debut atop the chart; she broke a record previously tied with DMX in 2013.[179] With all 12 tracks of Lemonade debuting on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, Beyoncé also became the first female act to chart 12 or more songs at the same time.[180] Lemonade was streamed 115 million times through Tidal, setting a record for the most-streamed album in a single week by a female artist in history.[181] It was 2016's third highest-selling album in the U.S. with 1.554 million copies sold in that time period within the country[182] as well as the best-selling album worldwide with global sales of 2.5 million throughout the year.[183] Lemonade became the most critically acclaimed work of her career.[184] Several music publications included the album among the best of 2016, including Rolling Stone, which listed Lemonade at number one.[185] The album's visuals were nominated in 11 categories at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards, the most ever received by Beyoncé in a single year, and went on to win 8 awards, including Video of the Year for \"Formation\".[186][187] The eight wins made Beyoncé the most-awarded artist in the history of the VMAs (24), surpassing Madonna (20).[188] Beyoncé occupied the sixth place for Time magazine's 2016 Person of the Year.[189] In January 2017, it was announced that Beyoncé would headline the Coachella Music and Arts Festival. This would have made Beyoncé only the second female headliner of the festival since it was founded in 1999.[190] It was later announced on February 23, 2017, that Beyoncé would no longer be able to perform at the festival due to doctor's concerns regarding her pregnancy. The festival owners announced that she would instead headline the 2018 festival.[191] Upon the announcement of Beyoncé's departure from the festival lineup, ticket prices dropped by 12%.[192] At the 59th Grammy Awards in February 2017, Lemonade led the nominations with nine, including Album, Record, and Song of the Year for Lemonade and \"Formation\" respectively.[193] and ultimately won two, Best Urban Contemporary Album for Lemonade and Best Music Video for \"Formation\".[194] In September 2017, Beyoncé collaborated with J Balvin and Willy William, to release a remix of the song \"Mi Gente\". Beyoncé donated all proceeds from the song to hurricane charities for those affected by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in Texas, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and other Caribbean Islands.[195] On November 10, Eminem released \"Walk on Water\" featuring Beyoncé as the lead single from his album Revival. On November 30, Ed Sheeran announced that Beyoncé would feature on the remix to his song \"Perfect\".[196] \"Perfect Duet\" was released on December 1, 2017. The song reached number-one in the United States, becoming Beyoncé's sixth song of her solo career to do so.[197] On January 4, 2018, the music video of Beyoncé and Jay-Z's 4:44 collaboration, \"Family Feud\" was released.[198] It was directed by Ava DuVernay. On March 1, 2018, DJ Khaled released \"Top Off\" as the first single from his forthcoming album Father of Asahd featuring Beyoncé, husband Jay-Z, and Future.[199] On March 5, 2018, a joint tour with Knowles's husband Jay-Z, was leaked on Facebook.[200] Information about the tour was later taken down. The couple announced the joint tour officially as On the Run II Tour on March 12[201] and simultaneously released a trailer for the tour on YouTube.[202] On April 14, 2018, Beyoncé played the first of two weekends as the headlining act of the Coachella Music Festival. Her performance of April 14, attended by 125,000 festival-goers, was immediately praised, with multiple media outlets describing it as historic. The performance became the most-tweeted-about performance of weekend one, as well as the most-watched live Coachella performance and the most-watched live performance on YouTube of all time. The show paid tribute to black culture, specifically historically black colleges and universities and featured a live band with over 100 dancers. Destiny's Child also reunited during the show.[203][204] On June 6, 2018, Beyoncé and husband Jay-Z kicked-off the On the Run II Tour in Cardiff, United Kingdom. Ten days later, at their final London performance, the pair unveiled Everything Is Love, their joint studio album, credited under the name The Carters, and initially available exclusively on Tidal. The pair also released the video for the album's lead single, \"Apeshit\", on Beyoncé's official YouTube channel.[205][206] Everything Is Love received generally positive reviews,[207] and debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200, with 123,000 album-equivalent units, of which 70,000 were pure album sales.[208] On December 2, 2018, Beyoncé alongside Jay-Z headlined the Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 which was held at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa.[209] Their 2-hour performance had concepts similar to the On the Run II Tour and Beyoncé was praised for her outfits, which paid tribute to Africa's diversity.[210] Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé, a documentary and concert film focusing on Beyoncé's historic 2018 Coachella performances, was released by Netflix on April 17, 2019.[211][212] The film was accompanied by the surprise live album Homecoming: The Live Album.[213] It was later reported that Beyoncé and Netflix had signed a $60 million deal to produce three different projects, one of which is Homecoming.[214] Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé received six nominations at the 71st Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.[215] Beyoncé starred as the voice of Nala in the remake The Lion King, which was released in July 2019.[216] Beyoncé is featured on the film's soundtrack, released on July 11, 2019, with a remake of the song \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" alongside Donald Glover, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, which was originally composed by Elton John.[217] An original song from the film by Beyoncé, \"Spirit\", was released as the lead single from both the soundtrack and The Lion King: The Gift – a companion album released alongside the film, produced and curated by Beyoncé.[218][219] Beyoncé called The Lion King: The Gift a \"sonic cinema\". She stated that the album is influenced by everything from R&B, pop, hip hop, gqom and Afro Beat.[218][220] The songs were produced by African producers, which Beyoncé said was because \"authenticity and heart were important to [her]\", since the film is set in Africa.[218] In September of the same year, a documentary chronicling the development, production and early music video filming of The Lion King: The Gift entitled \"Beyoncé Presents: Making The Gift\" was aired on ABC.[221] In March 2020, a photograph Beyoncé captured of her swimming pool was used as the album cover for rapper Jay Electronica's highly anticipated debut album A Written Testimony.[222] In April of the same year, Beyoncé was featured on the remix of Megan Thee Stallion's song \"Savage\", marking her first music release for the year.[223] The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Beyoncé's eleventh song to do so across all acts.[224] On June 19, 2020, Beyoncé released the nonprofit charity single \"Black Parade\".[225] On June 23, she followed up the release of its studio version with an a cappella version exclusively on Tidal.[226] Black Is King, a visual album based on the music of The Lion King: The Gift, premiered globally on Disney+ on July 31, 2020. Produced by Disney and Parkwood Entertainment, the film was written, directed and executively produced by Beyoncé. The film was described by Disney as \"a celebratory memoir for the world on the Black experience\".[227] Beyoncé received the most nominations (9) at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards and the most awards (4), which made her the most-awarded singer, most-awarded female artist, and second-most-awarded artist in Grammy history.[228] In 2021, Beyoncé wrote and recorded a song titled \"Be Alive\" for the biographical drama film King Richard.[229] She received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song at the 94th Academy Awards for the song, alongside co-writer Dixson.[230] On March 27, 2022, Beyoncé performed \"Be Alive\" at the 94th Academy Awards. Choreographed by friend and past collaborator Fatima Robinson, Beyoncé was applauded for choosing to perform on the Compton tennis courts Venus and Serena Williams practiced on in their childhood instead of at the venue.[231][232] On June 9, 2022, Beyoncé removed her profile pictures across various social media platforms, causing speculation that she would be releasing new music.[233] Days later, Beyoncé caused further speculation via her nonprofit BeyGood's Twitter account hinting at her upcoming seventh studio album.[234] On June 15, 2022, Beyoncé officially announced her seventh studio album, titled Renaissance.[235] The lead single of Renaissance, \"Break My Soul\", was released on June 20, 2022.[236] The album was released on July 29, 2022.[237][238] \"Break My Soul\" became Beyoncé's 20th top ten single on the Billboard Hot 100, which made her join Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson as the only artists in Hot 100 history to achieve at least twenty top tens as a solo artist and ten as a member of a group.[239] As Renaissance was released, Beyoncé announced that the album was the first installment of a trilogy she conceived and recorded over three years during the COVID-19 pandemic. A time she found to be her \"most creative [period].\"[240][235] The three recorded projects are designated into acts under Roman numerals.[241] Upon release, Renaissance received universal acclaim from critics.[242] Renaissance debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, making her the first female artist to have her first seven studio albums debut at number one in the United States.[243] \"Break My Soul\" concurrently rose to number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the twelfth song to do so across her career discography.[244] The song \"Heated\", which was co-written with Canadian rapper Drake, originally included the lyrics \"Spazzin' on that ass / spazz on that ass\". Critics, including a number of disability charities and activists, argued that the word \"spaz\" represented a derogatory term for spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy. In response, in August 2022, a representative for Beyoncé issued a statement and explained that \"The word, not used intentionally in a harmful way, will be replaced\".[245][246] On January 21, 2023, Beyoncé performed in Dubai at a private show.[247] The performance, which was her first full concert in more than four years, was delivered to an audience of influencers and journalists.[248] Beyoncé was reportedly paid $24 million to perform.[249] Beyoncé faced criticism for her decision to perform in the United Arab Emirates where homosexuality is illegal.[249][248][250] On February 1, Beyoncé announced the Renaissance World Tour with dates in North America and Europe,[251] becoming for a short-span, the highest-grossing tour by a female artist.[252] On July 28, Beyoncé appeared on \"Delresto (Echoes)\", the second single from rapper Travis Scott's album Utopia, eventually becoming her 100th career appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (encompassing Destiny's Child, her solo career, and musical duo The Carters).[253] On November 30, 2023, Beyoncé released documentary concert film Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé written, directed, and produced by her in collaboration with film distributor AMC Theatres. The film chronicles the development and execution of Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour, and contained new song \"My House\" in the end credits.[254] In February 2024, Beyoncé launched her hair care brand Cécred.[255] On February 11, 2024, immediately following a partner commercial with Verizon for the Super Bowl LVIII, she announced the second installment of her trilogy project and released its first two songs, \"Texas Hold 'Em\" and \"16 Carriages\".[256] \"Texas Hold 'Em\" became her highest chart debut in her career, her ninth solo number-one and her thirteenth across all credits on the Billboard Hot 100. On March 12, 2024, she announced the album's title, Cowboy Carter.[257][258] A country and gospel-tinged record, it was released on March 29 to universal acclaim from critics, and includes collaborations with artists including Tanner Adell and her daughter Rumi Carter, Miley Cyrus, Tiera Kennedy, Willie Jones, Post Malone, Linda Martell, Willie Nelson, Shaboozey, Brittney Spencer, Dolly Parton, and Reyna Roberts.[259] In July 2024, NBC released two promotional commercials featuring Beyoncé for their coverage of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France.[260] Set to Cowboy Carter songs \"Ya Ya\" and \"Just For Fun\", she introduced the entire USA Olympic Team and Gold-medal gymnast Simone Biles, respectively.[261][262] On August 20, Beyoncé announced SirDavis, a whiskey in collaboration with Moët Hennessy developed for years prior and co-founded with master distiller Dr. Bill Lumsden.[263] In October 2024, Levi's launched a four-part global campaign with Beyoncé titled \"Reiimagine\" that will stretch into 2025 and focus on women's history of the company, using Cowboy Carter track \"Levii's Jeans\".[264] The first commercial starring Beyoncé amassed 2.4 billion impressions in under a month.[265] Beyoncé reprised her role as Nala for Mufasa: The Lion King, a prequel to the 2019 remake, released in December 2024.[266] On December 25, 2024, Beyoncé headlined the first ever NFL Christmas Gameday Halftime Show.[267] With \"Single Ladies\", clearly I'd just gotten married, and people want to get married every day – then there was the whole Justin Timberlake thing [recreating the video] on Saturday Night Live, and it was also the year YouTube blew up. With \"Irreplaceable\", the aggressive lyrics, the acoustic guitar, and the 808 drum machine – those things don't typically go together, and it sounded fresh. \"Crazy in Love\" was another one of those classic moments in pop culture that none of us expected. I asked Jay to get on the song the night before I had to turn my album in – thank God he did. It still never gets old, no matter how many times I sing it. Critics have described Beyoncé's voice as being mezzo-soprano.[269][270] Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as \"one of the most compelling instruments in popular music\".[271] Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child.[272] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\".[273] Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé's unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto.[271] Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was \"capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.\"[274] On the 2023 Rolling Stone's list of the 200 Greatest Singers of all time, Beyoncé ranked at number 8, with the publication noting that \"in [her] voice lies the entire history of Black music\".[275] Beyoncé's music is generally R&B,[276][277] pop[276][278] and hip hop[279] but she also incorporates soul and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyoncé's exploration of 1990s-style R&B, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases.[268] While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyoncé recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyoncé was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.[280] Beyoncé has received co-writing credits for most of her songs.[281] Her early songs with Destiny's Child were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like \"Independent Women\" and \"Survivor\", but after the start of her relationship with Jay-Z, she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as \"Cater 2 U\".[282] Beyoncé's songwriting process is also known for combining parts of different tracks, resulting in alteration of song structures. Sia, who co-wrote \"Pretty Hurts\", called Beyoncé \"very Frankenstein when she comes to songs\";[283] Diana Gordon, who co-wrote \"Don't Hurt Yourself\" called her a \"scientist of songs\";[284] Caroline Polachek who co-wrote \"No Angel\", called her a \"genius writer and producer for this reason. She's so good at seeing connections.\"[285] In 2001, she became the first Black woman and second female lyricist to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards.[20][286] Beyoncé was the third woman to have writing credits on three number-one songs (\"Irreplaceable\", \"Grillz\" and \"Check on It\") in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American lyricist Diane Warren at third with nine songwriting credits on number-one singles.[287] The latter wrote her song \"I Was Here\" for 4, which was motivated by the September 11 attacks.[288] In May 2011, Billboard magazine listed Beyoncé at number 17 on their list of the Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of only three women on that list, along with Alicia Keys and Taylor Swift.[289] Beyoncé has received criticism, including from journalists and musicians, for the extensive writing credits on her songs.[281] The controversy surrounding her songwriting credits began with interviews in which she attributed herself as the songwriter for songs in which she was a co-writer[290] or for which her contributions were marginal.[281] In a cover story for Vanity Fair in 2005, she claimed to have \"written\" several number-one songs for Destiny's Child, contrary to the credits, which list her as a co-writer among others.[290] During a 2007 interview with Barbara Walters, she claimed to have conceived the musical idea for the Destiny's Child song \"Bootylicious\",[291] which provoked the song's producer Rob Fusari to call her father and then-manager Mathew Knowles in protest over the claim. In 2010, Fusari told Billboard: \"[Knowles] explained to me, in a nice way, he said, 'People don't want to hear about Rob Fusari, producer from Livingston, N.J. No offense, but that's not what sells records. What sells records is people believing that the artist is everything.'\"[292] However, in an interview for Entertainment Weekly in 2016, Fusari said Beyoncé \"had the 'Bootylicious' concept in her head. That was totally her. She knew what she wanted to say. It was very urban pop angle that they were taking on the record.\"[293] I am really passionate about all of the steps [during] the production [...] I love to stack vocals, and I love to create my own little Oreo with arrangements, sometimes it can be thousands of vocals [and then] I go back and then kind of piece things together, because usually the songs are way too long [...] I go back and edit the structure of the song. [I] make sure that [...] every section has an intention, so that takes months. [...] I hear certain elements of things that go with things that are opposites. I am rarely happy with one track, it's usually four or five things put together that again don't really go together. I am so excited when I'm able to adjust the tempo and key and mute certain elements that don't complement and put opposites together. Sometimes it's just like the EQ of a synth or the warmth of a bass or the distortion of a bass that's on a different song and I can hear like, 'Ah! That's exactly what is missing to make the track full and complete!' Beyoncé's collaborators frequently mention her talent and involvement in the record production of her songs,[295][296] sometimes describing her as a genius in the skill.[297] She is known to have favorite saturation and distortion plug‑ins, intentionality about stereo imaging and concentration on individual elements of her songs as a \"focal point\" in production.[298] Beyoncé names Michael Jackson as her major musical influence.[299][300] Aged five, Beyoncé attended her first ever concert where Jackson performed and she claims to have realized her purpose.[301] When she presented him with a tribute award at the World Music Awards in 2006, Beyoncé said, \"if it wasn't for Michael Jackson, I would never ever have performed.\"[302] Beyoncé was heavily influenced by Tina Turner, and once said \"Tina Turner is someone that I admire, because she made her strength feminine and sexy\".[303][304] She admires Diana Ross as an \"all-around entertainer\",[305] and Whitney Houston, who she said \"inspired me to get up there and do what she did.\"[306][307] Beyoncé cited Madonna as an influence \"not only for her musical style, but also for her business sense\",[308] saying that she wanted to \"follow in the footsteps of Madonna and be a powerhouse and have my own empire.\"[309] She also credits Mariah Carey's singing and her song \"Vision of Love\" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child.[310][311] Her other musical influences include Rachelle Ferrell,[312] Aaliyah,[313] Janet Jackson,[314] Prince,[315] Lauryn Hill,[305] Sade Adu,[316] Donna Summer,[317] Fairuz,[318][319] Mary J. Blige,[320] Selena,[321] Anita Baker, and Toni Braxton.[305] The feminism and female empowerment themes on Beyoncé's second solo album B'Day were inspired by her role in Dreamgirls[322] and by singer Josephine Baker.[323] Beyoncé paid homage to Baker by performing \"Déjà Vu\" at the 2006 Fashion Rocks concert wearing Baker's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas.[324] Beyoncé's third solo album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, was inspired by Jay-Z and especially by Etta James, whose \"boldness\" inspired Beyoncé to explore other musical genres and styles.[325] Her fourth solo album, 4, was inspired by Fela Kuti, 1990s R&B, Earth, Wind & Fire, DeBarge, Lionel Richie, Teena Marie, The Jackson 5, New Edition, Adele, Florence and the Machine, and Prince.[268] Beyoncé has stated that she is personally inspired by Michelle Obama (the 44th First Lady of the United States), saying \"she proves you can do it all\",[326] and has described Oprah Winfrey as \"the definition of inspiration and a strong woman.\"[305] She has also discussed how Jay-Z is a continuing inspiration to her, both with what she describes as his lyrical genius and in the obstacles he has overcome in his life.[327] Beyoncé has expressed admiration for the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, posting in a letter \"what I find in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, I search for in every day in music ... he is lyrical and raw\".[328][329] Beyoncé has also cited Cher as a fashion inspiration.[330] In 2006, Beyoncé introduced her all-female tour band Suga Mama (also the name of a song on B'Day) which includes bassists, drummers, guitarists, horn players, keyboardists and percussionists.[331] Her background singers, The Mamas, consist of Montina Cooper-Donnell, Crystal Collins and Tiffany Moniqué Riddick. They made their debut appearance at the 2006 BET Awards and re-appeared in the music videos for \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Green Light\".[280] The band have supported Beyoncé in most subsequent live performances, including her 2007 concert tour The Beyoncé Experience, I Am... Tour (2009–2010), The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013–2014) and The Formation World Tour (2016). Beyoncé has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances. According to Barbara Ellen of The Guardian, Beyoncé is the most in-charge female artist she's seen onstage.[332] Similarly, Alice Jones of The Independent wrote she \"takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good.\"[333] The ex-President of Def Jam L.A. Reid has described Beyoncé as the greatest entertainer alive.[334] Jim Farber of the Daily News and Stephanie Classen of The StarPhoenix both praised her strong voice and her stage presence.[335][336] I choose to invest my time and energy only in projects that I am passionate about. Once I've committed, I give it all of me. I start with identifying my intention and making sure that I am aligned with the collaborators for the same purpose. It takes enormous patience to rock with me. My process is tedious. I review every second of footage several times and know it backwards and forwards. I find every ounce of magic and then I deconstruct it. I keep building more layers and repeat this editing process for months. I won't let up until it's undeniably reached its full potential. I believe my strength is understanding how storytelling, music, lighting, angles, fashion, art direction, history, dance, and editing work together. They are all equally important. Beyoncé's stage outfits have been met with criticism from many countries, such as Malaysia, where she has postponed or cancelled performances due to the country's strict laws banning revealing costumes.[338] Beyoncé has worked with numerous directors for her music videos throughout her career, including Melina Matsoukas, Jonas Åkerlund, and Jake Nava. Bill Condon, director of Beauty and the Beast, stated that the Lemonade visuals in particular served as inspiration for his film, commenting, \"You look at Beyoncé's brilliant movie Lemonade, this genre is taking on so many different forms ... I do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want.\"[339] Described as being \"sexy, seductive and provocative\" when performing on stage, Beyoncé has said that she originally created the alter ego \"Sasha Fierce\" to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is. She described Sasha Fierce as being \"too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy\", stating, \"I'm not like her in real life at all.\"[340] Sasha was conceived during the making of \"Crazy in Love\", and Beyoncé introduced her with the release of her 2008 album, I Am... Sasha Fierce. In February 2010, she announced in an interview with Allure magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need Sasha Fierce.[341] However, Beyoncé announced in May 2012 that she would bring her back for her Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live shows later that month.[342] Beyoncé has been described as having sex appeal, with music journalist Touré writing that since the release of Dangerously in Love, she has \"become a crossover sex symbol\".[343] When off stage, Beyoncé says that while she likes to dress sexily, her onstage dress \"is absolutely for the stage\".[344] Due to her curves and the term's catchiness, in the 2000s, the media often used the term \"bootylicious\" (a portmanteau of the words \"booty\" and \"delicious\") to describe Beyoncé,[345][346] the term popularized by the single of the same name by her group Destiny's Child. In 2006, it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.[347] In September 2010, Beyoncé made her runway modelling debut at Tom Ford's Spring/Summer 2011 fashion show.[348] She was named the \"World's Most Beautiful Woman\" by People[349] and the \"Hottest Female Singer of All Time\" by Complex in 2012.[350] In January 2013, GQ placed her on its cover, featuring her atop its \"100 Sexiest Women of the 21st Century\" list.[351][352] VH1 listed her at number 1 on its 100 Sexiest Artists list.[353] Several wax figures of Beyoncé are found at Madame Tussauds Wax Museums in major cities around the world.[354] According to Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli, Beyoncé uses different fashion styles to work with her music while performing.[355] Her mother co-wrote a book, published in 2002, titled Destiny's Style,[356] an account of how fashion affected the trio's success.[357] The B'Day Anthology Video Album showed many instances of fashion-oriented footage, depicting classic to contemporary wardrobe styles.[358] In 2007, Beyoncé was featured on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, becoming the second African American woman after model and television personality Tyra Banks,[359] and People magazine recognized Beyoncé as the best-dressed celebrity.[360] Beyoncé has been nicknamed \"Queen Bey\" by publications over the years. The term is a reference to the common phrase \"queen bee\", a term used for the leader of a group of females. The nickname also refers to the Queen bee of a beehive, with her fan base being named \"BeyHive\". BeyHive was previously titled \"The Beyontourage\", (a portmanteau of Beyoncé and entourage), but was changed after online petitions on Twitter and online news reports during competitions.[361] In 2006, the animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), criticized Beyoncé for wearing and using fur in her clothing line House of Deréon.[362] Emmett Price, a professor of music at Northeastern University, wrote in 2007 that he thinks race plays a role in many criticisms of Beyoncé's image, saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments.[363] In 2008, the French personal care company L'Oréal was accused of whitening her skin in their Feria hair color advertisements, responding that \"it is categorically untrue\",[364][365] and in 2013, Beyoncé herself criticized H&M for their proposed \"retouching\" of promotional images of her, and according to Vogue requested that only \"natural pictures be used\".[366] Beyoncé has been a vocal advocate for the Black Lives Matter movement. The release of \"Formation\" on February 6, 2016, saw her celebrate her Sub-Saharan Black African ancestry, with the song's music video featuring pro-black imagery and a shot of wall graffiti that says \"Stop shooting us\". The day after the song's release, she performed it at the 2016 Super Bowl halftime show with back up dancers dressed to represent the Black Panther Party. This incited criticism from conservative politicians and police officers, with some police boycotting Beyoncé's then upcoming Formation World Tour.[367] Beyoncé responded to the backlash by releasing tour merchandise that said \"Boycott Beyoncé\",[368][369][370] and later clarified her sentiment, saying: \"Anyone who perceives my message as anti-police is completely mistaken. I have so much admiration and respect for officers and the families of officers who sacrifice themselves to keep us safe,\" Beyoncé said. \"But let's be clear: I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things.\"[371] In 2002, Beyoncé and Jay-Z collaborated on the song \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\",[372] which appeared on his seventh album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002).[373] Beyoncé appeared as Jay-Z's girlfriend in the music video for the song, fueling speculation about their relationship.[374] On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé and Jay-Z married without publicity.[375] As of April 2014[update], the couple had sold a combined 300 million records together.[168] They are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed since 2013.[376] Both have acknowledged difficulty that arose in their marriage after Jay-Z had an affair.[377][378] Beyoncé miscarried around 2010 or 2011, describing it as \"the saddest thing\" she had ever endured.[379] She returned to the studio and wrote music to cope with the loss. In April 2011, Beyoncé and Jay-Z traveled to Paris to shoot the album cover for 4, and she unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris.[380] In August, the couple attended the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, at which Beyoncé performed \"Love On Top\" and ended the performance by revealing she was pregnant.[381] Her appearance helped that year's MTV Video Music Awards become the most-watched broadcast in MTV history, pulling in 12.4 million viewers;[382] the announcement was listed in Guinness World Records for \"most tweets per second recorded for a single event\" on Twitter,[383] receiving 8,868 tweets per second[384] and \"Beyonce pregnant\" was the most Googled phrase the week of August 29, 2011.[385] On January 7, 2012, Beyoncé gave birth to a daughter, Blue Ivy, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.[386] Following the release of Lemonade, which included the single \"Sorry\", in 2016, speculations arose about Jay-Z's alleged infidelity with a mistress referred to as \"Becky\". Jon Pareles in The New York Times pointed out that many of the accusations were \"aimed specifically and recognizably\" at him.[387] Similarly, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted the lines \"Suck on my balls, I've had enough\" were an \"unmistakable hint\" that the lyrics revolve around Jay-Z.[388] On February 1, 2017, she revealed on her Instagram account that she was expecting twins. Her announcement gained over 6.3 million likes within eight hours, breaking the world record for the most liked image on the website at the time.[389] On July 13, 2017, Beyoncé uploaded the first image of herself and the twins onto her Instagram account, confirming their birth date as a month prior, on June 13, 2017,[390] with the post becoming the second most liked on Instagram, behind her own pregnancy announcement.[391] The twins, a daughter named Rumi and a son named Sir, were born at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in California via caesarean section. She wrote of her pregnancy and its aftermath in the September 2018 issue of Vogue, in which she had full control of the cover, shot at Hammerwood Park by photographer Tyler Mitchell.[392][393] Beyoncé performed \"America the Beautiful\" at President Barack Obama's 2009 presidential inauguration, as well as \"At Last\" during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later.[394] The couple held a fundraiser at Jay-Z's 40/40 Club in Manhattan for President Obama's 2012 presidential campaign[395] which raised $4 million.[396] Beyoncé voted for Obama in the 2012 presidential election.[397] She performed the American national anthem \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at his second inauguration in January 2013.[147] The Washington Post reported in May 2015, that Beyoncé attended a major celebrity fundraiser for 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.[398] She also headlined for Clinton in a concert held the weekend before Election Day the next year. In this performance, Beyoncé and her entourage of backup dancers wore pantsuits; a clear allusion to Clinton's frequent dress-of-choice. The backup dancers also wore \"I'm with her\" tee shirts, the campaign slogan for Clinton. In a brief speech at this performance Beyoncé said, \"I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and knowing that her possibilities are limitless.\"[399] She endorsed the bid of Beto O'Rourke during the 2018 United States Senate election in Texas.[400] In July 2024, Beyoncé gave Vice President Kamala Harris permission to use Lemonade promotional single \"Freedom\" as the official song for her 2024 presidential campaign.[401][402] Harris subsequently launched a digital ad in support of her candidacy featuring the song.[403] In October 2024, Beyoncé, alongside her mother Tina and Kelly Rowland endorsed Harris for president at a campaign rally in her hometown of Houston.[404] In a 2013 interview with Vogue, Beyoncé stated that she considered herself to be \"a modern-day feminist\".[405] She would later align herself more publicly with the movement, sampling \"We should all be feminists\", a speech delivered by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a TEDx talk in April 2013, in her song \"Flawless\", released later that year.[406] The next year she performed live at the MTV Video Awards in front a giant backdrop reading \"Feminist\".[407] Her self-identification incited a circulation of opinions and debate about whether her feminism is aligned with older, more established feminist ideals. Annie Lennox, celebrated artist and feminist advocate, referred to Beyoncé's use of her word feminist as 'feminist lite'.[408] Adichie responded with \"her type of feminism is not mine, as it is the kind that, at the same time, gives quite a lot of space to the necessity of men.\"[409] Adichie expands upon what \"feminist lite\" means to her, referring that \"more troubling is the idea, in Feminism Lite, that men are naturally superior but should be expected to 'treat women well'\" and \"we judge powerful women more harshly than we judge powerful men. And Feminism Lite enables this.\"[410] Beyoncé responded about her intent by utilizing the definition of feminist with her platform was to \"give clarity to the true meaning\" behind it. She says to understand what being a feminist is, \"it's very simple. It's someone who believes in equal rights for men and women.\" She advocated to provide equal opportunities for young boys and girls, men and women must begin to understand the double standards that remain persistent in our societies and the issue must be illuminated in effort to start making changes.[411] She has also contributed to the Ban Bossy campaign, which uses TV and social media to encourage leadership in girls.[412] Following Beyoncé's public identification as a feminist, the sexualized nature of her performances and the fact that she championed her marriage was questioned.[413] In December 2012, Beyoncé along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for \"Demand A Plan\", a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 U.S. mayors and others[414] designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[415] Beyoncé publicly endorsed same-sex marriage on March 26, 2013, after the Supreme Court debate on California's Proposition 8.[416] She spoke against North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, a bill passed (and later repealed) that discriminated against the LGBT community in public places in a statement during her concert in Raleigh as part of the Formation World Tour in 2016.[417] She has condemned police brutality against black Americans. She and Jay-Z attended a rally in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin.[418] The film for her sixth album Lemonade included the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, holding pictures of their sons in the video for \"Freedom\".[419] In a 2016 interview with Elle, Beyoncé responded to the controversy surrounding her song \"Formation\" which was perceived to be critical of the police. She clarified, \"I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things. If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me\".[420] In February 2017, Beyoncé spoke out against the withdrawal of protections for transgender students in public schools by Donald Trump's presidential administration. Posting a link to the 100 Days of Kindness campaign on her Facebook page, Beyoncé voiced her support for transgender youth and joined a roster of celebrities who spoke out against Trump's decision.[421] Beyoncé has been documented pursuing many passions, sometimes being described as a renaissance woman.[422][423] Some of these include canvas painting,[424] video editing,[425] poetry,[426] scriptwriting,[427] lighting and stage design,[428] animation and clothes design,[429] photography,[222] cultural historiography[430] and beekeeping (with around 80,000 bees).[337] I started painting portraits of women [in 2002], while filming Austin Powers [...] I got hooked and wouldn't sleep. I made this special room with saris and pillows. I would light candles, play Miles Davis and Björk, and paint all night. It was very therapeutic. Whenever I finish one of my paintings, I try to figure out what it represents in my life. I'll be like, 'It's dark behind her and light in front of her, so a dark period must be coming to an end. Something light and beautiful is going to happen.' Forbes magazine began reporting on Beyoncé's earnings in 2008, calculating that the $80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008, for her music, tour, films and clothing line made her the world's best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion.[431][432] It placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009[433] and ninth on the \"Most Powerful Women in the World\" list in 2010.[434] The following year, the magazine placed her eighth on the \"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\" list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyoncé at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals.[435][436] In 2012, Beyoncé and Jay-Z placed at number one on the \"World's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples\", for collectively earning $78 million.[437] The couple made it into the previous year's Guinness World Records as the \"highest-earning power couple\" for collectively earning $122 million in 2009.[438] For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyoncé earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012.[439] In 2013, Beyoncé's endorsements of Pepsi and H&M made her and Jay-Z the world's first billion-dollar couple in the music industry.[440] That year, Beyoncé was listed as the fourth-most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings.[441] In June 2014, Beyoncé ranked at number one on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, earning an estimated $115 million throughout June 2013 – June 2014. This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date.[442] In 2016, Beyoncé ranked at number 34 on the Celebrity 100 list with earnings of $54 million. She and Jay-Z also topped the highest-paid celebrity couple list, with combined earnings of $107.5 million.[443] Beyoncé is one of the wealthiest musical artists. As of 2018[update], Forbes calculated her net worth to be $355 million, and in June of the same year, ranked her as the 35th-highest-earning celebrity, with annual earnings of $60 million. This tied Beyoncé with Madonna as the only two female artists to earn more than $100 million within a single year twice.[444][445] As a couple, Beyoncé and Jay-Z have a combined net worth of $1.16 billion.[446] In July 2017, Billboard announced that Beyoncé was the highest-paid musician of 2016, with an estimated total of $62.1 million.[447] By December 2023, Forbes estimated Beyoncé's net worth to be $800 million.[448] In 2023, the couple bought a house in Malibu, California, designed by the architect Tadao Ando, for $200 million. It established a record for the most expensive residence sold in the state of California.[449] Beyoncé's success has led to her becoming a cultural icon and earning her the nickname \"Queen Bey\".[450] Constance Grady wrote for Vox, \"The transformation of Beyoncé from well-liked pop star to cultural icon came in three phases, punctuated by the self-titled Beyoncé album of 2013, 2016's Lemonade, and 2018's Homecoming concert at Coachella.\"[451] In The New Yorker, music critic Jody Rosen described Beyoncé as \"the most important and compelling popular musician of the twenty-first century ... the result, the logical end point, of a century-plus of pop.\"[452] She topped NPR list of the \"21st Century's Most Influential Women Musicians\".[453] James Clear, in his book Atomic Habits (2018), draws a parallel between Beyoncé's success and the dramatic transformations in modern society: \"In the last one hundred years, we have seen the rise of the car, the airplane, the television, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone, and Beyoncé.\"[454] The Observer named her Artist of the Decade (2000s) in 2009.[455] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Alex Suskind opined that Beyoncé was the decade's (2010s) defining pop star, stating \"no one dominated music in the 2010s like Queen Bey\", explaining that her \"songs, album rollouts, stage presence, social justice initiatives, and disruptive public relations strategy have influenced the way we've viewed music since 2010.\"[456] Based on Billboard rankings of chart success and sales, Beyonce was ranked 9th on the Top R&B and Hip Hop artists of the 2010s decade chart, behind the likes of Drake, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Nicki Minaj, Post Malone, The Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar and Lil Wayne in ranks 1 through 8, respectively.[457] British publication NME also shared similar thoughts on her impact in the 2010s, including Beyoncé on their list of the \"10 Artists Who Defined The Decade\".[458] In 2018, Rolling Stone included her on its Millennial 100 list.[459] Music critics have often credited Beyoncé with the invention of the staccato rap-singing style that has since dominated pop, R&B, and rap music. Lakin Starling of The Fader wrote that Beyoncé's innovative implementation of the delivery style on Destiny's Child's 1999 album The Writing's on the Wall invented a new form of R&B.[460] The staccato rap-singing style continued to be used in the music industry in the late 2010s and early 2020s; Aaron Williams of Uproxx described Beyoncé as the \"primary pioneer\" of the rapping style that dominates the music industry today, with many rappers implementing Beyoncé's rap-singing.[461] Michael Eric Dyson agrees, saying in 2019 that Beyoncé \"changed the whole genre\" and has become the \"godmother\" of mumble rappers, who use the staccato rap-singing cadence. Dyson added: \"She doesn't get credit for the remarkable way in which she changed the musical vocabulary of contemporary art.\"[462] Beyoncé has been credited with reviving the album as an art form in an era dominated by singles and streaming. This started with her 2011 album 4; while mainstream R&B artists were forgoing albums-led R&B in favor of singles-led EDM, Beyoncé aimed to place the focus back on albums as an art form and re-establish R&B as a mainstream concern.[463] This remained a focus of Beyoncé's, and in 2013, she made her eponymous album only available to purchase as a full album on iTunes, rather than being able to purchase individual tracks or consume the album via streaming. Kaitlin Menza of Marie Claire wrote that this made listeners \"experience the album as one whole sonic experience, the way people used to, noting the musical and lyrical themes\".[464] Jamieson Cox for The Verge described how Beyoncé's 2013 album initiated a gradual trend of albums becoming more cohesive and self-referential, and this phenomenon reached its endpoint with Lemonade, which set \"a new standard for pop storytelling at the highest possible scale\".[465] Megan Carpentier of The Guardian wrote that with Lemonade, Beyoncé has \"almost revived the album format\" by releasing an album that can only be listened to in its entirety.[466] Myf Warhurst on Double J's \"Lunch With Myf\" explained that while most artists' albums consist of a few singles plus filler songs, Beyoncé \"brought the album back\", changing the art form of the album \"to a narrative with an arc and a story and you have to listen to the entire thing to get the concept\".[467] She is known for coining popular phrases such as \"put a ring on it\", a euphemism for marriage proposal, \"I woke up like this\", which started a trend of posting morning selfies with the hashtag #iwokeuplikethis, and \"boy, bye\", which was used as part of the Democratic National Committee's campaign for the 2020 election.[468][469] Similarly, she also came up with the phrase \"visual album\" following the release of her fifth studio album, which had a video for every song. This has been recreated by many other artists since, such as Frank Ocean and Melanie Martinez.[470] The album also popularized surprise releases, with many artists releasing songs, videos or albums with no prior announcement, such as Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, Eminem, Frank Ocean, Jay-Z and Drake.[471] In January 2012, research scientist Bryan Lessard named Scaptia beyonceae, a species of horse-fly found in Northern Queensland, Australia after Beyoncé due to the fly's unique golden hairs on its abdomen.[472] Beyoncé has received numerous awards and is the most-awarded female artist of all time.[473] Having sold over 200 million records worldwide (a further 60 million additionally with Destiny's Child), Beyoncé is one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[474] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) listed Beyoncé as the top certified artist of the 2000s decade, with a total of 64 certifications.[475][476] In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Female Artist and Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade.[477][478][479] In 2010, Billboard named her in their Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years list at number 15.[480] In 2012, VH1 ranked her third on their list of the \"100 Greatest Women in Music\", behind Mariah Carey and Madonna.[481] In 2002, she received Songwriter of the Year from American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers becoming the First African American woman to win the award. In 2004 and 2019, she received NAACP Image Award for Entertainer of the Year and the Soul Train Music Award for Sammy Davis Jr. – Entertainer of the Year. In 2005, she also received APEX Award at the Trumpet Award honoring the achievements of Black African Americans. In 2007, Beyoncé received the International Artist of Excellence award by the American Music Awards. She also received Honorary Otto at the Bravo Otto. The following year, she received the Legend Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Arts at the World Music Awards[482] and Career Achievement Award at the LOS40 Music Awards. In 2010, she received the Award of Honor for Artist of the Decade at the NRJ Music Award.[483] At the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, Beyoncé received the inaugural Billboard Millennium Award.[484] Beyoncé received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards and was honored as Honorary Mother of the Year at the Australian Mother of the Year Award in Barnardo's Australia for her Humanitarian Effort in the region and the Council of Fashion Designers of America Fashion Icon Award in 2016. In 2019, alongside Jay-Z, she received GLAAD Vanguard Award which is presented to a member of the entertainment community who does not identify as LGBT but who has made a significant difference in promoting equal rights for LGBT people.[485] In 2020, she was awarded the BET Humanitarian Award. Consequence named her the 30th best singer of all time.[486] Beyoncé has won 32 Grammy Awards, both as a solo artist and member of Destiny's Child and The Carters, making her the most honored individual by the Grammys.[487][488] She is also the most nominated artist in Grammy Award history with a total of 88 nominations.[489] \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" won Song of the Year in 2010 while \"Say My Name\",[47] \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Drunk in Love\" have each won Best R&B Song. Dangerously in Love, B'Day and I Am... Sasha Fierce have won Best Contemporary R&B Album, while Lemonade has won Best Urban Contemporary Album. Beyoncé set the record for the most Grammy awards won by a female artist in one night in 2010 when she won six awards, breaking the tie she previously held with Alicia Keys, Norah Jones, Alison Krauss, and Amy Winehouse, with Adele equaling this in 2012.[490] Beyoncé has won 30 MTV Video Music Awards, making her the joint most-decorated artist in Video Music Award history.[491] She won 26 awards as a solo artist, two awards each with The Carters and Destiny's Child, making her lifetime total of 30 VMAs.[492] \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and \"Formation\" won Video of the Year in 2009 and 2016 respectively. Beyoncé tied the record set by Lady Gaga in 2010 for the most VMAs won in one night for a female artist with eight in 2016.[188] She is also the most-awarded and nominated artist in BET Award history,[493] winning 36 awards (including two with Destiny's Child) from over 80 nominations,[494] the most-awarded artist of the Soul Train Music Awards with 25 wins (21 as a soloist and four with Destiny's child),[495] and the most-decorated artist at the NAACP Image Awards with 25 wins as a solo artist and five with Destiny's Child.[496][497] Following her role in Dreamgirls, Beyoncé was nominated for Best Original Song for \"Listen\" and Best Actress at the Golden Globe Awards,[498] and Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture at the NAACP Image Awards.[499] Beyoncé won two awards at the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards 2006; Best Song for \"Listen\" and Best Original Soundtrack for Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture.[500] According to Fuse in 2014, Beyoncé is the second-most award-winning artist of all time, after Michael Jackson.[501][502] Lemonade won a Peabody Award in 2017.[503] In 2022, \"Be Alive\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song,[504] the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Song,[505] and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.[506] She was named on the 2016 BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour Power List as one of seven women judged to have had the biggest impact on women's lives over the past 70 years, alongside Margaret Thatcher, Barbara Castle, Helen Brook, Germaine Greer, Jayaben Desai and Bridget Jones,[507] She was named the Most Powerful Woman in Music on the same list in 2020.[508] In the same year, Billboard named her with Destiny's Child the third Greatest Music Video artists of all time, behind Madonna and Michael Jackson.[509] In June 2021, Beyoncé won the award of \"top touring artist\" of the decade (2010s) at the Pollstar Awards.[510] In that same month, Beyoncé was inducted into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame as a member of the inaugural class.[511] In 2010, Beyoncé founded her own entertainment company Parkwood Entertainment which formed as an imprint based from Columbia Records, the company began as a production unit for videos and films in 2008. Parkwood Entertainment is named after a street in Houston, Texas where Beyoncé once lived.[512] With headquarters in New York City, the company serves as an umbrella for the entertainer's various brands in music, movies, videos, and fashion. The staff of Parkwood Entertainment have experiences in arts and entertainment, from filmmaking and video production to web and fashion design. In addition to departments in marketing, digital, creative, publicity, fashion design and merchandising, the company houses a state-of-the-art editing suite, where Beyoncé works on content for her worldwide tours, music videos, and television specials. Parkwood Entertainment's first production was the musical biopic Cadillac Records (2008), in which Beyoncé starred and co-produced.[513] The company has distributed Beyoncé's albums such as her self-titled fifth studio album (2013), Lemonade (2016) and The Carters, Everything is Love (2018). Beyoncé has signed other artists to Parkwood such as Chloe x Halle, who performed at Super Bowl LIII in February 2019.[514] In February 2024, Beyoncé launched Cécred, a hair care product line developed to fit different hair textures.[255] Following its launch, she established an annual grant in collaboration with BeyGood. This is an effort to provide financial support to cosmetology students and professional hair stylists within the beauty industry.[515] A yearly $500,000 is funding cosmetology school scholarships and salon business grants across five cities chosen for their large, diverse community of hair stylists: Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and Clementon.[c][516] Beyoncé has worked with Pepsi since 2002,[517] and in 2004 appeared in a Gladiator-themed commercial with Britney Spears, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias.[518] In 2012, Beyoncé signed a $50 million deal to endorse Pepsi.[519] The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPINET) wrote Beyoncé an open letter asking her to reconsider the deal because of the unhealthiness of the product and to donate the proceeds to a medical organisation.[520] Nevertheless, NetBase found that Beyoncé's campaign was the most talked about endorsement in April 2013, with a 70 percent positive audience response to the commercial and print ads.[521] Beyoncé has worked with Tommy Hilfiger for the fragrances True Star (singing a cover version of \"Wishing on a Star\")[522] and True Star Gold;[523] she also promoted Emporio Armani's Diamonds fragrance in 2007.[524] Beyoncé launched her first official fragrance, Heat, in 2010.[525] In February 2011, Beyoncé launched her second fragrance, Heat Rush.[526] Beyoncé's third fragrance, Pulse, was launched in September 2011.[527] In 2013, The Mrs. Carter Show Limited Edition version of Heat was released.[528] The six editions of Heat are the world's best-selling celebrity fragrance line,[528] with sales of over $400 million.[529] The release of a video-game Starpower: Beyoncé was cancelled after Beyoncé pulled out of a $100 million deal with GateFive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development.[530] It was settled out of court by her lawyers in June 2013 who said that they had cancelled because GateFive had lost its financial backers.[531] Beyoncé also has had deals with American Express,[432] Nintendo DS[532] and L'Oréal since the age of 18.[533] In March 2015, Beyoncé became a co-owner, with other artists, of the music streaming service Tidal. The service specializes in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Beyoncé's husband Jay-Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015.[534] Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake.[535] The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.[536] In November 2020, Beyoncé formed a multi-year partnership with exercise equipment and media company Peloton. The partnership was formed to celebrate homecoming season in historically black colleges and universities, providing themed workout experiences inspired by Beyoncé's 2019 Homecoming film and live album after 2020's homecoming celebrations were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the partnership, Beyoncé and Peloton are donating free memberships to all students at 10 HBCUs, and Peloton are pursuing long-term recruiting partnerships at the HCBUs. Gwen Bethel Riley, head of music at Peloton, said: \"When we had conversations with Beyoncé around how critical a social impact component was to all of us, it crystallized how important it was to embrace Homecoming as an opportunity to celebrate and create dialogue around Black culture and music, in partnership with HBCUs.\"[537] Upon news of the partnership, a decline in Peloton's shares reversed, and its shares rose by 8.6%.[538] In 2021, Beyoncé and Jay-Z partnered with Tiffany & Co. for the company's \"About Love\" campaign. Beyoncé became the fourth woman, and first Black woman, to wear the 128.54-carat Tiffany Yellow Diamond.[539] The campaign featured a robin egg blue painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat titled Equals Pi (1982).[540] Both Beyonce and the brand faced significant backlash for the campaign, as the Tiffany Yellow Diamond, which was discovered in the Kimberley diamond mines in South Africa in 1877, is classified as a blood diamond and viewed as a symbol of British colonialism over Africa.[541][542][543] Beyoncé and her mother introduced House of Deréon, a women's fashion line, in 2005.[544] The concept is inspired by three generations of women in their family, with the name paying tribute to Beyoncé's grandmother, Agnèz Deréon, a respected seamstress.[545][546] According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé's taste and style. Beyoncé and her mother founded their family's company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing and brand management for House of Deréon, and its junior collection, Deréon.[544] House of Deréon pieces were exhibited in Destiny's Child's shows and tours, during their Destiny Fulfilled era.[547][548] The collection features sportswear, denim offerings with fur, outerwear and accessories that include handbags and footwear, and are available at department and specialty stores across the U.S. and Canada.[544] In 2005, Beyoncé teamed up with House of Brands, a shoe company, to produce a range of footwear for House of Deréon.[549] In January 2008, Starwave Mobile launched Beyoncé Fashion Diva, a \"high-style\" mobile game with a social networking component, featuring the House of Deréon collection.[544] In July 2009, Beyoncé and her mother launched a new junior apparel label, Sasha Fierce for Deréon, for back-to-school selling. The collection included sportswear, outerwear, handbags, footwear, eyewear, lingerie and jewelry.[550] It was available at department stores including Macy's and Dillard's, and specialty stores Jimmy Jazz and Against All Odds.[550] In May 2010, Beyoncé teamed up with clothing store C&A to launch Deréon by Beyoncé at their stores in Brazil.[551] The collection included tailored blazers with padded shoulders, little black dresses, embroidered tops and shirts and bandage dresses.[551] In October 2014, Beyoncé signed a deal to launch an activewear line of clothing with British fashion retailer Topshop.[552][553] The 50–50 venture is called Ivy Park and was launched in April 2016. The brand's name is a nod to Beyoncé's daughter and her favorite number four (IV in Roman numerals), and also references the park where she used to run in Texas.[554] She has since bought out Topshop owner Philip Green from his 50% share after he was alleged to have sexually harassed, bullied and racially abused employees.[555] She now owns the brand herself.[556] In April 2019, it was announced that Beyoncé would become a creative partner with Adidas and further develop her athletic brand Ivy Park with the company. Knowles will also develop new clothes and footwear for Adidas. Shares for the company rose 1.3% upon the news release.[557] In December 2019, they announced a launch date of January 18, 2020.[558] Beyoncé uploaded a teaser on her website and Instagram.[559] The collection was previewed on the upcoming Elle January 2020 issue, where Beyoncé is seen wearing several garments, accessories and footwear from the first collection.[560] In February 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that the line was struggling financially with revenue falling by more than 50% over the past fiscal year to $40 million; well short of the company's $250 million projected forecast.[561] In March 2023, it was announced that Beyoncé and Adidas reached a mutual decision to end their partnership.[562][563] In March 2023, Olivier Rousteing, the creative director of Balmain, announced that he and Beyoncé collaborated on a couture collection complete with sixteen looks corresponding to the sixteen tracks on her album Renaissance. This \"Renaissance Couture\" collection marked the first time that a Black woman oversaw the development of a collection from a Parisian couture house.[564] In September 2024, Beyoncé partnered with Levi Strauss & Co. to remake a classic '80s 'Launderette' campaign.[565] Michelle Gass, the CEO of Levis Strauss & Co., shared insights regarding the advantages of the company's collaboration with Beyoncé, emphasizing that the advertising campaign could significantly enhance sales in the women's clothing segment.[566] In 2002, Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Tina Knowles built the Knowles-Rowland Center for Youth, a community center in Downtown Houston. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Beyoncé and Rowland founded the Survivor Foundation to provide transitional housing to displaced families and provide means for new building construction, to which Beyoncé contributed an initial $250,000.[567] The foundation has since expanded to work with other charities in the city,[568] and also provided relief following Hurricane Ike three years later.[569] Beyoncé also donated $100,000 to the Gulf Coast Ike Relief Fund.[570] In 2007, Beyoncé founded the Knowles-Temenos Place Apartments, a housing complex offering living space for 43 displaced individuals. As of 2016, Beyoncé had donated $7 million for the maintenance of the complex.[571] After starring in Cadillac Records in 2009 and learning about Phoenix House, a non-profit drug and alcohol rehabilitation organization, Beyoncé donated her full $4 million salary from the film to the organization. Beyoncé and her mother subsequently established the Beyoncé Cosmetology Center, which offers a seven-month cosmetology training course helping Phoenix House's clients gain career skills during their recovery.[572] In January 2010, Beyoncé participated in George Clooney and Wyclef Jean's Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief telethon,[573] donated a large sum to the organization,[574] and was named the official face of the limited edition Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) \"Fashion For Haiti\" T-shirt.[575] In April 2011, Beyoncé joined forces with U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama and the National Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation, to help boost the latter's campaign against child obesity[576] by reworking her single \"Get Me Bodied\".[577] Following the death of Osama bin Laden, Beyoncé released her cover of the Lee Greenwood song \"God Bless the U.S.A.\", as a charity single to help raise funds for the New York Police and Fire Widows' and Children's Benefit Fund.[578] Beyoncé became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song \"I Was Here\" and its music video, shot in the UN, to the campaign.[579][580] In 2013, it was announced that Beyoncé would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci \"Chime for Change\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music.[581] A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013, in London.[582] With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls.[583][584] Beyoncé also took part in \"Miss a Meal\", a food-donation campaign,[585] and supported Goodwill Industries through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S.[586][587] Beyoncé and Jay-Z secretly donated tens of thousands of dollars to bail out Black Lives Matter protesters in Baltimore and Ferguson, as well as funded infrastructure for the establishment of Black Lives Matter chapters across the U.S.[588] Before Beyoncé's Formation World Tour show in Tampa, her team held a private luncheon for more than 20 community leaders to discuss how Beyoncé could support local charitable initiatives, including pledging on the spot to fund 10 scholarships to provide students with financial aid. Tampa Sports Authority board member Thomas Scott said: \"I don't know of a prior artist meeting with the community, seeing what their needs are, seeing how they can invest in the community. It says a lot to me about Beyoncé. She not only goes into a community and walks away with (money), but she also gives money back to that community.\"[589] In June 2016, Beyoncé donated over $82,000 to the United Way of Genesee County to support victims of the Flint water crisis. Beyoncé additionally donated money to support 14 students in Michigan with their college expenses.[590] In August 2016, Beyoncé and Jay-Z donated $1.5 million to civil rights groups including Black Lives Matter, Hands Up United and Dream Defenders.[591] After Hurricane Matthew, Beyoncé and Jay-Z donated $15 million to the Usain Bolt Foundation to support its efforts in rebuilding homes in Haiti.[592] During Hurricane Harvey in August 2017, Beyoncé launched BeyGOOD Houston to support those affected by the hurricane in Houston. The organization donated necessities such as cots, blankets, pillows, baby products, feminine products and wheelchairs, and funded long-term revitalization projects.[593] On September 8, Beyoncé visited Houston, where she sponsored a lunch for 400 survivors at her local church, visited the George R Brown Convention Center to discuss with people displaced by the flooding about their needs, served meals to those who lost their homes, and made a significant donation to local causes.[594][595] Beyoncé additionally donated $75,000 worth of new mattresses to survivors of the hurricane.[596] Later that month, Beyoncé released a remix of J Balvin and Willy William's \"Mi Gente\", with all of her proceeds being donated to disaster relief charities in Puerto Rico, Mexico, the U.S. and the Caribbean after hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the Chiapas and Puebla earthquakes.[597] In April 2020, Beyoncé donated $6 million to the National Alliance in Mental Health, UCLA and local community-based organizations in order to provide mental health and personal wellness services to essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. BeyGOOD also teamed up with local organizations to help provide resources to communities of color, including food, water, cleaning supplies, medicines and face masks.[598] The same month Beyoncé released a remix of Megan Thee Stallion's \"Savage\", with all proceeds benefiting Bread of Life Houston's COVID-19 relief efforts, which includes providing over 14 tons of food and supplies to 500 families and 100 senior citizens in Houston weekly.[599] In May 2020, Beyoncé provided 1,000 free COVID-19 tests in Houston as part of her and her mother's #IDidMyPart initiative, which was established due to the disproportionate deaths in African-American communities. Additionally, 1,000 gloves, masks, hot meals, essential vitamins, grocery vouchers and household items were provided.[600] In July 2020, Beyoncé established the Black-Owned Small Business Impact Fund in partnership with the NAACP, which offers $10,000 grants to black-owned small businesses in need following the George Floyd protests.[601] All proceeds from Beyoncé's single \"Black Parade\" were donated to the fund.[602] In September 2020, Beyoncé announced that she had donated an additional $1 million to the fund.[603] As of December 31, 2020, the fund had given 715 grants to black-owned small businesses, amounting to $7.15 million donated.[604] In October 2020, Beyoncé released a statement that she has been working with the Feminist Coalition to assist supporters of the End SARS movement in Nigeria, including covering medical costs for injured protestors, covering legal fees for arrested protestors, and providing food, emergency shelter, transportation and telecommunication means to those in need.

                "content": "Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (bee-YON-say) (born September 4, 1981), known mononymously as Beyoncé, is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, businesswoman, dancer and model. She is known as a lead singer of female R&B group Destiny's Child. She released her first solo album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003, when Destiny's Child was on a break. Since then, she has released six more albums, which have all produced hit singles. She has sold over 250 million records worldwide as a solo artist, and as the lead singer of the world's best-selling female group of all time, selling over 100 million records worldwide. She is the most awarded musicians in Grammys of all time, with 32 wins during her career, as well as her nominations.[6][7] Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born at Park Plaza Hospital in Houston, Texas.[8] Her mother is Tina Knowles (née Beyincé; currently Lawson) and has Creole descent, which means she has some African and French roots. Her father is Mathew Knowles, who is African American. Knowles went to several performing arts schools, and took part in singing and dancing competitions as a child. Her younger sister, Solange, is also a musician. In her youth, she started the girl group Girls Tyme. Her father Mathew became her manager. Knowles became very famous in the late 1990s. She became the lead singer of the R&B girl group Destiny's Child. The group became the world's best-selling girl group of all time, selling over 85 million records worldwide. Destiny's Child took a break from recording music. Knowles released her solo debut album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003. Two singles from the album—\"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\"—reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The album became one of the most successful albums of that year. Dangerously in Love was given five Grammy Awards. After Destiny's Child split, Knowles released her second album. B'Day was released in 2006, and its singles \"Déjà Vu\", \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Beautiful Liar\" reached the top ten in the United States. Her third album I Am... Sasha Fierce was released in 2008. \"If I Were a Boy\", \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", \"Halo\" and \"Sweet Dreams\" became hit singles for Knowles. \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" became another number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. The album earned six Grammys in 2010, the most Grammys won by a woman in one night. Only Adele would do this again at the 2012 Grammys. Her next album, 4 (2011), became her fourth number one album on the Billboard 200 chart. She became the third artist in history to have her first four albums debut at number one. Beyoncé released her fifth album Beyoncé on iTunes on December 13, 2013. The public did not know about the album before it was released. The album has fourteen songs and 17 videos.[9] It has been given good reviews. It entered the Billboard 200 at number one. This made her the first female artist in the history of the chart to have her first five albums enter the chart at the top.[10] Knowles performed \"Drunk in Love\" with JAY-Z at the 2014 Grammy Awards. She was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Part II (On the Run)\" with JAY-Z.[11] In February 2016, Beyoncé was a guest performer at Super Bowl 50. She performed \"Formation\", the lead single from her sixth studio album, Lemonade. The performance was controversial, as it had elements of the #BlackLivesMatter movement along with influences from the Black Panthers.[12] She announced The Formation World Tour in a commercial after the Super Bowl performance. In April 2016, an hour-long film, Lemonade, was shown on HBO. After the film aired, the Lemonade album was released. The album became her best-reviewed of her career. It entered the charts at number one in the US and Canada. Lemonade features the singles \"Formation\", \"Sorry\", and \"Hold Up\". It won the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album in 2017, while the music video for \"Formation\" won the award for Best Music Video. In 2017, Beyoncé released the promotional single \"Die with You\". She later contributed to the remix of \"Mi Gente\" by J Balvin and Willy William. This caused the song to jump to number three on the Billboard Hot 100. On December 1, 2017, an acoustic duet between Beyoncé and Ed Sheeran of Sheeran's song \"Perfect\" was released and was at the top of the iTunes charts in 32 countries.[13] The song became Beyoncé's sixth US number-one as a solo artist and her tenth number-one song in the US including songs with Destiny's Child. Knowles was featured on a remix of rapper Megan Thee Stallion's song \"Savage\"; it became Knowles’ seventh number-one song in the US.[14] On June 20, 2022, she released \"Break My Soul\", the lead single from her seventh studio album, Renaissance and the album was released on July 29, 2022. \"Break My Soul\" became her eighth solo US number-one (twelfth overall), while the album's next single, \"Cuff It\", reached number ten on the Hot 100.[15] Knowles has a three octave mezzo-soprano vocal range. Other sources state that she possesses a contralto vocal range at age of 30s. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\". Jody Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Knowles' unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Her first role in a movie was for the musical Carmen: A Hip Hopera (2001). Her first major movie was Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002). The movie Dreamgirls (2006) was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards. Her other movies Cadillac Records (2008) and Obsessed (2009) did not do so well. In 2019, she starred as Nala in the 2019 drama-live action remake The Lion King. In 2005, Knowles and her mother created a fashion line called House of Deréon. In 2016, she also introduced a fitness-wear collection called Ivy Park.[16] In 2010, she released her first perfume which she called Heat. In 2013, Knowles became H&M's new swimwear model since she gave birth to her daughter Blue Ivy just a year prior. She became a spokesperson for L'Oréal, Pepsi, Tommy Hilfiger, Nintendo, and Vizio. In 2010, Knowles was ranked first on Forbes list of the \"100 Most Powerful and Influential Musicians in the World\",[17] and second on its list of the \"100 Most Powerful and Influential Celebrities in the World\".[18] In 2012, she was named \"World's Most Beautiful Woman\" by People magazine.[19] Many of Knowles' recordings and movies were given many nominations, with many winning them. These include 32 Grammy Awards, 24 [MTV Video Music Awards], three [American Music Awards], a Billboard Millennium Award, and a star on the [Hollywood Walk of Fame] with Destiny's Child. In 2009, [Billboard (magazine)|Billboard] named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the 2000s decade. They also ranked her 4th for Artist of the Decade.[20][21] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), named Knowles as the Top Certified Artist of the 2000s.[22][23] In the US, she has sold over 17 million copies as of May 2014. She has sold more than 30.4 million digital singles as of January 2012.[24] Worldwide, she has sold 245 million records. This makes her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[25] Knowles appeared on [VH1]'s 2010 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".[26] They ranked her third on their \"100 Greatest Women in Music\" list in 2012. In 2000, Knowles met Jay-Z and proposed her on his 38th birthday on December 4, 2007. The couple married on April 4, 2008. On January 7, 2012, she gave birth to their first daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, via natural birth in Lennox Hill Hospital, New York. Knowles is a feminist. In the February 2013 issue of GQ magazine she said, \"You know, equality is a myth, and for some reason, everyone accepts the fact that women don’t make as much money as men do. I don’t understand that. Why do we have to take a backseat? I truly believe that women should be financially independent from their men. And let’s face it, money gives men the power to run the show. It gives men the power to define value. They define what’s sexy. And men define what’s feminine. It’s ridiculous.\"[27] Knowles joined the Ban Bossy campaign in 2014.[28] In December 2013, it was revealed that she and her husband Jay-Z were longtime vegans.[29] She wrote the foreword to the book The 22-Day Revolution by trainer Marco Borges, which was released in April 2015.[30] On February 1, 2017, Knowles announced via Instagram that she was expecting twins.[31] She gave birth to a daughter, Rumi and a son, Sir on June 13, 2017 via cesarean section.[32][33]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Beyoncé and her husband, JAY-Z (Shawn Carter), have three children. Their eldest daughter was born in 2012 and is named Blue Ivy. Their twins, a boy and a girl, were born in 2017 and are named Sir and Rumi, respectively. Beyoncé achieved fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the R&B group Destiny’s Child and then launched a hugely successful solo career. Her hit solo albums included Dangerously in Love (2003), B’Day (2006), I Am…Sasha Fierce (2008), 4 (2011), Beyoncé (2013), and Lemonade (2016). By 2019 Beyoncé had won 23 Grammy Awards and was the most-nominated female artist in Grammy history, with 62 nominations. She first won the award as a member of the R&B group Destiny’s Child in 2000. Beyoncé (born September 4, 1981, Houston, Texas, U.S.) is an American singer-songwriter and actress who achieved fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the R&B group Destiny’s Child and then launched a hugely successful solo career. In 2023 she broke the record for most Grammy Awards won by an artist, with 32 Grammy wins over the course of her career. Beyoncé was born Beyoncé Giselle Knowles to Tina (née Beyoncé) and Mathew Knowles (divorced 2011). She has a younger sister, Solange, who also became a successful recording artist. At age nine Beyoncé formed the singing-rapping girl group Destiny’s Child (originally called Girl’s Tyme) in 1990 with childhood friends. In 1992 the group lost on the Star Search television talent show, and three years later it was dropped from a recording contract before an album had been released. In 1997 Destiny’s Child’s fortunes reversed with a Columbia recording contract and then an eponymous debut album that yielded the hit single “No, No, No Part 2.” Its follow-up album, The Writing’s on the Wall (1999), earned the group two Grammy Awards and sold more than eight million copies in the United States. Survivor (2001), the group’s third album, reached the number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart. By this time the group’s lineup, which had seen several personnel changes, was composed of Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams. With her powerful voice and charisma, Beyoncé was clearly the leader of the group and wrote hit songs for Destiny’s Child, such as the saucy “Bootylicious.” Eventually, the group parted ways to pursue individual projects. Beyoncé used her songwriting talents to pen her first solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003). The album debuted to rave reviews, and, aided by the exuberant single “Crazy in Love,” which features rapper Jay-Z, it topped charts around the world. In 2004 Beyoncé won five Grammy Awards, including best contemporary R&B album and best female R&B vocal performance. Destiny’s Child reunited in 2004 to release Destiny Fulfilled. While generally not as acclaimed as the group’s previous efforts, the album sold more than seven million copies worldwide and spawned several hit singles. The trio embarked on a world tour in 2005, during which they announced that the group would officially disband. That same year they released #1’s, a collection of well-known songs and number one hits. In 2006 Beyoncé released her second solo studio album, B’Day, which features several coproducers, including the hit-making duo the Neptunes. Although much of the album carried echoes of 1970s-style funk, the pop ballad “Irreplaceable” became its most successful single. In 2008 she and Jay-Z married, and the union made them one of the top-earning couples in the entertainment industry. Later that year Beyoncé released the double album I Am…Sasha Fierce. Whereas the first half (I Am) captures an introspective mood, the second (Sasha Fierce) contains songs better suited to the dance floor. The album as a whole generated several hits, including the assertive “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),” and it contributed to Beyoncé’s dominance of the 2010 Grammy Awards. Her six awards, which included those for song of the year, best female pop vocal performance, and best contemporary R&B album, amounted to the most Grammys collected by a female artist in a single night. (The record was matched by pop singer Adele in 2012.) Days after a triumphant headlining performance at England’s Glastonbury Festival, Beyoncé released 4 (2011), a genre-bending mix of ballads and dance tracks that evokes influences ranging from Motown-era torch songs to the audio collages of rapper M.I.A. In early 2013 Destiny’s Child reunited for a halftime appearance at the Super Bowl and released a new song, “Nuclear.” Shortly thereafter Beyoncé collected a Grammy for her single “Love on Top.” She returned later in the year with the confidently sensuous and expressive Beyoncé, which boasts brand-name producers and appearances from, among others, the Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and the singer’s toddler daughter, Blue Ivy. The record, initially offered exclusively on iTunes, was promoted as a “visual album,” with music videos made to accompany each track. The single “Drunk in Love,” which features Jay-Z, was awarded several Grammys, including best R&B song. On the expansive and musically variegated Lemonade (2016), Beyoncé focused on themes of betrayal and perseverance. Conceived as another visual album, it debuted as an HBO television special. Lemonade attracted considerable acclaim, and it netted Beyoncé two Grammys, including a best music-video award for the anthemic “Formation.” In 2018 Beyoncé and Jay-Z released a collaborative album, Everything Is Love, credited to the Carters, and it took the Grammy for best urban contemporary album. That same year Beyoncé became the first Black woman to headline the Coachella Valley Festival in Indio, California. Her highly acclaimed performance, which featured marching bands from historically Black colleges, was the subject of Homecoming, a Netflix documentary and live album released in 2019. Although Beyoncé worked on a number of projects between studio albums, fans were left waiting for a new solo album. In 2022 she finally delivered with act i: RENAISSANCE. It received four Grammys, including best dance/electronic music album, and with those awards, Beyoncé surpassed classical music conductor Georg Solti for the most Grammy wins (32). Her world concert tour in 2023 broke the record, previously held by Madonna, for the highest grossing concert tour by a female artist. It also broke the record for the highest grossing tour of all time, until it was surpassed by Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, which began in 2023. In February 2024 Beyoncé appeared in a commercial during the Super Bowl telecast to announce that she was releasing new music. Immediately after the game, she dropped two singles, “Texas Hold ’Em” and “16 Carriages,” on the music streaming service Tidal. Both songs feature a country music sound, leading her fans to guess that her new album, which she teased right after the Super Bowl on her Instagram page, would be a country album. The following month she revealed the album’s name, Cowboy Carter, confirming her fans’ guess. In the meantime, “Texas Hold ’Em” went to number one on the Billboard country chart, marking the first time in history that a Black woman had topped that chart. It was not her first foray into country music; in 2016 she performed her song “Daddy Lessons” with the Dixie Chicks (now known as the Chicks) at the Country Music Awards. In another Instagram post, Beyoncé revealed that the backlash she received after that performance spurred her to “dive into the history of Country music” as a future project. She also asserted, “This ain’t a Country album. This is a ‘Beyoncé album.’ ” The album’s release in late March prompted a long-overdue discourse about the African American roots of country music. Cowboy Carter’s impressive roster of guest artists includes singers Miley Cyrus and Linda Martell, folk musician Rhiannon Giddens, and singer-songwriters Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson. Parton’s classic song “Jolene” is reimagined with new lyrics by Beyoncé, and country singer Tanner Adell is among several vocalists who join in on a cover of the Beatles’ “Blackbird.” In 2001 Beyoncé made her acting debut in the television movie Carmen: A Hip Hopera, which aired on MTV. Her role as Foxxy Cleopatra in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) made her a film star and led to parts in The Fighting Temptations (2003) and The Pink Panther (2006). In 2006 she played Deena Jones in Dreamgirls, the film adaptation of the 1981 Broadway musical about a 1960s singing group. Beyoncé’s performance was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and her song “Listen” for an Academy Award. She later starred in Cadillac Records (2008), in which she portrayed singer Etta James, and the thriller Obsessed (2009) before providing the voice of a fairylike forest queen in the animated Epic (2013). For the 2019 remake of Disney’s The Lion King, Beyoncé voiced the character of Nala and performed several songs on the soundtrack, including “Spirit,” an original song she cowrote, and a rendition of “Can You Feel the Love Tonight.” She also concurrently released an album inspired by the movie, The Lion King: The Gift. Songs from that record were later featured in the visual album Black Is King (2020), which aired on the streaming service Disney+. For the single “Black Parade,” Beyoncé earned the Grammy for best R&B performance in 2021. That year she received three other awards to set the record for most Grammys (28) won by a female artist, surpassing bluegrass musician and singer Alison Krauss. Beyoncé later cowrote and performed “Be Alive” for the film King Richard (2021), and it received an Oscar nomination for best original song.",

            {
                "title": "Nosferatu (word) - Wikipedia",
                "content": "\"Nosferatu\" has been presented as an archaic Romanian word[1] synonymous with \"vampire\". It was largely popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Western fiction such as the gothic novel Dracula (1897) and the German expressionist film Nosferatu (1922). One of the suggested etymologies of the term is that it is derived from the Romanian Nesuferitu (\"the offensive one\" or \"the insufferable one\"). The etymology of the word nosferatu is undetermined. There is no doubt that it achieved currency through Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula and its unauthorised first cinematic adaptation, Nosferatu (1922). Stoker identified his source for the term as 19th-century British author and speaker Emily Gerard. It is commonly thought that Gerard introduced the word into print in an 1885 magazine article, \"Transylvanian Superstitions\",[2] and in her travelogue The Land Beyond the Forest[3] (\"Transylvania\" is Latin for \"[the land] across/beyond the forest\"). She merely refers to \"Nosferatu\" as the Romanian word for vampire:[4] More decidedly evil, however, is the vampire, or nosferatu, in which every Romanian peasant believes as firmly as he does in heaven or hell. There are two sorts of vampires-—living and dead. The living vampire is in general the illegitimate offspring of two illegitimate persons, but even a flawless pedigree will not ensure anyone against the intrusion of a vampire into his family vault, since every person killed by a nosferatu becomes likewise a vampire after death, and will continue to suck the blood of other innocent people till the spirit has been exorcised, either by opening the grave of the person suspected and driving a stake through the corpse, or firing a pistol shot into the coffin. In very obstinate cases it is further recommended to cut off the head and replace it in the coffin with the mouth filled with garlic, or to extract the heart and burn it, strewing the ashes over the grave.[2] However, the word had already appeared in an 1865 German-language article by Wilhelm Schmidt.[5] Schmidt's article discusses Transylvanian customs and appeared in an Austro-Hungarian magazine, which Gerard could have encountered as a reviewer of German literature living in Austria-Hungary. Schmidt's article also mentions the legendary Scholomance by name, which parallels Gerard's \"Transylvanian Superstitions\".[2] Schmidt does not identify the language explicitly, but he puts the word nosferatu in a typeface which indicates it to be a language other than German. Schmidt's description is unambiguous in identifying nosferatu as a \"Vampyr\". At this point, I come to the vampire – nosferatu. It is this, the illegitimate offspring of two illegitimately begotten people or the unfortunate spirit of one killed by a vampire, who can appear in the form of dog, cat, toad, frog, louse, flea, bug, in any form, in short, and plays his evil tricks on newly engaged couples as incubus or succubus – zburatorul – by name, just like the Old Slavonic or Bohemian Blkodlak [sic], Vukodlak or Polish Mora and Russian Kikimora. That which was believed about this and used as a defense[6] more than 100 years ago is still true today, and there can hardly dare to be a village which would not be in a position to present a personal experience or at least hearsay with firm conviction of the veracity.[7] Schmidt expanded on his 1865 article in an 1866 monograph, adding the observation that the vampire was the \"uncanniest spawn of national-slavic fantasy\" and that his description was the Romanian perception.[8] However, nosferatu in that form does not appear to be a standard word in any known historical phase of Romanian (aside from that introduced by the novel and the films).[9] Internal evidence in Dracula suggests that Stoker believed the term meant \"not dead\" in Romanian, and thus he may have intended the word undead to be its calque.[10] Peter Haining identifies an earlier source for nosferatu as Roumanian Superstitions (1861) by Heinrich von Wlislocki.[11] However, Wlislocki seems only to have written in German, and according to the Magyar Néprajzi Lexikon, Wlislocki was born in 1856 (d. 1907), which makes his authorship of an English-titled 1861 source doubtful. Certain details of Haining's citation also conflict with David J. Skal,[9] so this citation seems unreliable. Skal identifies a similar reference to the word \"nosferat\" in an article by Wlislocki dating from 1896.[12] Since this postdates Gerard and has a number of parallels to Gerard's work, Skal considers it likely that Wlislocki is derivative from Gerard. There is also evidence to suggest that Haining derived his citation for Roumanian Superstitions from a confused reading of an extract in Ernest Jones's book, On the Nightmare (1931).[13] Wlislocki's later description of \"der Nosferat\" is more extensive than either Schmidt's or Gerard's. The former two German-language sources particularly emphasize the dual role of the creature as both blood-drinker and incubus/succubus. Wlislocki's nosferat is said to drink the blood of older people, while seeking to have sexual intercourse with young people and especially newlyweds, often being blamed for illegitimate children (who become moroi), impotence, and infertility. From the description by Wlislocki, who was a half-Saxon native of Kronstadt (Hungarian Brassó, Romanian Brașov, one of Saxon Transylvania's \"seven cities\"), it is difficult not to get the impression that both the term and the idea must have been quite well known in his community, which makes the inability to confirm its existence in Romanian literature rather puzzling. One proposed etymology of nosferatu is that the term originally came from the Greek nosophoros (Greek: νοσοφόρος), meaning \"disease-bearing\".[14] F. W. Murnau's film Nosferatu (1922) strongly emphasizes this theme of disease, and Murnau's creative direction in the film may have been influenced by this etymology (or vice versa).[15] There are several difficulties with this etymology. Schmidt, Gerard, and Wlislocki, all three sometime residents of Transylvania, identified the word as Romanian, and even proponents of the \"nosophoros\" etymology (as well as most other commentators) seem to have little doubt that this is correct; Wlislocki particularly was regarded as an expert in Transylvanian languages and folklore and was a prolific author on the subjects. Curiously, in Wlislocki's 1896 article, he presents a parenthetical analysis of the related Romanian term solomonar but has nothing to say regarding the origin and connections of the term nosferat, despite having normalized the spelling of both relative to Schmidt's earlier account. If this Romanian identification is taken to be correct, the first objection to the \"nosophoros\" etymology is that Romanian is a Romance language. While Romanian does have some words borrowed from Greek, as do most European languages, Greek is generally considered to be only a minor contributor to the Romanian vocabulary—absent any other information, any given Romanian word is much more likely to be of Latin origin than Greek. Second, the word appears to be quite rare in Greek. One instance of a Greek word similar to νοσοφόρος, νοσηφόρος (\"nosēphoros\"), is attested in fragments from a 2nd-century AD work by Marcellus Sidetes on medicine plus another of the Ionic dialect variant νουσοφόρος (\"nousophoros\") from the Palatine Anthology.[16] These two variant forms are subsumed as examples of the main νοσοφόρος lemma in the definitive Liddel-Scott Greek–English Lexicon, but examples of the normalized form itself seem to be lacking. In any event, supporting evidence for a relationship between this rare and obscure Greek term and nosferatu appears weak. In some versions of the \"nosophoros\" etymology, an intermediate form *nesufur-atu,[15] or sometimes *nosufur-atu is presented[14] but both the original source for this and the justification for it are unclear. This form is often indicated to be Slavonic or Slavic. It is likely that either Old Church Slavonic or the protolanguage Proto-Slavic is intended. As with νοσοφόρος, this supposed Slavonic word does not appear to be attested in primary sources, which severely undermines the credibility of the argument. Another common etymology suggests that the word meant \"not breathing\", which appears to be attempting to read a derivative of the Latin verb spirare (\"to breathe\") as a second morpheme in nosferatu, with the closest hypothetical Romanian word being *nuspirândul. Skal notes that this is \"without basis in lexicography\", viewing all these etymologies (including the widely repeated nosophoros etymology) with skepticism.[9] A final possibility is that the form given by Gerard and the German folklorists is a well-known Romanian term without the benefit of normalized spelling, or possibly a misinterpretation of the sounds of the word due to Gerard's limited familiarity with the language, or possibly a dialectal variant of the word. The standardization of Romanian was rather incomplete in the 19th century, as can be seen in Dictionariulu Limbei Romane of 1871, which in a highly Latinized orthography defines incubu (\"incubus\") as \"unu spiritu necuratu\" compared to the modern standard \"un spirit necurat\". Three candidate words that have been put forth are necurat (\"unclean\", usually associated with the occult, compare a avea un spirit necurat, to have an evil spirit, be possessed),[dubious – discuss][17][18] nesuferit[dubious – discuss],[9] and nefârtat (\"enemy\", lit. \"unbrothered\").[19] The nominative masculine definite form of a Romanian noun in the declension to which these words belong takes the ending \"-ul\" or even the shortened \"u\", as in Romanian \"l\" is usually lost in the process of speaking, so the definite forms nefârtatu, necuratu and nesuferitu are commonly encountered.",

                "content": "Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (German: Nosferatu – Eine Symphonie des Grauens) is a 1922 silent German Expressionist vampire film directed by F. W. Murnau and starring Max Schreck as Count Orlok, a vampire who preys on the wife (Greta Schröder) of his estate agent (Gustav von Wangenheim) and brings the plague to their town. Nosferatu was produced by Prana Film and is an unauthorized and unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula. Various names and other details were changed from the novel, including Count Dracula being renamed Count Orlok then finally Nosferatu, an archaic Romanian word with a suggested etymology of Nesuferitu`, meaning \"the offensive one\" or \"the insufferable one\". Although those changes are often represented as a defense against copyright infringement,[3] the original German intertitles acknowledged Dracula as the source. Film historian David Kalat states in his commentary track that since the film was \"a low-budget film made by Germans for German audiences... setting it in Germany with German-named characters makes the story more tangible and immediate for German-speaking viewers\".[4] Even with several details altered, Stoker's heirs sued over the adaptation, and a court ruling ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed. However, several prints of Nosferatu survived,[1] and the film came to be regarded as an influential masterpiece of cinema and the horror genre.[5][6] Critic and historian Kim Newman declared it as a film that set the template for the genre of horror film.[7] In 1838, in the fictional German town of Wisborg,[1][8] Thomas Hutter is sent to Transylvania by his employer, estate agent Herr Knock, to visit a new client, Count Orlok, who is planning on buying a house across from Hutter's own residence. While embarking on his journey, Hutter stops at an inn in which the locals are frightened by the mere mention of Orlok's name. Hutter rides on a coach to Orlok's castle in the Carpathian Mountains, where he is welcomed by Orlok himself. When he is eating dinner and accidentally cuts his thumb, Orlok tries to suck the blood out, but his repulsed guest pulls his hand away. Hutter wakes up the morning after to find fresh punctures on his neck, which he attributes to mosquitoes. That night, Orlok signs the documents to purchase the house and notices on the table a miniature portrait of Hutter's wife, Ellen, an image that the young man carries with him in a small circular frame. Admiring the portrait, the count remarks that she has a \"lovely neck.\" Reading a book about vampires that he took from the inn, Hutter begins to suspect that Orlok is indeed a vampire. With no way to bar the door to his bedroom, Hutter desperately tries to hide as midnight approaches. Suddenly, the door begins to slowly open by itself; and, as Orlok enters, a terrified Hutter hides under the bedcovers and falls unconscious. Meanwhile, back in Wisborg, Ellen arises from her own bed and sleepwalks to the railing of her bedroom's balcony. She starts walking on top of the railing, which gets the attention of her friend Harding in the adjacent room. When the doctor arrives, Ellen shouts Hutter's name and envisions Orlok in his castle threatening her unconscious husband. The next day, Hutter explores the castle, only to retreat back into his room after he finds the coffin in which Orlok is resting dormant in the crypt. Hours later, Orlok piles up coffins on a coach and climbs into the last one before the coach departs; Hutter rushes home after learning of this. The coffins are taken aboard a schooner, where the sailors discover rats in the coffins. All of the crewmen later die, and Orlok takes control of the vessel. When the ship arrives in Wisborg, Orlok leaves unobserved, carries one of his coffins and moves into the house that he purchased. Many deaths in the town follow after Orlok's arrival, which the local doctors blame on an unspecified plague caused by the rats from the ship. Ellen reads the book that Hutter found; it claims that a vampire can be defeated if a pure-hearted woman distracts the vampire with her beauty and offers him her blood of her own free will; she decides to sacrifice herself. Ellen opens her window to invite Orlok in and pretends to fall ill so that she can send Hutter to fetch Professor Bulwer, a physician. After he leaves, Orlok enters and drinks her blood, but the sun rises, which causes Orlok to vanish in a puff of smoke. Ellen lives just long enough to be embraced by her grief-stricken husband. Orlok's castle is later shown destroyed. Making uncredited appearances are Karl Etlinger as one of Bulwer's students, Hardy von Francois [de] as a doctor at a mental hospital, Guido Herzfeld as an innkeeper, and Fanny Schreck as a hospital nurse. Nosferatu has been noted for its themes regarding fear of the Other, as well as for possible antisemitic undertones,[1] both of which may have been partially derived from the Bram Stoker novel Dracula, upon which the film was based.[9] The physical appearance of Count Orlok, with his hooked nose, long claw-like fingernails, and large bald head, has been compared to stereotypical caricatures of Jewish people from the time in which Nosferatu was produced.[10] His features have also been compared to those of a rat or a mouse, the former of which Jews were often equated with.[11][12] Orlok's interest in acquiring property in the German town of Wisborg, a shift in locale from the Stoker novel's London, has also been analyzed as preying on the fears and anxieties of the German public at the time.[13] Professor Tony Magistrale wrote that the film's depiction of an \"invasion of the German homeland by an outside force [...] poses disquieting parallels to the anti-Semitic atmosphere festering in Northern Europe in 1922.\"[13] When the foreign Orlok arrives in Wisborg by ship, he brings with him a swarm of rats which, in a deviation from the source novel, spread the plague throughout the town.[12][14] This plot element further associates Orlok with rodents and the idea of the \"Jew as disease-causing agent\".[10][12] It is also notable that Orlok's accomplice in conspiracy Knock is a Jewish realtor, who acts as the vampire's fifth column in the Biedermeier town of Wisborg.[15] There were other views – writer Kevin Jackson has noted that director F. W. Murnau \"was friendly with and protective of a number of Jewish men and women\" throughout his life, including Jewish actor Alexander Granach, who plays Knock in Nosferatu.[16] Additionally, Magistrale wrote that Murnau, being a homosexual, would have been \"presumably more sensitive to the persecution of a subgroup inside the larger German society\".[12] As such, it has been said that perceived associations between Orlok and antisemitic stereotypes are unlikely to have been conscious decisions on the part of Murnau.[12][16] Murnau and Grau gave Orlok in the film a demonic lineage and an occult origin: Orlok is the creation of Belial, one of the Satanic archdemons. Belial in Psalm 41:8–10 is also associated with pestilence, with Orlok in film being the very manifestation of contagion, rats pouring out of his coffins onto the streets of Wisborg, spreading Black Death.[17] Orlok's link to Belial is also highly significant because Belial is \"one of the demons traditionally summoned by Goetic magicians\" – making Orlok someone who practiced dark sorcery before becoming a vampire.[18] Orlok and his servant Knock are communicating in occult language – the documents between Orlok and Knock are written in the Enochian language, a constructed language said to be that of the angels, which was recorded in the private journals of English occultist John Dee and his colleague English alchemist Edward Kelley in late 16th-century Elizabethan England.[19][20] The character of Professor Bulwer in the film is named in reference to English occult novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton.[20] The idea of astral entities, arising from the dark thoughts of human beings, responsible for epidemics that call for blood sacrifices in order to prevent them, is also closely linked to that of the alchemist Paracelsus, whose figure is partly embodied in the film in the character of Professor Bulwer (who is mentioned in the film to be Paracelsian himself). This is made concrete in the film in the plague epidemic that spreads through the city of Wisborg, which cannot be remedied by scientific methods, but by the blood sacrifice of a woman, thus destroying forever the dark being responsible for this catastrophic situation.[21] The idea for making this vampire film saw its genesis in the war-time experience of producer Albin Grau. Grau served in the German army during World War I on the Serbian front. While in Serbia Grau encountered a local farmer who told him of his father, who the farmer believed had become an undead vampire. F. W. Murnau, director of the film, also saw considerable action in World War I – not only as a company commander in the trenches of the Eastern Front, but also later in the air after he transferred to the German air service. He survived at least eight crashes. Max Schreck who portrayed Count Orlok also served in the trenches with the German army. Little is known of his war-time experience, but there are some signs he may have dealt with some form of post-traumatic stress disorder. Colleagues commented that he preferred to keep to himself. He was known to take long walks in the forest alone, often times disappearing for hours at a time. He once stated that he lived in \"a remote and incorporeal world\". Thus it is considered that the turmoil of 1920s Germany and the war-time experiences of those who produced the film left their marks on the production of the film.[22] As Lotte Eisner, a dedicated occultist, wrote: \"Mysticism and magic, the dark forces to which Germans have always been more than willing to commit themselves, had flourished in the face of death on the battlefields\" – these forces were intrinsic to the shaping of cinema's first vampires. Albin Grau himself also linked the war and vampires: \"this monstrous event that is unleashed across the earth like a cosmic vampire to drink the blood of millions and millions of men\". Belial as well is the link between war and contagion, as Orlok is linked directly to the Black Death and many critics have linked Nosferatu's disease-bearing rodents to the transmissible sickness associated with trench warfare in which rats flourished. As noted by Ernest Jones in his psychoanalytic study of nightmares, vampire legends proliferate in periods of mass contagion.[23] The studio behind Nosferatu, Prana Film, was a short-lived silent-era German film studio founded in 1921 by Enrico Dieckmann and occultist artist Albin Grau,[1] named after a Theosophical journal which was itself named for the Hindu concept of prana.[4] Although the studio's intent was to produce occult- and supernatural-themed films, Nosferatu was its only production,[24] as it declared bankruptcy shortly after the film's release. Grau claimed he was inspired to shoot a vampire film by a war experience: in Grau's apocryphal tale, during the winter of 1916, a Serbian farmer told him that his father was a vampire and one of the undead.[25] As a lifelong student of the occult and member of Fraternitas Saturni, under the magical name of Master Pacitius, Grau was able to imbue Nosferatu with hermetic and mystical undertones. One example in particular was the cryptic contract that Count Orlok and Knock exchanged, which was filled in Enochian, hermetic and alchemical symbols. Grau was also a strong influence on Orlok's verminous and emaciated look[26] and he also designed the film’s sets, costumes, make-up and the letter with the Enochian symbols. He also was responsible for film's advertising campaign, creating movie posters and advertisements. Grau’s visual style was also deeply influenced by work of the artist Hugo Steiner-Prag who had illustrated other texts with esoteric subjects such as Gustav Meyrink’s Golem and E. T. A. Hoffmann’s Die Elixiere des Teufels (1907).[27] Diekmann and Grau gave Henrik Galeen, a disciple of Hanns Heinz Ewers, the task to write a screenplay inspired by the Dracula novel, although Prana Film had not obtained the film rights. Galeen was an experienced specialist in dark romanticism; he had already worked on The Student of Prague (1913), and the screenplay for The Golem: How He Came into the World (1920). Galeen set the story in the fictional north German harbour town of Wisborg. He changed the characters' names and added the idea of the vampire bringing the plague to Wisborg via rats on the ship. Galeen's Expressionist style screenplay was poetically rhythmic, without being so dismembered as other books influenced by literary Expressionism, such as those by Carl Mayer. Lotte Eisner described Galeen's screenplay as \"voll Poesie, voll Rhythmus\" (\"full of poetry, full of rhythm\").[28] Actor Conrad Veidt was offered the role of Count Orlok, having previously worked with Murnau, but had to decline for scheduling reasons. In the search for an alternative the choice finally fell on the then-still-unknown actor Max Schreck.[29] Filming began in July 1921, with exterior shots in Wismar. A take from Marienkirche's tower over Wismar marketplace with the Wasserkunst Wismar [de] served as the establishing shot for the Wisborg scene. Other locations were the Wassertor [de], the Heiligen-Geist-Kirche yard and the harbour. In Lübeck, the abandoned Salzspeicher served as Nosferatu's new Wisborg house, the one of the churchyard of the Aegidienkirche served as Hutter's, and down the Depenau a procession of coffin bearers bore coffins of supposed plague victims. Many scenes of Lübeck appear in the hunt for Knock, who ordered Hutter in the Yard of Füchting to meet Count Orlok. Further exterior shots followed in Lauenburg, Rostock and on Sylt. The exteriors of the film set in Transylvania were actually shot on location in northern Slovakia, including the High Tatras, Vrátna dolina, Orava Castle, the Váh River, and Starý Castle [sk].[30] The team filmed interior shots at the JOFA studio in Berlin's Johannisthal locality and further exteriors in the Tegel Forest.[1] For cost reasons, cameraman Fritz Arno Wagner only had one camera available, and therefore there was only one original negative.[31] The director followed Galeen's screenplay carefully, following handwritten instructions on camera positioning, lighting, and related matters.[28] Nevertheless, Murnau completely rewrote 12 pages of the script, as Galeen's text was missing from the director's working script. This concerned the last scene of the film, in which Ellen sacrifices herself and the vampire dies in the first rays of the sun.[32][33] Murnau prepared carefully; there were sketches that were to correspond exactly to each filmed scene, and he used a metronome to control the pace of the acting.[34] The original score was composed by Hans Erdmann and performed by an orchestra at the film's Berlin premiere. However, most of the score has been lost, and what remains is only a partial adapted suite.[1] Thus, throughout the history of Nosferatu screenings, many composers and musicians have written or improvised their own soundtrack to accompany the film. For example, James Bernard, composer of the soundtracks of many Hammer horror films in the late 1950s and 1960s, wrote a score for a reissue.[1][35] Bernard's score was released in 1997 by Silva Screen Records. A version of Erdmann's original score reconstructed by musicologists and composers Gillian Anderson and James Kessler was released in 1995 by BMG Classics, with multiple missing sequences composed anew, in an attempt to match Erdmann's style. An earlier reconstruction by German composer Berndt Heller has many additions of unrelated classical works.[1] In 2022, the New York Times wrote about Dutch composer Jozef van Wissem's new score and record release for Nosferatu. Beginning with a solo played on the lute, his performance incorporates electric guitar and distorted recordings of extinct birds, graduating from subtlety to gothic horror. \"My soundtrack goes from silence to noise over the course of 90 minutes,\" he said, culminating in \"dense, slow death metal.\"[36] A new score for full orchestra and piano was commissioned by the Louisville Orchestra from its former composer-in-residence Sebastian Chang. It premiered, played live with the film in October 2023.[37] Shortly before the premiere, an advertisement campaign was placed in issue #21 of the magazine Bühne und Film, with a summary, scene and work photographs, production reports, and essays, including a treatment on vampirism by Albin Grau.[39] Nosferatu opened in the Netherlands on 16 February 1922 at the Hague Flora and Olympia cinemas.[40] Nosferatu premiered in Germany on 4 March 1922 in the Marmorsaal of the Berlin Zoological Garden. This was planned as a large society evening entitled Das Fest des Nosferatu (Festival of Nosferatu), and guests were asked to arrive dressed in Biedermeier costume. The German cinema premiere itself took place on 15 March 1922 at Berlin's Primus-Palast.[1] The 1930s sound version Die zwölfte Stunde – Eine Nacht des Grauens (The Twelfth Hour: A Night of Horror), which is less commonly known, was a completely unauthorized and re-edited version of the film. It was released in Vienna, Austria on 16 May 1930 with sound-on-disc accompaniment and a recomposition of Hans Erdmann's original score by Georg Fiebiger, a German production manager and composer of film music. It had an alternative ending lighter than the original and the characters were renamed again; Count Orlok's name was changed to Prince Wolkoff, Knock became Karsten, Hutter and Ellen became Kundberg and Margitta, and Annie was changed to Maria.[1] This version, of which Murnau was unaware, contained many scenes filmed by Murnau but not previously released. It also contained additional footage not filmed by Murnau but by a cameraman, Günther Krampf, under the direction of Waldemar Roger [de] (also known as Waldemar Ronger),[41] supposedly also a film editor and lab chemist.[citation needed] The name of director F. W. Murnau is no longer mentioned in the credits.[citation needed] This version, lasting approximately 80 minutes, was presented on 5 June 1981 at the Cinémathèque Française.[42] Nosferatu brought Murnau into the public eye, especially when his film Der brennende Acker (The Burning Soil) was released a few days later. The press reported extensively on Nosferatu and its premiere. With the laudatory votes, there was also occasional criticism that the technical perfection and clarity of the images did not fit the horror theme. The Filmkurier of 6 March 1922 said that the vampire appeared too corporeal and brightly lit to appear genuinely scary. Hans Wollenberg described the film in photo-Stage No. 11 of 11 March 1922 as a \"sensation\" and praised Murnau's nature shots as \"mood-creating elements.\"[43] In the Vossische Zeitung of 7 March 1922, Nosferatu was praised for its visual style.[44] Nosferatu was also the first film to show a vampire dying from exposure to sunlight. Previous vampire novels such as Dracula had shown them being uncomfortable with sunlight, but not undeath-threateningly so.[45] The film has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 9.05/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"One of the silent era's most influential masterpieces, Nosferatu's eerie, gothic feel – and a chilling performance from Max Schreck as the vampire – set the template for the horror films that followed.\"[46] In 1995, the Vatican included Nosferatu on a list of 45 important films that people should watch.[47] It was ranked twenty-first in Empire magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.[48] In 1997, critic Roger Ebert added Nosferatu to his list of The Great Movies, writing: Here is the story of Dracula before it was buried alive in clichés, jokes, TV skits, cartoons and more than 30 other films. The film is in awe of its material. It seems to really believe in vampires. ...Is Murnau's Nosferatu scary in the modern sense? Not for me. I admire it more for its artistry and ideas, its atmosphere and images, than for its ability to manipulate my emotions like a skillful modern horror film. It knows none of the later tricks of the trade, like sudden threats that pop in from the side of the screen. But Nosferatu remains effective: It doesn't scare us, but it haunts us.[49] Nosferatu only entered the public domain worldwide by the end of 2019. Despite this, the film had already been subject to widespread circulation via a sped-up, unrestored black and white bootleg copy.[50] Beginning in 1981, the film has had various different official restorations, several of which have been issued on home video in the U.S., Europe and Australia. These versions, which are all tinted, speed-corrected and have specially recorded scores, are separately copyrighted with respect to new copyrightable elements.[1] The most recent restoration, completed in 2005/2006, has been released on DVD and Blu-ray throughout the world, and features a reconstruction of Hans Erdmann's original score by Berndt Heller.[51] In 1977, Spanish amateur filmmaker José Ernesto Díaz Noriega added humorous and iconoclastic dialogues to the film. His adaptation or détournement, titled Manuscrito encontrato en Zarazwela or Nos fera tu la pugnete, was based on a S8 mm print of the English version. \"Observing the curious coincidence of the fiction that is related in the film with history\",[52] Díaz Noriega adapted Nosferatu's plot to the years of the Spanish transition to democracy: Prime Minister Arias Navarro becomes Draculas Navarro and Juan Carlos de Borbón becomes Jonathan Carolus (prince of Franconia). The original Transylvania becomes Galitzia and the Pazo de Meirás becomes the vampire's castle. All Murnau's characters find equivalence in the political actors of the Spanish transition to democracy.[53] A 1979 adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula by director Werner Herzog, Nosferatu the Vampyre, starred Klaus Kinski (as Count Dracula, not Count Orlok).[54] The film is a remake of the 1922 film with character names that are faithful to the novel. A remake by director David Lee Fisher was in development after being successfully funded on Kickstarter on 3 December 2014.[55] On 13 April 2016, it was reported that Doug Jones had been cast as Count Orlok in the film and that filming had begun. The film would use green screen to insert colorized backgrounds from the original film atop live-action, a process Fisher previously used for his remake The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (2005).[56][1] In November 2023, it premiered at the Emagine Theater in Novi.[57] It was later released on video on demand via Amazon Prime Video in September 2024 and on streaming though Apple TV+ on 18 October 2024.[58] In July 2015, a remake was announced with Robert Eggers writing and directing.[59] It was reported in September 2022 that Eggers' remake would be distributed by Focus Features, with Bill Skarsgård set to star as Orlok and Lily-Rose Depp as Ellen Hutter. Willem Dafoe, Nicholas Hoult, and Emma Corrin also appear.[60] The film wrapped principal photography on 19 May 2023.[61] The film's first teaser trailer was released on 24 June 2024, and it confirmed that the film will be released on 25 December 2024.[62]",

                "content": "In 1887, a vampire wakes up and seeks to quench his thirst for blood. Brave men and women ally to destroy him  but to do so, they will have to thwart the plot of Renfeld, his faithful servant. Nosferatu is a card game mixing tactics, bluffing, and team play, with the vampire and Renfeld facing off against the vampire hunters. At the start of the game, everyone knows who Renfeld is, and Renfield knows which of the hunters is actually a vampire (as he chooses how to distribute the character cards), but the vampire's identity is hidden from everyone else. The hunters must identify the vampire and kill him with the ancestral stake before he can play five bite cards; if the hunters accidentally stake one of their own, then demoralized and weakened they lose the game. Components  Rules  8 Character Cards  49 Library Cards  11 Clock Cards  5 Ritual Cards  1 Ancestral Stake CardEach player other than Renfield starts with two cards from the library, which is comprised of rumors, components, bites and night cards. Three ritual cards  silver mirror, blood transfusion, and time distortion  are placed face-up on the table. Renfield takes the \"Eternal Darkness\" card, while one hunter holds the ancestral stake. Renfield creates a \"clock\" by taking one night card for each player and shuffling it with a dawn card. The game lasts a number of rounds, with the rounds continuing until one of the winning conditions is met. At the start of a round, players take turns doing the following: Drawing two cards from the library, discarding one card face-up, placing one card face-down in an action pile, then drawing a card from the clock. As soon as a player draws the dawn card or each player has played once, this part of the round ends. Renfield shuffles all the cards in the action pile, then reveals them. If the pile contains only components, the player holding the stake chooses one of the rituals, takes its action  forcing Renfield to reveal a character card, removing a bite from a hunter, or removing a night card from the clock  then turns the ritual face-down. Once all three rituals have been used, they're turned face-up and can be used again. If the deck contains bite cards, then Renfield applies the bites to the hunters, with a hunter losing one card in his stock for each bite; a hunter can have at most two bites. Night cards in the pile are added to the clock, thereby giving the vampire more time to work in future rounds, while making it tougher for players to achieve rituals. If the dawn card was revealed, the holder of the ancient stake can stab someone, thereby ending the game with victory for one side or the other, or pass the stake to another player. (If dawn didn't break, then the stake passes to another player with no opportunity for stabbing.) Once a hunter is bitten, Renfield flips the \"Eternal Darkness\" card to its \"Darkness Master\" side. If the library runs out and the \"Darkness Master\" side is face-up, you flip the card, shuffle the library, and start a new round. If, however, \"Eternal Darkness\" still shows (i.e., no one was bitten during this pass through the library), then the stake holder must reveal someone's character card, possibly unveiling the vampire for all to see. Better get chomping, Fangs, if you don't want to be exposed!",

                "title": "Squid Game Season 2 Release Date, Trailer, Plot, Photos, Cast, and News - Netflix Tudum",
                "content": "Smile — Squid Game is ready to welcome you back into the arena. All seven new episodes of the Korean drama are now streaming on Netflix. The trailer, which was released in early December, revealed a hardened Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), aka Player 456, returns to the deadly games with one goal in mind: to end the horrifying competition once and for all. Forced to play a new set of games, Gi-hun finds himself locked in a tense battle with the shadowy Front Man (Lee Byung-hun), whose true motivations remain cloaked in secrecy as the twists and turns of Season 2 unfurl. Will Gi-hun succeed, and how many more lives will the system claim as he tries? Well, you can find out right now by pressing “play” on Squid Game Season 2. Director Hwang Dong-hyuk is thrilled about what’s in store for Squid Game’s return. “I do have a lot on my shoulders, but I’ll make sure it’s worth the wait,” Hwang told Netflix in 2023. The Golden Globes seem to think it is: Squid Game Season 2 has already been nominated for Best Drama Series at the upcoming awards show. Squid Game Season 1 introduced fans to the K-drama’s titular deadly game, which forces citizens to gamble with their lives. In return, they may win a world-changing cash prize — or suffer dire consequences. Down-on-his-luck Gi-hun continues to lead the series, and Season 2 picks up after his jaw-dropping decisions in the Season 1 finale. “Season 2 explores how Gi-hun follows through on his words after leaving the airport,” says Hwang below in a new behind-the-scenes featurette that revisits Season 1. “Gi-hun’s endeavor to find out who these people are and why they do what they do is the core story of Season 2.” Lee adds: “In Season 1, there was room to show glimpses of Gi-hun’s various personalities, such as his optimistic nature and positive energy. This time, the focus was on his determination.” As you get into the game, keep reading to learn everything you want to know about Season 2 — from the plot to details about the new players. “Three years after winning Squid Game, Player 456 gave up going to the States and comes back with a new resolution in his mind,” reads the official Season 2 synopsis. “Gi-hun once again dives into the mysterious survival game, starting another life-or-death game with new participants gathered to win the prize of 45.6 billion won.” The trailer also confirms that Wi Ha-jun is back in the role of Hwang Jun-ho, driving the narrative forward as the relentless detective on a mission of his own. The Squid Game Season 2 cast includes the following stars: The teaser trailer very clearly reveals Player 456 will return to Squid Game. The actor who plays him, Lee, and director Hwang swear Gi-hun has a good reason for stepping back into the deadly competition. “He wants to return to a ‘normal’ so-called life. [But] there’s something inside him that has already been broken, where he cannot return to the way he was before,” Hwang said during Netflix’s Fall Edit event in November. Although Gi-hun yearns to reconnect with his daughter, “he understands … that he has changed in a way where [that’s] no longer possible.” Gi-hun’s only recourse is to focus on the savage game that transformed him into the person he is now. “That is why I believe that character decides to return [to Squid Game], turn away from [his daughter], and begin this further journey,” Hwang explained. Although Gi-hun will be putting his tracksuit back on, Lee is quick to remind us he’s not the same man he was in Season 1. “I had many opportunities where I was able to express that goodness of heart in the character [in Season 1],” the actor said. “However, in Season 2, while there are certain circumstances that allow for that [quality] to peek out of him … I didn’t have that many opportunities.” You’ll have to tune in this winter to learn how this new version of Gi-hun tackles a contest as treacherous as Squid Game. The Squid Game cast and creative team are happy to help answer this question. In a new video (below), the team looks back on the success of Season 1, while reminiscing about the character dynamics, compelling backstories, and shocking games that enthralled audiences around the world. And they hint at what Season 2 holds. “So we don’t have many survivors from Season 1, meaning that I had to continue on with the narrative with Gi-hun and a handful of other survivors,” director Hwang says in the clip. “I thought it’d be fun to bring back characters who had just a brief appearance in Season 1.” Watch the entire video for a star-studded walk down Squid Game memory lane. And, for even more insights, read the complete Season 1 recap here. Yes, there are. In 2023, the team released photos of the cast gathering for the first table read of Season 2. Now, even more Season 2 photos have just arrived, and you can sneak a peek at them. Below, you can see the much-anticipated return of Gi-hun, Front Man (Lee Byung-hun), and Recruiter (Gong Yoo), and get your first look at a new character played by Park Gyu-young. The thriller’s main set is located in South Korea. Yes! Squid Game: The Official Podcast has also returned to help unravel every Season 2 surprise, alongside hosts Phil Yu and Kiera Please. The duo will unpack the thriller’s deadly challenges, layered characters, and each new episode’s moral dilemmas. Squid Game: The Official Podcast Season 2 is now streaming. Emmy winner Hwang serves as writer, director, and executive producer. He made history at the 74th Primetime Emmys as the first Asian director to ever win the award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series. In a letter to fans in June 2022 (seen above), he teased what viewers could expect from Season 2. The series is produced by Firstman Studio; Kim is the CEO of Firstman Studio and an executive producer. “There’s definitely a lot of pressure on how to make [Season 2] even better,” Kim told Tudum in 2022. “I know that a lot of the different fans and audiences have enjoyed the series very much, but, really, we’re focusing on how to make it even more joyful to the global audience.” Chae Kyoung-sun is Squid Game’s production designer. “I still can’t believe I’ve won a Primetime Emmy. I’m just exhilarated to once again be part of Squid Game,” she told Netflix, looking ahead to Season 2. The Golden Globe–nominated new season is now streaming. Hold onto your tracksuit — more Squid Game is on the way. Hwang has confirmed Season 3 is coming in 2025, and it will be the series’ last.

                "content": "How you watch Netflix's Korean-language show can make it a stud or a dud When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. \"Squid Game\" season 2 is a must-watch show. The first season was a massive hit for Netflix and the early reviews for season 2 suggest that it's going to be a hit yet again. It even somehow already earned a Golden Globes nomination despite the fact that almost nobody has seen it yet. However, there's a trick to watching this show properly, and those of you who have watched or rewatched season 1 probably already know what I'm going to say: You need to turn on English subtitles. There are technically multiple versions of \"Squid Game.\" There's an English language dubbed version and there's the original Korean version. Which version you watch makes a big difference. When I first watched \"Squid Game\" season 1, my first reaction was \"This dialogue is awful.\" My second reaction was \"This is a dub. And a bad one.\" So I immediately went into the settings and changed the audio to Korean [Original]. That was easy. But when I looked at the subtitles section, I had two options for English: English or English [CC]. And choosing the right version can change your experience entirely. That's because English subtitles are an English translation of the original Korean dialogue. It's not always perfect, but it's as close to the original meaning of the dialogue as you can get without knowing Korean. English [CC] however, is an accessibility-focused subtitle option that adds speaker identification, sound effects, and music description based on the English dub. So if you choose English [CC], you're still getting the terrible dialogue from the English dubbed version. So please, before you watch even a second of 'Squid Game season 2, go to your audio and subtitles settings and select Korean [Original] audio with English subtitles. If you do, then you'll get to enjoy this incredible show as it was intended. If you don't, you might be like I was after watching 10 minutes of episode 1, season 1, wondering why on Earth people were even watching this show. It truly makes that significant of a difference. Once the episode starts playing do the following steps to turn on Korean [Original] audio and English subtitles 1. Open Audio and Subtitles settings. This is the icon that looks like a chat bubble. 2. Under Audio, select Korean [Original]. 3. Under Subtitles, select English. Do not select English [CC]. 4. Hit play and enjoy \"Squid Game\" as it was intended! Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.

                "content": "On Christmas Day and Christmas Eve, many families cook their own feast at home, but some are certain to want to pick up some fast-food during the holiday. Whether you're in need of a caffeine fix or your home cooking plans for the holiday went awry, many restaurants will stay open on both days. However, some do close their doors, so it's good to know beforehand whether a restaurant will be serving food as usual. Newsweek compiled a full list of the fast-food and restaurant chains open on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Pancakes on Christmas morning could be your family's tradition. If that's the case, you're in luck because the International House of Pancakes will be open on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Just keep in mind, the hours could be limited at certain locations, so you should always call ahead. America's beloved fast food chain McDonald's plans to serve customers all throughout the day on Christmas. While the majority are open, there is a possibility local franchises give employees the day off, so it's best to call ahead to confirm. On Christmas Eve, locations will be open but hours vary depending on your location. If you still want a sit-down Christmas dinner but don't want to be involved in the cooking process, Applebee's might have your back. Select restaurant locations will be open on Christmas, but some will operate with reduced hours. On Christmas Eve, locations nationwide will be open but hours may also be reduced. Sonic, which is known for its burgers and signature beverages, will be closed on Christmas Day. But you're in luck for Christmas Eve since locations nationwide will be open from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. The beloved breakfast eatery will be open 24 hours on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, allowing easy access to waffles and breakfast sandwiches all day. Sometimes Christmas Eve and Christmas day calls for an impromptu pizza order, and luckily, Domino's will keep many restaurants open to serve those who need it. Keep in mind, hours and openings vary by location, so you should still confirm with your local restaurant. Caffeine can be a necessity on Christmas morning. To help you fuel up, some Dunkin' stores will be open on their regular hours. But keep in mind, other stores will elect to close on the holidays, so call ahead for Christmas hours. Starbucks is to remain open to serve its festive coffee beverages all throughout the day on Christmas Eve and Christmas day. The specific hours and openings could vary depending on location. According to the company, many Burger King locations will not be fully open on Christmas Day. \"Customers can expect Burger King restaurants to be more accessible on Christmas Eve,\" said the company.

                "content": "Luka Dončić (/ˈluːkə ˈdɒntʃɪtʃ/ LOO-kə DON-chitch;[1] Slovene: [ˈlùːka ˈdòːntʃitʃ]; born February 28, 1999) is a Slovenian professional basketball player for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"Luka Magic\",[2] he also plays for the Slovenia national team and is regarded as one of the greatest European players of all time.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Born in Ljubljana, Dončić shone as a youth player for Union Olimpija before joining the youth academy of Real Madrid. In 2015, he made his debut for the academy's senior team at age 16, becoming the youngest in club history. He made his senior debut for Slovenia in 2016 at only 17 years of age. He later helped his country win its first EuroBasket title, in 2017, while also being named to the All-Tournament Team. Dončić led Madrid to the 2018 EuroLeague title, winning the EuroLeague MVP and the Final Four MVP. He was named the ACB Most Valuable Player and won back-to-back EuroLeague Rising Star and ACB Best Young Player awards. Dončić was also selected to the EuroLeague 2010–20 All-Decade Team.[9] In 2018, Dončić declared for the NBA draft, where he was drafted third overall by the Atlanta Hawks and then traded to the Dallas Mavericks.[note 1] Dončić was unanimously selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team and won Rookie of the Year for the 2018–19 season. Since his rookie season, Dončić has been selected to five consecutive NBA All-Star games and five All-NBA First Team selections. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2023–24 season, becoming the first European to lead the NBA in scoring and second international player to achieve the feat. That season, he led the Mavericks to their third NBA Finals appearance. Dončić is also the Mavericks' franchise leader in career triple-doubles,[12] and holds the record for most points in a Mavericks season.[13] Dončić was born in Ljubljana to Mirjam Poterbin [sl], an owner of beauty salons,[14] and Saša Dončić, a basketball coach and former player.[15][16] His mother is Slovenian, and his father is a Slovenian of Serbian descent from Kosovo.[17][18][19] His parents filed for divorce in 2008, with custody and legal guardianship granted to his mother.[16][20] According to his family, Dončić first touched a basketball when he was seven months old and frequently played with a miniature hoop in his room by age one.[15][21] Dončić played various sports in his childhood, including football, which he later quit after growing too tall.[22] At age seven, Dončić began playing organized basketball at a primary school in Ljubljana.[21][23] His opponents at the time were up to 10 years old, as Dončić reflected: \"I was always training and playing with older kids who had much more experience than me. Many of them were bigger and faster than me too, so I had to beat them with my brain.\"[23] Dončić admired Greek basketball player Vassilis Spanoulis from his early teenage years, stating that he was \"enchanted\" by him.[24] Dončić wore the number 7 at Real Madrid in honor of Spanoulis.[25] Dončić also grew up admiring American basketball player LeBron James.[26] When Dončić was eight, his father started playing for his hometown club Union Olimpija. Olimpija Basketball School coach Grega Brezovec invited Dončić to practice with players his age.[21][27] Only 16 minutes into his first training session, the coaching staff moved Dončić to the 11-year-old group. Starting in the next session, he primarily practiced with Olimpija's under-14 team. Still, due to league rules, Dončić only played for the club's under-12 selection team, coming off the bench against opponents three or four years older than him.[21][23] Despite his exclusion from under-14 games at the time, Dončić often asked to attend practice, even when his coach asked him to stay home.[21] Representing Olimpija at the under-14 Vasas Intesa Sanpaolo Cup in Budapest in September 2011, Dončić was named the most valuable player (MVP) despite finishing as runners-up to FC Barcelona.[28] In February 2012, he was loaned to Spanish club Real Madrid for the Minicopa Endesa, an under-14 Spanish club competition.[29][30] Dončić averaged 13.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.8 assists, and 3.3 steals per game to win tournament MVP honors, leading Real Madrid to a second-place finish.[30] In April 2012, he participated in the under-13 Lido di Roma Tournament for Olimpija, finishing as MVP and leading scorer with 34.5 points per game. In the semifinal round of the event against Victoria Fermo, Dončić posted 29 points and 15 rebounds. In a title-clinching win over Lazio, he erupted for 54 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists.[21][31] In September 2012, at 13 years of age, Dončić signed a five-year contract with Real Madrid, immediately standing out on the under-16 team with coach Paco Redondo.[23][32] Dončić moved to Madrid, living with football and basketball prospects.[15] In February 2013, he led Real Madrid to a Minicopa Endesa win, averaging 24.5 points, 13 rebounds, four assists, and six steals per game. In the tournament's final game, Dončić had 25 points, 16 rebounds, and five steals to defeat FC Barcelona and win MVP honors.[33] In March, he earned MVP accolades of the under-16 Spain Championship, scoring 25 points in a championship game win over the Gran Canaria youth team.[34] In the 2014–15 season, Dončić mainly played with Real Madrid's under-18 and reserve teams. He averaged 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 3.1 assists with the reserve team, helping them win Group B of the Liga EBA, the amateur fourth-division of Spanish basketball.[35][36] By the end of the season, Dončić earned all-league honorable mention accolades from the basketball website Eurobasket.com.[35] In January 2015, Dončić won the under-18 Ciutat de L'Hospitalet Tournament and was selected to the All-Tournament Team, despite being two years younger than the rest of the team.[37] On January 6, against the youth team of his former club Union Olimpija, he posted a double-double of 13 points, 13 rebounds, four assists, and four steals.[38] In May 2015, Dončić won the under-18 Next Generation Tournament, for which he was selected MVP after helping defeat defending champions Crvena zvezda Belgrade in the final.[39] On April 30, 2015, Dončić made his professional debut for Real Madrid in the Liga ACB against Unicaja, making his only three-point attempt in under two minutes of playing time.[40] At 16 years, two months, and two days of age, Dončić became the youngest player to ever play for Real Madrid in the ACB and the third-youngest debutant in league history, behind only Ricky Rubio and Ángel Rebolo.[41] Dončić played five games in the 2014–15 ACB season, averaging 1.6 points, and 1.2 rebounds in 4.8 minutes per game.[42] In the 2015–16 season, Dončić became a regular member of Real Madrid's senior team. He played against the Boston Celtics in an NBA preseason game on October 8, 2015, collecting four rebounds, an assist, and a block.[43] On October 16, at age 16, Dončić debuted in the EuroLeague, scoring two points in a loss to Khimki.[44] He became the 21st player ever to debut in the EuroLeague before turning 17.[45] On October 18, Dončić recorded 10 points and four rebounds in a 94–61 victory over Gipuzkoa.[46] On November 29, he posted a season-high 15 points, six rebounds, and four assists against Bilbao.[47] With the performance, Dončić set a new ACB record for most points and the highest Performance Index Rating (PIR) in a game for players under age 17.[48] He scored 12 points and grabbed five rebounds on January 7, 2016, against CSKA Moscow in the EuroLeague.[49] After a Real Madrid time-out in the second quarter of the game, Dončić made three consecutive three-pointers, recording nine points in two minutes.[50] Through 39 games in the 2015–16 ACB season, he averaged 4.5 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 1.7 assists.[51] In 12 EuroLeague games, Dončić recorded 3.5 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 2.0 assists per game.[52] Dončić made his 2016–17 season debut on September 30, 2016, against Unicaja, recording six points and four assists in 19 minutes.[53] He collected three points, five rebounds, and four assists in an NBA preseason win on October 3, 2016, over the Oklahoma City Thunder.[54] On December 4, Dončić posted a double-double of 23 points and 11 assists, both season highs, in a 92–76 victory over Montakit Fuenlabrada.[55] The game earned him his first ACB player of the week honor.[56] Dončić scored a team-high 17 points in a EuroLeague victory over Žalgiris Kaunas on December 8, 2016.[57] After recording 16 points, six rebounds, five assists, and three steals in a 95–72 victory over Brose Bamberg on December 22, he was named MVP of the Round in the EuroLeague, becoming the youngest player ever to do so.[58][59] Dončić earned the same honor on January 14, 2017, after posting 10 points, 11 rebounds, and eight assists to help beat Maccabi Tel Aviv.[60] On February 9, Dončić recorded five points, seven rebounds, and 11 assists to defeat UNICS Kazan.[61] He scored a season-high 23 points on February 18, in the Spanish King's Cup against Baskonia.[62] After scoring 13 points and grabbing eight rebounds in the 2017 EuroLeague Playoffs against Darüşşafaka on April 26, Dončić shared MVP of the Round accolades with two other players.[63] Two days later, he won the award outright, posting 11 points, five rebounds, and seven assists to lead Real Madrid to a EuroLeague Final Four berth.[64] Through 42 ACB games in the season, Dončić averaged 7.5 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 3.0 assists. Through 35 EuroLeague contests, he averaged 7.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 4.2 assists per game.[51] Dončić was named EuroLeague Rising Star by a unanimous vote and claimed the ACB Best Young Player award.[59][65] Dončić assumed a more significant role for Real Madrid entering the 2017–18 season after the team's star player Sergio Llull suffered a torn ACL during EuroBasket 2017.[66] In his season debut on October 1, 2017, he recorded eight points, six rebounds, and four assists in a 94–88 victory over MoraBanc Andorra.[67] On October 12, Dončić scored a career-high 27 points in his first EuroLeague game of the season to help defeat Anadolu Efes.[68] Dončić nearly recorded a triple-double against Valencia in his next game, with 16 points, 10 assists, and seven rebounds.[69] On October 24, he was named EuroLeague MVP of the Round after erupting for 27 points, eight rebounds, five assists, and three steals.[70] Dončić was named MVP of the Round again two days later, eclipsing his career-best with 28 points in an 87–66 win over Žalgiris Kaunas. Dončić also grabbed nine rebounds and had four assists in the game.[71] At the end of October, he earned EuroLeague MVP of the Month honors, becoming the youngest player to win the award.[72] On December 8, Dončić set a career high in scoring with 33 points, six rebounds, and four assists against Olympiacos Piraeus.[73] He led Real Madrid to a 79–77 victory over defending EuroLeague champion Fenerbahçe Doğuş on December 28, contributing 20 points, 10 assists, and eight rebounds.[74] Following a 24-point outburst versus Movistar Estudiantes on December 31, Dončić was selected as Player of the Round in the ACB.[75] He was later named ACB Player of the Month for December, becoming the award's youngest recipient.[76] On February 9, 2018, Dončić led his team with 27 points in a losing effort to Olympiacos, 80–79.[77] Dončić had another strong performance on February 17 against Iberostar Tenerife in the 2018 Spanish King's Cup, posting 17 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and four steals.[78][79] On March 30, 2018, Dončić scored 24 points, grabbed nine rebounds, and made a game-winning three-pointer under a second left in regulation to beat Crvena zvezda Belgrade, 82–79.[80] On May 9, he recorded 17 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in 22 minutes against Real Betis Energía Plus, for the first triple-double in the ACB since the 2006–07 season, seventh in league history.[81] Dončić finished with 16 points, seven rebounds, and two assists on May 18, in a 92–83 victory over CSKA Moscow in the EuroLeague semifinals.[82] On May 20, he guided Real Madrid to a EuroLeague finals victory over Fenerbahçe Doğuş.[83] Dončić was subsequently named EuroLeague Final Four MVP after scoring 15 points.[84] He won the EuroLeague MVP award, being its youngest winner, after averaging 16 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game over 33 EuroLeague games and leading the league in PIR.[85] Dončić also repeated as the EuroLeague Rising Star, becoming the third back-to-back winner.[86] Not only that, but he earned the ACB Best Young Player and MVP accolades after helping his team defeat Kirolbet Baskonia in the league finals.[87] On June 29, 2018, Dončić parted ways with Real Madrid.[88][89] In November 2019, Dončić was nominated to the EuroLeague 2010–20 All-Decade Team.[90] In March 2020, he was selected for the 2010–20 All-Decade Team.[91][92] On March 23, 2021, the Real Madrid Football Club named Dončić and Spanish rally driver Carlos Sainz Sr. as honorary members, which is the highest distinction award of the club. The decision was made by the Real Madrid board of directors chaired by Florentino Pérez.[93][94] On June 21, 2018, Dončić was selected with the third overall pick by the Atlanta Hawks in the 2018 NBA draft. He was then traded to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for the draft rights to Trae Young and a protected future first-round pick in 2019.[95][96] After the draft, Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle said, \"At one point, we thought there might be a slight chance Dončić could fall to us, but a couple of days ago it was pretty clear that there was no way that was going to happen. He's just too good. We get a guy we think is franchise foundation piece.\"[97] Dončić signed his rookie contract with the Mavericks on July 9, 2018.[98] He did not play at the 2018 NBA Summer League due to his late buyout from Real Madrid.[99] Before the 2018–19 season, ESPN considered Dončić the favorite to win the NBA Rookie of the Year award.[100] Dončić made his regular-season debut on October 17, 2018, recording 10 points, eight rebounds, and four assists in a 121–100 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[101] On October 20, Dončić recorded 26 points and 6 rebounds in a 140–136 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.[102] He became the youngest 20-point scorer in franchise history.[103] On October 29, Dončić posted 31 points and eight rebounds in a 113–108 loss to the San Antonio Spurs for his first 30-point game in the NBA.[104] Three weeks later, Dončić recorded his first NBA double-double, with 15 points and 10 rebounds in a 98–88 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies.[105] He was named NBA Rookie of the Month in the Western Conference for November 2018.[106] On December 8, Dončić scored 21 points in a 107–104 victory over the Houston Rockets.

Dončić became the youngest Western Conference Player of the Month winner since the league began issuing the award by conferences in the 2001–02 season.[137] In December, he was named Sports Illustrated 2019 Breakout of the Year.[138] On December 8, 2019, Dončić surpassed the record for the most consecutive games with at least 20 points, five rebounds, and five assists since the ABA-NBA merger in 1976. Michael Jordan previously held the record with 18 straight games in 1989.[139] Dončić recorded his tenth triple-double of the season on January 4, 2020, posting 39 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 123–120 loss to the Charlotte Hornets.[140] During the 2019–20 season, Dončić was selected to his first NBA All-Star Game as a Western Conference starter.[141] Dončić became the youngest European player to start in an All-Star game.[142] On March 4, he recorded his 22nd career triple-double, passing Jason Kidd for the most in Mavericks history.

2018 NBA draft, Dončić was widely seen as one of the best and most accomplished European prospects of his generation.[293] Slam magazine considered Dončić the \"best international prospect ever,\"[15] and sports website SB Nation called him \"most accomplished NBA prospect in decades.\"[294] An anonymous NBA veteran scouting executive said that Dončić's game was \"leap years above anyone\" in his draft class.[295] Dončić is versatile on the offensive end, displaying proficiency in shooting three-pointers, mid-range jump shots, floaters, and shots in the post.[296] His basketball IQ, intangibles, and skills have been considered his primary assets, and Dončić is seen as an elite facilitator, especially on the pick and roll.[295] NBA and EuroLeague coach Ettore Messina called Dončić \"phenomenal, especially mentally\" for his age.[297] His lack of lateral quickness to stay in front of most NBA point guards and wings has been labeled one of his main flaws.[298][299][300] Dallas Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle refuted some of the worries regarding Dončić's athleticism, stating that \"for a 19-year-old, he's got a really unusual combination of size, speed, and deceptive quickness.\"[301] By his second year, Dončić's ability to accelerate off a pick and blow by defenders to get to the basket is seen as one of his strengths.[302] Given the false characterisation of Dončić's abilities and his subsequent success in the NBA, some speculate that prejudiced stereotyping might have had a role in his negative pre-draft evaluation.[303][304][305] Before his draft, basketball journalist and scout Austin Green compared Dončić to NBA players Paul Pierce and Joe Johnson.[306] Dončić compared himself to Ben Simmons due to his versatility.[307] In his second season, Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers, when asked about Dončić, stated that \"there's a lot of people in him.\" He likened Dončić's stepback three-pointers to James Harden, his passing ability to Larry Bird, and his court vision to LeBron James.[308] NBA analyst Kendrick Perkins called Dončić \"baby LeBron\" due to his overall skill and dominance on the court.[309] In December 2019, San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich called Dončić's playing style \"Magic Johnson-like\" because \"he sees the floor in that same way.\"[310] In August 2020, head coach Rick Carlisle compared Dončić's playmaking and court vision to Larry Bird and Jason Kidd.[311] Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo called Dončić \"one of the most talented guys I've ever played against.\"[312] During his first career playoff game against the Los Angeles Clippers, TV analyst and former point guard Mark Jackson, reiterated his view of Dončić, calling him \"an absolute combination of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.\"[313] In January 2024, former basketball player and Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd stated about Dončić that \"he's better than Dirk [Nowitzki]\" and that \"he's in the atmosphere of [Michael Jordan], the best to ever do it, LeBron [James], Kobe [Bryant]\".[314] In July 2023, Dončić got engaged to his longtime girlfriend Anamaria Goltes.[350] On December 1, 2023, his daughter Gabriela was born.[351][352] Dončić can speak four languages: Slovenian, Serbian, English, and Spanish.[353] He learned Spanish after joining Real Madrid.[354] In 2017, while playing at Real Madrid, Dončić signed a two-year deal with Nike.[355] In December 2019, it was announced that he had signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Air Jordan including a signature shoe, the Jordan Luka 1.[356][357][358] On July 14, 2021, it was announced that Dončić would be the cover athlete for NBA 2K22, the 23rd installment in the NBA 2K video game series.[359] In 2023 he inked a 6 year deal with Jordan, solidifying the continuation of his Jordan Luka line.[358] Dončić's 2018–19 Panini National Treasures basketball card sold for $4.6 million dollars in 2021.[360] Sports journalist Mina Kimes profiled Dončić in April 2018, writing that he is a gamer and enjoys playing Call of Duty, FIFA, and Overwatch.[307][361] Dončić's skill in the latter has been particularly noted, having reached the \"Grandmaster\" tier in competitive play in March 2023,[362] and later becoming a top 500 player in the tank role in Overwatch 2.[363] In 2018, he was noted as playing Genji and Hanzo,[361] and as a tank player, Dončić plays as Zarya.[362]",

The interrelationships of ethnicity, language and culture in the Celtic world are unclear and debated;[8] for example over the ways in which the Iron Age people of Britain and Ireland should be called Celts.[5][8][9][10] In current scholarship, 'Celt' primarily refers to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single ethnic group.[11] The history of pre-Celtic Europe and Celtic origins is debated. The traditional \"Celtic from the East\" theory, says the proto-Celtic language arose in the late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of central Europe, named after grave sites in southern Germany,[12][13] which flourished from around 1200 BC.[14] This theory links the Celts with the Iron Age Hallstatt culture which followed it (c. 1200–500 BC), named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt, Austria,[14][15] and with the following La Tène culture (c. 450 BC onward), named after the La Tène site in Switzerland. It proposes that Celtic culture spread westward and southward from these areas by diffusion or migration.[16] A newer theory, \"Celtic from the West\", suggests proto-Celtic arose earlier, was a lingua franca in the Atlantic Bronze Age coastal zone, and spread eastward.[17] Another newer theory, \"Celtic from the Centre\", suggests proto-Celtic arose between these two zones, in Bronze Age Gaul, then spread in various directions.[11] After the Celtic settlement of Southeast Europe in the 3rd century BC, Celtic culture reached as far east as central Anatolia, Turkey. The earliest undisputed examples of Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions from the 6th century BC.[18] Continental Celtic languages are attested almost exclusively through inscriptions and place-names. Insular Celtic languages are attested from the 4th century AD in Ogham inscriptions, though they were being spoken much earlier. Celtic literary tradition begins with Old Irish texts around the 8th century AD. Elements of Celtic mythology are recorded in early Irish and early Welsh literature. Most written evidence of the early Celts comes from Greco-Roman writers, who often grouped the Celts as barbarian tribes. They followed an ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. The Celts were often in conflict with the Romans, such as in the Roman–Gallic wars, the Celtiberian Wars, the conquest of Gaul and conquest of Britain. By the 1st century AD, most Celtic territories had become part of the Roman Empire. By c. 500, due to Romanisation and the migration of Germanic tribes, Celtic culture had mostly become restricted to Ireland, western and northern Britain, and Brittany. Between the 5th and 8th centuries, the Celtic-speaking communities in these Atlantic regions emerged as a reasonably cohesive cultural entity. They had a common linguistic, religious and artistic heritage that distinguished them from surrounding cultures.[19] Insular Celtic culture diversified into that of the Gaels (Irish, Scots and Manx) and the Celtic Britons (Welsh, Cornish, and Bretons) of the medieval and modern periods.[2][20][21] A modern Celtic identity[22] was constructed as part of the Romanticist Celtic Revival in Britain, Ireland, and other European territories such as Galicia.[23] Today, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton are still spoken in parts of their former territories, while Cornish and Manx are undergoing a revival. The first recorded use of the name 'Celts' – as Κελτοί (Keltoi) in Ancient Greek – was by Greek geographer Hecataeus of Miletus in 517 BC,[24] when writing about a people living near Massilia (modern Marseille), southern Gaul.[25] In the fifth century BC, Herodotus referred to Keltoi living around the source of the Danube and in the far west of Europe.[26] The etymology of Keltoi is unclear. Possible roots include Indo-European *kʲel 'to hide' (seen also in Old Irish ceilid, and Modern Welsh celu), *kʲel 'to heat' or *kel 'to impel'.[27] It may come from the Celtic language. Linguist Kim McCone supports this view and notes that Celt- is found in the names of several ancient Gauls such as Celtillus, father of Vercingetorix. He suggests it meant the people or descendants of \"the hidden one\", noting the Gauls claimed descent from an underworld god (according to Commentarii de Bello Gallico), and linking it with the Germanic Hel.[28] Others view it as a name coined by Greeks; among them linguist Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel, who suggests it meant \"the tall ones\".[29] In the first century BC, Roman leader Julius Caesar reported that the Gauls called themselves 'Celts', Latin: Celtae, in their own tongue.[30] Thus whether it was given to them by others or not, it was used by the Celts themselves. Greek geographer Strabo, writing about Gaul towards the end of the first century BC, refers to the \"race which is now called both Gallic and Galatic\", though he also uses Celtica as another name for Gaul. He reports Celtic peoples in Iberia too, calling them Celtiberi and Celtici.[31] Pliny the Elder noted the use of Celtici in Lusitania as a tribal surname,[32] which epigraphic findings have confirmed.[33][34] A Latin name for the Gauls, Galli (pl.), may come from a Celtic ethnic name, perhaps borrowed into Latin during the Celtic expansion into Italy from the early fifth century BC. Its root may be Proto-Celtic *galno, meaning \"power, strength\" (whence Old Irish gal \"boldness, ferocity\", Welsh gallu \"to be able, power\"). The Greek name Γαλάται (Galatai, Latinized Galatae) most likely has the same origin, referring to the Gauls who invaded southeast Europe and settled in Galatia.[35] The suffix -atai might be a Greek inflection.[36] Linguist Kim McCone suggests it comes from Proto-Celtic *galatis (\"ferocious, furious\"), and was not originally an ethnic name but a name for young warrior bands. He says \"If the Gauls' initial impact on the Mediterranean world was primarily a military one typically involving fierce young *galatīs, it would have been natural for the Greeks to apply this name for the type of Keltoi that they usually encountered\".[28] Because Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Κελτοί (Keltoi) or Celtae,[5][8][9] some scholars prefer not to use the term for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] However, they spoke Celtic languages, shared other cultural traits, and Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Gauls in customs and religion.[11] For at least 1,000 years the name Celt was not used at all, and nobody called themselves Celts or Celtic, until from about 1700, after the word 'Celtic' was rediscovered in classical texts, it was applied for the first time to the distinctive culture, history, traditions, language of the modern Celtic nations – Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Brittany, and the Isle of Man.[37] 'Celt' is a modern English word, first attested in 1707 in the writing of Edward Lhuyd, whose work, along with that of other late 17th-century scholars, brought academic attention to the languages and history of the early Celtic inhabitants of Great Britain.[38] The English words Gaul, Gauls (pl.) and Gaulish (first recorded in the 16–17th centuries) come from French Gaule and Gaulois, a borrowing from Frankish *Walholant, 'Roman-land' (see Gaul: Name), the root of which is Proto-Germanic *walha-, 'foreigner, Roman, Celt', whence the English word Welsh (Old English wælisċ). Proto-Germanic *walha comes from the name of the Volcae,[39] a Celtic tribe who lived first in southern Germany and central Europe, then migrated to Gaul.[40] This means that English Gaul, despite its superficial similarity, is not actually derived from Latin Gallia (which should have produced *Jaille in French),[citation needed] though it does refer to the same ancient region. Celtic refers to a language family and, more generally, means 'of the Celts' or 'in the style of the Celts'. Several archaeological cultures are considered Celtic, based on unique sets of artefacts. The link between language and artefact is aided by the presence of inscriptions.[41] The modern idea of a Celtic cultural identity or \"Celticity\" focuses on similarities among languages, works of art, and classical texts,[42] and sometimes also among material artefacts, social organisation, homeland and mythology.[43] Earlier theories held that these similarities suggest a common \"racial\" (race is now a contested concept) origin for the various Celtic peoples, but more recent theories hold that they reflect a common cultural and linguistic heritage more than a genetic one. Celtic cultures seem to have been diverse, with the use of a Celtic language being the main thing they had in common.[5] Today, the term 'Celtic' generally refers to the languages and cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, and Brittany; also called the Celtic nations. These are the regions where Celtic languages are still spoken to some extent. The four are Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton; plus two recent revivals, Cornish (a Brittonic language) and Manx (a Goidelic language). There are also attempts to reconstruct Cumbric, a Brittonic language of northern Britain. Celtic regions of mainland Europe are those whose residents claim a Celtic heritage, but where no Celtic language survives; these include western Iberia, i.e. Portugal and north-central Spain (Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Castile and León, Extremadura).[44] Continental Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of mainland Europe and Insular Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of the British and Irish islands, and their descendants. The Celts of Brittany derive their language from migrating Insular Celts from Britain and so are grouped accordingly.[45] The Celtic languages are a branch of the Indo-European languages. By the time Celts are first mentioned in written records around 400 BC, they were already split into several language groups, and spread over much of western mainland Europe, the Iberian Peninsula, Ireland and Britain. The languages developed into Celtiberian, Goidelic and Brittonic branches, among others.[46][47] The mainstream view during most of the twentieth century is that the Celts and the proto-Celtic language arose out of the Urnfield culture of central Europe around 1000 BC, spreading westward and southward over the following few hundred years.[14][48][49][50] The Urnfield culture was preeminent in central Europe during the late Bronze Age, circa 1200 BC to 700 BC. The spread of iron-working led to the Hallstatt culture (c. 800 to 500 BC) developing out of the Urnfield culture in a wide region north of the Alps. The Hallstatt culture developed into the La Tène culture from about 450 BC, which came to be identified with Celtic art.[citation needed] In 1846, Johann Georg Ramsauer unearthed an ancient grave field with distinctive grave goods at Hallstatt, Austria. Because the burials \"dated to roughly the time when Celts are mentioned near the Danube by Herodotus, Ramsauer concluded that the graves were Celtic\".[51] Similar sites and artifacts were found over a wide area, which were named the 'Hallstatt culture'. In 1857, the archaeological site of La Tène was discovered in Switzerland.[51] The huge collection of artifacts had a distinctive style. Artifacts of this 'La Tène style' were found elsewhere in Europe, \"particularly in places where people called Celts were known to have lived and early Celtic languages are attested. As a result, these items quickly became associated with the Celts, so much so that by the 1870s scholars began to regard finds of the La Tène as 'the archaeological expression of the Celts'\".[51] This cultural network was overrun by the Roman Empire, though traces of La Tène style were still seen in Gallo-Roman artifacts. In Britain and Ireland, the La Tène style survived precariously to re-emerge in Insular art.[citation needed] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to be challenged in the latter 20th century, when it was accepted that the oldest known Celtic-language inscriptions were those of Lepontic from the 6th century BC and Celtiberian from the 2nd century BC. These were found in northern Italy and Iberia, neither of which were part of the 'Hallstatt' nor 'La Tène' cultures at the time.[11] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory was partly based on ancient Greco-Roman writings, such as the Histories of Herodotus, which placed the Celts at the source of the Danube. However, Stephen Oppenheimer shows that Herodotus seemed to believe the Danube rose near the Pyrenees, which would place the Ancient Celts in a region which is more in agreement with later classical writers and historians (i.e. in Gaul and Iberia).[52] The theory was also partly based on the abundance of inscriptions bearing Celtic personal names in the Eastern Hallstatt region (Noricum). However, Patrick Sims-Williams notes that these date to the later Roman era, and says they suggest \"relatively late settlement by a Celtic-speaking elite\".[11] In the late 20th century, the Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to fall out of favour with some scholars, which was influenced by new archaeological finds. 'Celtic' began to refer primarily to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single culture or ethnic group.[11] A new theory suggested that Celtic languages arose earlier, along the Atlantic coast (including Britain, Ireland, Armorica and Iberia), long before evidence of 'Celtic' culture is found in archaeology. Myles Dillon and Nora Kershaw Chadwick argued that \"Celtic settlement of the British Isles\" might date to the Bell Beaker culture of the Copper and Bronze Age (from c. 2750 BC).[53][54] Martín Almagro Gorbea (2001) also proposed that Celtic arose in the 3rd millennium BC, suggesting that the spread of the Bell Beaker culture explained the wide dispersion of the Celts throughout western Europe, as well as the variability of the Celtic peoples.[55] Using a multidisciplinary approach, Alberto J. Lorrio and Gonzalo Ruiz Zapatero reviewed and built on Almagro Gorbea's work to present a model for the origin of Celtic archaeological groups in Iberia and proposing a rethinking of the meaning of \"Celtic\".[56] John T. Koch[57] and Barry Cunliffe[58] have developed this 'Celtic from the West' theory. It proposes that the proto-Celtic language arose along the Atlantic coast and was the lingua franca of the Atlantic Bronze Age cultural network, later spreading inland and eastward.[11] More recently, Cunliffe proposes that proto-Celtic had arisen in the Atlantic zone even earlier, by 3000 BC, and spread eastwards with the Bell Beaker culture over the following millennium. His theory is partly based on glottochronology, the spread of ancient Celtic-looking placenames, and thesis that the Tartessian language was Celtic.[11] However, the proposal that Tartessian was Celtic is widely rejected by linguists, many of whom regard it as unclassified.[59][60] Celticist Patrick Sims-Williams (2020) notes that in current scholarship, 'Celt' is primarily a linguistic label. In his 'Celtic from the Centre' theory, he argues that the proto-Celtic language did not originate in central Europe nor the Atlantic, but in-between these two regions. He suggests that it \"emerged as a distinct Indo-European dialect around the second millennium BC, probably somewhere in Gaul [centered in modern France] ... whence it spread in various directions and at various speeds in the first millennium BC\". Sims-Williams says this avoids the problematic idea \"that Celtic was spoken over a vast area for a very long time yet somehow avoided major dialectal splits\", and \"it keeps Celtic fairly close to Italy, which suits the view that Italic and Celtic were in some way linked\".[11] The Proto-Celtic language is usually dated to the Late Bronze Age.[14] The earliest records of a Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions of Cisalpine Gaul (Northern Italy), the oldest of which pre-date the La Tène period. Other early inscriptions, appearing from the early La Tène period in the area of Massilia, are in Gaulish, which was written in the Greek alphabet until the Roman conquest. Celtiberian inscriptions, using their own Iberian script, appear later, after about 200 BC. Evidence of Insular Celtic is available only from about 400 AD, in the form of Primitive Irish Ogham inscriptions.[citation needed] Besides epigraphic evidence, an important source of information on early Celtic is toponymy (place names).[61] Arnaiz-Villena et al. (2017) demonstrated that Celtic-related populations of the European Atlantic (Orkney Islands, Scottish, Irish, British, Bretons, Basques, Galicians) shared a common HLA system.[clarification needed][62] Other genetic research does not support the notion of a significant genetic link between these populations, beyond the fact that they are all West Europeans. Early European Farmers did settle Britain (and all of Northern Europe) in the Neolithic; however, recent genetics research has found that, between 2400 and 2000 BC, over 90% of British DNA was overturned by European Steppe Herders in a migration that brought large amounts of Steppe DNA (including the R1b haplogroup) to western Europe.[63] Modern autosomal genetic clustering is testament to this fact, as both modern and Iron Age British and Irish samples cluster genetically very closely with other North Europeans, and less so with Galicians, Basques or those from the south of France.[64][65] The concept that the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures could be seen not just as chronological periods but as \"Culture Groups\", entities composed of people of the same ethnicity and language, had started to grow by the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century the belief that these \"Culture Groups\" could be thought of in racial or ethnic terms was held by Gordon Childe, whose theory was influenced by the writings of Gustaf Kossinna.[66] As the 20th century progressed, the ethnic interpretation of La Tène culture became more strongly rooted, and any findings of La Tène culture and flat inhumation cemeteries were linked to the Celts and the Celtic language.[67] In various[clarification needed] academic disciplines the Celts were considered a Central European Iron Age phenomenon, through the cultures of Hallstatt and La Tène. However, archaeological finds from the Halstatt and La Tène culture were rare in Iberia, southwestern France, northern and western Britain, southern Ireland and Galatia[68][69] and did not provide enough evidence for a culture like that of Central Europe. It is equally difficult to maintain that the origin of the Iberian Celts can be linked to the preceding Urnfield culture. This has resulted in a newer theory that introduces a 'proto-Celtic' substratum and a process of Celticisation, having its initial roots in the Bronze Age Bell Beaker culture.[70] The La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age (from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC) in eastern France, Switzerland, Austria, southwest Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. It developed out of the Hallstatt culture without any definite cultural break, under the impetus of considerable Mediterranean influence from Greek, and later Etruscan civilisations. A shift of settlement centres took place in the 4th century. The western La Tène culture corresponds to historical Celtic Gaul. Whether this means that the whole of La Tène culture can be attributed to a unified Celtic people is difficult to assess; archaeologists have repeatedly concluded that language and material culture do not necessarily run parallel. Frey notes that in the 5th century, \"burial customs in the Celtic world were not uniform; rather, localised groups had their own beliefs, which, in consequence, also gave rise to distinct artistic expressions\".[71] Thus, while the La Tène culture is certainly associated with the Gauls, the presence of La Tène artefacts may be due to cultural contact and does not imply the permanent presence of Celtic speakers.[citation needed] The Greek historian Ephorus of Cyme in Asia Minor, writing in the 4th century BC, believed the Celts came from the islands off the mouth of the Rhine and were \"driven from their homes by the frequency of wars and the violent rising of the sea\". Polybius published a history of Rome about 150 BC in which he describes the Gauls of Italy and their conflict with Rome. Pausanias in the 2nd century AD says that the Gauls \"originally called Celts\", \"live on the remotest region of Europe on the coast of an enormous tidal sea\". Posidonius described the southern Gauls about 100 BC. Though his original work is lost, later writers such as Strabo used it. The latter, writing in the early 1st century AD, deals with Britain and Gaul as well as Hispania, Italy, and Galatia. Caesar wrote extensively about his Gallic Wars in 58–51 BC. Diodorus Siculus wrote about the Celts of Gaul and Britain in his 1st-century history.[citation needed] Diodorus Siculus and Strabo both suggest that the heartland of the people they call Celts was in southern Gaul. The former says that the Gauls were to the north of the Celts, but that the Romans referred to both as Gauls (linguistically the Gauls were certainly Celts). Before the discoveries at Hallstatt and La Tène, it was generally considered that the Celtic heartland was southern Gaul, see Encyclopædia Britannica for 1813.[citation needed] The Romans knew the Celts then living in present-day France as Gauls. The territory of these peoples probably included the Low Countries, the Alps and present-day northern Italy. Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars described the 1st-century BC descendants of those Gauls.[citation needed] Eastern Gaul became the centre of the western La Tène culture. In later Iron Age Gaul, the social organisation resembled that of the Romans, with large towns. From the 3rd century BC the Gauls adopted coinage. Texts with Greek characters from southern Gaul have survived from the 2nd century BC.[72] Greek traders founded Massalia about 600 BC, with some objects (mostly drinking ceramic vessels) being traded up the Rhône valley. But trade became disrupted soon after 500 BC and re-oriented over the Alps to the Po valley in the Italian peninsula. The Romans arrived in the Rhone valley in the 2nd century BC and encountered a mostly Celtic-speaking Gaul. Rome wanted land communications with its Iberian provinces and fought a major battle with the Saluvii at Entremont in 124–123 BC. Gradually Roman control extended, and the Roman province of Gallia Transalpina developed along the Mediterranean coast.[73][74] The Romans knew the remainder of Gaul as Gallia Comata, 'Long-haired Gaul'.[75] In 58 BC, the Helvetii planned to migrate westward but Julius Caesar forced them back. He then became involved in fighting the various tribes in Gaul, and by 55 BC had overrun most of Gaul. In 52 BC, Vercingetorix led a revolt against Roman occupation but was defeated at the Battle of Alesia and surrendered.[76] Following the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BC, Caesar's Celtica formed the main part of Roman Gaul, becoming the province of Gallia Lugdunensis. This territory of the Celtic tribes was bounded on the south by the Garonne and on the north by the Seine and the Marne.[77] The Romans attached large swathes of this region to neighbouring provinces Belgica and Aquitania, particularly under Augustus.[78] Place- and personal-name analysis and inscriptions suggest that Gaulish was spoken over most of what is now France.[79][80] Until the end of the 19th century, traditional scholarship dealing with the Celts did acknowledge their presence in the Iberian Peninsula[81][82] as a material culture relatable to the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures. However, since according to the definition of the Iron Age in the 19th century Celtic populations were supposedly rare in Iberia and did not provide a cultural scenario that could easily be linked to that of Central Europe, the presence of Celtic culture in that region was generally not fully recognised. Modern scholarship, however, has proven that Celtic presence and influences were most substantial in what is today Spain and Portugal (with perhaps the highest settlement saturation in Western Europe), particularly in the central, western and northern regions.[83][84] In addition to Gauls infiltrating from the north of the Pyrenees, the Roman and Greek sources mention Celtic populations in three parts of the Iberian Peninsula: the eastern part of the Meseta (inhabited by the Celtiberians), the southwest (Celtici, in modern-day Alentejo) and the northwest (Gallaecia and Asturias).[85] A modern scholarly review[86] found several archaeological groups of Celts in Spain: The origins of the Celtiberians might provide a key to understanding the Celticisation process in the rest of the Peninsula. The process of Celticisation of the southwestern area of the peninsula by the Keltoi and of the northwestern area is, however, not a simple Celtiberian question. Recent investigations about the Callaici[91] and Bracari[92] in northwestern Portugal are providing new approaches to understanding Celtic culture (language, art and religion) in western Iberia.[93] John T. Koch of Aberystwyth University suggested that Tartessian inscriptions of the 8th century BC might be classified as Celtic. This would mean that Tartessian is the earliest attested trace of Celtic by a margin of more than a century.[94] In Germany by the late Bronze Age, the Urnfield culture (c. 1300 BC – c. 750 BC) had replaced the Bell Beaker, Unetice and Tumulus cultures in central Europe,[97] whilst the Nordic Bronze Age had developed in Scandinavia and northern Germany. The Hallstatt culture, which had developed from the Urnfield culture, was the predominant Western and Central European culture from the 12th to 8th centuries BC and during the early Iron Age (8th to 6th centuries BC). It was followed by the La Tène culture (5th to 1st centuries BC). The people who had adopted these cultural characteristics in central and southern Germany are regarded as Celts. Celtic cultural centres developed in central Europe during the late Bronze Age (c. 1200 BC until 700 BC). Some, like the Heuneburg, the oldest city north of the Alps,[98] grew to become important cultural centres of the Iron Age in Central Europe, that maintained trade routes to the Mediterranean. In the 5th century BC the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned a Celtic city at the Danube – Pyrene, that historians attribute to the Heuneburg. Beginning around 700 BC (or later), Germanic peoples (Germanic tribes) from southern Scandinavia and northern Germany expanded south and gradually replaced the Celtic peoples in Central Europe.[99][100][101][102][103][104] The Canegrate culture represented the first migratory wave of the proto-Celtic[105][106] population from the northwest part of the Alps that, through the Alpine passes, had already penetrated and settled in the western Po valley between Lake Maggiore and Lake Como (Scamozzina culture). It has also been proposed that a more ancient proto-Celtic presence can be traced back to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, when North Westwern Italy appears closely linked regarding the production of bronze artefacts, including ornaments, to the western groups of the Tumulus culture.[107] La Tène cultural material appeared over a large area of mainland Italy,[108] the southernmost example being the Celtic helmet from Canosa di Puglia.[109] Italy is home to Lepontic, the oldest attested Celtic language (from the 6th century BC).[110] Anciently spoken in Switzerland and in Northern-Central Italy, from the Alps to Umbria.[111][112][113][114] According to the Recueil des Inscriptions Gauloises, more than 760 Gaulish inscriptions have been found throughout present-day France – with the notable exception of Aquitaine – and in Italy,[115][116] which testifies the importance of Celtic heritage in the peninsula.[citation needed] In 391 BC, Celts \"who had their homes beyond the Alps streamed through the passes in great strength and seized the territory that lay between the Apennine Mountains and the Alps\" according to Diodorus Siculus. The Po Valley and the rest of northern Italy (known to the Romans as Cisalpine Gaul) was inhabited by Celtic-speakers who founded cities such as Milan.[117] Later the Roman army was routed at the battle of Allia and Rome was sacked in 390 BC by the Senones.[118] At the battle of Telamon in 225 BC, a large Celtic army was trapped between two Roman forces and crushed.[119] The defeat of the combined Samnite, Celtic and Etruscan alliance by the Romans in the Third Samnite War sounded the beginning of the end of the Celtic domination in mainland Europe, but it was not until 192 BC that the Roman armies conquered the last remaining independent Celtic kingdoms in Italy.[citation needed] The Celts also expanded down the Danube river and its tributaries. One of the most influential tribes, the Scordisci, established their capital at Singidunum (present-day Belgrade, Serbia) in the 3rd century BC. The concentration of hill-forts and cemeteries shows a dense population in the Tisza valley of modern-day Vojvodina, Serbia, Hungary and into Ukraine. Expansion into Romania was however blocked by the Dacians.[citation needed] The Serdi were a Celtic tribe[120] inhabiting Thrace. They were located around and founded Serdika (Bulgarian: Сердика, Latin: Ulpia Serdica, Greek: Σαρδῶν πόλις), now Sofia in Bulgaria,[121] which reflects their ethnonym. They would have established themselves in this area during the Celtic migrations at the end of the 4th century BC, though there is no evidence for their existence before the 1st century BC. Serdi are among traditional tribal names reported into the Roman era.[122] They were gradually Thracianized over the centuries but retained their Celtic character in material culture up to a late date.[when?][citation needed] According to other sources they may have been simply of Thracian origin,[123] according to others they may have become of mixed Thraco-Celtic origin. Further south, Celts settled in Thrace (Bulgaria), which they ruled for over a century, and Anatolia, where they settled as the Galatians (see also: Gallic Invasion of Greece). Despite their geographical isolation from the rest of the Celtic world, the Galatians maintained their Celtic language for at least 700 years. St Jerome, who visited Ancyra (modern-day Ankara) in 373 AD, likened their language to that of the Treveri of northern Gaul.[citation needed] For Venceslas Kruta, Galatia in central Turkey was an area of dense Celtic settlement.[citation needed] The Boii tribe gave their name to Bohemia, Bologna and possibly Bavaria, and Celtic artefacts and cemeteries have been discovered further east in what is now Poland and Slovakia. A Celtic coin (Biatec) from Bratislava's mint was displayed on the old Slovak 5-crown coin.[citation needed] As there is no archaeological evidence for large-scale invasions in some of the other areas, one current school of thought holds that Celtic language and culture spread to those areas by contact rather than invasion.[124] However, the Celtic invasions of Italy and the expedition in Greece and western Anatolia, are well documented in Greek and Latin history.[125][126] There are records of Celtic mercenaries in Egypt serving the Ptolemies. Thousands were employed in 283–246 BC and they were also in service around 186 BC. They attempted to overthrow Ptolemy II.[127] All living Celtic languages today belong to the Insular Celtic languages, derived from the Celtic languages spoken in Iron Age Britain and Ireland.[128] They separated into a Goidelic and a Brittonic branch early on. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, the Insular Celts were made up of the Celtic Britons, the Gaels (or Scoti), and the Picts (or Caledonians).[citation needed] The renown of insular Celts has caused a popular belief that Celtic clans only lived in the British Isles.[129] Linguists have debated whether a Celtic language came to the British Isles and then split, or whether the two branches arrived separately. The older view was that Celtic influence in the Isles was the result of successive migrations or invasions from the European mainland by diverse Celtic-speaking peoples over several centuries, accounting for the P-Celtic vs. Q-Celtic isogloss. This view has been challenged by the hypothesis that the islands' Celtic languages form an Insular Celtic dialect group.[130] In the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars often dated the \"arrival\" of Celtic culture in Britain (via an invasion model) to the 6th century BC, corresponding to archaeological evidence of Hallstatt influence and the appearance of chariot burials in what is now England. Cunliffe and Koch propose in their newer 'Celtic from the West' theory that Celtic languages reached the Isles earlier, with the Bell Beaker culture c.2500 BC, or even before this.[131][132] More recently, a major archaeogenetics study uncovered a migration into southern Britain in the Bronze Age from 1300 to 800 BC.[133] The newcomers were genetically most similar to ancient individuals from Gaul.[133] From 1000 BC, their genetic marker swiftly spread through southern Britain,[134] but not northern Britain.[133] The authors see this as a \"plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain\".[133] There was much less immigration during the Iron Age, so it is likely that Celtic reached Britain before then.[133] Cunliffe suggests that a branch of Celtic was already spoken in Britain, and the Bronze Age migration introduced the Brittonic branch.[135] Like many Celtic peoples on the mainland, the Insular Celts followed an Ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. Some of the southern British tribes had strong links with Gaul and Belgica, and minted their own coins. During the Roman occupation of Britain, a Romano-British culture emerged in the southeast. The Britons and Picts in the north, and the Gaels of Ireland, remained outside the empire. During the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 400s AD, there was significant Anglo-Saxon settlement of eastern and southern Britain, and some Gaelic settlement of its western coast. During this time, some Britons migrated to the Armorican peninsula, where their culture became dominant. Meanwhile, much of northern Britain (Scotland) became Gaelic. By the 10th century AD, the Insular Celtic peoples had diversified into the Brittonic-speaking Welsh (in Wales), Cornish (in Cornwall), Bretons (in Brittany) and Cumbrians (in the Old North); and the Gaelic-speaking Irish (in Ireland), Scots (in Scotland) and Manx (on the Isle of Man).[citation needed] Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Celtae or Κελτοί (Keltoi),[5][8][9] leading some scholars to question the use of the term 'Celt' for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] The first historical account of the islands was by the Greek geographer Pytheas, who sailed around what he called the \"Pretannikai nesoi\" (the \"Pretannic isles\") around 310–306 BC.[136] In general, classical writers referred to the Britons as Pretannoi (in Greek) or Britanni (in Latin).[137] Strabo, writing in Roman times, distinguished between the Celts and Britons.[138] However, Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Celts of Gaul in customs and religion.[11] Under Caesar the Romans conquered Celtic Gaul, and from Claudius onward the Roman empire absorbed parts of Britain. Roman local government of these regions closely mirrored pre-Roman tribal boundaries, and archaeological finds suggest native involvement in local government.[citation needed] The native peoples under Roman rule became Romanised and keen to adopt Roman ways. Celtic art had already incorporated classical influences, and surviving Gallo-Roman pieces interpret classical subjects or keep faith with old traditions despite a Roman overlay.[citation needed] The Roman occupation of Gaul, and to a lesser extent of Britain, led to Roman-Celtic syncretism. In the case of the continental Celts, this eventually resulted in a language shift to Vulgar Latin, while the Insular Celts retained their language.[citation needed] There was also considerable cultural influence exerted by Gaul on Rome, particularly in military matters and horsemanship, as the Gauls often served in the Roman cavalry. The Romans adopted the Celtic cavalry sword, the spatha, and Epona, the Celtic horse goddess.[139][140] To the extent that sources are available, they depict a pre-Christian Iron Age Celtic social structure based formally on class and kingship, although this may only have been a particular late phase of organisation in Celtic societies. Patron-client relationships similar to those of Roman society are also described by Caesar and others in the Gaul of the 1st century BC.[citation needed] In the main, the evidence is of tribes being led by kings, although some argue that there is also evidence of oligarchical republican forms of government eventually emerging in areas which had close contact with Rome. Most descriptions of Celtic societies portray them as being divided into three groups: a warrior aristocracy; an intellectual class including professions such as druid, poet, and jurist; and everyone else. In historical times, the offices of high and low kings in Ireland and Scotland were filled by election under the system of tanistry, which eventually came into conflict with the feudal principle of primogeniture in which succession goes to the first-born son.[citation needed] Little is known of family structure among the Celts. Patterns of settlement varied from decentralised to urban. The popular stereotype of non-urbanised societies settled in hillforts and duns,[141] drawn from Britain and Ireland (there are about 3,000 hill forts known in Britain)[142] contrasts with the urban settlements present in the core Hallstatt and La Tène areas, with the many significant oppida of Gaul late in the first millennium BC, and with the towns of Gallia Cisalpina.[citation needed] Slavery, as practised by the Celts, was very likely similar to the better documented practice in ancient Greece and Rome.[143] Slaves were acquired from war, raids, and penal and debt servitude.[143] Slavery was hereditary,[144] though manumission was possible. The Old Irish and Welsh words for 'slave', cacht and caeth respectively, are cognate with Latin captus 'captive' suggesting that the slave trade was an early means of contact between Latin and Celtic societies.[143] In the Middle Ages, slavery was especially prevalent in the Celtic countries.[145] Manumissions were discouraged by law and the word for 'female slave', cumal, was used as a general unit of value in Ireland.[146] There are only very limited records from pre-Christian times written in Celtic languages. These are mostly inscriptions in the Roman and sometimes Greek alphabets. The ogham script, an Early Medieval alphabet, was mostly used in early Christian times in Ireland and Scotland (but also in Wales and England), and was only used for ceremonial purposes such as inscriptions on gravestones. The available evidence is of a strong oral tradition, such as that preserved by bards in Ireland, and eventually recorded by monasteries. Celtic art also produced a great deal of intricate and beautiful metalwork, examples of which have been preserved by their distinctive burial rites.[147] In some regards the Atlantic Celts were conservative: for example, they still used chariots in combat long after they had been reduced to ceremonial roles by the Greeks and Romans. However, despite being outdated, Celtic chariot tactics were able to repel the invasions of Britain attempted by Julius Caesar.[148] According to Diodorus Siculus: The Gauls are tall of body with rippling muscles and white of skin and their hair is blond, and not only naturally so for they also make it their practice by artificial means to increase the distinguishing colour which nature has given it. For they are always washing their hair in limewater and they pull it back from the forehead to the nape of the neck, with the result that their appearance is like that of Satyrs and Pans since the treatment of their hair makes it so heavy and coarse that it differs in no respect from the mane of horses. Some of them shave the beard but others let it grow a little; and the nobles shave their cheeks but they let the moustache grow until it covers the mouth. During the later Iron Age the Gauls generally wore long-sleeved shirts or tunics and long trousers (called braccae by the Romans).[149] Clothes were made of wool or linen, with some silk being used by the rich. Cloaks were worn in the winter. Brooches[150] and armlets were used, but the most famous item of jewellery was the torc, a neck collar of metal, sometimes gold. The horned Waterloo Helmet in the British Museum, which long set the standard for modern images of Celtic warriors, is in fact a unique survival, and may have been a piece for ceremonial rather than military wear.[151] Archaeological evidence suggests that the pre-Roman Celtic societies were linked to the network of overland trade routes that spanned Eurasia. Archaeologists have discovered large prehistoric trackways crossing bogs in Ireland and Germany. Due to their substantial nature, these are believed to have been created for wheeled transport as part of an extensive roadway system that facilitated trade.[152] The territory held by the Celts contained tin, lead, iron, silver and gold.[153] Celtic smiths and metalworkers created weapons and jewellery for international trade, particularly with the Romans.[154] The myth that the Celtic monetary system consisted of wholly barter is a common one, but is in part false. The monetary system was complex and is still not understood (much like the late Roman coinages), and due to the absence of large numbers of coin items, it is assumed that \"proto-money\" was used. This included bronze items made from the early La Tène period and onwards, which were often in the shape of axeheads, rings, or bells. Due to the large number of these present in some burials, it is thought they had a relatively high monetary value, and could be used for \"day to day\" purchases. Low-value coinages of potin, a bronze alloy with high tin content, were minted in most Celtic areas of the continent and in South-East Britain prior to the Roman conquest of these lands. Higher-value coinages, suitable for use in trade, were minted in gold, silver, and high-quality bronze. Gold coinage was much more common than silver coinage, despite being worth substantially more, as while there were around 100 mines in Southern Britain and Central France, silver was more rarely mined. This was due partly to the relative sparsity of mines and the amount of effort needed for extraction compared to the profit gained. As the Roman civilisation grew in importance and expanded its trade with the Celtic world, silver and bronze coinage became more common. This coincided with a major increase in gold production in Celtic areas to meet the Roman demand, due to the high value Romans put on the metal. The large number of gold mines in France is thought to be a major reason why Caesar invaded.[155] Very few reliable sources exist regarding Celtic views on gender roles, though some archaeological evidence suggests their views may have differed from those of the Greco-Roman world, which tended to be less egalitarian.[156][157] Some Iron Age burials in northeastern Gaul suggest women may have had roles in warfare during the earlier La Tène period, but the evidence is far from conclusive.[158] Celtic individuals buried with both female jewellery and weaponry have been found, such as the Vix Grave in northeastern Gaul, and there are questions about the gender of some individuals buried with weaponry. However, it has been suggested that the weapons indicate high social rank rather than masculinity.[159] Most written accounts of the Ancient Celts are from the Romans and Greeks, though it is not clear how accurate these are. Roman historians Ammianus Marcellinus and Tacitus mentioned Celtic women inciting, participating in, and leading battles.[160] Plutarch reports that Celtic women acted as ambassadors to avoid a war among Celtic chiefdoms in the Po valley during the 4th century BC.[161] Posidonius' anthropological comments on the Celts had common themes, primarily primitivism, extreme ferocity, cruel sacrificial practices, and the strength and courage of their women.[162] Cassius Dio suggests there was great sexual freedom among women in Celtic Britain:[163] ... a very witty remark is reported to have been made by the wife of Argentocoxus, a Caledonian, to Julia Augusta. When the empress was jesting with her, after the treaty, about the free intercourse of her sex with men in Britain, she replied: \"We fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way than do you Roman women; for we consort openly with the best men, whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest\". Such was the retort of the British woman. Barry Cunliffe writes that such references are \"likely to be ill-observed\" and meant to portray the Celts as outlandish \"barbarians\".[164] Historian Lisa Bitel argues the descriptions of Celtic women warriors are not credible. She says some Roman and Greek writers wanted to show that the barbarian Celts lived in \"an upside-down world ... and a standard ingredient in such a world was the manly warrior woman\".[165] The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote in his Politics that the Celts of southeastern Europe approved of male homosexuality. Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote in his Bibliotheca historica that although Gaulish women were beautiful, the men had \"little to do with them\" and it was a custom for men to sleep on animal skins with two younger males. He further claimed that \"the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused\". His claim was later repeated by Greco-Roman writers Athenaeus and Ammianus.[166] H. David Rankin, in Celts and the Classical World, suggests some of these claims refer to bonding rituals in warrior groups, which required abstinence from women at certain times,[167] and says it probably reflects \"the warlike character of early contacts between the Celts and the Greeks\".[168] Under Brehon Law, which was written down in early Medieval Ireland after conversion to Christianity, a woman had the right to divorce her husband and gain his property if he was unable to perform his marital duties due to impotence, obesity, homosexual inclination or preference for other women.[169][170][failed verification] Celtic art is generally used by art historians to refer to art of the La Tène period across Europe, while the Early Medieval art of Britain and Ireland, that is what \"Celtic art\" evokes for much of the general public, is called Insular art in art history. Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence. Energetic circular forms, triskeles and spirals are characteristic. Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from Pictish stones and the Insular high crosses, large monumental sculpture, even with decorative carving, is very rare; possibly it was originally common in wood. Celts were also able to create developed musical instruments such as the carnyces, these famous war trumpets used before the battle to frighten the enemy, as the best preserved found in Tintignac (Gaul) in 2004 and which were decorated with a boar head or a snake head.[171] The interlace patterns that are often regarded as typical of \"Celtic art\" were characteristic of the whole of the British Isles, a style referred to as Insular art, or Hiberno-Saxon art. This artistic style incorporated elements of La Tène, Late Roman, and, most importantly, animal Style II of Germanic Migration Period art. The style was taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and illuminated manuscripts. Equally, the forms used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: Gospel books like the Book of Kells and Book of Lindisfarne, chalices like the Ardagh Chalice and Derrynaflan Chalice, and penannular brooches like the Tara Brooch and Roscrea Brooch. These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the Viking attacks sharply set back cultural life.[citation needed] In contrast the less well known but often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other \"foreign\" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic. After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially Ancient Roman pottery, of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including figurines of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalised styles. Roman Britain also took more interest in enamel than most of the Empire, and its development of champlevé technique was probably important to the later Medieval art of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom of Insular decoration was an important element. Rising nationalism brought Celtic revivals from the 19th century.[citation needed] The Coligny calendar, which was found in 1897 in Coligny, Ain, was engraved on a bronze tablet, preserved in 73 fragments, that originally was 1.48 metres (4 feet 10 inches) wide and 0.9 metres (2 feet 11 inches) high (Lambert p. 111). Based on the style of lettering and the accompanying objects, it probably dates to the end of the 2nd century.[172] It is written in Latin inscriptional capitals, and is in Gaulish. The restored tablet contains 16 vertical columns, with 62 months distributed over 5 years.[citation needed] French archaeologist J. Monard speculated that it was recorded by druids wishing to preserve their tradition of timekeeping in a time when the Julian calendar was imposed throughout the Roman Empire. However, the general form of the calendar suggests the public peg calendars (or parapegmata) found throughout the Greek and Roman world.[173] Tribal warfare appears to have been a regular feature of Celtic societies. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for economic advantage, and in some instances to conquer territory.[citation needed] The Celts were described by classical writers such as Strabo, Livy, Pausanias, and Florus as fighting like \"wild beasts\", and as hordes. Dionysius said that their:[174] [175] manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in military science. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of wild boars, throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target, as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all. Polybius (2.33) indicates that the principal Celtic weapon was a long bladed sword which was used for hacking edgewise rather than stabbing. Celtic warriors are described by Polybius and Plutarch as frequently having to cease fighting in order to straighten their sword blades. This claim has been questioned by some archaeologists, who note that Noric steel, steel produced in Celtic Noricum, was famous in the Roman Empire period and was used to equip the Roman military.[176][177] However, Radomir Pleiner, in The Celtic Sword (1993) argues that \"the metallographic evidence shows that Polybius was right up to a point\", as around one third of surviving swords from the period might well have behaved as he describes.[178] In addition to these long bladed slashing swords, spears and specialized javelins were also used.[179] Polybius also asserts that certain of the Celts fought naked: \"The appearance of these naked warriors was a terrifying spectacle, for they were all men of splendid physique and in the prime of life.\"[180] According to Livy, this was also true of the Celts of Asia Minor.[181] Celts had a reputation as head hunters.[182] Paul Jacobsthal says: \"Amongst the Celts the human head was venerated above all else, since the head was to the Celt the soul, centre of the emotions as well as of life itself, a symbol of divinity and of the powers of the other-world.\"[183] Writing in the first century BC, Greek historians Posidonius and Diodorus Siculus said Celtic warriors cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle, hung them from the necks of their horses, then nailed them up outside their homes.[182] Strabo wrote in the same century that Celts embalmed the heads of their most esteemed enemies in cedar oil and put them on display.[182] Roman historian Livy wrote that the Boii beheaded a defeated Roman general after the Battle of Silva Litana, covered his skull in gold, and used it as a ritual cup.[182] Archaeologists have found evidence that heads were embalmed and displayed by the southern Gauls.[184][185] In another example, at the southern Gaulish site of Entremont, there stood a pillar carved with skulls, within which were niches where human skulls were kept, nailed into position.[186] Roquepertuse nearby has similar carved heads and skull niches. Many lone carved heads have been found in Celtic regions, some with two or three faces.[187] Examples include the Mšecké Žehrovice Head and the Corleck Head. Severed heads are a common motif in Insular Celtic myths, and there are many tales in which 'living heads' preside over feasts or speak prophecies.[182][187] The beheading game is a motif in Irish myth and Arthurian legend, most famously in the tale Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, where the Green Knight picks up his own severed head after Gawain has struck it off. There are also many legends in Celtic regions of saints who carry their own severed heads. In Irish myth, the severed heads of warriors are called the mast or nuts of the goddess Macha.[188] Like other European Iron Age societies, the Celts practised a polytheistic religion and believed in an afterlife.[189][190][unreliable source] Celtic religion varied by region and over time, but had \"broad structural similarities\",[189] and there was \"a basic religious homogeneity\" among the Celtic peoples.[191] Because the ancient Celts did not have writing, evidence about their religion is gleaned from archaeology, Greco-Roman accounts, and literature from the early Christian period.[192] The names of over two hundred Celtic deities have survived (see list of Celtic deities), although it is likely that many of these were alternative names, regional names or titles for the same deity.[189] Some deities were venerated only in one region, but others were more widely known.[189] According to Miranda Aldhouse-Green, the Celts were also animists, believing that every part of the natural world had a spirit.[192] The Celts seem to have had a father god, who was often a god of the tribe and of the dead (Toutatis probably being one name for him); and a mother goddess who was associated with the land, earth and fertility[193] (Dea Matrona probably being one name for her). The mother goddess could also take the form of a war goddess as protectress of her tribe and its land.[193] There also seems to have been a male celestial god—identified with Taranis—associated with thunder, the wheel, and the bull.[193] There were gods of skill and craft, such as the pan-regional god Lugus, and the smith god Gobannos.[193] Celtic healing deities were often associated with sacred springs,[193] such as Sirona and Borvo. Other pan-regional deities include the horned god Cernunnos, the horse and fertility goddess Epona, the divine son Maponos, as well as Belenos, Ogmios, and Sucellos.[189][192] Caesar says the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[189] Triplicity is a common theme in Celtic cosmology, and a number of deities were seen as threefold,[194] for example the Three Mothers.[195] Celtic religious ceremonies were overseen by priests known as druids, who also served as judges, teachers, and lore-keepers. Other classes of druids performed sacrifices for the perceived benefit of the community.[196] There is evidence that ancient Celtic peoples sacrificed animals, almost always livestock or working animals. It appears some were offered wholly to the gods (by burying or burning), while some were shared between gods and humans (part eaten and part offered).[197] There is also some evidence that ancient Celts sacrificed humans, and some Greco-Roman sources claim the Gauls sacrificed criminals by burning them in a wicker man.[198] The Romans said the Celts held ceremonies in sacred groves and other natural shrines, called nemetons.[189] Some Celtic peoples built temples or ritual enclosures of varying shapes (such as the Romano-Celtic temple and viereckschanze), though they also maintained shrines at natural sites.[189] Celtic peoples often made votive offerings: treasured items deposited in water and wetlands, or in ritual shafts and wells, often in the same place over generations.[189] Modern clootie wells might be a continuation of this.[199] Most surviving Celtic mythology belongs to the Insular Celtic peoples: Irish mythology has the largest written body of myths, followed by Welsh mythology. These were written down in the early Middle Ages, mainly by Christian scribes. The supernatural race called the Tuatha Dé Danann are believed to represent the main Celtic gods of Ireland. Their traditional rivals are the Fomóire, whom they defeat in the Battle of Mag Tuired.[200] Barry Cunliffe says the underlying structure in Irish myth was a dualism between the male tribal god and the female goddess of the land.[189] The Dagda seems to have been the chief god and the Morrígan his consort, each of whom had other names.[189] One common motif is the sovereignty goddess, who represents the land and bestows sovereignty on a king by marrying him. The goddess Brigid was linked with nature as well as poetry, healing and smithing.[194] Some figures in medieval Insular Celtic myth have ancient continental parallels: Irish Lugh and Welsh Lleu are cognate with Lugus, Goibniu and Gofannon with Gobannos, Macán and Mabon with Maponos, while Macha and Rhiannon may be counterparts of Epona.[201] In Insular Celtic myth, the Otherworld is a parallel realm where the gods dwell. Some mythical heroes visit it by entering ancient burial mounds or caves, by going under water or across the western sea, or after being offered a silver apple branch by an Otherworld resident.[202] Irish myth says that the spirits of the dead travel to the house of Donn (Tech Duinn), a legendary ancestor; this echoes Caesar's comment that the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[189] Insular Celtic peoples celebrated four seasonal festivals, known to the Gaels as Beltaine (1 May), Lughnasa (1 August), Samhain (1 November) and Imbolc (1 February).[189] The Roman invasion of Gaul brought a great deal of Celtic peoples into the Roman Empire. Roman culture had a profound effect on the Celtic tribes which came under the empire's control. Roman influence led to many changes in Celtic religion, the most noticeable of which was the weakening of the druid class, especially religiously; the druids were to eventually disappear altogether. Romano-Celtic deities also began to appear: these deities often had both Roman and Celtic attributes, combined the names of Roman and Celtic deities, or included couples with one Roman and one Celtic deity. Other changes included the adaptation of the Jupiter Column, a sacred column set up in many Celtic regions of the empire, primarily in northern and eastern Gaul. Another major change in religious practice was the use of stone monuments to represent gods and goddesses. The Celts had probably only created wooden cult images (including monuments carved into trees, which were known as sacred poles) before the Roman conquest.[195] While the regions under Roman rule adopted Christianity along with the rest of the Roman empire, unconquered areas of Ireland and Scotland began to move from Celtic polytheism to Christianity in the 5th century. Ireland was converted by missionaries from Britain, such as Saint Patrick. Later missionaries from Ireland were a major source of missionary work in Scotland, Anglo-Saxon parts of Britain, and central Europe (see Hiberno-Scottish mission). Celtic Christianity, the forms of Christianity that took hold in Britain and Ireland at this time, had for some centuries only limited and intermittent contact with Rome and continental Christianity, as well as some contacts with Coptic Christianity. Some elements of Celtic Christianity developed, or retained, features that made them distinct from the rest of Western Christianity, most famously their conservative method of calculating the date of Easter. In 664, the Synod of Whitby began to resolve these differences, mostly by adopting the current Roman practices, which the Gregorian Mission from Rome had introduced to Anglo-Saxon England.[citation needed] Genetic studies on the limited amount of material available suggest continuity between Iron Age people from areas considered Celtic and the earlier Bell Beaker culture of Bronze Age Western Europe.[206][207][208] Like the Bell Beakers, ancient Celts carried a substantial amount of Western Steppe Herders ancestry, which is derived from Yamnaya pastoralists who expanded westwards from the Pontic–Caspian steppe during the late Neolithic and the early Bronze Age and associated with the initial spread of Indo-European languages.[209] This ancestry was particularly prevalent among Celts of Northwest Europe.[208] Examined individuals overwhelmingly carry types of the paternal haplogroup R-M269,[203][204][205] while the maternal haplogroups H and U are frequent.[210][211] These lineages are associated with steppe ancestry.[203][210] The spread of Celts into Iberia and the emergence of the Celtiberians is associated with an increase in north-central European ancestry in Iberia, and may be connected to the expansion of the Urnfield culture.[212] The paternal haplogroup haplogroup I2a1a1a has been detected among Celtiberians.[213] There appears to have been significant gene flow among Celtic peoples of Western Europe during the Iron Age.[214][208] While the Gauls of southern France display genetic links with the Celtiberians, the Gauls of northern France display links with Great Britain and Sweden.[215] Modern populations of Western Europe, particularly those who still speak Celtic languages, display substantial genetic continuity with the Iron Age populations of the same areas.[216][217][218] Geography Organisations",

                "content": "Celtic refers to Irish culture and heritage, along with the historical people who migrated from the British Isles throughout much of Europe. While the early pronunciation was with an /s/ sound, reflecting its nearest origin in French, the modern standard is a hard \"c\" sound like /k/. This is because language historians desired the word to better reflect its Greek and Classical Latin origins. The soft \"c\" sound is usually reserved for sports teams now, like the Boston Celtics. Be it in the pub or in the halls of academia, whenever the topic of Irish culture, language, music, literature—basically, anything Irish—is brought up, the words Celt and Celtic are bound to be heard. In modern-day English, those words are commonly used in reference to the Irish people and their widely-accepted traditions (of course everybody is Irish on St. Patrick's Day; the Celtic cross or knot is a popular tattoo; the Claddagh ring makes a nice gift). The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The etymology of the noun Celt—from which the adjective Celtic is derived—is straightforward. It's a 16th-century borrowing of the French word Celte, which itself is from Latin Celta, the singular of Celtae, which is the name for a member of an early Indo-European people from antiquity who spread over much of Europe from the British Isles and Spain to Asia Minor. The Latin name is derived from Greek Keltoi, and both the Latin and Greek words referred to the Gauls, the Celtic people who occupied the region that is now France and Belgium. See? Straightforward. With that history laid out, we're wondering how you pronounced all the capital 'c' and 'k' words, especially if you're unfamiliar with French, Latin, Greek, and even English Celt and Celtic, for that matter. The question: is the 'c' sounded \\s\\ or \\k\\? Following its French and Latin predecessors, early pronunciation of Celt was actually \\SELT\\. (In French and Latin, the 'c' is pronounced \\s\\, as in the last name of the French painter Paul Cézanne and in Latin century.) The pronunciation \\KELT\\ started being heard as early as the 18th century, which, in time, ushered in the variant spelling Kelt. The variants were introduced by language and history academics who believed that the pronunciation of Celt should reflect the initial \\k\\ sound in the ancient Greek Keltoi and the Classical Latin Celtae. (It wasn't until the Middle Ages that the letter 'c' in Latin began being pronounced before vowels as the combination \\ts\\—prior, it was pronounced \\k\\; English speakers subsequently reduced the Latin 'c' to a simple \\s\\.) Outside of academia, the variant Kelt never caught on, and it is rarely if ever used today; however, the \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic has since flourished. Another influence on pronouncing Celt and Celtic with a soft 'c' is English's phonetic rule for 'c' when followed by 'e' (or 'i,' as in circus or Cicero), which says that, in such cases, the 'c' is usually pronounced as \\s\\. Think cell, cereal, ceiling, and dance. Nevertheless, English speakers, especially those who wanted to sound knowledgeable about things Celtic, grew to prefer the hard 'c' pronunciation, which harkened back to the words' ancient roots. From the 18th century onward, more and more people began sounding the words with an initial \\k\\. By the mid-20th century, \\k\\ became the norm, which is fitting since the pronunciation is in line with that of the Celtic family of languages that include Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Breton, and the now-extinct (or, depending on who you talk to, nearly extinct) languages Manx and Cornish. Apparently, people appreciated the ethnic pronunciation. This shift in the pronunciation of Celt is fully evinced when comparing H. W. Fowler's 1926 Dictionary of Modern English with Robert Burchfield's 1996 revised edition. Here's what Fowler had to say about Celt(ic): \"The spelling C-, & the pronunciation s-, are the established ones, & no useful purpose seems to be served by the substitution of k-.\" Decades later, Burchfield observes a different trend: \"Except for the football club Celtic (in Glasgow), which is pronounced [SEL-tik], both Celt and Celtic are pronounced with initial \\k\\ in standard English.\" Burchfield is referring to the Scottish Celtic Football Club, founded in 1887. In America, there is basketball's Boston Celtics, founded in 1946, whose name is also pronounced with an initial \\s\\. The European away support that Celtic enjoys is phenomenal. Few clubs have a fanbase that travels in such numbers or makes as much noise, all the more remarkable when you consider the poor record that the club has away from home in recent times.— Liam Kelly, The Celtic Star, 20 Feb. 2020 Aside from this use of the initial soft 'c' in sports teams' names, Celtic with a hard 'c' is the standard; however, you might still sometimes hear the 'c' softly sounded by those who are uninitiated in the history and etymology of Celt and Celtic as well as those who are unfamiliar with the words and resort to the phonetic rules of English. (And, as happens so often in English, those phonetic rules let them down.) See Definitions and Examples » Get Word of the Day daily email! Learn a new word every day.

        "Mariah Carey": [
            {
                "title": "Mariah Carey - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Mariah Carey (/məˈraɪə/ mə-RY-ə;[1]: 0:01 born March 27, 1969)[a] is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. Dubbed the \"Songbird Supreme\" by Guinness World Records, Carey is known for her five-octave vocal range, melismatic singing style and signature use of the whistle register. An influential figure in music, she was ranked as the fifth greatest singer of all time by Rolling Stone in 2023. Carey rose to fame in 1990 with her self-titled debut album and became the only artist to have their first five singles reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, from \"Vision of Love\" to \"Emotions\". She achieved an international success with the best-selling albums Music Box (1993) and Daydream (1995), before adopting a new image with hip hop-inflected sounds, following the release of Butterfly (1997). The remix of her song \"Fantasy\", featuring Ol' Dirty Bastard, popularized the blend of pop and hip-hop into mainstream music. With eleven consecutive years of US number-one songs, Billboard ranked Carey as the most successful artist of the 1990s. Following a career decline and the failure of her 2001 film Glitter, she returned to the top of the charts with The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. Carey's public and personal life, including her diva persona, high-profile relationships and public breakdown in 2001, has received widespread media coverage. She has also been dubbed the \"Queen of Christmas\" due to the enduring popularity of her holiday music, particularly Merry Christmas (1994), the best-selling holiday album, and its single \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", which is the best selling holiday single by a female artist of all time. Outside of music, she has acted in major roles in the films Tennessee (2008), Precious (2009), The Butler (2013), A Christmas Melody (2015), and The Lego Batman Movie (2017). Carey also served as an American Idol judge in 2013 and starred in the docu-series Mariah's World. She published a memoir, The Meaning of Mariah Carey, in 2020. Carey is one of the best-selling music artists, with over 220 million records sold worldwide. She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame, and the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress. Her accolades include 5 competitive Grammy Awards and a Grammy Global Impact Award, 10 American Music Awards, 19 World Music Awards and 20 Billboard Music Awards. She holds the record for the most Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles by a solo artist (19), a female songwriter (18), and a female producer (15), spending a record 96 weeks atop the chart. \"One Sweet Day\" and \"We Belong Together\" were ranked by Billboard as the most successful songs of the 1990s and 2000s, respectively. Carey is the highest-certified female artist in the United States and 10th overall, with 75 million certified album-equivalent units. Carey was born on March 27, 1969,[a] in Huntington, New York.[5][6] Her name is derived from the song \"They Call the Wind Maria\", originally from the 1951 Broadway musical Paint Your Wagon.[7][8] She is the youngest of three children born to Patricia (née Hickey), a former opera singer and vocal coach of Irish descent, and Alfred Roy Carey, an aeronautical engineer of both African-American and Afro-Venezuelan lineage. The last name \"Carey\" was adopted by her Venezuelan grandfather, Francisco Núñez, after he emigrated to New York.[9][6] Patricia's family disowned her for marrying a black man. Racial tensions prevented the Carey family from integrating into their community. While they lived in Huntington, their neighbors poisoned the family dog and set fire to their car.[9] After her parents' divorce, Carey had little contact with Alfred, and Patricia worked several jobs to support the family. Carey spent much of her time at home alone and began singing at age three, often imitating her mother's take on Verdi's opera Rigoletto in Italian. Her older sister Alison moved in with their father while Mariah and her elder brother Morgan lived with their mother.[10][11] During her years in elementary school, she excelled in the arts, such as music and literature. Carey began writing poetry and lyrics while attending Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York,[12] where she graduated in 1987.[13] Carey began vocal training under her mother's guidance. Though she was a classically trained opera singer, Patricia Carey never pressured her daughter to pursue a career in classical opera. Mariah Carey recalled that she had \"never been a pushy mom. She never said, 'Give it more of an operatic feel.' I respect opera like crazy, but it didn't influence me.\"[12][14] In high school, Mariah Carey was often absent because of her work as a demo singer. This led to her classmates giving her the nickname Mirage.[14] Working in the Long Island music scene gave her opportunities to work with musicians such as Gavin Christopher and Ben Margulies, with whom she co-wrote material for her demo tape. After moving to New York City, she worked part-time jobs to pay the rent and completed 500 hours of beauty school.[15] Carey moved into a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan with four female students as roommates.[16] She landed a gig singing backup for freestyle singer Brenda K. Starr.[17][18] In December 1988, Carey accompanied Starr to a music executive's party and handed her demo tape to the head of Columbia Records, Tommy Mottola.[19][20] After listening to the tape during the ride home, he immediately requested the driver turn around. She had already left the event, and Mottola spent two weeks looking for her. Another record label expressed interest and a bidding war ensued. He signed Carey to Columbia and enlisted producers Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden, and Rhett Lawrence for her first album.[19] Columbia marketed Carey as the main female artist on their roster, competing with Arista Records's Whitney Houston and Madonna of Sire Records.[21] It spent upwards of $1 million promoting Carey's debut studio album, Mariah Carey.[22] On June 5, 1990, Carey made her first public appearance at the 1990 NBA Finals, singing \"America the Beautiful\". The highlight was the piercing whistle note toward the song's conclusion, sparking CBS Sports anchor Pat O'Brien to declare, \"The palace now has a queen.\"[23] The album topped the US Billboard 200 for eleven consecutive weeks, after Carey's exposure at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards, where she won the award for Best New Artist, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for her single \"Vision of Love\".[24][25] The album's singles \"Vision of Love\", \"Love Takes Time\", \"Someday\", and \"I Don't Wanna Cry\" all topped the US Billboard Hot 100.[26] Mariah Carey was the best-selling album in the United States in 1991,[27] and achieved worldwide sales of 15 million copies.[28] Carey co-wrote, co-produced, and recorded her second studio effort, Emotions, during 1991.[29][30] She described it as a homage to Motown soul music and employed the help of Walter Afanasieff, who only had a small role on her debut, as well as Robert Clivillés and David Cole, from the dance group C+C Music Factory.[31] Carey's relationship with Margulies deteriorated over a songwriting royalties dispute. After he filed a lawsuit against Columbia's parent company, Sony Music Entertainment, the songwriting duo parted ways.[30] Emotions was released on September 17 that year. Its title track served as the album's lead single and became Carey's fifth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100, making her the first artist whose first five singles reached the chart's summit.[32] Though critics praised the album's content and described it as a more mature effort, the album was criticized as calculated and lacking originality.[33] While the album managed sales of eight million copies globally, Emotions failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor.[34] Carey did not embark on a world tour to promote the album.[35] Although she attributed this to stage fright and the vocally challenging nature of her material, speculation grew that Carey was a \"studio worm\" and incapable of producing the perfect pitch and five-octave vocal range for which she was known.[36][37] In hopes of ending any speculation of her being a manufactured artist, Carey booked an appearance on MTV Unplugged. The show presented artists \"unplugged\" or in a stripped setting and devoid of studio equipment.[38] Days prior to the show's taping, Carey and Afanasieff chose to add a cover of the Jackson 5's 1970 song \"I'll Be There\" to the set-list. On March 16, 1992, she played and recorded an intimate seven-song show at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York.[39] The acclaimed revue was aired more than three times as often as the average episode,[40] and critics heralding it as a \"vocal Tour de force\".[41] Carey's live version of \"I'll Be There\" became her sixth number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Sony capitalized on this success and released an extended play (EP) of her performance. It earned a triple-Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)[42] and earned Gold and Platinum certifications in several European markets.[43] Following years of dating,[44] Carey and Mottola got married on June 5, 1993.[45] After Emotions failed to achieve the commercial heights of her debut album, Carey's subsequent release was to be marketed as adult contemporary and pop-friendly. Music Box was produced by Carey and Afanasieff, and it began a songwriting partnership that would extend until 1997's Butterfly.[46] The album was released on August 31, 1993, to mixed reviews from music critics. Carey's songwriting was derided as clichéd and her vocal performances were described as less emotive and lazier in their delivery. In his review of the album, AllMusic's Ron Wynn concluded: \"sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion.\"[47] In promotion of the album, Carey embarked on her debut tour, a six-date concert series, the Music Box Tour.[48] Music Box's first and second singles, \"Dreamlover\" and \"Hero\", became Carey's seventh and eighth chart-toppers in the United States, while her cover of Badfinger's \"Without You\" became her first number-one single in Germany,[49] Sweden[50] and the United Kingdom.[51] Music Box remains Carey's best-seller and one of the best-selling albums, with worldwide sales of over 28 million copies.[52] In mid-1994, Carey and Luther Vandross recorded and released a cover of Lionel Richie and Diana Ross's \"Endless Love\".[53] Merry Christmas, released on November 1, 1994, became the best-selling Christmas album, with global sales of over 15 million copies.[54][55][56] The lead single, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", became a holiday standard and continues to surge in popularity each holiday season.[57] By October 2017, it had become the 11th best-selling single in history with over 16 million copies sold worldwide.[58] Carey's fifth studio album, Daydream, found her consolidating creative control over her career, leading to tensions with Columbia.[59] Songs from her prior two albums had been primarily shaped by Mottola's conceptualization of what Carey should sound like, as innocent and wholesome tracks dominated by her vocal performance.[60] Daydream featured a departure from her allegiance to pop and gravitated heavily towards R&B and hip hop.[59] Critically, the album was described as Carey's best to date. The New York Times named it one of 1995's best albums and wrote it \"brings R&B candy-making to a new peak of textural refinement ... Carey's songwriting has taken a leap forward and become more relaxed, sexier and less reliant on thudding clichés.\"[61] Its lead single, \"Fantasy\", became the first single by a female artist to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100,[62] and the second song overall after Michael Jackson's \"You Are Not Alone\".[63] \"One Sweet Day\", a collaboration with R&B group Boyz II Men, served as the second single from Daydream and remained atop the Billboard Hot 100 for a record-breaking 16 consecutive weeks, becoming the longest-running number-one song in the history of the charts at the time.[64] It also opened at the top spot, becoming Carey's second track to do so.[63] The album's third single, \"Always Be My Baby\", became Carey's eleventh chart-topper, tying her with Madonna and Whitney Houston for the most number-one singles among female artists at the time.[64] Daydream became Carey's biggest-selling album in the United States,[65] and her second album to be certified Diamond by the RIAA, after Music Box.[42] The album continued Carey's dominance in Asian music markets and sold in excess of 2.2 million copies in Japan alone and over 20 million copies globally.[66][67] Daydream and its singles were nominated in six categories at the 38th Grammy Awards.[68] Though considered a favorite to win the top awards of the evening, Carey was shut out, prompting her to comment \"What can you do? I will never be disappointed again.\"[69] In early 1996, she embarked on her first international string of concerts, the Daydream World Tour. Its seven dates spanned three in Japan and four throughout Europe.[70] Forbes named Carey the top-earning female musician of 1996, collecting an estimated $32 million.[71] During the recording of Daydream, Carey also worked on the alternative rock album Someone's Ugly Daughter by the band Chick, contributing writing, production, vocals and art direction. As Columbia Records refused to release the album with her lead vocals, Carey's friend Clarissa Dane was brought in to become the face of Chick, and her vocals were layered on top of Carey's, masking her voice.[72] Her contributions were secret until the release of her 2020 memoir The Meaning of Mariah Carey.[73] Carey's subsequent musical releases followed the trend that began with Daydream. Her music began relying less on pop and adult contemporary-tinged balladry and instead incorporating heavy elements of hip hop and R&B. On Butterfly, she collaborated with a bevy of producers other than Afanasieff, such as Sean Combs, Q-Tip, Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters.[74] Butterfly was released on September 10, 1997,[75] and introduced a more subdued style of singing, with critics noting Carey's incorporation of breathy vocals.[76] Some viewed her lack of propensity to use her upper range as a sign of maturity,[77] while others questioned whether it forebode waning vocal prowess.[78][79] The music video for the album's lead single, \"Honey\", her first since separating from Mottola, introduced a more overtly sexual image.[80] Butterfly became Carey's best-reviewed album, with attention placed on the album's exploration of more mature lyrical themes. In their review of the album, Rolling Stone wrote it was \"not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine, Houston-style balladry ... but the predominant mood of Butterfly is one of coolly erotic reverie.\"[81] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Carey's vocals as \"sultrier and more controlled than ever,\" and felt the album \"illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her '90s peers.'\"[82] \"Honey\" and \"My All\", the album's fifth single, both topped the Hot 100, making Carey a female artist with the most number-one singles in the chart's history. Though a commercial success, Butterfly failed to reach the commercial heights of her previous albums, Music Box and Daydream.[83] After concluding her Butterfly World Tour, Carey participated in the VH1 Divas benefit concert on April 14, 1998, where she sang alongside Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Gloria Estefan, and Carole King.[84] Carey began conceptualizing a film project All That Glitters, later re-titled to simply Glitter (2001),[85] and wrote songs for other projects, such as Men in Black (1997) and How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000). After Glitter fell into developmental hell, Carey postponed the project and began writing material for a new album.[86] Sony Music executives insisted she prepare a greatest hits collection in time for the holiday season.[87] The album, titled #1's (1998), featured a cover of Brenda K. Starr's \"I Still Believe\" and a duet with Whitney Houston, \"When You Believe\", which was included on the soundtrack for The Prince of Egypt (1998).[88] #1's became a phenomenon in Japan, selling over one million copies in its opening week, making Carey the only international artist to accomplish this feat. It sold over 3.25 million copies in Japan in its first three months and holds the record as the best-selling album by a non-Asian artist.[89] With only one album left to fulfill her contract with Sony, and with a desire to separate herself professionally from the record label her ex-husband still headed, Carey completed the album in three months in mid-1999.[45] Titled Rainbow, the album found Carey exploring with producers whom she had not worked with before. Rainbow became Carey's first album to not feature a collaboration with her longtime writing partner, Walter Afanasieff. She instead chose to work with David Foster and Diane Warren. \"Heartbreaker\" and \"Thank God I Found You\" both topped the Billboard Hot 100, while her rendition of Phil Collins' \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)\" with Irish boy band Westlife became her second number-one song on the UK charts. Rainbow was released on November 2, 1999, to the highest first-week sales of her career at the time, and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200.[90] Carey's tense relationship with Columbia grew increasingly fractious; she began posting messages on her website, sharing inside information with fans on the dispute, as well as instructing them to request \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" on radio stations.[91] Ultimately, the song was only given a very limited and low-promotion release.[92] Critical reception of Rainbow was generally positive, with the general consensus finding: \"what began on Butterfly as a departure ends up on Rainbow a progression – perhaps the first compelling proof of Carey's true colors as an artist.\"[93] Though a commercial success, Rainbow became Carey's lowest selling album at that point in her career.[94] Carey received Billboard's Artist of the Decade Award and the World Music Award for Best-Selling Pop Female Artist of the Millennium,[95] and parted from Columbia Records. She signed an unprecedented $80 million five-album recording contract with Virgin Records (EMI Records) in April 2001.[96][97] Glitter was a musical departure, recreating a 1980s post-disco era to accompany the film, set in 1983. Carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project.[96] She said that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives. Carey's three-year relationship with Latin singer Luis Miguel ended.[98] In July 2001, Carey suffered a physical and emotional breakdown. She began posting disturbing messages on her website and behaved erratically in live promotional outings.[99] On July 19, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program Total Request Live (TRL). As the show's host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break, she came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men's shirt and began a striptease that revealed a tight ensemble.[100] She credited exhaustion for the appearance going awry.[101] Days later, Carey posted irregular voice notes on her website.[100] On July 26, she was hospitalized due to exhaustion and a \"physical and emotional breakdown\". Carey was admitted to a hospital in Connecticut and remained under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public.[102] Virgin Records and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of Glitter and its soundtrack.[103][104] Critics panned Glitter and its soundtrack; both were unsuccessful commercially.[105] The soundtrack became Carey's lowest-selling album to that point. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch condemned it as \"an absolute mess that'll go down as an annoying blemish on [her] career.\"[106] She attributed the poor performance to her state of mind, its postponement and the soundtrack having been released on September 11.[107] Carey's record deal with Virgin Records was bought out for $28 million.[96][97] She flew to Capri, Italy, for five months, and wrote material for a new album there.[99] Carey described her time at Virgin \"a complete and total stress-fest ... I made a total snap decision which was based on money and I never make decisions based on money. I learned a big lesson from that.\"[108] She signed a contract with Island Records, valued at more than $24 million,[109] and launched the record label MonarC. Carey's father, Alfred Roy, with whom she had had little contact since childhood, died of cancer that year.[110] Her song \"Sunflowers for Alfred Roy\" from Charmbracelet is dedicated to his memory.[111] In 2002, she was cast in the independent film WiseGirls alongside Mira Sorvino and Melora Walters, who co-starred as waitresses at a mobster-operated restaurant. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and received negative reviews, though Carey's performance was praised. Roger Friedman of Fox News described her as \"a Thelma Ritter for the new millennium\", and wrote, \"Her line delivery is sharp and she manages to get the right laughs.\"[112] In December 2002, Carey released her ninth studio album, Charmbracelet, which she said marked \"a new lease on life\" for her.[113] Sales of Charmbracelet were moderate and the quality of Carey's vocals came under criticism. Joan Anderson from The Boston Globe declared the album \"the worst of her career, and revealed a voice [that is] no longer capable of either gravity-defying gymnastics or soft coos\",[114] while AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, \"Mariah's voice is shot, sounding in tatters throughout the record. She can no longer coo or softly croon nor can she perform her trademark gravity-defying vocal runs.\"[115] To support the album, Carey embarked on the Charmbracelet World Tour, spanning North America and East Asia over three months.[116] While smaller venues were booked throughout the tour's stateside leg, Carey performed in stadiums in Asia and Europe.[117] In the United Kingdom, it was her first tour to feature shows outside London.[118] The tour garnered generally positive reviews, with many praising the production and Carey's vocals.[119] Carey's tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi in 2005, was produced with the Neptunes, Kanye West and Carey's longtime collaborator, Jermaine Dupri. She described the album as \"very much like a party record ... the process of putting on makeup and getting ready to go out ... I wanted to make a record that was reflective of that.\"[120] The Emancipation of Mimi topped the charts in the United States, becoming her fifth number-one album and first since Butterfly (1997), and was warmly accepted by critics. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian defined it as \"cool, focused and urban [... some of] the first Mariah Carey tunes in years which I wouldn't have to be paid to listen to again,\"[121] while USA Today's Elysa Gardner wrote, \"The [songs] truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying.\"[122] The album's second single, \"We Belong Together\", became a \"career re-defining\"[123] song for Carey, after a relatively unsuccessful period and a point when many critics had considered her career over.[124] Music critics heralded the song as her \"return to form,\" as well as the \"return of The Voice,\"[125] while many felt it would revive \"faith\" in Carey's potential as a balladeer.[120] \"We Belong Together\" broke several records in the United States and became Carey's sixteenth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100. After staying at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks, the song became the second-longest-running number one song in US chart history, behind Carey's \"One Sweet Day\".[126] Billboard listed it as the \"song of the decade\" and the ninth most popular song of all time.[127] The song broke several airplay records, and according to Nielsen BDS, and gathered both the largest one-day and one-week audiences in history.[128] During the week of September 25, 2005, Carey set another record, becoming the first woman to occupy the first two spots atop the Hot 100, as \"We Belong Together\" remained at number one, and her next single, \"Shake It Off\", moved into the number two spot (Ashanti had topped the chart in 2002 while being a featured singer on the number two single).[126] On the US Billboard Hot 100 Year-end Chart of 2005, \"We Belong Together\" was declared the number one song, a first for Carey.[129] Billboard listed \"We Belong Together\" ninth on The Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs and was declared the most popular song of the 2000s decade by Billboard.[130] The album was re-released as The Ultra Platinum Edition, from which \"Don't Forget About Us\" became her seventeenth number-one in the United States.[131][132] The Emancipation of Mimi earned ten Grammy Award nominations: eight in 2006 for the original release, the most received by Carey in a single year, and two in 2007 for the Ultra Platinum Edition. Carey won Best Contemporary R&B Album for The Emancipation of Mimi and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song for \"We Belong Together\".[133] The Emancipation of Mimi was 2005's best-selling album in the United States, with nearly five million units sold. It was the first album by a solo female artist to become the year's best-selling album within the country since Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill in 1996.[134] At the end of 2005, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that The Emancipation of Mimi had sold more than 7.7 million copies globally, and was the second-best-selling album of the year after Coldplay's X&Y.[135][136][137] It has since sold 12 million copies worldwide.[138] In support of the album, Carey embarked on her first headlining tour in three years, named The Adventures of Mimi after a \"Carey-centric fan's\" music diary.[139] The tour spanned 40 dates, with 32 in the United States and Canada, two in Africa, and six in Japan.[140] It received warm reception from music critics and concert goers, many of which lauded Carey's vocals.[141][142] In early 2007, Carey began to work on her eleventh studio album, E=MC². Although the album was well received by some critics,[143][144] others criticized it for being very similar to the formula used on The Emancipation of Mimi.[145] Two weeks before the album's release, \"Touch My Body\", the record's lead single, reached the top position on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Carey's eighteenth number one and making her the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, pushing her past Elvis Presley into second place according to the magazine's revised methodology.[146] Carey is second only to The Beatles, who have twenty number-one singles. Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the Hot 100, tying her with Presley as the artist with the most weeks at number one in the Billboard chart history.\"[147] E=MC² debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 463,000 copies sold, the biggest opening week sales of her career.[148] In 2008, Carey also played an aspiring singer named Krystal in Tennessee[149] and had a cameo appearance in Adam Sandler's film You Don't Mess with the Zohan, playing herself.[150] Since the album's release, Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of E=MC².[151] However, the tour was suddenly cancelled in early December 2008.[152] Carey later stated that she had been pregnant during that time period and suffered a miscarriage, prompting the tour's cancellation.[153][154] On January 20, 2009, Carey performed \"Hero\" at the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball after Barack Obama was sworn as the first African-American president of the United States.[155] On July 7, 2009, Carey—alongside Trey Lorenz—performed her version of \"I'll Be There\" at the memorial service for Michael Jackson.[156] In 2009, she appeared as a social worker in Precious, the movie adaptation of the 1996 novel Push by Sapphire. The film garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, also for Carey's performance.[157] Variety described her acting as \"pitch-perfect.\"[158] In January 2010, Carey won the Breakthrough Actress Performance Award for her role in Precious at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.[159] On September 25, 2009, Carey's twelfth studio album, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, was released. Reception for the album was mostly mixed; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it \"her most interesting album in a decade,\"[160] while Jon Caramanica from The New York Times criticized Carey's vocal performances, complaining she overused softer vocal registers at the expense of her more powerful lower and upper registers.[161] Commercially, the album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 with first week sales of 168,000 copies.[162] \"Obsessed\" served as the lead single and debuted at number eleven in the US before peaking at number seven. It became Carey's 27th top-ten entry within the nation, tying her with Elton John and Janet Jackson for having the fifth most top-tens.[163] Its follow-up single, a cover of Foreigner's \"I Want to Know What Love Is\", broke airplay records in Brazil. The song spent 27 weeks atop the Brasil Hot 100, making it the longest running song in the chart's history.[164] On December 31, 2009, Carey embarked on her seventh concert tour, Angels Advocate Tour, which visited the United States and Canada and ended on September 26, 2010.[165][166] A planned remix album of Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, titled Angels Advocate, was slated for a March 30, 2010, release but was eventually cancelled after Island Def Jam decided to instead distribute \"Up Out My Face\" with Nicki Minaj and \"Angels Cry\" with Ne-Yo as stand-alone releases.[167] Following the cancellation of Angels Advocate, it was announced that Carey would return to the studio to start work on her thirteenth studio album.[168] It was later revealed that it would be her second Christmas album, and follow-up to Merry Christmas.[55] The release date for the album, titled Merry Christmas II You, was November 2, 2010;[169] the track list included new songs as well as a remix of \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\".[170] Merry Christmas II You debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 with sales of 56,000 copies, and number one on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it only the second Christmas album to top this chart.[171] In February 2011, she recorded a duet with Tony Bennett for his Duets II album, titled \"When Do The Bells Ring For Me?\",[172] and re-recorded \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" with Justin Bieber as a duet for his Christmas album, Under the Mistletoe.[173][174] In November that year, Carey was included in the remix to the mixtape single \"Warning\" by Uncle Murda; the remix also features 50 Cent and Young Jeezy.[175] Later that month, Carey released a duet with John Legend titled \"When Christmas Comes\", originally part of Merry Christmas II You.[176] On March 1, 2012, Carey performed at New York City's Gotham Hall; her first time performing since her pregnancy.[177][178] She also performed a three-song set at a special fundraiser for US President Barack Obama held in New York's Plaza Hotel. A new song titled \"Bring It On Home\", which Carey wrote for the event to show her support for Obama's re-election campaign, was also performed.[179] In August 2012, she released a stand-alone single, \"Triumphant (Get 'Em)\", featuring rappers Rick Ross and Meek Mill.[180] Carey joined the judging panel of the twelfth season of American Idol.[181][182] Throughout the show there were on-set disagreements between Carey and fellow judge Nicki Minaj.[183][184] Three years later, Carey did not make an appearance for its original series finale.[185][186] In 2013, Carey appeared in Lee Daniels' film The Butler[187] and had a guest role voicing as a redneck character on the adult animated series American Dad!.[188] In February 2013, Carey recorded and released a song called \"Almost Home\", for the soundtrack of The Walt Disney Studios film Oz the Great and Powerful. The video was directed by photographer David LaChapelle.[189][190] For her 14th album, she worked with producers including DJ Clue?, Randy Jackson, Q-Tip, R. Kelly, David Morales, Afanasieff, Dupri, The-Dream, and Da Brat. Carey told Billboard: \"It's about making sure I have tons of good music, because at the end of the day that's the most important thing... There are a lot more raw ballads than people might expect...there are also uptempo and signature-type songs that represent [my] different facets as an artist.\"[191] The lead single, \"Beautiful\", featuring singer Miguel, was released on May 6, 2013, and peaked at number 15 on the Hot 100.[192] Carey taped a performance of \"Beautiful\" along with a medley of her greatest hits on May 15, 2013. This taping aired on the American Idol season finale the following day.[193] After multiple delays, The album, titled Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse, was released on May 27, 2014.[194] In October 2014, Carey announced an annual residency show All I Want for Christmas Is You: A Night of Joy and Festivity. Originally performed at the Beacon Theatre in New York City, the residency began on December 15, 2014, and ended in 2019.[195][196] On January 30, 2015, it was announced that Carey had left Universal Music Group's Def Jam Recordings to reunite with L.A. Reid and Sony Music via Epic Records.[197][198][199] Carey also announced her new #1 to Infinity residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas the same month.[200] To coincide with the residency, Carey released #1 to Infinity, a greatest hits compilation album containing all of her eighteen Billboard Hot 100 number one singles at the time, along with a new recording, \"Infinity\", which was released as a single on April 27.[201] In 2015 Carey had her directorial debut for the Hallmark Channel Christmas movie A Christmas Melody, in which she also performed as one of the main characters.[202] In December 2015, Carey announced The Sweet Sweet Fantasy Tour which spanned a total of 27-dates beginning in March 2016, marking Carey's first major tour of mainland Europe in 13 years. Four stops included shows in South Africa.[203] The tour grossed $30.3 million.[204] On March 15, 2016, Carey announced that she was filming Mariah's World, a docu-series for the E! network documenting her Sweet Sweet Fantasy tour and her wedding planning process. Carey told The New York Times, \"I thought it would be a good opportunity to kind of, like, show my personality and who I am, even though I feel like my real fans have an idea of who I am... A lot of people have misperceptions about this and that.\"[205] The series premiered on December 4, 2016.[206] Carey guest starred on the musical drama Empire, as a superstar singer named Kitty and sang the song \"Infamous\" featuring Jussie Smollett.[207] On December 5, 2016, Carey participated in the VH1 Divas Holiday: Unsilent Night benefit concert, alongside Vanessa Williams, Chaka Khan, Patti LaBelle, and Teyana Taylor.[208] On December 31, 2016, Carey's performance on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve in Times Square received worldwide attention after technical difficulties caused her in-ear monitors to malfunction, resulting in what The New York Times referred to as a \"performance train wreck.\"[209] She said her inability to hear the music without in-ear auditory feedback caused the mishap.[210] Carey's representatives and Dick Clark Productions placed blame on each other.[211] On February 3, 2017, Carey released the single \"I Don't\" featuring YG.[212] Later that month, she voiced the Mayor of Gotham City in the animated film The Lego Batman Movie.[213] In July 2017, Carey made a cameo in the comedy film Girls Trip[214] and embarked on a tour with Lionel Richie, titled, All the Hits Tour.[215] She was also featured in the official remix for French Montana's single \"Unforgettable\", alongside Swae Lee.[216] In October 2017, Carey released a new soundtrack single, \"The Star\", for the movie of the same name.[217] She also voiced a hen named Rebecca in the film.[218] The song was nominated for the Best Original Song at the 75th Golden Globe Awards.[219] Carey additionally developed an animated Christmas film, Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You, for which she recorded an original song called \"Lil' Snowman\". The film was released direct-to-video on November 14, 2017.[220][221] On December 31, 2017, Carey returned to perform on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve after the technical difficulties that hindered her previous performance, in what The New York Times described as a \"made-for-television act of pop culture redemption\".[222] In July 2018, Carey embarked on a new Las Vegas residency, The Butterfly Returns, which received critical acclaim.[223][224] Its first 12 shows in 2018 grossed $3.6 million, with dates later extending into 2019 and 2020.[225] Following the residency, Carey embarked on her Mariah Carey: Live in Concert tour in Asia and returned to Europe with her All I Want for Christmas Is You concert series.[226][227] In September 2018, Carey announced plans to release her fifteenth studio album later in the year.[228][229] The project was announced alongside the release of a new song titled \"GTFO\",[230] which she performed on September 21, 2018, when she headlined the 2018 iHeartRadio Music Festival.[231] The album's lead single, \"With You\", was released in October and performed for the first time at the American Music Awards of 2018.[232] It became Carey's highest-charting non-holiday song on the US Adult Contemporary chart since \"We Belong Together\" in 2005. This was followed by a second single, \"A No No\".[233] The album, titled Caution, was released on November 16, 2018, and received universal acclaim from critics.[234] By December 2018, the album had been featured on numerous year-end lists by music critics and publications.[235] In February 2019, Carey commenced the Caution World Tour in support of the album.[236] Later in 2019, Carey engaged in a series of business and television ventures. On September 18, 2019, Carey released \"In the Mix\", the theme song for the ABC sitcom Mixed-ish.[237] On November 1, 2019, Carey re-released her holiday album Merry Christmas for its 25th anniversary.

It shall conclude the following December 17.[275][276] A thirtieth anniversary edition of Merry Christmas was also released.[277] Carey has said that from childhood she has been influenced by Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan as well as R&B and soul musicians including Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Aretha Franklin, and George Michael. Her music contains strong influences of gospel music, and she credits the Clark Sisters, Shirley Caesar, and Edwin Hawkins as the most influential in her early years.[278][279] When Carey incorporated hip hop into her sound, speculation arose that she was making an attempt to take advantage of the genre's popularity, but she told Newsweek, \"People just don't understand. I grew up with this music.\"[280] She has expressed appreciation for rappers such as the Sugarhill Gang, Eric B. & Rakim, the Wu-Tang Clan, The Notorious B.I.G. and Mobb Deep, with whom she collaborated on the single \"The Roof (Back in Time)\" (1998). Carey was heavily influenced by Minnie Riperton, and began experimenting with the whistle register due to her original practice of the range.[281] During Carey's career, her vocal and musical style, along with her level of success, has been compared to Whitney Houston, whom she has also cited as an influence.[282] Carey and her peers, according to Garry Mulholland, are \"the princesses of wails... virtuoso vocalists who blend chart-oriented pop with mature MOR torch song.\" Author and writer Lucy O'Brien attributed the comeback of Barbra Streisand's \"old-fashioned showgirl\" to Carey and Celine Dion, and described them and Houston as \"groomed, airbrushed and overblown to perfection.\" Carey's musical transition and use of more revealing clothing during the late 1990s were, in part, initiated to distance herself from this image, and she subsequently said that most of her early work was \"schmaltzy MOR.\"[283] Some have noted that unlike Houston and Dion, Carey writes and produces her own music.[284] Love is the subject of the majority of Carey's lyrics, although she has written about themes such as loss, sex, race, abuse and spirituality.[285][286] Andrew Chan of the University of Texas Press identifies \"the purging of private emotions\" as the main theme of Carey's ballads, though he believes several others aim to have an \"all-purpose feeling\" with mass appeal.[287] Carey has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical, but Time magazine's Christopher John Farley wrote: \"If only Mariah Carey's music had the drama of her life. Her songs are often sugary and artificial—NutraSweet soul. But her life has passion and conflict,\" applying it to the first stages of her career. He commented that as her albums progressed, so too her songwriting and music blossomed into more mature and meaningful material.[288] Jim Faber of the New York Daily News, made similar comments, \"For Carey, vocalizing is all about the performance, not the emotions that inspired it. Singing, to her, represents a physical challenge, not an emotional unburdening.\"[289] While reviewing Music Box, Stephen Holden from Rolling Stone commented that Carey sang with \"sustained passion,\" while Arion Berger of Entertainment Weekly wrote that during some vocal moments, Carey becomes \"too overwhelmed to put her passion into words.\"[290] In 2001, The Village Voice wrote that \"Carey's Strawberry Shortcake soul still provides the template with which teen-pop cuties draw curlicues around those centerless [Diane] Warren ballads.\"[291] Carey gained public perception as a balladeer with her first few releases.[292] Following her divorce with Tommy Mottola, Carey broke free of adult contemporary arrangements in favor of what Alex Macpherson of The Guardian described as \"a lovingly crafted, hip-hop-inflected quiet storm\".[293] Carey often records her layered background vocals, which have been described as \"a swooning bank of a hundred Mariahs\".[294] The singer has said that \"it's because I started out as a backup singer and doing sessions as a background vocalist learning from some of the greatest background vocalists, and also people like Luther Vandross. Growing up, I admired his texture in and of itself but also his use of background vocals\".[295] Carey's songwriting is noted for its \"eccentric verbosity\".[293][296][297] Jeffrey Ingold of Vice argues that her lyrics are \"among the most verbose in pop music.\"[298] Since the beginning of her career, Carey has repeatedly described herself as a songwriter and producer and emphasized the importance of being acknowledged for these roles.[299] Carey's output makes use of electronic instruments such as drum machines,[120] keyboards and synthesizers.[300] Many of her songs contain piano-driven melodies,[301] as she was given piano lessons at age six. Carey said that she cannot read sheet music and prefers to collaborate with a pianist when composing her material, but feels that it is easier to experiment with faster and less-conventional melodies and chord progressions using this technique.[10] While Carey learned to play the piano at a young age, and incorporates several ranges of production and instrumentation into her music, she has maintained that her voice has always been her most important asset: \"My voice is my instrument; it always has been.\"[83] Carey began commissioning remixes of her material early in her career and helped to spearhead the practice of recording entirely new vocals for remixes.[302] Disc jockey David Morales has collaborated with Carey on several occasions, starting with \"Dreamlover\" (1993), which popularized the tradition of remixing R&B songs into house records, and which Slant Magazine named one of the greatest dance songs.[303] From \"Fantasy\" (1995) onward, Carey enlisted both hip hop and house producers to re-structure her album compositions.[69] Entertainment Weekly included two remixes of \"Fantasy\" on a list of Carey's greatest recordings compiled in 2005: a National Dance Music Award-winning remix produced by Morales, and a Sean Combs production featuring rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard.[304] The latter has been credited with popularizing the pop and hip hop collaboration trend that has continued into the 2000s, through artists such as Ashanti and Beyoncé.[302] Combs said that Carey \"knows the importance of mixes, so you feel like you're with an artist who appreciates your work—an artist who wants to come up with something with you.\"[305] Carey possesses a five-octave vocal range.[306][307][308] Regarding her type of voice, several critics have described her as a lyric coloratura soprano or just a soprano.[309][310] Jon Pareles of The New York Times described Carey's lower register as a \"rich, husky alto\" that extends to \"dog-whistle high notes.\"[311] She once described herself as an alto singer.[312] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker adds her timbre on \"Vision of Love\" possesses various colors, stating, \"Carey's sound changes with nearly every line, mutating from a steely tone to a vibrating growl and then to a humid, breathy coo.\"[54] Chan believes that Carey moved through several \"vocal personas\" throughout her discography, like the \"stentorian, full-throated belting of her first few albums; the fluid mix of chest and head voice deployed to masterful effect in the mid-1990s; and the delicate, foggy tones and manic cadences that predominated after the turn of the millennium\".[313] In an analysis of Carey's voice for ClassicFM, singer Catherine Bott claims that Carey's chest voice could go up \"higher in pitch\" compared to classical singer.\"[314] Her sense of pitch is admired and Jon Pareles adds \"she can linger over sensual turns, growl with playful confidence, syncopate like a scat singer... with startlingly exact pitch.\"[311] Carey claims that she has had nodules on her vocal cords since childhood, enabling her to sing in a higher register than others. However, tiredness and sleep deprivation can affect them due to the nodules, and Carey explained that she went through a lot of practice as a child to maintain a balance during singing.[281][315] Carey is noted for her vocal improvisation skills.[316][317] Towards the late 1990s, she began incorporating breathy vocals into her material.[318] Tim Levell from BBC News described her vocals as \"sultry close-to-the-mic breathiness,\"[318] while USA Today's Elysa Gardner wrote \"it's impossible to deny the impact her vocal style, a florid blend of breathy riffing and resonant belting, has had on today's young pop and R&B stars.\"[319] In an interview, Ron Givens of Entertainment Weekly described it this way, \"first, a rippling, soulful ooh comes rolling effortlessly from her throat: alto. Then, after a quick breath, she goes for the stratosphere, with a sound that nearly changes the barometric pressure in the room. In one brief swoop, she seems to squeal and roar at the same time.\"[320] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian noted that Carey's voice on Butterfly is \"an instrument of texture rather than volume, with pillows of lavishly layered vocals and nuanced phrasing magnifying the emotional intensity of the songs.\"[293] Randy Jackson said that \"It's in the tone, that buttery tone that she has with her voice that is unbelievably amazing and unbelievably identifiable.\"[321] Despite being called a \"show stopper\" and \"the 1990s pop phenomenon\",[322] Carey suffered from stage fright in her early years in the music industry.[323] One of her earliest performances was at MTV Unplugged, which received positive reception as Carey silenced critics saying her vocals were studio-made.[324][325] Chan identifies the Milli Vanilli lip syncing controversy as a potential contributor to the initial accusations.[299] Carey's \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" rendition at the Super Bowl XXXVI was called \"stunning\" by Billboard.[326] She also performed \"America the Beautiful\" at the 1990 NBA Finals in which Rolling Stone writer, Brittany Spanos, stated the players were struck \"with awe by the incredible talent of a burgeoning young star\".[327] The singer received the only standing ovation of the night at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, after performing the medley of \"We Belong Together and \"Fly Like a Bird\".[328] Although Carey's performance at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve 2017 was marred by technical issues, she returned to the stage a year later and, according to Time, \"effectively redeemed herself\".[329] Carey is known for being very static during her live performances. Some reviewers credited her stage fright and lack of confidence as the reasoning,[330][331] while others pointed out that her performances focus on her vocals and the quality of her songs.[332] Her onstage hand gesticulations have usually been mimicked,[333] as the singer has a tendency for \"using her hands to point, flutter and sweep through the air as she deftly crests each run\".[334] When reviewing Carey's 2014 concert, Michael Lallo wrote that \"If you're Mariah, you ... stroke your hair a lot. When a high note is on the horizon, you brace yourself by touching your ear and adopting a pained expression, provoking the crowd into losing its collective mind.\"[335] Carey had been open about the fact that she had not been happy with some of her early music videos, and has subsequently been noted for self-directing and co-producing her subsequent videography.[336] The music video for \"Fantasy\" was the first that Carey directed entirely on her own,[337] and \"Honey\" pushed Carey further towards hip hop and R&B than before.[337] Its music video gained further attention, as Carey, for the first time in her career, was provocatively dressed, giving viewers a \"taste of the freer Mariah.\"[337] In 2007, author Saul Austerlitz wrote Carey had been \"marketed as a whitebread pop princess\" in her earlier music videos, adding the plots, directorial styles, clothes, and auras from later videos like \"Heartbreaker\" were very different and she was displayed as an \"R&B diva\".[338] Billboard ranked Carey 73rd on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time\" in 2020, stating that \"over three decades, [Carey] has gone from breezy girl next door, flaunting a denim collection as wide as her vocal range, to secret agent, runaway bride and even her own stalker in a collection of music videos that play like mini-dramas\".[339] The music video for \"The Roof\" was ranked 18th on Slant Magazine's \"100 Greatest Music Videos.[340] The music videos for \"Honey\" and \"Heartbreaker\" remain among the most expensive ever made, costing over $2 million.[341][342] In 2021, Carey was honoured at the African American Film Critics Association with a Special Achievement Innovator Award for her \"visual storytelling in her music videos and specials\".[343] Throughout her career, Carey has been called a pop icon,[344][345][346] a gay icon,[347] and a fashion icon.[348] Guinness World Records and music critics have dubbed Carey the \"Songbird Supreme\".[349][350][351] She has been labeled a \"diva\" for her stardom and persona.[352] Her diva persona has received heavy attention, gaining admiration from her fans.[353][354] Author Lily E. Hirsch argues that while Carey has displayed diva behavior during several incidents in her career, the media's association of the term with her is influenced by gender.[355] Carey's style has often been described as \"eccentric\" and \"over the top\".[356][357] Throughout her career, she has also been used in several social media memes, gaining the \"Queen of Shade\" title from Elle.[358] Carey's reactions in various interviews have often gone viral, becoming the originator for various memes including \"I don't know her\".[359] Carey's public image has undergone significant transformations, often receiving heavy media attention. Early in her career, Carey had a polished image, influenced by Mottola and his control over her career. After their separation, Carey took on a more provocative image in her career and has since been called a sex symbol.[360][361] Her career has received heavy media attention, particularly during the rollout of her 2001 film, Glitter which became \"tabloid legend\".[362][363] Academic Shara Rambarran believes that Carey has matched the media's intense scrutiny and attention on her personal life through \"her diva attitude, performance, identity, and music\".[364] Carey's enduring popularity as a musician has received extensive recognition and often praised for its longevity.[365][366] She has been credited for her role in breaking down racial barriers in popular culture and facilitating public discourse surrounding multiracialism in the music industry.[367] Carey has also been credited for popularizing the use of melisma amongst her peers and the generation after her, and has often been considered one of the greatest vocalists in pop music.[368] Carey has influenced numerous artists and her music has also been recorded, performed or sampled by a variety of acts.[369][370][371][372] In a 2010 article for The New York Times, David Browne wrote that in the early 1990s, \"melisma overtook pop in a way it hadn't before. Mariah Carey's debut hit from 1990, 'Vision of Love', [set] the bar insanely high for notes stretched louder, longer and knottier than most pop fans had ever heard\". He added that because of this, various artists have since \"built their careers around melisma\" including Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson and Beyoncé.[373] \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", as well as its parent album Merry Christmas, have become such a ubiquitous part of wider popular culture that Carey's name became synonymous with the season, and she has since been dubbed the \"Queen of Christmas\".[374] Multiple media sources have referred to Carey as a holiday icon.[375][376][377] The singer has often incorporated holiday-themed outfits during her Christmas shows and music videos.[375] Throughout her career, Carey has earned numerous awards and honors. She has won six Grammy Awards (including a Grammy Global Impact Award),[378] nineteen World Music Awards, ten American Music Awards,[379] and twenty Billboard Music Awards.[380] Carey is one of the best-selling recording artists in history, with more than 220 million records sold.[381] She is also an inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame,[241] according to whom she is \"the all-time most successful female songwriter in chart history\",[382] and The Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame.[383] Carey was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2015,[384] and a Billboard Icon Award in 2019.[385] In 2023, she became one of the first 13 recipients of the BRIT Billion Award, for surpassing the milestone one billion streams in the United Kingdom.[386] Declining offers to appear in commercials in the United States during her early career, Carey was not involved in brand marketing initiatives until 2006, when she participated in endorsements for Intel Centrino personal computers and launched a jewelry and accessories line for teenagers, Glamorized, in American Claire's and Icing stores.[387] During this period, as part of a partnership with Pepsi and Motorola, Carey recorded and promoted a series of exclusive ringtones, including \"Time of Your Life\".[388] She signed a licensing deal with the cosmetics company Elizabeth Arden, and in 2007, she released her own fragrance, \"M\".[389] The Elizabeth Arden deal has netted her $150 million.[390] For the fragrance, Carey won a Basenotes Fragrance Award for Best Celebrity Women's Fragrance as well as being nominated in three other categories.[391] She has released a series of fragrances with Elizabeth Arden, including Luscious Pink (2008) and Forever (2009).[392][393] On November 29, 2010, she debuted a collection on HSN, which included jewelry, shoes and fragrances.[394] In November 2011, Carey was announced as \"brand ambassador\" for Jenny Craig, Inc. which included \"participation in a new company initiative... public service announcements and community and education programs.\"[395] In 2018, Carey featured in an advertisement for Hostelworld with the tagline \"Even Divas are Believers\".[396] On August 25, 2019, Carey signed a $12 million contract with the Walkers crisps brand as part of their Christmas campaign[397] and starred in a commercial for the company.[398] In December 2020, Carey launched a partnership with Virtual Dining Concepts and restaurateur, Robert Earl, for a biscuit line titled Mariah's Cookies.[399] In 2021, Carey announced the launch of a new line of alcohol called Black Irish, an homage to her Black, Venezuelan, and Irish heritage.[400] That same year, Carey also partnered with McDonald's, promoting an entirely new limited time menu.[401] In 2022, Carey recorded nine video lessons for MasterClass titled \"Mariah Carey Teaches the Voice as an Instrument\", as well as re-recording \"The Roof (Back in Time)\" alongside Brandy.[402] Carey is a philanthropist who has been involved with several charitable organizations. She became associated with the Fresh Air Fund in the early 1990s, and co-founded a camp located in Fishkill, New York, that enables inner-city youth to embrace the arts and introduces them to career opportunities.[403] The camp was called Camp Mariah \"for her generous support and dedication to Fresh Air children,\" and she received a Congressional Horizon Award for her youth-related charity work.[404] Carey has continued her direct involvement with Camp Mariah, and by 2019 the executive director of The Fresh Air Fund reported that \"...the kids who have gone to Camp Mariah have higher graduation rates out of high school and college.[405] In 1999, Carey was presented with a Congressional Award for contributing \"to expanding opportunities for all Americans through their own personal contributions, and [setting] exceptional examples for young people through their own successes in life.[406] In 2019, she was honored by Variety's Power of Women for her work with The Fresh Air Fund's Camp Mariah.[407] Carey also donated royalties from her songs \"Hero\" and \"One Sweet Day\" to charities.[408] She has worked with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and in November 2006 she was awarded the Foundation's Wish Idol for her \"extraordinary generosity and her many wish granting achievements.\"[409][410] Carey has volunteered for the Police Athletic League of New York City and contributed to the obstetrics department of New York Presbyterian Hospital Cornell Medical Center. A percentage of the sales of MTV Unplugged was donated to various other charities.[411] In 2008, Carey was named Hunger Ambassador of the World Hunger Relief Movement.[412] In February 2010, the song, \"100%\", which was originally written and recorded for the film, Precious,[413] was used as one of the theme songs for the 2010 Winter Olympics, with all money proceeds going to Team USA.[414] In 2017, Carey was awarded with PETA's Angel for Animals Award for promoting animal adoption through her animated movie All I Want for Christmas Is You.[415] One of Carey's most high-profile benefit concert appearances was on VH1's 1998 Divas Live special, during which she performed alongside other female singers in support of the Save the Music Foundation. The concert was a ratings success, and Carey participated in the Divas 2000 special and a 2016 holiday edition.[84][416] She appeared at the America: A Tribute to Heroes nationally televised fundraiser in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and performed before peacekeeping troops in Kosovo.[417] Carey hosted the CBS television special At Home for the Holidays, which documented real-life stories of adopted children and foster families.[418] In 2005, Carey performed for Live 8 in London[419] and at the Hurricane Katrina relief telethon \"Shelter from the Storm\".[420] In August 2008, Carey and other singers recorded the charity single, \"Just Stand Up\" produced by Babyface and L.A. Reid, to support Stand Up to Cancer.[421] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Carey participated in the iHeart Living Room Concert for America and Rise Up New York! telethons to raise money for those affected by COVID-19.[422][423] In response to the murder of George Floyd, Carey took to social media and sang a snippet of her 1990 song \"There's Got to Be a Way\" while encouraging fans to demand justice.[424] In 2008, Carey performed in a New Year's Eve concert for the family of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. She later said she felt \"horrible and embarrassed\" to have taken part in the concert.[425] To make amends, in March 2011, Carey's representative Cindi Berger stated that royalties for the song \"Save the Day\", written for her fourteenth studio album, would be donated to charities that create awareness for human rights. Berger also said that Carey \"has and continues to donate her time, money and countless hours of personal service to many organizations both here and abroad.\"[408] \"Save the Day\" remained unreleased until 2020.[245] In 2013, human rights activists criticized Carey for performing in a concert for Angola's \"father-daughter kleptocracy\" and accused her of accepting \"dictator cash\".[426] Carey stated in 2006: \"I do believe that I have been born again in a lot of ways. I think what I've changed are my priorities and my relationships with God. I feel the difference when I don't have my private moments to pray... I'm a fighter, but I learned that I'm not in charge. Whatever God wants to happen is what's going to happen. I feel like I've had endless second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth chances. It's by the grace of God I'm still here.\"[427] Carey began dating Tommy Mottola while recording Mariah Carey,[44] and they were married at the Episcopal Saint Thomas Church in New York City on June 5, 1993, in a half-million dollar ceremony.[45] The newlyweds moved into a custom-built mansion, located on a 51-acre (21 ha) estate in Bedford, New York, referred to by Carey as \"Sing Sing\"[428] (alluding to her feeling imprisoned there).[429] After the release of Daydream and the success that followed, Carey began focusing on her personal life, which was a constant struggle at the time. Their relationship began to deteriorate due to their growing creative differences in terms of her music, as well as Mottola's controlling nature.[430] They separated in December 1996,[431] and announced it publicly on May 30, 1997.[432] The couple divorced on March 4, 1998.[433] Shortly afterwards they sold their home to Nelson Peltz for $20.5 million;[434] it burned down in 1999.[435] Carey was in a relationship with baseball player Derek Jeter from 1997 to 1998,[436] and with singer Luis Miguel from 1998 to 2001.[98] She began dating actor and comedian Nick Cannon while conceiving the music video for her song \"Bye Bye\", which they filmed together on an island off the coast of Antigua in April 2008.[437] They were married on April 30, 2008, in the Bahamas.[438] That same year, Carey suffered a miscarriage.[439] At 35 weeks into her next pregnancy, she gave birth to their fraternal twins, Moroccan and Monroe, on April 30, 2011,[440] via caesarean section.[441] In August 2014, Cannon confirmed he and Carey had separated.[442] He filed for divorce on December 12, 2014,[443] which was finalized in 2016.[444] In 2015, Carey began dating Australian billionaire James Packer and, on January 21, 2016, she announced they were engaged.[445] By October, however, they had called off the engagement.[446] In October 2016, she began dating American choreographer Bryan Tanaka.[447] On December 26, 2023, Tanaka confirmed that he and Carey had parted ways after seven years of dating.[448] In April 2018, Carey opened up about taking therapy sessions and medication for her struggle with bipolar II disorder. She was diagnosed in 2001 and initially kept the diagnosis private.[449] Headlining tours Co-headlining tours Residencies",

                "content": "Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1969)[a] is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, philanthropist, author and businesswoman. She is best known for the song \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\". She is recognized as the Queen of Christmas and Songbird Supreme by the Guinness World Records with her five-octave coloratura soprano voice, melismatic singing style and her signature use of the whistle register. She has sold over 200 million copies worldwide and is one of the best-selling artists of all time. She has sold over 71 million albums in the US alone, the most US albums sold for a female artist.[4] Mariah Carey was born on March 27, 1969, in Huntington, New York, the daughter of Alfred Roy Carey, an African American and Afro-Venezuelan ancestry and Patricia Hickey, an Irish ancestry. She is the youngest of three children. Carey's father is an aeronautical engineer while her mother is a opera singer and a freelance vocal coach. Her siblings are Morgan (born 1960) and Alison (born 1962). Her parents divorced when she was three years old. She practiced playing piano when she was a little girl.[5] In December 1988, Carey started making her first album. She released her self-titled debut studio album in 1990. It was released from Columbia Records. The album was certified multi-platinum by the RIAA. Four singles from the album all reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart (\"Vision of Love\", \"Love Takes Time\", \"Someday\", and \"I Don't Wanna Cry\"). It reached number one on the US Billboard 200. It was certified 9× platinum. This means that 9 million copies of the album were shipped in the US. Carey married Tommy Mottola, the head of Sony Music, in 1993. Mottola was the executive producer for Carey. Many critics believed that this helped Carey's musical career. In 1991, her second album Emotions reached number four on the Billboard 200. It was certified 4× platinum and sold less than her previous album. Her songs \"Emotions\" (#1), \"Can't Let Go\" (#2), and \"Make It Happen\" (#5) were released as singles from the album. Carey released her first EP MTV Unplugged (1992). It reached number three on the Billboard 200. The songs \"I'll Be There\" (#1) and \"If It's Over\" were released as singles from the album. Carey's third album Music Box (1993) reached number one on the Billboard 200. As of 2012, the album has sold 10,000,000 copies in the US, according to Nielsen Soundcan, and was certified Diamond because of this. Worldwide, it sold 32 million copies and became one of the best-selling albums of all time. \"Dreamlover\" (#1), \"Hero\" (#1), \"Without You\" (#3), \"Never Forget You\" (#3), and \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" (#12) helped Carey to become more popular. Her fourth studio album and first holiday album, Merry Christmas (1994), reached number three on the Billboard 200 chart. Two singles were released: \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" and \"Joy to the World\". Carey's fifth album Daydream became her third number-one album in the US. It was given a diamond award from the RIAA. This means that 10 million copies of the album were shipped in the US. There were six singles for the album. They include \"Fantasy\" (#1), \"One Sweet Day\" (#1), \"Open Arms\", \"Always Be My Baby\" (#1), \"Forever\" (#9) and \"Underneath the Stars\". On September 16, 1997, Carey released her sixth album Butterfly. The album reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart. The album released five singles. They include \"Honey\" (#1), \"Butterfly\" (#16), \"The Roof (Back in Time)\", \"Breakdown\" (#53) and \"My All\" (#1). On November 2, 1999, her seventh album Rainbow was released. After selling 323,000 copies the first week, it debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. It featured her fifteenth number-one US single, \"Thank God I Found You\" (with R&B singer Joe and boy band 98°), along with a cover of singer Phil Collins' song \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)\". The cover reached number one in the UK. Carey starred in the movie Glitter in 2001. It did not do so well and grossed $5,271,666 out of a $20,000,000 budget. It was released on the day of the September 11 attacks.[6] It was nominated for several \"worst movie\" categories. The soundtrack did better than the movie. The single \"Loverboy\" reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2002, her album Charmbracelet was released. Her 2005 album, The Emancipation of Mimi, became one of her most successful albums. Many music critics believed it was her \"comeback album\". It contained her sixteenth and seventeenth US number-one hits, \"We Belong Together\" and \"Don't Forget About Us\". \"We Belong Together\" was the number-one song of 2005 and of the 2000s decade in the US. Her following album, E=MC² (2008), featured her eighteenth number-one song, \"Touch My Body\". With this, Carey holds the most US number-ones for a solo artist in history. However, this album, along with its followups Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel (2009) and Merry Christmas II You (2010), did not sell well. She played the role of a social worker, Ms. Weiss, in the 2009 movie Precious. In 2013, she was a judge on the competition series American Idol. Carey's fourteenth album, Me. I Am Mariah… The Elusive Chanteuse, was released in 2014 and reached number three on the Billboard 200. The song \"#Beautiful\", featuring R&B singer Miguel, was released in May 2013 as the first single from the album. It reached the top fifteen in the US and was certified platinum. The next single, \"The Art of Letting Go\", was released on November 11, 2013. \"You're Mine (Eternal)\" was released in time for Valentine's Day in 2014 as the third single from the album. Carey released a greatest hits collection, #1 to Infinity, in 2015. It features all eighteen of her US number-one songs along with a new song, \"Infinity\". She performed a Las Vegas residency show at Caesars Palace called Mariah Carey #1 to Infinity and completed her Sweet Sweet Fantasy Tour across Europe. She performed at the New Year's Eve countdown show, Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest, on December 31, 2016. This performance was not received well by viewers. Her in-ear monitors were not working, which led her to walk around the stage and eventually lip-sync \"We Belong Together\". On February 3, 2017, she released a new single, \"I Don't\", featuring rapper YG. Footage was shown of Carey recording the song on her docuseries, Mariah's World. In October 2017, a new song, \"The Star\", was released for the soundtrack of a film of the same name. During Christmas 2017, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" reached a new high of #9 on the Billboard Hot 100. Carey again performed at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest on New Year's Eve 2017. This performance was much more acclaimed than the one of the previous year. The song finally reached number one for the week ending December 19, 2019.[7] It became Carey's nineteenth US number-one, continuing her record of the most number-ones in the US by a soloist. Carey revealed that she had joined rapper Jay-Z's company, Roc Nation, for management.[8] In 2020, Carey announced that she would be releasing an autobiography, The Meaning of Mariah Carey, on September 29, 2020.[9] She is also releasing a compilation album, The Rarities, on October 2, 2020.[10] Carey possesses a five-octave coloratura soprano vocal range. She lists Aretha Franklin, Patti LaBelle, Chaka Khan, Luther Vandross, Michael Jackson, Deniece Williams, Minnie Riperton, Diana Ross, Natalie Cole, Whitney Houston, Donna Summer, Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan Al Green, George Michael, Stevie Wonder and Gladys Knight as her musical influences. She cited Minnie Riperton as one of her musical influences for the use of a whistle register. During the release of Glitter, Carey suffered a breakdown and was put in the hospital for exhaustion.[11] Carey married Nick Cannon on April 30, 2008.[12] On their 3rd wedding anniversary, she gave birth to her fraternal twins, a boy, Moroccan and a girl, Monroe. Cannon announced his separation from Carey in 2014. He filed for divorce the same year of their separation and it was finalized in 2016.

                "content": "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular music and the subject of widespread media coverage. Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, starting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Love Story\", and \"You Belong with Me\" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Bad Blood\" and \"Look What You Made Me Do\". Shifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and switched to indie folk styles in the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore. She experimented with subdued pop genres on Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024), and began re-recording her Big Machine albums as Taylor's Version[a] due to an ownership dispute with the label. Through the 2020s, she garnered the US number one songs \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"All Too Well\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"Cruel Summer\", \"Is It Over Now?\", and \"Fortnight\". She has undertaken six concert tours, including the Eras Tour (2023–2024), the highest-grossing tour of all time. Her films include Miss Americana (2020), All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and The Eras Tour (2023)—the highest-grossing concert film. Swift is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with a record seven albums that moved one million copies first-week. She is the highest-grossing performer, the first billionaire from music primarily, and the world's richest female musician. She has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as Rolling Stone, Billboard and Forbes, as well as the only individual from the arts to have been named the Time Person of the Year (2023). Swift is the most-awarded artist of the American Music Awards (40), the Billboard Music Awards (49), and the MTV Video Music Awards (30). She also received 14 Grammy Awards (including a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, and a record four IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards. She is an advocate of artists' rights and women's empowerment. Her fans are known as Swifties. Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[1] She is named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor.[2][3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[4] Swift's younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[5] Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer,[6] whose singing in church became one of Swift's earliest memories of music that shaped her career.[4] Swift is of Scottish, English, and German descent, with distant Italian and Irish ancestry.[7][8][9] Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania that her father had purchased from one of his clients,[10] and she spent her summers at her family's vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where she occasionally performed acoustic songs at a local coffee shop.[11] She is a Christian[12] and attended preschool and kindergarten at a Montessori school run by the Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[13][14] When her family moved to Wyomissing, she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[15][16] As a child, she performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions[17] and traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[18] Her early love for country music was influenced by Shania Twain, Patsy Cline, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[14] and she spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[19][20] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, she became determined to pursue a country-music career in Nashville, Tennessee.[21] At 11, Swift traveled to Nashville with her mother to visit record labels and submit demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[22] She was rejected by all the labels, which led her to focus on songwriting.[23] She started learning the guitar at 12 with the help of Ronnie Cremer, a computer repairman and local musician who also assisted Swift with writing an original song.[24] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with the talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD.[25] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, 13-year-old Swift was given an artist development deal and began to travel regularly to Nashville with her mother.[26][27] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[28][29] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[30] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[3][31] In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[32][33] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[34] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[35] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing,[36] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people's stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[27][20] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[37] At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[39] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[27] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[40][41][42] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[20] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[43] Released in October 2006, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[44][45] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a platinum-certified debut album.[46] Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations.[47] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[48] as a replacement for Eric Church.[49] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[47][28] Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\", and \"Should've Said No\". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one. \"Our Song\" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a Hot Country Songs number-one single,[50] and \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was Swift's breakthrough single on mainstream radio and charts.[51][52][53] Swift released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[54][55] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[56] Brad Paisley,[57] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[58] Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[59] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[60] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[61] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[62] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[63] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[64] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[65] Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released in November 2008 in North America,[66] and in March 2009 in other markets.[67] On the Billboard 200, Fearless spent 11 weeks at number one, becoming Swift's first chart topper and the longest-running number-one female country album.[68] It was the bestselling album of 2009 in the US.[69] Its lead single, \"Love Story\", was her first number one in Australia and the first country song to top Billboard's Pop Songs chart,[70][71] and its third single, \"You Belong with Me\", was the first country song to top Billboard's all-genre Radio Songs chart.[72] Three other singles were released in 2008–2010: \"White Horse\", \"Fifteen\", and \"Fearless\". All five singles were Hot Country Songs top 10 entries, with \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" topping the chart.[73] In 2009, Swift toured as an opening act for Keith Urban and embarked on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour.[74] \"You Belong with Me\" won Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[75] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by the rapper Kanye West, an incident that became the subject of controversy and widespread media coverage.[76] That year, Swift won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[77] Billboard named her the 2009 Artist of the Year.[78] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for \"Love Story\" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called \"Thug Story\".[79] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.[80] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[81] Throughout 2009, Swift featured on and wrote other musicians' releases. She featured on \"Half of My Heart\" by John Mayer, whom she was romantically linked with in late 2009.[82][83] She wrote \"Best Days of Your Life\" for Kellie Pickler,[84] co-wrote and featured on Boys Like Girls' \"Two Is Better Than One,[85] and wrote two songs—\"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\"—for the soundtrack of Hannah Montana: The Movie, in which she had a cameo appearance.[86][87] She wrote and recorded \"Today Was a Fairytale\" for the soundtrack of Valentine's Day (2010), in which she had her acting debut.[88] \"Today Was a Fairytale\" was her first number-one single on the Canadian Hot 100.[89] While shooting Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[90] On television, she made her debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode[91] and hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host ever to write their own opening monologue.[92][93] Swift's third studio album, Speak Now, was released in October 2010.[94] Written solely by Swift,[95] the album debuted the Billboard 200 with over one million US copies sold first week[96] and became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist.[97] Speak Now was supported by six singles: \"Mine\", \"Back to December\", \"Mean\", \"The Story of Us\", \"Sparks Fly\", and \"Ours\". \"Mine\" peaked at number three and was the highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100,[98] the first three singles reached the top 10 in Canada,[89] and the last two reached number one on Hot Country Songs.[73] Swift promoted Speak Now with the Speak Now World Tour from February 2011 to March 2012[99] and the live album Speak Now World Tour – Live.[100] At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, Swift performed \"Mean\", which won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance.[101] She was named Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011),[102][103] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[104] and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[105] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[106] At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[107] Rolling Stone named Speak Now on its list of \"50 Best Female Albums of All Time\" (2012).[108] Red, Swift's fourth studio album, was released in October 2012.[109] On Red, Swift worked with Chapman and new producers including Max Martin, Shellback, Dan Wilson, Jeff Bhasker, Dann Huff, and Butch Walker, resulting in a genre-spanning record that incorporated eclectic styles of pop and rock such as Britrock, dubstep, and dance-pop.[110][111] The album opened at number one on the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million sales[112] and was Swift's first number-one album in the UK.[113] Its lead single, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", was her first number one on the Billboard Hot 100,[114] and its third single, \"I Knew You Were Trouble\", reached the top five on charts worldwide.[115] Other singles from Red were \"Begin Again\", \"22\", \"Everything Has Changed\", \"The Last Time\", and \"Red\".[116] Red and its single \"Begin Again\" received three nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (2014).[117] Swift received American Music Awards for Best Female Country Artist in 2012, Artist of the Year in 2013,[118][119] and the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist Award for the fifth and sixth consecutive years.[120] At the 2014 Country Music Association Awards, Swift was honored with the Pinnacle Award, making her the second recipient in history after Garth Brooks.[121] The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and became the highest-grossing country tour upon completion.[122] Swift continued writing songs for films and featuring on other artists' releases. On the soundtrack album to The Hunger Games (2012), Swift wrote and recorded \"Eyes Open\" and \"Safe & Sound\"; the latter of which was co-written with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett. \"Safe & Sound\" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[123] She wrote and produced \"Sweeter than Fiction\" with Jack Antonoff for the soundtrack to One Chance (2013).[124] Swift featured on B.o.B's \"Both of Us\" (2012)[125] and provided vocals for Tim McGraw's \"Highway Don't Care\" (2013), also featuring Keith Urban.[126] She was a voice actress in The Lorax (2012),[127] made a cameo in the sitcom New Girl (2013),[128] and had a supporting role in the dystopian film The Giver (2014).[129] From 2010 to 2013, Swift was romantically involved with the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, the political heir Conor Kennedy, and the singer Harry Styles.[83] In March 2014, Swift began living in New York City, which she credited as a creative influence on her fifth studio album, 1989.[note 1] She described 1989 as her first \"official pop album\" and produced it with Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.[132] Released in October 2014, the album opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.28 million copies sold.[133] Its singles \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\" reached number one in Australia, Canada, and the US, with the first two making Swift the first woman to replace herself at the Hot 100 top spot.[134] Other singles include \"Style\", \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Out of the Woods\", and \"New Romantics\".[135] The 1989 World Tour (2015) was the highest-grossing tour of the year with $250 million in total revenue.[136] After publishing an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal stressing the importance of albums as a creative medium for artists,[137] in November 2014, Swift removed her catalog from ad-supported, free music streaming platforms such as Spotify.[138] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during its free three-month trial period and threatened to withdraw her music from the platform,[139] which prompted Apple Inc. to announce that it would pay artists during the free trial period.[140] Swift then agreed to keep 1989 and her catalog on Apple Music.[141] Big Machine Records returned Swift's catalog to Spotify among other free streaming platforms in June 2017.[142] Swift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[143] At the 2014 American Music Awards, Swift received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence.[144] On her 25th birthday in 2014, the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live opened an exhibit in her honor in Los Angeles that ran until October 4, 2015.[145][146] In 2015, Swift won the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist.[147] \"Bad Blood\" won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.[148] At the 58th Grammy Awards (2016), 1989 won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, making Swift the first woman to win Album of the Year twice.[149] Swift dated the DJ Calvin Harris from March 2015 to June 2016.[150] They co-wrote the song \"This Is What You Came For\", featuring vocals from Rihanna; Swift was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg.[151] She recorded \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" with Zayn Malik for the soundtrack to Fifty Shades Darker (2017)[152] and won a Country Music Association Award for Song of the Year with \"Better Man\", which she wrote for the band Little Big Town.[153] In April 2016, Kanye West released the single \"Famous\", in which he references Swift in the line, \"I made that bitch famous.\" Swift criticized West and said she never consented to the lyric, but West claimed that he had received her approval and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the song amicably over the phone. The controversy made Swift a subject of an online \"cancel\" movement.[154] In late 2016, after briefly dating Tom Hiddleston, Swift began a six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn and retreated herself from the public spotlight.[155][156] In August 2017, Swift successfully countersued David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from loss of employment. Four years earlier, she informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event.[157] The public controversies influenced Swift's sixth studio album, Reputation, which explored the impact of her fame and musically incorporated electropop with urban styles of hip hop and R&B.[158] Released in November 2017,[159] Reputation opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million US sales[160] and topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada.[161] The album's lead single, \"Look What You Made Me Do\", was Swift's first UK number-one single[162] and topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the US.[163] Its singles \"...Ready for It?\", \"End Game\", and \"Delicate\" were released to pop radio.[164] Reputation was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.[165] Swift featured on the country duo Sugarland's \"Babe\" (2018).[166] At the 2018 American Music Awards, Swift won four awards, which made her accumulate 23 trophies in total and become the AMAs' most awarded female musician, surpassing Whitney Houston.[167] The same year, she embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour,[168] which became the highest-grossing North American concert tour in history and grossed $345.7 million worldwide.[169] In November 2018, Swift signed a new deal with Universal Music Group, which promoted her subsequent albums under Republic Records' imprint.[170] The contract included a provision for Swift to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[171][172] Swift's first album with Republic Records, Lover, was released in August 2019.[173] She produced the album with Antonoff, Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little.[174] Lover peaked atop the charts of such territories as Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the US.[175] The album spawned five singles: \"Me!\", \"You Need to Calm Down\", \"Lover\", \"The Man\", and \"Cruel Summer\"; the first two singles peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and the lattermost single became a resurgent success in 2023, reaching number one.[176] Lover was 2019's best selling album in the US and best selling album by a solo artist worldwide.[177] The album and its singles earned three nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.[178] At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Video of the Year for \"You Need to Calm Down\", becoming the first female and second artist overall to win the category for a self-directed video.[179] While promoting Lover in 2019, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with the talent manager Scooter Braun after he purchased Big Machine Records, including the masters of her albums that the label had released.[180] Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine would only allow her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under a new contract, which she refused to sign.[180] In November 2020, Swift began re-recording her back catalog, which enabled her to own the new masters and the licensing of her songs for commercial use, substituting for the Big Machine-owned masters.[181] In February 2020, Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group after her 16-year contract with Sony/ATV expired.[182] Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Swift surprise-released two \"sister albums\" that she recorded and produced with Antonoff and Aaron Dessner: Folklore in July and Evermore in December.[183] Joe Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced a few songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[184] Both albums incorporated a muted indie folk production;[185] each was supported by three singles catering to US pop, country, and triple A radio formats. The singles were \"Cardigan\", \"Betty\", and \"Exile\" from Folklore, and \"Willow\", \"No Body, No Crime\", and \"Coney Island\" from Evermore.[186] Folklore was the bestselling album of 2020 in the US[187] and, together with \"Cardigan\", made Swift the first artist to debut a US number-one album and a number-one song in the same week; she achieved the feat again with Evermore and \"Willow\".[188] According to Billboard, Swift was the highest-paid musician in the US and highest-paid solo musician worldwide of 2020.[189] Folklore made Swift the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times, winning the category at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021).[190] At the American Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Artist of the Year for a third record time (2020)[191] and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and Favorite Pop/Rock Album (2021).[192] Swift played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song \"Beautiful Ghosts\".[193][194] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift's life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival.[195] Swift's re-recordings of her first six studio albums began with Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version), which were released in April and November 2021. Both peaked atop the Billboard 200, and the former was the first re-recorded album to do so.[196] Fearless (Taylor's Version) was preceded by \"Love Story (Taylor's Version)\", which made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and re-recorded versions of a song reach number one on Hot Country Songs.[197] Red (Taylor's Version) was supported by \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", which became the longest song in history to top the Hot 100.[198] Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights, was released in October 2022.[199] The album incorporates a restrained electropop[200] and synth-pop sound[201] with elements of hip hop, R&B, and electronica.[199][202] In the US, Midnights was her fifth to open atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies, and its tracks, led by the single \"Anti-Hero\", made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 10 of the Hot 100.[203] Globally, the album broke the record for the most single-day streams and most single-week streams on Spotify and peaked atop the charts of at least 14 countries.[204] The album's two further singles, \"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma\", both peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[205] According to Billboard, Swift was the top-earning solo artist in the US and the top-earning musician worldwide of 2021.[206][207] She won six American Music Awards including Artist of the Year in 2022.[208] At the MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won her third and fourth trophies for Video of the Year with All Too Well: The Short Film, her self-directed short film that accompanies \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", in 2022[209] and \"Anti-Hero\" in 2023.[210] During this period, Swift won three Grammy Awards: Best Music Video for All Too Well: The Short Film[211] and Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year for Midnights. Swift became the first artist to win Album of the Year four times in Grammy history.[212] Swift's next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), were released in July and October 2023. The former made Swift the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand,[213] and the latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, claiming her career's largest album sales week.[214] 1989 (Taylor's Version)'s single \"Is It Over Now?\" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[215] Swift featured on Big Red Machine's \"Renegade\" and \"Birch\" (2021),[216] Haim's \"Gasoline\" (2021),[217] Ed Sheeran's \"The Joker and the Queen\" (2022),[218] and the National's \"The Alcott\" (2023).[219] For the soundtrack of Where the Crawdads Sing (2022), she wrote and recorded \"Carolina\", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards.[220] In 2023, Swift was the most streamed artist on Spotify,[221] Apple Music,[222] and Amazon Music;[223] and the first act to place number one on the year-end Billboard top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023).[224] She had five out of the 10 best-selling albums of 2023 in the US, a record since Luminate began tracking US music sales in 1991.[225] Besides music, Swift had a supporting role in the period comedy film Amsterdam (2022).[226] In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums. Media outlets extensively covered the tour's global cultural and economic impact,[227] and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[203] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour's ticket sales.[228] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history.[229][230] Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[231][232] Swift's eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, was released on April 19, 2024.[233] Topping charts globally, the album broke a string of records: it marked the first album ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week; sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US; made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 14 of the Billboard Hot 100 and the top 10 of Australia's ARIA Singles Chart; and went on to spend 17 weeks atop the Billboard 200—Swift's longest-running number-one album on the chart. The lead single, \"Fortnight,\" featuring Post Malone, became Swift's 12th number one song on the Hot 100.[234][235][236] After the pandemic, Swift's music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity.[237] From 2023 onward, Swift found ubiquitous success, albeit more dominant than before, with the successes of the re-recordings, the Eras Tour, its concert film, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department, significantly increasing her net worth; Music Business Worldwide remarked this as a \"new stratosphere of global career success\" for Swift.[238][239] In 2023, she began dating the American football player Travis Kelce,[240] and in 2024, won Artist of the Year at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[241] Swift was Spotify's most streamed artist of 2023 and 2024.[242][243] In January 2024, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to Twitter and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[244] In July, Swift and Kelce received death threats from a stalker in Gelsenkirchen, Germany,[245] and three children were killed in a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed workshop in Southport, England, leading to civil unrest in the UK.[246] In August, all three of the Eras Tour concerts in Vienna were canceled following the arrest of two suspects for allegedly planning an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack in the city. The plan was uncovered by US Intelligence and was thwarted by Austrian police forces.[247] Swift has ventured into diverse genres throughout her career, including pop,[b] country,[c] folk,[d] rock,[e] and alternative music.[f] Her early musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[264] and Keith Urban's country crossover sounds incorporating rock, pop, and blues.[265] She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift to Red.[266] The albums feature country signifiers such as banjo, six-string banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and a slight vocal twang, in addition to pop melodies and rock influences;[267][268] Speak Now draws on rock styles such as pop rock, pop-punk, and 1980s arena rock.[95][269] Critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's narrative songwriting rather than musical direction[270][271] and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray from its roots.[272][273] After the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna.[274][275] 1989, the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense synthesizers and drum machines.[276] Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums;[277] Reputation consists of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences;[158][278] and Lover features eclectic elements from country, pop-punk, and folk rock.[279] When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity,[280] but others regarded it as necessary for Swift's artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism.[281][282] Her 2020 alternative albums Folklore and Evermore explore indie styles of rock and folk, and both incorporate a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestration, synthesizers, and drum pads.[263][283][284] The latter experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric time signatures, and diverse instruments.[285][286] Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's artistry as a singer-songwriter.[284] Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department both incorporate a minimalist, subdued synth-pop sound, making use of analog synthesizers, sustained bass notes, and simple drum machine patterns.[287][288] With continuous musical reinventions,[289] Swift was described by Time and the BBC as a musical \"chameleon\".[290][291] Jody Rosen commented that by originating her career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[292] Clash wrote that she has the versatility to \"no longer [...] be defined by any genre or sound label\".[293] According to Ann Powers, Swift's sound is genre-agnostic, blending and \"reconfiguring\" elements of country, R&B, indie pop, and hip hop.[294][295] Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range[300] and a generally soft and breathy timbre that Rolling Stone deemed versatile.[301][302] Reviews of Swift's early country albums criticized her vocals as weak and strained compared to those of other female country singers.[303] Despite the criticism, most reviewers appreciated that Swift refrained from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune and how she prioritized \"intimacy over power and nuance\" to communicate the messages of her songs with her audience[304]—a style that has been described as conversational.[305][306] According to Powers, Swift's defining vocal feature was her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[307] On Red and 1989, Swift's vocals are electronically processed to accompany the pop production.[308][305] Her voice on Reputation and Midnights incorporates hip-hop and R&B influences that result in a near-rap delivery which emphasizes rhythm and cadence over melody.[309][294] She uses her lower register vocals extensively in \"Cardigan\"[310] and both her lower and upper registers in Evermore; the musicologist Alyssa Barca described her timbre in the upper register as \"breathy and bright\" and the lower register as \"full and dark\".[286] Reviews in The New York Times, Variety and The Atlantic were more appreciative of Swift's vocals in her later albums.[268][311][312][313] She ranked 102nd on Rolling Stone's 2023 list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time: \"A decade ago, including her on this list would have been a controversial move, but recent releases like Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights officially settled the argument.\"[302] Laura Snapes of The Guardian said that Swift's \"vocal directness\" enables her to express wide-ranging feelings, highlighting some trademarks such as \"yo-yoing vocal yelp\" and \"climactic, processed cri de coeur\".[314] Amanda Petrusich praised how the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals accentuate her lyrics.[315] Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood. She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations.[316][317] She enjoyed Disney film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them.[318] Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton;[19][104] 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette;[319] Joni Mitchell;[320] and Fall Out Boy.[321] She listed Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs.[28][322] Her literary influences include the authors William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne, F. Scott Fitzgerald,[323] and the poets William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson;[324] the last of whom was a distant cousin of Swift.[325] In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[28] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[326][29] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[327][328] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[95][329] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[330] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[274] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[331] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[332] Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,[333][334] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[317][335] She often references or draws inspiration from historical events and figures.[336] Swift's confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[337][28][338] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music,[339][340][341] although some perceived her as a fragile, juvenile artist, a label she has consistently challenged.[337] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[342][305] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[158] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[305] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[28] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[343][344][345] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[346] On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[347] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[327] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[347] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[348] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[349] Swift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[350] Fans noticed that the fifth track of every Swift album was the most emotionally vulnerable of the album.[351] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[352] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[353] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[203] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You're Anything Like Me\".[354] Critics have analyzed the distinctive qualities and thematic depth in Swift's songwriting. Critic Kitty Empire opined in 2024 that Swift is \"a profoundly old-fashioned artist\", whose songs \"tell a story, in succinct, emotive ways that often scan meticulously\" unlike most pop music of the time; Empire attributed it to Swift's country beginnings.[355] Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[356][349] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[357] Mojo dubbed her \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[358] Academics have variably described her as a poet laureate,[359] philosopher,[360] and bard.[292] Swift commands large audiences on stage,[361][362][363] captivating them through emotional storytelling and vocal delivery rather than relying on elaborate choreography.[364] According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[365] In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\"[271] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour,[366] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\".[367] Swift's concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[368] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[369] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[370] acoustic guitar; piano;[371] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[372][373] six-string banjo,[374] or ukulele.[375] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[315][376] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains \"integral to her singer-songwriter origins\".[377][371] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift \"pop's most approachable superstar\",[378] and the 21st century's most popular performer.[379] Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[380] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time, she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\" in 2011[381] and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White the year before.[382] In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes.\"[383] From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement.[384] She worked with American Express for the \"Blank Space\" music video (which Kahn directed) and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[385] Swift produced the music video for \"Bad Blood\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[386] Her production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media, starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour.[387] She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles \"Me!\" with Dave Meyers, and \"You Need to Calm Down\" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and \"Lover\" with Drew Kirsch,[388] but first ventured into sole direction with the video for \"The Man\" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction).[389] After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,[203] which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director.[390] Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.[380] Swift's discography is a \"critically hailed songbook\", as per Time's Sam Lansky.[391] She has won 14 Grammy Awards (including four for Album of the Year—the most won by an artist),[392] an Emmy Award,[393] 40 American Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[394] 49 Billboard Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[395] 118 Guinness World Records,[396] 30 MTV Video Music Awards (including five Video of the Year wins—the most by an act),[397] 12 Country Music Association Awards (including the Pinnacle Award),[398] eight Academy of Country Music Awards,[399] and two Brit Awards.[147] As a songwriter, she has been honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association,[59][400] the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the National Music Publishers' Association and was the youngest person on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time in 2015.[401][402] At the 64th BMI Awards in 2016, Swift was the first woman to be honored with an award named after its recipient.[403] From available data, Swift has amassed over 50 million album sales and 150 million single sales as of 2019,[404][405][406] and 114 million units globally, including 78 billion streams as of 2021.[407][408] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ranked her as the Global Recording Artist of the Year for a record four times (2014, 2019, 2022, and 2023).[409] Swift has the most number-one albums in the UK and Ireland for a female artist this century,[410][411] earned the highest income for an artist on Chinese digital music platforms (CN¥ 159,000,000 as of 2021),[412] and is the first artist to occupy the entire top five[note 2] of the Australian albums chart[415][416] and the top ten of the country's singles chart.[417] Swift remains the world's highest-grossing touring act ever, with cumulative ticket sales at $3.12 billion as of December 2024, per Pollstar.[418] The Eras Tour is the highest-grossing tour of all time and the first to surpass $1 billion in revenue.[419][229] Beginning with Fearless, each of her studio albums have opened with over one million global units.[420][421] Swift is the most-streamed act on Spotify,[422] and the most-streamed female artist on Apple Music.[423] On Spotify, she is the only artist to have received more than 250 million and 350 million streams in one day (260 million on October 27, 2023, and 380 million on April 19, 2024)[424] and was the first female act to reach 100 million monthly listeners.[425][198] The most entries and the most simultaneous entries (175 and 34 songs), and most number-ones (5) for a soloist on the Billboard Global 200, are among her feats.[426][427] Swift is the first and only artist to occupy the top nine spots on the Global 200.[426] She has the most entries (154), top-ten songs (20), and number-ones (3)[note 3] among solo acts on the Global 200 Excl. US.[426] In the US, Swift has sold over 37.3 million albums as of 2019,[406] when Billboard placed her eighth on its Greatest of All Time Artists Chart.[428] Twelve of her songs have topped the Billboard Hot 100.[429] She is the longest-reigning and the first act to spend at least 100 weeks atop the Billboard Artist 100 (120 weeks);[430][431] the soloist with the most cumulative weeks atop and in the top ten of the Billboard 200 (84 and 425);[432][433] the woman with the most Billboard 200 number-ones (14),[434] Hot 100 entries (total and single-week: 264 and 32),[435] number-one debuts (7),[note 4] top-ten songs (59),[429] top-five songs (36),[198] Streaming Songs chart-toppers (9),[429] and weeks atop the Top Country Albums chart (101);[437] and the act with the most number-one songs on Pop Airplay (13)[438] and Digital Songs (29).[429] Swift is the first woman to simultaneously chart five albums in the top 10 and eleven albums on the entire Billboard 200;[439][440] and the first act to occupy the top four spots and chart seven albums[note 5] in the top 10 on the Top Album Sales chart.[442][443] She is the second highest-certified female digital singles artist (and fifth overall) in the US, with 137.5 million total units certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[444] and the first woman to have both an album (Fearless) and a song (\"Shake It Off\") certified Diamond.[445] Swift is the only artist in Luminate history to have seven albums sell over a million copies in a week.[446] Swift has appeared in various power listings. Time included her on its annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010, 2015, and 2019.[447] She was one of the \"Silence Breakers\" that the magazine spotlighted as Person of the Year in 2017 for speaking up about sexual assault,[448] and she received the honor again in 2023 for her cultural domination that year.[391] Time described Swift as the first Person of the Year to be recognized for \"achievement in the arts\", as well as the first woman to be recognized and appear on a Person of the Year cover more than once.[449][391] In 2014, she was named to Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in the music category[450] and again in 2017 in its \"All-Star Alumni\" category.[451] Swift became the youngest woman to be included on Forbes' list of the 100 most powerful women in 2015, ranked at number 64.[452] In 2023, she was ranked by Forbes as the fifth-most powerful woman in the world, the first entertainer to place in the top five.[453] Swift received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from New York University and served as its commencement speaker on May 18, 2022.[203] In 2024, Billboard ranked her at number 2 on its \"Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century\" list.[254] Swift has been credited with making a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture, and the economy.[454][455] She dominates cultural conversations,[456][457] leading some publications to describe her as a cultural \"vitality\" or zeitgeist.[458][459][360] Her music, life, and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture.[289] Initially a teen idol,[460] she has been referred to as a pop icon;[277][461] publications describe her enormous popularity and longevity as unwitnessed since the 20th century.[462][463] In 2013, New York magazine's Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the \"world's biggest pop star\" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift \"falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends\", leaving her contemporaries \"vying for second place\".[292] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[464] Swift's fans are known as Swifties.[228] Billboard noted that only a few artists have achieved her level of chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support.[465] Swift's million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[466][467] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an \"economic genius\".[468] Although labeled by the media in her early career as \"America's Sweetheart\" for her girl next door persona,[469][470] Swift has been called by detractors \"calculated\" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[471][472] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and \"slut-shaming\",[473][474] as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[475] Swift has also been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[476][477] Swift's private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.[478][479] In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights.[480][481] In December 2023, Swift's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, alleging stalking and safety risks; media outlets have reported that the information posted by Sweeney is a synthesis of publicly available data.[482][483] In February 2024, it was reported that Swift had sold one of her two private jets.[484] \"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we're at this moment where there's no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that's on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact.\" Swift helped shape the modern country music scene,[486] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[292][486] pioneered the use of the internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[27][47] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[487][292] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[488] her guitar performances contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\": a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[489][490] According to Pitchfork, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[491] and Billboard notes her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[492] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[174] Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift.[324][493] She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album \"eras\".[494][495] Swift is a subject of academic study and scholarly media research.[289] Various educational institutions offer courses on Swift in literary, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts.[496][289] Swift has influenced numerous music artists, and her albums have inspired a generation of singer-songwriters.[487][283][497] Journalists praise her ability to reform industry practices, noting how her actions changed streaming policies, prompted awareness of intellectual property in new musicians,[498][499] and reshaped ticketing models.[500] Various sources deem Swift's music a paradigm representing the millennial generation;[501] Vox called her the \"millennial Bruce Springsteen\",[502] and The Times named her \"the Bob Dylan of our age\".[503] Swift earned the title Woman of the Decade (2010s) from Billboard,[504] Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards,[505] and Global Icon at the Brit Awards for her impact.[408] Senior artists such as Madonna,[506] Stevie Nicks,[507] Jon Bon Jovi,[508] Dolly Parton,[509] and Elton John have praised her musicianship.[510] Carole King regards Swift as her \"professional granddaughter\" and thanked Swift for \"carrying the torch forward\".[511] Springsteen called her a \"tremendous\" writer,[512] while Elvis Costello compared Swift's songwriting to that of Bob Dylan,[513] and Billy Joel considered Swift the Beatles' successor.[514] Britney Spears labeled Swift \"the most iconic pop woman of our generation\".[515] Media outlets describe Swift as a savvy businesswoman;[516][517] in 2024, she topped Billboard's annual Power 100 ranking of the top music industry executives.[518] Swift is known for her traditional album rollouts, consisting of a variety of promotional activities that Rolling Stone termed as an inescapable \"multimedia bonanza\".[519][520] Easter eggs and cryptic teasers became a common practice in contemporary pop music because of Swift.[521] Publications describe her discography as a music \"universe\" subject to analysis by fans, critics, and journalists.[522][523][524] Swift maintains an active presence on social media and a close relationship with fans, to which many journalists attribute her success.[525][455][526] Her in-house management team is called 13 Management.[527] Swift has endorsed many brands and businesses, having launched clothing lines with L.E.I. and Stella McCartney,[528][529] designed American Greetings cards and Jakks Pacific dolls,[530][531] released a number of fragrances with Elizabeth Arden,[532] and signed multi-year deals with AT&T and Capital One.[533][534] She was a spokesperson for the National Hockey League's Nashville Predators and Sony Cyber-shot digital cameras,[535][536] and became the global ambassador for New York City in 2014 and Record Store Day in 2022.[537][538] Swift identifies as a pro-choice feminist,[539] and is a founding signatory of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment.[540] Specifically, she criticized the US Supreme Court's decision to end federal abortion rights in 2022.[541] Swift also advocates for LGBT rights,[542] and has called for the passing of the Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.[543][544] She performed during WorldPride NYC 2019 at the Stonewall Inn, a gay rights monument, and has donated to the LGBT organizations Tennessee Equality Project and GLAAD.[545][546][547] A supporter of the March for Our Lives movement and gun control reform in the US,[548] Swift is a vocal critic of white supremacy, racism, and police brutality.[321][539] Following the George Floyd protests, she donated to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Black Lives Matter movement,[549] called for the removal of Confederate monuments in Tennessee,[550] and advocated for Juneteenth to become a national holiday.[551] She has openly criticized former president Donald Trump.[552] In 2020, Swift urged her fans to check their voter registration ahead of elections, which resulted in 65,000 people registering to vote within one day of her post,[553] and endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the 2020 US presidential election.[554] For the 2024 election, she endorsed Harris and Tim Walz.[555][556] Swift became a billionaire in October 2023, becoming the world's first musician to achieve the status \"solely based on her songs and performances\".[557][558] Forbes has estimated her net worth at $1.6 billion as of October 2024,[450] making her the richest female musician in the world.[559] Forbes had named her the annual top-earning female musician in 2016, 2019, 2021, and 2022.[560] She was the highest-paid celebrity of 2016 with $170 million—a feat recognized by Guinness World Records as the highest annual earnings ever for a female musician,[561] which she herself surpassed with $185 million in 2019.[562] Overall, Swift was listed as the Forbes highest-paid female artist of the 2010s, earning $825 million.[563] She has also developed a real estate portfolio worth $150 million as of 2023, with residential properties in Nashville, New York City, Los Angeles (Samuel Goldwyn Estate), and Rhode

Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards for her \"dedication to helping others\" and \"inspiring others through action\".[566][567] Especially early in her career, Swift donated to various relief funds following natural disasters. In 2009, she donated $100,000 to the Red Cross to help the victims of the Iowa flood of 2008.[568] The same year, she performed at Sydney's Sound Relief concert, which raised money for those impacted by bushfires and flooding.[569] In 2011, Swift used a dress rehearsal of her Speak Now tour as a benefit concert for victims of recent tornadoes in the US, raising more than $750,000.[570] In response to the May 2010 Tennessee floods, she donated $500,000.[571] In 2009, Swift sang at BBC's Children in Need concert and raised £13,000 for the cause.[572] In 2016, she donated $1 million to Louisiana flood relief efforts and $100,000 to the Dolly Parton Fire Fund.[573][574] Swift donated to food banks after Hurricane Harvey struck Houston in 2017.[575] Swift donated $1 million for Tennessee tornado relief in 2020 and again in 2023,[576][577] as well as $5 million toward the reliefs efforts after Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton in 2024.[578] Swift has also donated to cancer research.

She is the highest-earning female musician of the 2010s and 2020s.[source?] Taylor Swift has won 14 Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award, and 118 Guinness World Records. She is the most-awarded act and woman at the American Music Awards (29 wins) and Billboard Music Awards (23 wins). She has had eleven number-one songs on the Billboard Hot 100. In October 2023, she became a billionaire. She won Apple Music Artist of the Year in 2020 and 2023. Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] at Reading Hospital in West Reading, Pennsylvania, [2]the daughter of Scott Swift and Andrea Gardner.[3] She is named after singer-songwriter James Taylor.[4]She has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift.[5] Swift was raised in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania on a Christmas tree farm.[6] She became interested in musical theater when she was nine. Later, she became interested in country music. On weekends, she performed music at local events. She moved to Hendersonville, Tennessee, near Nashville, when she was 14.[7] Her family moved there to help Swift's career in country music. In Nashville, she went to Hendersonville High School for two years. After that, she went to Aaron Academy, because Aaron Academy made it easier for her to tour while in school. She graduated high school one year early. Additionally, at the age of 10, Swift won a poetry writing competition.[8] She released her first single, \"Tim McGraw\", in 2006 at the age of 16. That same year she released her first album, Taylor Swift. The album reached number 5 on the Billboard albums chart, and sold one million copies by November 2007. She won Country Music Television's (CMT) \"Breakthrough Video of the Year\" award in 2007 for \"Tim McGraw\". She was also nominated by the Academy of Country Music for \"Top New Female Vocalist\". Swift’s second studio album, Fearless, was released in 2008. On September 10, 2009 it reached Platinum, selling 1 million copies. On October 25, 2010 she released her third album, Speak Now. The lead single from Swift's fourth album, Red, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", became her first number-one song on the US Billboard Hot 100. The single \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" reached number two on the chart. It was also her first chart-topper on Billboard's Mainstream Top 40/Pop Songs chart. In 2012 Swift voiced the character Audrey in the movie The Lorax. Swift performed \"Shake It Off\", the lead single from her fifth album, 1989, at the 2014 MTV VMAs.[9] 1989 was released on October 27, 2014. \"Shake It Off\", along with the singles \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\", all reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. These singles, along with \"Style\" and \"Wildest Dreams\", have also topped the Mainstream Top 40/Pop Songs chart. 1989 was based off of Taylors birthday year, 1989. In 2016 she featured on the single, \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" with English singer Zayn Malik (former member of One Direction). It was released as a single for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). It reached number two on the Hot 100 in the US and Canada. On June 8, 2017, Swift restored her music on streaming sites such as Spotify and Apple Music after previously removing it from being streamed. On August 25, 2017, Swift released the single \"Look What You Made Me Do\", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 and broke YouTube's streaming record after getting 43 million views within 24 hours. It also became her first UK chart-topper. Swift announced that her sixth studio album, Reputation, would be released on November 10, 2017. The album included singles such as \"...Ready for It?\" and \"End Game\" featuring American rapper Future and English singer Ed Sheeran. During this era, she met backstage with global superstar Oliver Kang[source?] On April 26, 2019, Swift released the single \"Me!\" featuring Brendon Urie as the lead single from her seventh studio album, Lover. On June 14, 2019, Swift released Lover’s second single \"You Need to Calm Down\". Both of these songs reached number two on the US Hot 100. On August 16, Swift released \"Lover\" as the third single from Lover. She released a duet version of Lover with Canadian recording artist Shawn Mendes. In August 2020, Swift revealed that she was releasing a surprise album called folklore, after it was announced her Loverfest stadium tour was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Its lead single, \"cardigan\", entered at number one on the US Hot 100, becoming her sixth US number-one single. folklore became her seventh US number-one album. She became the first artist to enter at number one on both the Hot 100 singles chart and Billboard 200 album chart in the same week.[10] On December 11, 2020, Swift released her ninth studio album, evermore. It is meant to be a \"sister\" album to folklore.[11] Due to Swift not being able to own her own masters, she has begun re-recording all of her old albums. She released the first song from the re-recording of Fearless (Taylor's Version), \"Love Story\" on February 12, 2021. On November 12, 2021 she released Red (Taylor's Version). Swift's 10th studio album Midnights came out on October 21, 2022. In March 2023 Swift started her Eras Tour. The tour covers all her albums. The US part of the tour sold the most tickets in one day ever. Many people said that the company handling the ticket sales, Ticketmaster, did not do well.[12] The Eras Tour earned the most money of any tour in history. It earned over $1 billion.[13][14] During this time, she also released Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version). On February 4, 2024, Swift won Album of the Year at the 66th Grammy Awards. She was the first artist to win in this category four times.

Today she's the most recognizable country-- or formerly country? or pop?-- artist in North America, if not the world: her songwriting takes in half a dozen genres, and her economic impact changes cities. We will move through Swift's own catalogue, including hits, deep cuts, outtakes, re-recordings, considering songwriting as its own art, distinct from poems recited or silently read. We will learn how to study fan culture, celebrity culture, adolescence, adulthood and appropriation; how to think about white texts, Southern texts, transatlantic texts, and queer subtexts. We will learn how to think about illicit affairs, and hoaxes, champagne problems and incomplete closure. We will look at her precursors, from Dolly Parton to the Border Ballads, and at work about her (such as the documentary \"Miss Americana\"). And we will read literary works important to her and works about song and performance, with novels, memoirs and poems by (among others) Willa Cather, James Weldon Johnson, Tracey Thorn, and William Wordsworth.

                "title": "Bob Dylan - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Bob Dylan (legally Robert Dylan;[3] born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter. Considered one of the greatest songwriters of all time,[4][5][6] Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture over his 60-year career. He rose to prominence in the 1960s, when songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (1963) and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights and antiwar movements. Initially modeling his style on Woody Guthrie's folk songs,[7] Robert Johnson's blues[8] and what he called the \"architectural forms\" of Hank Williams's country songs,[9] Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s, infusing it \"with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry\".[6] His lyrics incorporated political, social, and philosophical influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning counterculture.[10] Dylan was born and raised in St. Louis County, Minnesota. Following his self-titled debut album of traditional folk songs in 1962, he made his breakthrough with The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan (1963). The album featured \"Girl from the North Country\" and \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\", which adapted the tunes and phrasing of older folk songs. He released the politically charged The Times They Are a-Changin' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan drew controversy among folk purists when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most influential rock albums of the 1960s: Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited (both 1965) and Blonde on Blonde (1966). Dylan's move from acoustic folk and blues music to rock contributed to the development of folk rock, as his musical and lyrical output grew in complexity. His six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" (1965) expanded commercial and creative boundaries in popular music.[11][12] In July 1966, a motorcycle crash led Dylan to cease touring. During this period, he recorded a large body of songs with members of the Band, who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were later released as The Basement Tapes (1975). In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored country music and rural themes on John Wesley Harding (1967), Nashville Skyline (1969) and New Morning (1970). In 1975, he released Blood on the Tracks, which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a born-again Christian and released three albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. Dylan's Time Out of Mind (1997) marked the beginning of a career renaissance. He has released five critically acclaimed albums of original material since, most recently Rough and Rowdy Ways (2020). He also recorded a trilogy of albums covering the Great American Songbook, especially songs sung by Frank Sinatra, and an album smoothing his early rock material into a mellower Americana sensibility, Shadow Kingdom (2023). Dylan has toured continuously since the late 1980s on what has become known as the Never Ending Tour.[13] Since 1994, Dylan has published nine books of paintings and drawings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. With an estimated figure of more than 125 million records sold,[14] Dylan is one of the best-selling musicians of all-time. He has received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, ten Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2008, the Pulitzer Prize Board awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\" In 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.[15] Bob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman (Hebrew: שבתאי זיסל בן אברהם Shabtai Zisl ben Avraham)[1][16][17] in St. Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota.[18] Dylan's paternal grandparents, Anna Kirghiz and Zigman Zimmerman, emigrated from Odessa in the Russian Empire (now Odesa, Ukraine) to the United States, following the 1905 pogroms against Jews.[19] His maternal grandparents, Florence and Ben Stone, were Lithuanian Jews who had arrived in the United States in 1902.[19] Dylan wrote that his paternal grandmother's family was originally from the Kağızman district of Kars Province in northeastern Turkey.[20] Dylan's father Abram Zimmerman and his mother Beatrice \"Beatty\" Stone were part of a small, close-knit Jewish community.[21][22][23] They lived in Duluth until Dylan was six, when his father contracted polio and the family returned to his mother's hometown of Hibbing, where they lived for the rest of Dylan's childhood, and his father and paternal uncles ran a furniture and appliance store.[23][24] In the early 1950s Dylan listened to the Grand Ole Opry radio show and heard the songs of Hank Williams. He later wrote: \"The sound of his voice went through me like an electric rod.\"[9] Dylan was also impressed by the delivery of Johnnie Ray: \"He was the first singer whose voice and style, I guess, I totally fell in love with… I loved his style, wanted to dress like him too.\"[25] As a teenager, Dylan heard rock and roll on radio stations broadcasting from Shreveport and Little Rock.[26] Dylan formed several bands while attending Hibbing High School. In the Golden Chords, he performed covers of songs by Little Richard[27] and Elvis Presley.[28] Their performance of Danny & the Juniors' \"Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay\" at their high school talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone.[29] In 1959, Dylan's high school yearbook carried the caption \"Robert Zimmerman: to join 'Little Richard'\".[27][30] That year, as Elston Gunnn, he performed two dates with Bobby Vee, playing piano and clapping.[31][32][33] In September 1959, Dylan enrolled at the University of Minnesota.[34] Living at the Jewish-centric fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu house, Dylan began to perform at the Ten O'Clock Scholar, a coffeehouse a few blocks from campus, and became involved in the Dinkytown folk music circuit.[35][36] His focus on rock and roll gave way to American folk music, as he explained in a 1985 interview: The thing about rock'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn't enough ... There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms ... but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings.[37] During this period, he began to introduce himself as \"Bob Dylan\".[38] In his memoir, he wrote that he considered adopting the surname Dillon before unexpectedly seeing poems by Dylan Thomas, and deciding upon the given name spelling.[39][a 1] In a 2004 interview, he said, \"You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the free.\"[40] In May 1960, Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year. In January 1961, he traveled to New York City to perform and visit his musical idol Woody Guthrie[41] at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital.[42] Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances. He wrote of Guthrie's impact: \"The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them... [He] was the true voice of the American spirit. I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie's greatest disciple\".[43] In addition to visiting Guthrie, Dylan befriended his protégé Ramblin' Jack Elliott.[44] From February 1961, Dylan played at clubs around Greenwich Village, befriending and picking up material from folk singers, including Dave Van Ronk, Fred Neil, Odetta, the New Lost City Ramblers and Irish musicians the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem.[45] In September, The New York Times critic Robert Shelton boosted Dylan's career with a very enthusiastic review of his performance at Gerde's Folk City: \"Bob Dylan: A Distinctive Folk-Song Stylist\".[46] That month, Dylan played harmonica on folk singer Carolyn Hester's third album, bringing him to the attention of the album's producer John Hammond,[47] who signed Dylan to Columbia Records.[48] Dylan's debut album, Bob Dylan, released March 19, 1962,[49][50] consisted of traditional folk, blues and gospel material with just two original compositions, \"Talkin' New York\" and \"Song to Woody\". The album sold 5,000 copies in its first year, just breaking even.[51] In August 1962, Dylan changed his name to Bob Dylan,[a 2] and signed a management contract with Albert Grossman.[52] Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was known for his sometimes confrontational personality and protective loyalty.[53] Dylan said, \"He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker figure ... you could smell him coming.\"[36] Tension between Grossman and John Hammond led to the latter suggesting Dylan work with the jazz producer Tom Wilson, who produced several tracks for the second album without formal credit. Wilson produced the next three albums Dylan recorded.[54][55] Dylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom from December 1962 to January 1963.[56] He had been invited by television director Philip Saville to appear in Madhouse on Castle Street, which Saville was directing for BBC Television.[57] At the end of the play, Dylan performed \"Blowin' in the Wind\", one of its first public performances.[57] While in London, Dylan performed at London folk clubs, including the Troubadour, Les Cousins, and Bunjies.[56][58] He also learned material from UK performers, including Martin Carthy.[57] By the release of Dylan's second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, in May 1963, he had begun to make his name as a singer-songwriter. Many songs on the album were labeled protest songs, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by Pete Seeger's topical songs.[59] \"Oxford Town\" was an account of James Meredith's ordeal as the first Black student to enroll at the University of Mississippi.[60] The first song on the album, \"Blowin' in the Wind\", partly derived its melody from the traditional slave song \"No More Auction Block\",[61] while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo. The song was widely recorded by other artists and became a hit for Peter, Paul and Mary.[62] \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" was based on the folk ballad \"Lord Randall\". With its apocalyptic premonitions, the song gained resonance when the Cuban Missile Crisis developed a few weeks after Dylan began performing it.[63][a 3] Both songs marked a new direction in songwriting, blending a stream-of-consciousness, imagist lyrical attack with traditional folk form.[64] Dylan's topical songs led to his being viewed as more than just a songwriter. Janet Maslin wrote of Freewheelin': These were the songs that established [Dylan] as the voice of his generation—someone who implicitly understood how concerned young Americans felt about nuclear disarmament and the growing Civil Rights Movement: his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributes.[65][a 4] Freewheelin' also included love songs and surreal talking blues. Humor was an important part of Dylan's persona,[66] and the range of material on the album impressed listeners, including the Beatles. George Harrison said of the album: \"We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude—it was incredibly original and wonderful\".[67] The rough edge of Dylan's singing unsettled some but attracted others. Author Joyce Carol Oates wrote: \"When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, the effect was dramatic and electrifying\".[68] Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers, such as Joan Baez, who became Dylan's advocate and lover.[69] Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts.[70] Others who had hits with Dylan's songs in the early 1960s included the Byrds, Sonny & Cher, the Hollies, the Association, Manfred Mann and the Turtles. \"Mixed-Up Confusion\", recorded during the Freewheelin' sessions with a backing band, was released as Dylan's first single in December 1962, but then swiftly withdrawn. In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album, the single showed a willingness to experiment with a rockabilly sound. Cameron Crowe described it as \"a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards Elvis Presley and Sun Records\".[71] In May 1963, Dylan's political profile rose when he walked out of The Ed Sullivan Show. During rehearsals, Dylan had been told by CBS television's head of program practices that \"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\" was potentially libelous to the John Birch Society. Rather than comply with censorship, Dylan refused to appear.[72] Dylan and Baez were prominent in the civil rights movement, singing together at the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Dylan performed \"Only a Pawn in Their Game\" and \"When the Ship Comes In\".[73] Dylan's third album, The Times They Are a-Changin', reflected a more politicized Dylan.[74] The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary stories, with \"Only a Pawn in Their Game\" addressing the murder of civil rights worker Medgar Evers, and the Brechtian \"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\" the death of Black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll at the hands of young White socialite William Zantzinger.[75] \"Ballad of Hollis Brown\" and \"North Country Blues\" addressed despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities.[76] The final track on the album expressed Dylan's angry response to a hostile profile published in Newsweek.[77] As biographer Clinton Heylin puts it, the profile wrote about \"the way the Bar Mitzvah boy from Hibbing, Minnesota, had reinvented himself as the prince of protest\", emphasising his birth name Robert Zimmerman, his attendance at the University of Minnesota and his close relationship with his parents whom he claimed to be estranged from.[77][78] The day after the article appeared, Dylan returned to the studio to record \"Restless Farewell\" which ends with his vow to \"make my stand/ And remain as I am/ And bid farewell and not give a damn\".[79] By the end of 1963, Dylan felt manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements.[80] Accepting the \"Tom Paine Award\" from the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, an intoxicated Dylan questioned the role of the committee, characterized the members as old and balding, and claimed to see something of himself and of every man in Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.[81] Another Side of Bob Dylan, recorded in a single evening on June 9, 1964,[82] had a lighter mood. The humorous Dylan reemerged on \"I Shall Be Free No. 10\" and \"Motorpsycho Nightmare\". \"Spanish Harlem Incident\" and \"To Ramona\" are passionate love songs, while \"Black Crow Blues\" and \"I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)\" suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan's music. \"It Ain't Me Babe\", on the surface a song about spurned love, has been described as a rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him.[83] His new direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the impressionistic \"Chimes of Freedom\", which sets social commentary against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by Allen Ginsberg as \"chains of flashing images,\"[a 5] and \"My Back Pages\", which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions.[84] In the latter half of 1964 and into 1965, Dylan moved from folk songwriter to folk-rock pop-music star. His jeans and work shirts were replaced by a Carnaby Street wardrobe, sunglasses day or night, and pointed \"Beatle boots\". A London reporter noted \"Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square. He looks like an undernourished cockatoo.\"[85] Dylan began to spar with interviewers. Asked about a movie he planned while on Les Crane's television show, he told Crane it would be a \"cowboy horror movie.\" Asked if he played the cowboy, Dylan replied, \"No, I play my mother.\"[86] Dylan's late March 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home was another leap,[87] featuring his first recordings with electric instruments, under producer Tom Wilson's guidance.[88] The first single, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", owed much to Chuck Berry's \"Too Much Monkey Business\";[89] its free-association lyrics described as harking back to the energy of beat poetry and as a forerunner of rap and hip-hop.[90] The song was provided with an early music video, which opened D. A. Pennebaker's cinéma vérité presentation of Dylan's 1965 British tour, Dont Look Back.[91] Instead of miming, Dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words on the ground. Pennebaker said the sequence was Dylan's idea, and it has been imitated in music videos and advertisements.[92] The second side of Bringing It All Back Home contained four long songs on which Dylan accompanied himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica.[93] \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" became one of his best-known songs when The Byrds recorded an electric version that reached number one in the US and UK.[94][95] \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\" and \"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\" were two of Dylan's most important compositions.[93][96] In 1965, headlining the Newport Folk Festival, Dylan performed his first electric set since high school with a pickup group featuring Mike Bloomfield on guitar and Al Kooper on organ.[97] Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964, but in 1965 was met with cheering and booing and left the stage after three songs. One version has it that the boos were from folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by appearing, unexpectedly, with an electric guitar. Murray Lerner, who filmed the performance, said: \"I absolutely think that they were booing Dylan going electric.\"[98] An alternative account claims audience members were upset by poor sound and a short set.[99][100] Dylan's performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment.[101][102] In the September issue of Sing Out!, Ewan MacColl wrote: \"Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time ...'But what of Bobby Dylan?' scream the outraged teenagers ... Only a completely non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music, could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel\".[103] On July 29, four days after Newport, Dylan was back in the studio in New York, recording \"Positively 4th Street\". The lyrics contained images of vengeance and paranoia,[104] and have been interpreted as Dylan's put-down of former friends from the folk community he had known in clubs along West 4th Street.[105] In July 1965, Dylan's six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" peaked at number two in the US chart. In 2004 and in 2011, Rolling Stone listed it as number one on \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".[11][106] Bruce Springsteen recalled first hearing the song: \"that snare shot sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind.\"[107] The song opened Dylan's next album, Highway 61 Revisited, named after the road that led from Dylan's Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans.[108] The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, flavored by Mike Bloomfield's blues guitar and Al Kooper's organ riffs. \"Desolation Row\", backed by acoustic guitar and understated bass,[109] offers the sole exception, with Dylan alluding to figures in Western culture in a song described by Andy Gill as \"an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a Fellini-esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters\".[110] Poet Philip Larkin, who also reviewed jazz for The Daily Telegraph, wrote \"I'm afraid I poached Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited (CBS) out of curiosity and found myself well rewarded.\"[111] In support of the album, Dylan was booked for two US concerts with Al Kooper and Harvey Brooks from his studio crew and Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm, former members of Ronnie Hawkins's backing band the Hawks.[112] On August 28 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by Dylan's electric sound. The band's reception on September 3 at the Hollywood Bowl was more favorable.[113] From September 24, 1965, in Austin, Texas, Dylan toured the US and Canada for six months, backed by the five musicians from the Hawks who became known as The Band.[114] While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences, their studio efforts foundered. Producer Bob Johnston persuaded Dylan to record in Nashville in February 1966, and surrounded him with top-notch session men. At Dylan's insistence, Robertson and Kooper came from New York City to play on the sessions.[115] The Nashville sessions produced the double album Blonde on Blonde (1966), featuring what Dylan called \"that thin wild mercury sound\".[116] Kooper described it as \"taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion\": the musical worlds of Nashville and of the \"quintessential New York hipster\" Bob Dylan.[117] On November 22, 1965, Dylan quietly married 25-year-old former model Sara Lownds.[118] Some of Dylan's friends, including Ramblin' Jack Elliott, say that, immediately after the event, Dylan denied he was married.[118] Writer Nora Ephron made the news public in the New York Post in February 1966 with the headline \"Hush! Bob Dylan is wed\".[119] Dylan toured Australia and Europe in April and May 1966. Each show was split in two. Dylan performed solo during the first half, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica. In the second, backed by the Hawks, he played electrically amplified music. This contrast provoked many fans, who jeered and slow clapped.[120] The tour culminated in a raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in England on May 17, 1966.[121] A recording of this concert was released in 1998: The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966. At the climax of the evening, a member of the audience, angered by Dylan's electric backing, shouted: \"Judas!\" to which Dylan responded, \"I don't believe you ... You're a liar!\" Dylan turned to his band and said, \"Play it fucking loud!\"[122] During his 1966 tour, Dylan was described as exhausted and acting \"as if on a death trip\".[123] D. A. Pennebaker, the filmmaker accompanying the tour, described Dylan as \"taking a lot of amphetamine and who-knows-what-else\".[124] In a 1969 interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, \"I was on the road for almost five years. It wore me down. I was on drugs, a lot of things ... just to keep going, you know?\"[125] On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his motorcycle, a Triumph Tiger 100, near his home in Woodstock, New York. Dylan said he broke several vertebrae in his neck.[126] The circumstances of the accident are unclear since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized.[126][127] Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered him the chance to escape the pressures around him.[126][128] Dylan concurred: \"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\"[129] He made very few public appearances, and did not tour again for almost eight years.[127][130] Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit D. A. Pennebaker's film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to ABC Television, but they rejected it as incomprehensible to mainstream audiences.[131] The film, titled Eat the Document on bootleg copies, has since been screened at a few film festivals.[132] Secluded from public gaze, Dylan recorded over 100 songs during 1967 at his Woodstock home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, \"Big Pink\".[133] These songs were initially offered as demos for other artists to record and were hits for Julie Driscoll, the Byrds, and Manfred Mann. The public heard these recordings when Great White Wonder, the first \"bootleg recording\", appeared in West Coast shops in July 1969, containing Dylan material recorded in Minneapolis in 1961 and seven Basement Tapes songs. This record gave birth to a minor industry in the illicit release of recordings by Dylan and other major rock artists.[134] Columbia released a Basement selection in 1975 as The Basement Tapes. In late 1967, Dylan returned to studio recording in Nashville,[135] accompanied by Charlie McCoy on bass,[135] Kenny Buttrey on drums[135] and Pete Drake on steel guitar.[135] The result was John Wesley Harding, a record of short songs thematically drawing on the American West and the Bible. The sparse structure and instrumentation, with lyrics that took the Judeo-Christian tradition seriously, was a departure from Dylan's previous work.[136] It included \"All Along the Watchtower\", famously covered by Jimi Hendrix.[37][a 6] Woody Guthrie died in October 1967, and Dylan made his first live appearance in twenty months at a memorial concert held at Carnegie Hall on January 20, 1968, where he was backed by the Band.[137] Nashville Skyline (1969), featured Nashville musicians, a mellow-voiced Dylan, a duet with Johnny Cash and the single \"Lay Lady Lay\".[139] Variety wrote, \"Dylan is definitely doing something that can be called singing. Somehow he has managed to add an octave to his range.\"[140] During one recording session, Dylan and Cash recorded a series of duets, but only their version of \"Girl from the North Country\" appeared on the album.[141][142] The album influenced the nascent genre of country rock.[6] In 1969, Dylan was asked to write songs for Scratch, Archibald MacLeish's musical adaptation of \"The Devil and Daniel Webster\". MacLeish initially praised Dylan's contributions, writing to him \"Those songs of yours have been haunting me—and exciting me,\" but creative differences led to Dylan leaving the project. Some of the songs were later recorded by Dylan in a revised form.[143] In May 1969, Dylan appeared on the first episode of The Johnny Cash Show where he sang a duet with Cash on \"Girl from the North Country\" and played solos of \"Living the Blues\" and \"I Threw It All Away\". Dylan traveled to England to top the bill at the Isle of Wight Festival on August 31, 1969, after rejecting overtures to appear at the Woodstock Festival closer to home.[144] In the early 1970s, critics charged that Dylan's output was varied and unpredictable. Greil Marcus asked \"What is this shit?\" upon first hearing Self Portrait, released in June 1970.[145][146] It was a double LP including few original songs and was poorly received.[147] In October 1970, Dylan released New Morning, considered a return to form.[148] The title track was from Dylan's ill-fated collaboration with MacLeish,[143] and \"Day of the Locusts\" was his account of receiving an honorary degree from Princeton University on June 9, 1970.[149] In November 1968, Dylan co-wrote \"I'd Have You Anytime\" with George Harrison;[150] Harrison recorded that song and Dylan's \"If Not for You\" for his album All Things Must Pass. Olivia Newton-John covered \"If Not For You\" on her debut album and \"The Man in Me\" was prominently featured in the film The Big Lebowski (1998). Tarantula, a freeform book of prose-poetry, had been written by Dylan during a creative burst in 1964–65.[151] Dylan shelved his book for several years, apparently uncertain of its status,[152] until he suddenly informed Macmillan at the end of 1970 that the time had come to publish it.[153] The book attracted negative reviews but later critics have suggested its affinities with Finnegans Wake and A Season In Hell.[154] Between March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan recorded with Leon Russell at Blue Rock, a small studio in Greenwich Village. These sessions resulted in \"Watching the River Flow\" and a new recording of \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\".[155] On November 4, 1971, Dylan recorded \"George Jackson\", which he released a week later. For many, the single was a surprising return to protest material, mourning the killing of Black Panther George Jackson in San Quentin State Prison.[156] Dylan's surprise appearance at Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh on August 1, 1971, attracted media coverage as his live appearances had become rare.[157] In 1972, Dylan joined Sam Peckinpah's film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, providing the soundtrack and playing \"Alias\", a member of Billy's gang.[158] Despite the film's failure at the box office, \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" became one of Dylan's most covered songs.[159][160] That same year, Dylan protested the move to deport John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who had been convicted for marijuana possession, by sending a letter to the US Immigration Service which read in part: \"Hurray for John & Yoko. Let them stay and live here and breathe. The country's got plenty of room and space. Let John and Yoko stay!\"[161] Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new label, David Geffen's Asylum Records, when his contract with Columbia Records expired.[163] His next album, Planet Waves, was recorded in the fall of 1973, using the Band as his backing group as they rehearsed for a major tour.[164] The album included two versions of \"Forever Young\", which became one of his most popular songs.[165] As one critic described it, the song projected \"something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan\",[166] and Dylan said \"I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental\".[37] Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan, a collection of studio outtakes, widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label.[167] In January 1974, Dylan, backed by the Band, embarked on a North American tour of 40 concerts—his first tour for seven years. A live double album, Before the Flood, was released on Asylum Records. Soon, according to Clive Davis, Columbia Records sent word they \"will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold\".[168] Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, unhappy that Geffen had sold only 600,000 copies of Planet Waves despite millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour;[169] he returned to Columbia Records, which reissued his two Asylum albums.[170] After the tour, Dylan and his wife became estranged. He filled three small notebooks with songs about relationships and ruptures, and recorded the album Blood on the Tracks in September 1974.[171][172] Dylan delayed the album's release and re-recorded half the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother, David Zimmerman.[173] Released in early 1975, Blood on the Tracks received mixed reviews. In NME, Nick Kent described the \"accompaniments\" as \"often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes\".[174] In Rolling Stone, Jon Landau wrote that \"the record has been made with typical shoddiness\".[174] Over the years critics came to see it as one of Dylan's masterpieces. In Salon, journalist Bill Wyman wrote: Blood on the Tracks is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-1960s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years.[175] In the middle of 1975, Dylan championed boxer Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter, imprisoned for triple murder, with his ballad \"Hurricane\" making the case for Carter's innocence. Despite its length—over eight minutes—the song was released as a single, peaking at 33 on the US Billboard chart, and performed at every 1975 date of Dylan's next tour, the Rolling Thunder Revue.[a 7][176] Running through late 1975 and again through early 1976, the tour featured about one hundred performers and supporters from the Greenwich Village folk scene, among them Ramblin' Jack Elliott, T-Bone Burnett, Joni Mitchell,[177][178] David Mansfield, Roger McGuinn, Mick Ronson, Ronee Blakely, Joan Baez and Scarlet Rivera, whom Dylan discovered walking down the street, her violin case on her back.[179] The tour encompassed the January 1976 release of the album Desire. Many of Desire's songs featuring a travelogue-like narrative style, influenced by Dylan's new collaborator, playwright Jacques Levy.[180][181] The 1976 half of the tour was documented by a TV concert special, Hard Rain, and the LP Hard Rain. The 1975 tour with the Revue provided the backdrop to Dylan's film Renaldo and Clara, a sprawling narrative mixed with concert footage and reminiscences. Actor and playwright Sam Shepard accompanied the Revue and was to serve as screenwriter, but much of the film was improvised. Released in 1978, it received negative, sometimes scathing, reviews.[182][183] Later in the year, a two-hour edit, dominated by the concert performances, was more widely released.[184] In November 1976, Dylan appeared at the Band's farewell concert with Eric Clapton, Muddy Waters, Van Morrison, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell. Martin Scorsese's 1978 film of the concert, The Last Waltz, included most of Dylan's set.[185] In 1978, Dylan embarked on a year-long world tour, performing 114 shows in Japan, the Far East, Europe and North America, to a total audience of two million. Dylan assembled an eight-piece band and three backing singers. Concerts in Tokyo in February and March were released as the live double album Bob Dylan at Budokan.[186] Reviews were mixed. Robert Christgau awarded the album a C+ rating,[187] while Janet Maslin defended it: \"These latest live versions of his old songs have the effect of liberating Bob Dylan from the originals\".[188] When Dylan brought the tour to the US in September 1978, the press described the look and sound as a \"Las Vegas Tour\".[189] The 1978 tour grossed more than $20 million, and Dylan told the Los Angeles Times that he had debts because \"I had a couple of bad years. I put a lot of money into the movie, built a big house ... and it costs a lot to get divorced in California.\"[186] In April and May 1978, Dylan took the same band and vocalists into Rundown Studios in Santa Monica, California, to record an album of new material, Street-Legal.[190] It was described by Michael Gray as \"after Blood On The Tracks, arguably Dylan's best record of the 1970s: a crucial album documenting a crucial period in Dylan's own life\".[191] However, it had poor sound and mixing (attributed to Dylan's studio practices), muddying the instrumental detail until a remastered CD release in 1999 restored some of the songs' strengths.[192][193] In the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Evangelical Christianity,[194][195] undertaking a three-month discipleship course run by the Association of Vineyard Churches.[196][197] He released three albums of contemporary gospel music. Slow Train Coming (1979) featured Dire Straits guitarist Mark Knopfler and was produced by veteran R&B producer Jerry Wexler. Wexler said that Dylan had tried to evangelize him during the recording. He replied: \"Bob, you're dealing with a 62-year-old Jewish atheist. Let's just make an album.\"[198] Dylan won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for the song \"Gotta Serve Somebody\". When touring in late 1979 and early 1980, Dylan would not play his older, secular works, and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage, such as: Years ago they ... said I was a prophet. I used to say, \"No I'm not a prophet\", they say \"Yes you are, you're a prophet.\" I said, \"No it's not me.\" They used to say \"You sure are a prophet.\" They used to convince me I was a prophet. Now I come out and say Jesus Christ is the answer. They say, \"Bob Dylan's no prophet.\" They just can't handle it.[199] Dylan's Christianity was unpopular with some fans and musicians.[200] John Lennon, shortly before being murdered, recorded \"Serve Yourself\" in response to \"Gotta Serve Somebody\".[201] In 1981, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times that \"neither age (he's now 40) nor his much-publicized conversion to born-again Christianity has altered his essentially iconoclastic temperament\".[202] In late 1980, Dylan briefly played concerts billed as \"A Musical Retrospective\", restoring popular 1960s songs to the repertoire. His second Christian album, Saved (1980), received mixed reviews, described by Michael Gray as \"the nearest thing to a follow-up album Dylan has ever made, Slow Train Coming II and inferior\".[203] His third Christian album was Shot of Love (1981).[204] The album featured his first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with Christian songs. The lyrics of \"Every Grain of Sand\" recall William Blake's \"Auguries of Innocence\".[205] Elvis Costello wrote that \"Shot of Love may not be your favorite Bob Dylan record, but it might contain his best song: 'Every Grain of Sand'.\"[206] Reception of Dylan's 1980s recordings varied. Gray criticized Dylan's 1980s albums for carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs.[207] Infidels (1983) employed Knopfler again as lead guitarist and also as producer; the sessions resulted in several songs that Dylan left off the album. Best regarded of these were \"Blind Willie McTell\", which was both a tribute to the eponymous blues musician and an evocation of African American history,[208] \"Foot of Pride\" and \"Lord Protect My Child\". These three songs were later released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991.[209] Between July 1984 and March 1985, Dylan recorded Empire Burlesque.[210] Arthur Baker, who had remixed hits for Bruce Springsteen and Cyndi Lauper, was asked to engineer and mix the album. Baker said he felt he was hired to make Dylan's album sound \"a little bit more contemporary\".[210] In 1985 Dylan sang on USA for Africa's famine relief single \"We Are the World\". He also joined Artists United Against Apartheid, providing vocals for their single \"Sun City\".[211] On July 13, 1985, he appeared at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia. Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, he performed a ragged version of \"Ballad of Hollis Brown\", a tale of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience: \"I hope that some of the money ... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe ... one or two million, maybe ... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks\".[212] His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but inspired Willie Nelson to organize a concert, Farm Aid, to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.[213] In October 1985, Dylan released Biograph, a box set featuring 53 tracks, 18 of them previously unreleased. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: \"Historically, Biograph is significant not for what it did for Dylan's career, but for establishing the box set, complete with hits and rarities, as a viable part of rock history.\"[214] Biograph also contained liner notes by Cameron Crowe in which Dylan discussed the origins of some of his songs.[215] In April 1986, Dylan made a foray into rap when he added vocals to the opening verse of \"Street Rock\" on Kurtis Blow's album Kingdom Blow.[216] Dylan's next studio album, Knocked Out Loaded (1986), contained three covers (by Junior Parker, Kris Kristofferson and the gospel hymn \"Precious Memories\"), plus three collaborations (with Tom Petty, Sam Shepard and Carole Bayer Sager), and two solo compositions by Dylan. A reviewer wrote that \"the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling, and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends. By 1986, such uneven records weren't entirely unexpected by Dylan, but that didn't make them any less frustrating.\"[217] It was the first Dylan album since his 1962 debut to fail to make the Top 50.[218] Some critics have called the song Dylan co-wrote with Shepard, \"Brownsville Girl\", a masterpiece.[219] In 1986 and 1987, Dylan toured with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night. Dylan also toured with the Grateful Dead in 1987, resulting in the live album Dylan & The Dead, which received negative reviews; Erlewine said it was \"quite possibly the worst album by either Bob Dylan or the Grateful Dead\".[220] Dylan initiated what came to be called the Never Ending Tour on June 7, 1988, performing with a back-up band featuring guitarist G. E. Smith. Dylan would continue to tour with a small, changing band for the next 30 years.[221] In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation (Rupert Everett).[222] Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\"Night After Night\", and \"Had a Dream About You, Baby\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \"The Usual\". The film was a critical and commercial flop.[223] Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988. Bruce Springsteen, in his introduction, declared, \"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual\".[107] Down in the Groove (1988) sold even more poorly than Knocked Out Loaded.[224] Gray wrote: \"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\"[225] The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys, a supergroup Dylan co-founded with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty. In late 1988, their Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached number three on the US albums chart,[224] featuring songs described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years.[226] Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990, Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.[227] Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy, produced by Daniel Lanois. Gray praised the album as \"Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s.\"[225] \"Most of the Time\", a lost-love composition, was prominently featured in the film High Fidelity (2000), while \"What Was It You Wanted\" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.[228] The religious imagery of \"Ring Them Bells\" struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.[229] Dylan's 1990s began with Under the Red Sky (1990), an about-face from the serious Oh Mercy. It contained several apparently simple songs, including \"Under the Red Sky\" and \"Wiggle Wiggle\". The album was dedicated to \"Gabby Goo Goo\", a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and Carolyn Dennis, Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, who was four.[230] Musicians on the album included George Harrison, Slash, David Crosby, Bruce Hornsby, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Elton John. The record received negative reviews and sold poorly.[231] In 1990 and 1991 Dylan was described by his biographers as drinking heavily, impairing his performances on stage.[232][233] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Dylan dismissed allegations that drinking was interfering with his music: \"That's completely inaccurate. I can drink or not drink. I don't know why people would associate drinking with anything I do, really\".[234] Defilement and remorse were themes Dylan addressed when he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from Jack Nicholson in February 1991.[235] The event coincided with the start of the Gulf War and Dylan played \"Masters of War\"; Rolling Stone called his performance \"almost unintelligible\".[236] He made a short speech: \"My daddy once said to me, he said, 'Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in your ability to mend your own ways'\".[235][237] This was a paraphrase of 19th-century Orthodox Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch's commentary on Psalm 27.[238] On October 16, 1992, the thirtieth anniversary of Dylan's debut album was celebrated with a concert at Madison Square Garden, christened \"Bobfest\" by Neil Young and featuring John Mellencamp, Stevie Wonder, Lou Reed, Eddie Vedder, Dylan and others. It was recorded as the live album The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration.[236] Over the next few years Dylan returned to his roots with two albums covering traditional folk and blues songs: Good as I Been to You (1992) and World Gone Wrong (1993), backed solely by his acoustic guitar.[239] Many critics and fans noted the quiet beauty of the song \"Lone Pilgrim\",[240] written by a 19th-century teacher. In August 1994, he played at Woodstock '94; Rolling Stone called his performance \"triumphant\".[236] In November, Dylan recorded two live shows for MTV Unplugged. He said his wish to perform traditional songs was overruled by Sony executives who insisted on hits.[241] The resulting album, MTV Unplugged, included \"John Brown\", an unreleased 1962 song about how enthusiasm for war ends in mutilation and disillusionment.[242] With a collection of songs reportedly written while snowed in on his Minnesota ranch,[243] Dylan booked recording time with Daniel Lanois at Miami's Criteria Studios in January 1997. The subsequent recording sessions were, by some accounts, fraught with musical tension.[244] Before the album's release Dylan was hospitalized with life-threatening pericarditis, brought on by histoplasmosis. His scheduled European tour was canceled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, \"I really thought I'd be seeing Elvis soon\".[245] He was back on the road by mid-year, and performed before Pope John Paul II at the World Eucharistic Conference in Bologna, Italy. The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 to a homily based on Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\".[246] In September, Dylan released the new Lanois-produced album, Time Out of Mind. With its bitter assessments of love and morbid ruminations, Dylan's first collection of original songs in seven years was highly acclaimed. Alex Ross called it \"a thrilling return to form.\"[247] \"Cold Irons Bound\" won Dylan another Grammy For Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, and the album won him his first Grammy Award for Album of the Year.[248] The album's first single, \"Not Dark Yet\", has been called one of Dylan's best songs[249] and \"Make You Feel My Love\" was covered by Billy Joel, Garth Brooks, Adele and others. Elvis Costello said \"I think it might be the best record he's made.\"[250] In 2001, Dylan won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Things Have Changed\", written for the film Wonder Boys.[252] \"Love and Theft\" was released on September 11, 2001. Recorded with his touring band, Dylan produced the album under the alias Jack Frost.[253] Critics noted that Dylan was widening his musical palette to include rockabilly, Western swing, jazz and lounge music.[254] The album won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album.[255] Controversy ensued when The Wall Street Journal pointed out similarities between the album's lyrics and Junichi Saga's book Confessions of a Yakuza. Saga was not familiar with Dylan's work, but said he was flattered. Upon hearing the album, Saga said of Dylan: \"His lines flow from one image to the next and don't always make sense. But they have a great atmosphere.\"[256][257] In 2003, Dylan revisited the evangelical songs from his Christian period and participated in the project Gotta Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan. That year, Dylan released Masked & Anonymous, which he co-wrote with director Larry Charles under the alias Sergei Petrov.[258] Dylan starred as Jack Fate, alongside a cast that included Jeff Bridges, Penélope Cruz and John Goodman. The film polarized critics.[259] In The New York Times, A. O. Scott called it as an \"incoherent mess\";[260] a few treated it as a serious work of art.[261][262] In 2004, Dylan published the first part of his memoir, Chronicles: Volume One. Confounding expectations,[263] Dylan devoted three chapters to his first year in New York City in 1961–1962, virtually ignoring the mid-1960s when his fame was at its height, while devoting chapters to the albums New Morning (1970) and Oh Mercy (1989). The book reached number two on The New York Times' Hardcover Non-Fiction bestseller list in December 2004 and was nominated for a National Book Award.[264] Critics noted that Chronicles contained many examples of pastiche and borrowing; sources included Time magazine[265] and the novels of Jack London.[266] Biographer Clinton Heylin queried the veracity of Dylan's autobiography, noting \"Not a single checkable story held water; not one anecdote couldn't be shot full of holes by any half-decent researcher.\"[267] Martin Scorsese's Dylan documentary No Direction Home was broadcast on September 26–27, 2005, on BBC Two in the UK and as part of American Masters on PBS in the US.[268] It covers the period from Dylan's arrival in New York in 1961 to his motorcycle crash in 1966, featuring interviews with Suze Rotolo, Liam Clancy, Joan Baez, Allen Ginsberg, Pete Seeger, Mavis Staples and Dylan himself. The film earned a Peabody Award[269] and a Columbia-duPont Award.[270] The accompanying soundtrack featured unreleased songs from Dylan's early years.[271] Dylan's career as a radio presenter began on May 3, 2006, with his weekly program, Theme Time Radio Hour, on XM Satellite Radio. He played songs with a common theme, such as \"Weather\", \"Weddings\", \"Dance\" and \"Dreams\".[272][273] Dylan's records ranged from Muddy Waters to Prince, L.L. Cool J to the Streets. Dylan's show was praised for the breadth of his musical selections[274] and for his jokes, stories and eclectic references.[275][276] In April 2009, Dylan broadcast the 100th show in his radio series; the theme was \"Goodbye\" and he signed off with Woody Guthrie's \"So Long, It's Been Good to Know Yuh\".[277] Dylan released Modern Times in August 2006. Despite some coarsening of Dylan's voice (a critic for The Guardian characterized his singing on the album as \"a catarrhal death rattle\"[278]) most reviewers praised the album, and many described it as the final installment of a successful trilogy, encompassing Time Out of Mind and \"Love and Theft\".[279] Modern Times entered the US charts at number one, making it Dylan's first album to reach that position since 1976's Desire.[280] The New York Times published an article exploring similarities between some of Dylan's lyrics in Modern Times and the work of the Civil War poet Henry Timrod.[281] Modern Times won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album and Dylan won Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for \"Someday Baby\".[282] Modern Times was named Album of the Year by Rolling Stone[283] and Uncut.[284] On the same day that Modern Times was released, the iTunes Music Store released Bob Dylan: The Collection, a digital box set containing all of his albums (773 tracks), along with 42 rare and unreleased tracks.[285] On October 1, 2007, Columbia Records released the triple CD retrospective Dylan, anthologizing his entire career under the Dylan 07 logo.[286] The sophistication of the Dylan 07 marketing campaign was a reminder that Dylan's commercial profile had risen considerably since the 1990s. This became evident in 2004, when Dylan appeared in a TV advertisement for Victoria's Secret.[287] In October 2007, he participated in a multi-media campaign for the 2008 Cadillac Escalade.[288][289] In 2009 he gave the highest profile endorsement of his career to date, appearing with rapper will.i.am in a Pepsi ad that debuted during Super Bowl XLIII. The ad opened with Dylan singing the first verse of \"Forever Young\" followed by will.i.am doing a hip hop version of the song's third and final verse.[290] The Bootleg Series Vol. 8 – Tell Tale Signs was released in October 2008, as both a two-CD set and a three-CD version with a 150-page hardcover book. The set contains live performances and outtakes from selected studio albums from Oh Mercy to Modern Times, as well as soundtrack contributions and collaborations with David Bromberg and Ralph Stanley.[291] The pricing of the album—the two-CD set went on sale for $18.99 and the three-CD version for $129.99—led to complaints about \"rip-off packaging\".[292][293] The release was widely acclaimed by critics.[294] The abundance of alternative takes and unreleased material suggested to one reviewer that this volume of old outtakes \"feels like a new Bob Dylan record, not only for the astonishing freshness of the material, but also for the incredible sound quality and organic feeling of everything here\".[295] Dylan released Together Through Life on April 28, 2009. In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, Dylan explained it originated when French director Olivier Dahan asked him to supply a song for his movie My Own Love Song. He initially intended to record a single track, \"Life Is Hard\", but \"the record sort of took its own direction\".[296] Nine of the album's ten songs are credited as co-written by Dylan and Robert Hunter.[297] The album received largely favorable reviews,[298] although several critics described it as a minor addition to Dylan's canon.[299] In its first week of release, the album reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart in the US, making Dylan, at 67 years of age, the oldest artist to ever debut at number one on that chart.[300] Dylan's Christmas in the Heart was released in October 2009, comprising such Christmas standards as \"Little Drummer Boy\", \"Winter Wonderland\" and \"Here Comes Santa Claus\".[301] Edna Gundersen wrote that Dylan was \"revisiting yuletide styles popularized by Nat King Cole, Mel Tormé, and the Ray Conniff Singers\".[302] Dylan's royalties from the album were donated to the charities Feeding America in the US, Crisis in the UK, and the World Food Programme.[303] The album received generally favorable reviews.[304] In an interview published in The Big Issue, Flanagan asked Dylan why he had performed the songs in a straightforward style, and he replied: \"There wasn't any other way to play it. These songs are part of my life, just like folk songs. You have to play them straight too.\"[305] Volume 9 of Dylan's Bootleg Series, The Witmark Demos, was issued in October 18, 2010. It comprised 47 demo recordings of songs taped between 1962 and 1964 for Dylan's earliest music publishers: Leeds Music in 1962, and Witmark Music from 1962 to 1964. One reviewer described the set as \"a hearty glimpse of young Bob Dylan changing the music business, and the world, one note at a time.\"[306] On the critical aggregator Metacritic, the album has a score of 86, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[307] In the same week, Sony Legacy released Bob Dylan: The Original Mono Recordings, a box set that presented Dylan's eight earliest albums, from Bob Dylan (1962) to John Wesley Harding (1967), in their original mono mix in the CD format for the first time. The set was accompanied by a booklet featuring an essay by Greil Marcus.[308][309] On April 12, 2011, Legacy Recordings released Bob Dylan in Concert – Brandeis University 1963, taped at Brandeis University on May 10, 1963, two weeks before the release of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. The tape was discovered in the archive of music writer Ralph J. Gleason, and the recording carries liner notes by Michael Gray, who says it captures Dylan \"from way back when Kennedy was President and the Beatles hadn't yet reached America. It reveals him not at any Big Moment but giving a performance like his folk club sets of the period ... This is the last live performance we have of Bob Dylan before he becomes a star.\"[310] On Dylan's 70th birthday, three universities organized symposia on his work: the University of Mainz,[311] the University of Vienna,[312] and the University of Bristol[313] invited literary critics and cultural historians to give papers on aspects of Dylan's work. Other events, including tribute bands, discussions and simple singalongs, took place around the world, as reported in The Guardian: \"From Moscow to Madrid, Norway to Northampton and Malaysia to his home state of Minnesota, self-confessed 'Bobcats' will gather today to celebrate the 70th birthday of a giant of popular music.\"[314] Dylan's 35th studio album, Tempest, was released on September 11, 2012.[315] The album features a tribute to John Lennon, \"Roll On John\", and the title track is a 14-minute song about the sinking of the Titanic.[316] In Rolling Stone, Will Hermes gave Tempest five out of five stars, writing: \"Lyrically, Dylan is at the top of his game, joking around, dropping wordplay and allegories that evade pat readings and quoting other folks' words like a freestyle rapper on fire\".[317] Volume 10 of Dylan's Bootleg Series, Another Self Portrait (1969–1971), was released in August 2013.[318] The album contained 35 previously unreleased tracks, including alternative takes and demos from Dylan's 1969–1971 recording sessions during the making of the Self Portrait and New Morning albums. The box set also included a live recording of Dylan's performance with the Band at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1969. Thom Jurek wrote, \"For fans, this is more than a curiosity, it's an indispensable addition to the catalog.\"[319] Columbia Records released a boxed set containing all 35 Dylan studio albums, six albums of live recordings and a collection of non-album material (Sidetracks) as Bob Dylan: Complete Album Collection: Vol. One, in November 2013.[320][321] To publicize the box set, an innovative video of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" was released on Dylan's website. The interactive video, created by director Vania Heymann, allowed viewers to switch between 16 simulated TV channels, all featuring characters who are lip-synching the lyrics.[322][323] Dylan appeared in a commercial for the Chrysler 200 car which aired during the 2014 Super Bowl. In it, he says that \"Detroit made cars and cars made America... So let Germany brew your beer, let Switzerland make your watch, let Asia assemble your phone. We will build your car.\" Dylan's ad was criticized for its protectionist implications, and people wondered whether he had \"sold out\".[324][325] The Lyrics: Since 1962 was published by Simon & Schuster in the fall of 2014. The book was edited by literary critic Christopher Ricks, Julie Nemrow and Lisa Nemrow and offered variant versions of Dylan's songs, sourced from out-takes and live performances. A limited edition of 50 books, signed by Dylan, was priced at $5,000. \"It's the biggest, most expensive book we've ever published, as far as I know\", said Jonathan Karp, Simon & Schuster's president and publisher.[326][327] A comprehensive edition of the Basement Tapes, songs recorded by Dylan and the Band in 1967, was released as The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete in November 2014. The album included 138 tracks in a six-CD box; the 1975 album The Basement Tapes contained just 24 tracks from the material which Dylan and the Band had recorded at their homes in Woodstock, New York in 1967. Subsequently, over 100 recordings and alternate takes had circulated on bootleg records. The sleeve notes are by author Sid Griffin.[328][329] The Basement Tapes Complete won the Grammy Award for Best Historical Album.[330] The box set earned a score of 99 on Metacritic.[331] In February 2015, Dylan released Shadows in the Night, featuring ten songs written between 1923 and 1963,[332][333] which have been described as part of the Great American Songbook.[334] All of the songs had been recorded by Frank Sinatra, but both critics and Dylan himself cautioned against seeing the record as a collection of \"Sinatra covers\".[332][335] Dylan explained: \"I don't see myself as covering these songs in any way. They've been covered enough. Buried, as a matter a fact. What me and my band are basically doing is uncovering them. Lifting them out of the grave and bringing them into the light of day\".[336] Critics praised the restrained instrumental backings and the quality of Dylan's singing.[334][337] The album debuted at number one in the UK Albums Chart in its first week of release.[338] The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965–1966, consisting of previously unreleased material from the three albums Dylan recorded between January 1965 and March 1966 (Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde) was released in November 2015. The set was released in three formats: a 2-CD \"Best Of\" version, a 6-CD \"Deluxe edition\", and an 18-CD limited \"Collector's Edition\". On Dylan's website the \"Collector's Edition\" was described as containing \"every single note recorded by Bob Dylan in the studio in 1965/1966\".[339][340] The Best of the Cutting Edge entered the Billboard Top Rock Albums chart at number one on November 18, based on its first-week sales.[341] Dylan released Fallen Angels, described as \"a direct continuation of the work of 'uncovering' the Great Songbook that he began on Shadows In the Night\", in May.[342] The album contained twelve songs by classic songwriters such as Harold Arlen, Sammy Cahn and Johnny Mercer, eleven of which had been recorded by Sinatra.[342] Jim Farber wrote in Entertainment Weekly: \"Tellingly, [Dylan] delivers these songs of love lost and cherished not with a burning passion but with the wistfulness of experience. They're memory songs now, intoned with a present sense of commitment. Released just four days ahead of his 75th birthday, they couldn't be more age-appropriate\".[343] The 1966 Live Recordings, including every known recording of Dylan's 1966 concert tour, was released in November 2016.[344] The recordings commence with the concert in White Plains New York on February 5, 1966, and end with the Royal Albert Hall concert in London on May 27.[345][346] The New York Times reported most of the concerts had \"never been heard in any form\", and described the set as \"a monumental addition to the corpus\".[347] In March 2017, Dylan released a triple album of 30 more recordings of classic American songs, Triplicate. Dylan's 38th studio album was recorded in Hollywood's Capitol Studios and features his touring band.[348] Dylan posted a long interview on his website to promote the album, and was asked if this material was an exercise in nostalgia. Nostalgic? No I wouldn't say that. It's not taking a trip down memory lane or longing and yearning for the good old days or fond memories of what's no more. A song like 'Sentimental Journey' is not a way back when song, it doesn't emulate the past, it's attainable and down to earth, it's in the here and now.[349] Critics praised the thoroughness of Dylan's exploration of the Great American Songbook, though, in the opinion of Uncut, \"For all its easy charms, Triplicate labours its point to the brink of overkill. After five albums' worth of croon toons, this feels like a fat full stop on a fascinating chapter.\"[350] The next volume of Dylan's Bootleg Series revisited his \"Born Again\" Christian period of 1979 to 1981, described by Rolling Stone as \"an intense, wildly controversial time that produced three albums and some of the most confrontational concerts of his long career\".[351] Reviewing the box set The Bootleg Series Vol. 13: Trouble No More 1979–1981, comprising 8 CDs and 1 DVD,[351] Jon Pareles wrote in The New York Times: Decades later, what comes through these recordings above all is Mr. Dylan's unmistakable fervor, his sense of mission. The studio albums are subdued, even tentative, compared with what the songs became on the road. Mr. Dylan's voice is clear, cutting and ever improvisational; working the crowds, he was emphatic, committed, sometimes teasingly combative. And the band tears into the music.[352] Trouble No More includes a DVD of a film directed by Jennifer Lebeau consisting of live footage of Dylan's gospel performances interspersed with sermons delivered by actor Michael Shannon. In April 2018, Dylan made a contribution to the compilation EP Universal Love, a collection of reimagined wedding songs for the LGBT community.[353] The album was funded by MGM Resorts International and the songs are intended to function as \"wedding anthems for same-sex couples\".[354] Dylan recorded the 1929 song \"She's Funny That Way\", changing the gender pronoun to \"He's Funny That Way\". The song was previously recorded by Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra.[354][355] That same month, The New York Times reported that Dylan was launching Heaven's Door, a range of three whiskeys. The Times described the venture as \"Mr. Dylan's entry into the booming celebrity-branded spirits market, the latest career twist for an artist who has spent five decades confounding expectations\".[356] Dylan has been involved in both the creation and the marketing of the range; on September 21, 2020, Dylan resurrected Theme Time Radio Hour with a two-hour special with the theme of \"Whiskey\".[357] On November 2, 2018, Dylan released More Blood, More Tracks as Volume 14 in the Bootleg Series. The set comprises all Dylan's recordings for Blood On the Tracks and was issued as a single CD and also as a six-CD Deluxe Edition.[358] In 2019, Netflix released Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese, billed as \"Part documentary, part concert film, part fever dream\".[359][360] The film received largely positive reviews but also aroused controversy because it mixed documentary footage filmed during the Rolling Thunder Revue in the fall of 1975 with fictitious characters and stories.[361][362] Coinciding with the film release, the box set The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings, was released by Columbia Records. The set comprises five full Dylan performances from the tour and recently discovered tapes from Dylan's tour rehearsals.[363] The box set received an aggregate score of 89 on Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[364] The next installment of Dylan's Bootleg Series, Bob Dylan (featuring Johnny Cash) – Travelin' Thru, 1967 – 1969: The Bootleg Series Vol. 15, was released on November 1. The set comprises outtakes from Dylan's albums John Wesley Harding and Nashville Skyline, and songs that Dylan recorded with Johnny Cash in Nashville in 1969 and with Earl Scruggs in 1970.[365][366] On March 26, 2020, Dylan released \"Murder Most Foul\", a seventeen-minute song revolving around the Kennedy assassination, on his YouTube channel.[367] Billboard reported on April 8 that \"Murder Most Foul\" had topped the Billboard Rock Digital Song Sales Chart, the first time that Dylan had scored a number one song on a pop chart under his own name.[368] Three weeks later, on April 17, 2020, Dylan released another new song, \"I Contain Multitudes\".[369][370] The title is from Walt Whitman's poem \"Song of Myself\".[371] On May 7, Dylan released a third single, \"False Prophet\", accompanied by the news that the three songs would all appear on a forthcoming double album. Rough and Rowdy Ways, Dylan's 39th studio album and his first album of original material since 2012, was released on June 19 to favorable reviews.[372] Alexis Petridis wrote: \"For all its bleakness, Rough and Rowdy Ways might well be Bob Dylan's most consistently brilliant set of songs in years: the die-hards can spend months unravelling the knottier lyrics, but you don't need a PhD in Dylanology to appreciate its singular quality and power.\"[373] Rob Sheffield wrote: \"While the world keeps trying to celebrate him as an institution, pin him down, cast him in the Nobel Prize canon, embalm his past, this drifter always keeps on making his next escape. On Rough and Rowdy Ways, Dylan is exploring terrain nobody else has reached before—yet he just keeps pushing on into the future\".[374] The album earned a score of 95 on Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[372] In its first week of release Rough and Rowdy Ways reached number one on the UK album chart, making Dylan \"the oldest artist to score a No. 1 of new, original material\".[375] In December 2020, it was announced that Dylan had sold his entire song catalog to Universal Music Publishing Group,[376] including both the income he receives as a songwriter and his control of their copyright. Universal, a division of the French media conglomerate Vivendi, will collect all future income from the songs.[377] The New York Times stated Universal had purchased the copyright to over 600 songs and the price was \"estimated at more than $300 million\",[377] although other reports suggested the figure was closer to $400 million.[378] In February 2021, Columbia Records released 1970, a three-CD set of recordings from the Self Portrait and New Morning sessions, including the entirety of the session Dylan recorded with George Harrison on May 1, 1970.[379][380] Dylan's 80th birthday was commemorated by a virtual conference, Dylan@80, organized by the University of Tulsa Institute for Bob Dylan Studies. The program featured seventeen sessions over three days delivered by over fifty international scholars, journalists and musicians.[381] Several new biographies and studies of Dylan were published.[382][383] In July 2021, livestream platform Veeps presented a 50-minute performance by Dylan, Shadow Kingdom: The Early Songs of Bob Dylan.[384] Filmed in black and white with a film noir look,[385] Dylan performed 13 songs in a club setting with an audience.[384][386] The performance was favorably reviewed,[386][385] and one critic suggested the backing band resembled the style of the musical Girl from the North Country.[387] The soundtrack to the film was released on 2 LP and CD formats in June 2023.[388] In September, Dylan released Springtime in New York: The Bootleg Series Vol. 16 (1980–1985), issued in 2 LP, 2 CD and 5 CD formats. It comprised rehearsals, live recordings, out-takes and alternative takes from Shot of Love, Infidels and Empire Burlesque.[389] In The Daily Telegraph, Neil McCormick wrote: \"These bootleg sessions remind us that Dylan's worst period is still more interesting than most artists' purple patches\".[390] Springtime in New York received an aggregate score of 85 on Metacritic.[391] On July 7, 2022, Christie's, London, auctioned a 2021 recording of Dylan singing \"Blowin' in the Wind\". The record was in an innovative \"one of one\" recording medium, branded as Ionic Original, which producer T Bone Burnett claimed \"surpasses the sonic excellence and depth for which analogue sound is renowned, while at the same time boasting the durability of a digital recording.\"[392][393] The recording fetched GBP £1,482,000—equivalent to $1,769,508.[394][395] In November, Dylan published The Philosophy of Modern Song, a collection of 66 essays on songs by other artists. The New Yorker described it as \"a rich, riffy, funny, and completely engaging book of essays\".[396] Other reviewers praised the book's eclectic outlook,[397] while some questioned its variations in style and dearth of female songwriters.[398] In January 2023, Dylan released The Bootleg Series Vol. 17: Fragments – Time Out of Mind Sessions (1996–1997) in multiple formats. The 5-CD version comprised a re-mix of the 1997 album \"to sound more like how the songs came across when the musicians originally played them in the room\" without the effects and processing which producer Daniel Lanois applied later; 25 previously unreleased out-takes from the studio sessions; and a disc of live performances of each song on the album performed by Dylan and his band in concert.[399] On November 17, 2023, Dylan released The Complete Budokan 1978, containing the full recordings of the February 28 and March 1 Tokyo concerts from his 1978 Tour.[400] Dylan contributed a cover version of Cole Porter's song \"Don't Fence Me In\" to the soundtrack of the biographical film Reagan, which was released on August 30, 2024.[401] On September 20, 2024, Dylan released The 1974 Live Recordings, a 27-disc CD boxset of recordings from the 1974 Bob Dylan & The Band tour, featuring 417 previously unreleased live tracks.[402] The Never Ending Tour commenced on June 7, 1988.[403] Dylan has played roughly 100 dates a year since, a heavier schedule than most performers who started in the 1960s.[404] By April 2019, Dylan and his band had played more than 3,000 shows,[405] anchored by long-time bassist Tony Garnier.[406] To the dismay of some of his audience,[407] Dylan's performances are unpredictable as he often alters his arrangements and changes his vocal approach.[408] These variable performances have divided critics. Richard Williams and Andy Gill argued that Dylan has found a successful way to present his rich legacy of material.[409][410] Others have criticized his live performances for changing \"the greatest lyrics ever written so that they are effectively unrecognisable\", and giving so little to the audience that \"it is difficult to understand what he is doing on stage at all\".[411] In September 2021, Dylan's touring company announced a series of tours which were billed as the \"Rough and Rowdy Ways World Wide Tour, 2021–2024\". The Rough and Rowdy Ways World Tour replaced Dylan's varied set lists with a more stable repertory, performing nine of the ten songs on his 2020 album.[412] Nevertheless, the tour has been referred to by the media as an extension of his ongoing Never Ending Tour.[413] In the fall of 2024 Dylan embarked on a European tour, beginning in Prague, Czech Republic, on October 4 and ending in London on November 14.[414][415] Alex Ross has summarised Dylan's touring career: \"his shows cause his songs to mutate, so that no definitive or ideal version exists. Dylan's legacy will be the sum of thousands of performances, over many decades... Every night, whether he's in good or bad form, he says, in effect, 'Think again.'\"[247] Echo Helstrom was Dylan's high school girlfriend. The couple listened together to rhythm-and-blues on the radio, and her family exposed him to singers such as Jimmie Rodgers on 78 RPM records, and a plethora of folk music magazines, sheet music, and manuscripts.[416] Helstrom is believed by some to be the inspiration for Dylan's song \"Girl from the North Country\", though this is disputed.[417] Dylan's first serious relationship was with artist Suze Rotolo, a daughter of Communist Party USA radicals. According to Dylan, \"She was the most erotic thing I'd ever seen ... The air was suddenly filled with banana leaves. We started talking and my head started to spin\".[418] Rotolo was photographed arm-in-arm with Dylan on the cover of his album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. Critics have connected Rotolo to some of Dylan's early love songs, including \"Don't Think Twice It's All Right\". The relationship ended in 1964.[419] In 2008, Rotolo published a memoir about her life in Greenwich Village and relationship with Dylan in the 1960s, A Freewheelin' Time.[420] When Joan Baez met Dylan in April 1961, she had already released her first album and was acclaimed as the \"Queen of Folk\".[421] On hearing Dylan perform his song \"With God on Our Side\", Baez later said, \"I never thought anything so powerful could come out of that little toad\".[422] In July 1963, Baez invited Dylan to join her on stage at the Newport Folk Festival, setting the scene for similar duets over the next two years.[423] By the time of Dylan's 1965 tour of the UK, their romantic relationship had begun to fizzle out, as captured in D. A. Pennebaker's documentary film Dont Look Back.[423] Baez later toured with Dylan as a performer on his Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975–76. Baez also starred as \"The Woman In White\" in the film Renaldo and Clara (1978), directed by Dylan.[424] Dylan and Baez toured together again in 1984 with Carlos Santana.[423] Baez recalled her relationship with Dylan in Martin Scorsese's documentary film No Direction Home (2005). Baez wrote about Dylan in two autobiographies—admiringly in Daybreak (1968), and less admiringly in And A Voice to Sing With (1987). Her song \"Diamonds & Rust\" has been described as \"an acute portrait\" of Dylan.[423] Dylan married Sara Lownds, who had worked as a model and secretary at Drew Associates, on November 22, 1965.[425] They had four children: Jesse Byron Dylan (born January 6, 1966), Anna Lea (born July 11, 1967), Samuel Isaac Abram (born July 30, 1968), and Jakob Luke (born December 9, 1969). Dylan also adopted Sara's daughter from a prior marriage, Maria Lownds (later Dylan, born October 21, 1961). Sara Dylan played the role of Clara in Dylan's film Renaldo and Clara (1978). Bob and Sara Dylan were divorced on June 29, 1977.[425] Dylan and his backing singer Carolyn Dennis (often professionally known as Carol Dennis) have a daughter, Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, born on January 31, 1986.[426] The couple were married on June 4, 1986, and divorced in October 1992. Their marriage and child remained a closely guarded secret until the publication of Howard Sounes's biography Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan, in 2001.[427] When not touring, Dylan is believed to live primarily in Point Dume, a promontory on the coast of Malibu, California, though he owns property around the world.[428][429] Growing up in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small, close-knit Jewish community, and Dylan had his Bar Mitzvah in May 1954.[430][23] Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited Israel, and also met Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the New York-based Jewish Defense League.[431] In the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Christianity. In November 1978, guided by his friend Mary Alice Artes, Dylan made contact with the Vineyard School of Discipleship.[195] Vineyard Pastor Kenn Gulliksen recalled: \"Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying yes, he did in fact want Christ in his life. And he prayed that day and received the Lord\".[432][433] From January to March 1979, Dylan attended Vineyard's Bible study classes in Reseda, California.[195][434] By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the \"born again\" label. He told Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone: \"I've never said I'm 'born again'. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an agnostic. I've always thought there's a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there's a world to come.\"[435] In 1997, he told David Gates of Newsweek: Here's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else. Songs like \"Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain\" or \"I Saw the Light\"—that's my religion. I don't adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I've learned more from the songs than I've learned from any of this kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs.[436] Dylan has supported the Chabad Lubavitch movement,[437] and has privately participated in Jewish religious events, including his sons' Bar Mitzvahs and services at Hadar Hatorah, a Chabad Lubavitch yeshiva. In 1989 and 1991, he appeared on the Chabad telethon.[438] Dylan has continued to perform songs from his gospel albums in concert, occasionally covering traditional religious songs. He has made passing references to his religious faith, such as in a 2004 interview with 60 Minutes, when he told Ed Bradley, \"the only person you have to think twice about lying to is either yourself or to God\". He explained his constant touring schedule as part of a bargain he made a long time ago with the \"chief commander—in this earth and in the world we can't see\".[40] Speaking to Jeff Slate of The Wall Street Journal in December 2022, Dylan reaffirmed his religious outlook: \"I read the scriptures a lot, meditate and pray, light candles in church. I believe in damnation and salvation as well as predestination. The Five Books of Moses, Pauline Epistles, Invocation of the Saints, all of it.\"[439][440] Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 1997, US President Bill Clinton presented Dylan with a Kennedy Center Honor in the East Room of the White House, saying: \"He probably had more impact on people of my generation than any other creative artist. His voice and lyrics haven't always been easy on the ear, but throughout his career Bob Dylan has never aimed to please. He's disturbed the peace and discomforted the powerful\".[441] In May 2000, Dylan received the Polar Music Prize from Sweden's King Carl XVI.[442] In June 2007, Dylan received the Prince of Asturias Award in the Arts category; the jury called him \"a living myth in the history of popular music and a light for a generation that dreamed of changing the world.\"[6][443] In 2008, the Pulitzer Prize jury awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power\".[444] Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in May 2012.[445][446] President Barack Obama, presenting Dylan with the award, said \"There is not a bigger giant in the history of American music.\" Obama praised Dylan's voice for its \"unique gravelly power that redefined not just what music sounded like but the message it carried and how it made people feel\".[447] In November 2013, Dylan was awarded France's highest honor, the Légion d'Honneur,[448] despite the misgiving of the grand chancellor of the Légion, who had declared him unworthy.[448] In February 2015, Dylan accepted the MusiCares Person of the Year award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, in recognition of his philanthropic and artistic contributions.[449] In 1996, Gordon Ball of the Virginia Military Institute nominated Dylan for the Nobel Prize in Literature,[450][451] initiating a campaign that lasted for 20 years.[452] On October 13, 2016, the Nobel committee announced that it would be awarding Dylan the prize \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\".[453] The New York Times reported: \"Mr. Dylan, 75, is the first musician to win the award, and his selection on Thursday is perhaps the most radical choice in a history stretching back to 1901.\"[453] Dylan remained silent for days after receiving the award,[454] and then told journalist Edna Gundersen that it was \"amazing, incredible. Whoever dreams about something like that?\"[455] Dylan's Nobel Lecture was posted on the Nobel Prize website on June 5, 2017.[456] Horace Engdahl, a member of the Nobel Committee, described Dylan's place in literary history: a singer worthy of a place beside the Greek bards, beside Ovid, beside the Romantic visionaries, beside the kings and queens of the blues, beside the forgotten masters of brilliant standards.[457] Dylan has been described as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, musically and culturally. He was included in the Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century, where he was called \"master poet, caustic social critic and intrepid, guiding spirit of the counterculture generation\".[458] Paul Simon suggested that Dylan's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre: \"[Dylan's] early songs were very rich ... with strong melodies. 'Blowin' in the Wind' has a really strong melody. He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while. He defined the genre for a while.\"[459] For many critics, Dylan's greatest achievement was the cultural synthesis exemplified by his mid-1960s trilogy of albums—Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde. In Mike Marqusee's words: Between late 1964 and the middle of 1966, Dylan created a body of work that remains unique. Drawing on folk, blues, country, R&B, rock'n'roll, gospel, British beat, symbolist, modernist and Beat poetry, surrealism and Dada, advertising jargon and social commentary, Fellini and Mad magazine, he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision. The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console.[460] Dylan's lyrics began to receive critical study as early as 1998, when Stanford University sponsored the first international academic conference on Bob Dylan held in the United States.[461] In 2004, Richard F. Thomas, Classics professor at Harvard University, created a freshman seminar titled \"Dylan\", which aimed \"to put the artist in context of not just popular culture of the last half-century, but the tradition of classical poets like Virgil and Homer.\"[462] Thomas went on to publish Why Bob Dylan Matters, exploring Dylan's connections with Greco-Roman literature.[463] Literary critic Christopher Ricks published Dylan's Visions of Sin, an appreciation of Dylan's work.[464] Following Dylan's Nobel win, Ricks reflected: \"I'd not have written a book about Dylan, to stand alongside my books on Milton and Keats, Tennyson and T.S. Eliot, if I didn't think Dylan a genius of and with language.\"[465] The critical consensus that Dylan's songwriting was his outstanding creative achievement was articulated by Encyclopædia Britannica: \"Hailed as the Shakespeare of his generation, Dylan ... set the standard for lyric writing.\"[6] Former British poet laureate Andrew Motion said Dylan's lyrics should be studied in schools.[466] His lyrics have entered the vernacular; Edna Gundersen notes that Lines that branded Dylan a poet and counterculture valedictorian in the '60s are imprinted on the culture: \"When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose\"; \"a hard rain's a-gonna fall\"; \"to live outside the law you must be honest.\" Some lyrics — \"you don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows\" and \"the times they are a-changin' \" — appear in Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.[467] Rolling Stone ranked Dylan first on its 2015 list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time,[468] fifteenth on its 2023 list of the Greatest Singers of All Time,[469] and placed \"Like A Rolling Stone\" first on their list of greatest songs in 2004 and 2011.[11] He was listed second on the magazine's list of the hundred greatest artists.[470] The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll writes that \"His lyrics—the first in rock to be seriously regarded as literature—became so well known that politicians from Jimmy Carter to Václav Havel have cited them as an influence.\"[236] Dylan's voice also received critical attention. Robert Shelton described his early vocal style as \"a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie's old performances, etched in gravel like Dave Van Ronk's\".[471] His voice continued to develop as he began to work with rock'n'roll backing bands; Michael Gray described the sound of Dylan's vocal work on \"Like a Rolling Stone\" as \"at once young and jeeringly cynical\".[472] As Dylan's voice aged during the 1980s, for some critics, it became more expressive. Christophe Lebold writes in the journal Oral Tradition: Dylan's more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs—this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken, fallen world. The anatomy of a broken world in \"Everything is Broken\" (on the album Oh Mercy) is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is grounded in a concrete sonic reality.[473] Among musicians who have acknowledged his influence are John Lennon,[474] Paul McCartney,[475] Jerry Garcia,[476] Pete Townshend,[477] Syd Barrett,[478] Joni Mitchell,[479] Neil Young,[480] Bruce Springsteen,[107] David Bowie,[481][467] Bryan Ferry,[482] Patti Smith,[483] Joe Strummer,[484] Bono,[485][467] Nick Cave,[486] Leonard Cohen,[487] Tom Waits,[488] Ole Paus[489] and Chuck D.[490][467] Dylan significantly contributed to the initial success of both the Byrds and the Band: the Byrds achieved chart success with their version of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and the subsequent album, while the Band were Dylan's backing band on his 1966 tour, recorded The Basement Tapes with him in 1967[491] and featured three previously unreleased Dylan songs on their debut album.[492] Johnny Cash, introducing \"Wanted Man\", said \"I don't have to tell you who Bob Dylan is—the greatest writer of our time.\"[493] Some critics have dissented from the view of Dylan as a visionary figure in popular music. In his book Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom, Nik Cohn objected: \"I can't take the vision of Dylan as seer, as teenage messiah, as everything else he's been worshipped as. The way I see him, he's a minor talent with a major gift for self-hype\".[494] Australian critic Jack Marx credited Dylan with changing the persona of the rock star: \"What cannot be disputed is that Dylan invented the arrogant, faux-cerebral posturing that has been the dominant style in rock since, with everyone from Mick Jagger to Eminem educating themselves from the Dylan handbook\".[495] Fellow musicians have also expressed critical views. Joni Mitchell described Dylan as a \"plagiarist\" and his voice as \"fake\" in a 2010 interview in the Los Angeles Times.[496][497][498] Mitchell's comments led to discussions on Dylan's use of other people's material, both supporting and criticizing him.[499] Talking to Mikal Gilmore in Rolling Stone in 2012, Dylan responded to the allegation of plagiarism, including his use of Henry Timrod's verse in his album Modern Times,[281] by saying that it was \"part of the tradition\".[500][a 8] Dylan's music has inspired artists in other fields. Dave Gibbons recalls how he and Alan Moore were inspired by the lines of \"Desolation Row\" beginning \"At midnight, all the agents/ And the superhuman crew...\": It was a glimpse, a mere fragment of something; something ominous, paranoid and threatening. But something that showed that comics, like poetry or rock and roll or Bob Dylan himself, might feasibly become part of the greater cultural continuum. The lines must have also lodged in Alan's consciousness for, nearly twenty years later, Dylan's words eventually provided the title of the first issue of our comic book series Watchmen. Gibbons says of their seminal comic, \"It began with Bob Dylan.\"[501] In 2007, Todd Haynes released I'm Not There, \"inspired by the music and many lives of Bob Dylan\".[502] The movie used six actors, Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Marcus Carl Franklin, Richard Gere, Heath Ledger and Ben Whishaw, to explore different facets of Dylan's life.[502][503] Dylan's previously unreleased 1967 song from which the film takes its name[504] was included on the original soundtrack along with covers of Dylan songs by such diverse artists as Sonic Youth, Calexico and Yo La Tengo. Irish playwright Conor McPherson wrote and directed the musical Girl from the North Country, which used Dylan's songs to tell the stories of various characters during the Depression years, set in Dylan's birthplace, Duluth, Minnesota. The play premiered in London in 2017.[505][506] Dylan's rise to stardom, from his arrival in New York in 1961 to his controversial performance at Newport in 1965, is portrayed by actor Timothée Chalamet in the feature film A Complete Unknown, scheduled to open in the U.S. on December 25, 2024.[507] If Dylan's work in the 1960s was seen as bringing intellectual ambition to popular music,[460] critics in the 21st century described him as a figure who had greatly expanded the folk culture from which he initially emerged. In his review of I'm Not There, J. Hoberman wrote: Elvis might never have been born, but someone else would surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic accounts for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then—having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning—vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.[508] The sale of Dylan's archive of about 6,000 items of memorabilia to the George Kaiser Family Foundation and the University of Tulsa was announced on March 2, 2016. It was reported the sale price was \"an estimated $15 million to $20 million\". The archive comprises notebooks, drafts of Dylan lyrics, recordings, and correspondence.[509][510] To house the archive, the Bob Dylan Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma opened on May 10, 2022.[511][512] In 2005, 7th Avenue East in Hibbing, Minnesota, the street on which Dylan lived from ages 6 to 18, received the honorary name Bob Dylan Drive.[513][514] In 2006, a cultural pathway, Bob Dylan Way, was inaugurated in Duluth, Minnesota, where Dylan was born. The 1.8-mile path links \"cultural and historically significant areas of downtown for the tourists\".[515] In 2015, a 160-foot-wide Dylan mural by Brazilian street artist Eduardo Kobra was unveiled in downtown Minneapolis.[516] In December 2013, the Fender Stratocaster which Dylan had played at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival fetched $965,000, the second highest price paid for a guitar.[517] In June 2014, Dylan's hand-written lyrics of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" fetched $2 million at auction, a record for a popular music manuscript.[518][519] Dylan's visual art was first seen by the public via a painting he contributed for the cover of The Band's Music from Big Pink album in 1968.[520] The cover of Dylan's own 1970 album Self Portrait features the painting of a human face by Dylan.[521] More of Dylan's artwork was revealed with the 1973 publication of his book Writings and Drawings.[522] The cover of Dylan's 1974 album Planet Waves again featured one of his paintings. In 1994 Random House published Drawn Blank, a book of Dylan's drawings.[523] In 2007, the first public exhibition of Dylan's paintings, The Drawn Blank Series, opened at the Kunstsammlungen in Chemnitz, Germany;[524] it showcased more than 200 watercolors and gouaches made from the original drawings. The exhibition coincided with the publication of Bob Dylan: The Drawn Blank Series, which includes 170 reproductions from the series.[524][525] From September 2010 until April 2011, the National Gallery of Denmark exhibited 40 large-scale acrylic paintings by Dylan, The Brazil Series.[526] In July 2011, a leading contemporary art gallery, Gagosian Gallery, announced their representation of Dylan's paintings.[527] An exhibition of Dylan's art, The Asia Series, opened at the Gagosian Madison Avenue Gallery on September 20, displaying Dylan's paintings of scenes in China and the Far East.[528] The New York Times reported that \"some fans and Dylanologists have raised questions about whether some of these paintings are based on the singer's own experiences and observations, or on photographs that are widely available and were not taken by Mr. Dylan\". The Times pointed to close resemblances between Dylan's paintings and historic photos of Japan and China, and photos taken by Dmitri Kessel and Henri Cartier-Bresson.[529] Art critic Blake Gopnik has defended Dylan's artistic practice, arguing: \"Ever since the birth of photography, painters have used it as the basis for their works: Edgar Degas and Édouard Vuillard and other favorite artists—even Edvard Munch—all took or used photos as sources for their art, sometimes barely altering them\".[530] The Magnum photo agency confirmed that Dylan had licensed the reproduction rights of these photographs.[531] Dylan's second show at the Gagosian Gallery, Revisionist Art, opened in November 2012. The show consisted of thirty paintings, transforming and satirizing popular magazines, including Playboy and Babytalk.[532][533] In February 2013, Dylan exhibited the New Orleans Series of paintings at the Palazzo Reale in Milan.[534] In August 2013, Britain's National Portrait Gallery in London hosted Dylan's first major UK exhibition, Face Value, featuring twelve pastel portraits.[535] In November 2013, the Halcyon Gallery in London mounted Mood Swings, an exhibition in which Dylan displayed seven wrought iron gates he had made. In a statement released by the gallery, Dylan said, I've been around iron all my life ever since I was a kid. I was born and raised in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference.[536][537] In November 2016, the Halcyon Gallery featured a collection of drawings, watercolors and acrylic works by Dylan. The exhibition, The Beaten Path, depicted American landscapes and urban scenes, inspired by Dylan's travels across the US.[538] The show was reviewed by Vanity Fair and Asia Times Online.[539][540][541] In October 2018, the Halcyon Gallery mounted an exhibition of Dylan's drawings, Mondo Scripto. The works consisted of Dylan hand-written lyrics of his songs, with each song illustrated by a drawing.[542] Retrospectrum, the largest retrospective of Dylan's visual art to date, consisting of over 250 works in a variety of media, debuted at the Modern Art Museum in Shanghai in 2019.[543] Building on the exhibition in China, a version of Retrospectrum, which includes a new series of paintings, \"Deep Focus\", drawn from film imagery,[544] opened at the Frost Art Museum in Miami on November 30, 2021.[545] Since 1994, Dylan has published nine books of paintings and drawings.[546] In November 2022, Dylan apologized for using an autopen to sign books and artwork which were subsequently sold as \"hand-signed\" since 2019.[547][548] In 2024 an abstract painting by Dylan from the late 1960s sold at auction for approximately $200,000. The painting was originally given to a relative of the seller in exchange for an astrology chart.[549] Dylan has published Tarantula, a work of prose poetry; Chronicles: Volume One, the first part of his memoirs; several books of the lyrics of his songs, and nine books of his art. Dylan's third full length book, The Philosophy of Modern Song, which contains 66 essays on songs by other artists, was published on November 1, 2022. Dylan has also been the subject of numerous biographies and critical studies.",

                "content": "Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman; May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter and musician. He is one of the most famous and successful popular singers of the last 50 years. He was born in 1941 in Minnesota. His parents were from the Russian Empire in what is now Ukraine.[1] As a youth he was a big fan of rock and roll, and formed several bands in high school. However, Dylan first became famous as a folk musician. In 1962, he released his first album, simply called Bob Dylan. The next year, he released the folk song \"Blowin' in the Wind\", which became very popular. In 1965, he began playing rock and roll. That year, Dylan released \"Like a Rolling Stone\", which has been called the greatest popular music song of all time. He put these two types of music together in a new way, which became very popular. The next year, Dylan was in a motorcycle crash which broke his neck. His recovery took many months, and he released no new music or records during this time. Dylan re-examined his life while he recovered, saw what other musicians were doing, and made changes to his own style. His comeback album, John Wesley Harding, was different from his earlier work. While he made many tours to perform during the mid-1960s, he made very few public appearances until the mid-1970s. Dylan later became a Christian, then drifted away from Christianity, even re-exploring Judaism, which his family followed.[2] Now, he does not talk about his religion. Since the 1980s, he has concentrated on his music career. Also, Dylan is one of the famous people who appear on the cover of The Beatles's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. In 2016, Dylan received the Nobel Prize in Literature, \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\".[3] In 1960, Dylan dropped out of college and moved to New York, where his idol, the legendary folk singer Woody Guthrie, was hospitalized with a rare hereditary disease of the nervous system. Dylan visited with Guthrie regularly in his hospital room. He also became a regular in the folk clubs and coffeehouses of Greenwich Village. He met many other musicians, and he began writing songs at an astonishing pace, including \"Song to Woody,\" honoring Woody Guthrie. In the fall of 1961, after one of his performances received a rave review in The New York Times, Dylan signed a recording contract with Columbia Records. Released early in 1962, \"Bob Dylan\" contained only two original songs, but showcased Dylan's gravelly-voiced singing style in a number of traditional folk and blues songs. The 1963 release of \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\" marked Dylan's emergence as one of the most original voices in the history of American popular music. The album included two of the most memorable 1960s folk songs, \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (which later became a huge hit for the folk trio Peter, Paul, and Mary) and \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall.\" His next album, \"The Times They Are A-Changin'\", firmly established Dylan as the definitive songwriter of the 60s protest movement. This reputation only increased after he became involved with one of the movement's established icons, Joan Baez, in 1963. While his romantic relationship with Baez lasted only two years, it benefited both performers immensely in terms of their music careers. Dylan wrote some of Baez's best-known material, and Baez introduced him to thousands of fans through her concerts. By 1964, Dylan was playing 200 concerts per year, but had become tired of his role as \"the\" folk singer-songwriter of the protest movement. \"Another Side of Bob Dylan,\" recorded in 1964, was a much more personal, introspective collection of songs, far less politically charged than Dylan's previous efforts. In 1965, Dylan scandalized many of his folk music fans by recording the half-acoustic, half-electric album \"Bringing It All Back Home,\" backed by a nine-piece band. On July 25, 1965, he was famously booed at the Newport Folk Festival when he performed electrically for the first time. The albums that followed, \"Highway 61 Revisited\" (1965)—which included the seminal rock song \"Like a Rolling Stone\"—and the two-record set \"Blonde on Blonde\" (1966) represented Dylan at his most innovative. With his unmistakable voice and unforgettable lyrics, Dylan brought the worlds of music and literature together as no one else had. Over the course of the next three decades, Dylan continued to reinvent himself. Following a near-fatal motorcycle accident in July 1966, Dylan spent almost a year recovering in seclusion. His next two albums, \"John Wesley Harding\" (1968) – including \"All Along the Watchtower,\" later recorded by guitar great Jimi Hendrix—and the unabashedly countryish \"Nashville Skyline\" (1969) – were far more mellow than his earlier works. Critics blasted the two-record set \"Self-Portrait\" (1970). \"Tarantula,\" a long-awaited collection of writings Dylan published in 1971, also met with a poor reception. In 1973, Dylan appeared in Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, a feature film directed by Sam Peckinpah. He also wrote the film's soundtrack, which became a hit and included the now-classic song \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door.\" In 1974, Dylan began his first full-scale tour since his accident, embarking on a sold-out nationwide tour with his longtime backup band, The Band. An album he recorded with the Band, \"Planet Waves,\" became his first No. 1 album ever. He followed these successes with the celebrated 1975 album \"Blood on the Tracks\" and \"Desire\" (1976), each of which hit No. 1 as well. \"Desire\" included the song \"Hurricane,\" written by Dylan about the boxer Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter, then serving life in prison after what many felt was an wrongful conviction of triple homicide in 1967. Dylan was one of many prominent public figures who helped popularize Carter's cause, leading to a retrial in 1976, when he was again convicted. After a painful split with his wife, Sara Lowndes—the song \"Sara\" on \"Desire\" was Dylan's plaintive but unsuccessful attempt to win Lowndes back—Dylan again reinvented himself, declaring in 1979 that he was a born-again Christian. The evangelical \"Slow Train Coming\" was a commercial hit, and won Dylan his first Grammy Award. The tour and albums that followed were less successful, however, and Dylan's religious leanings soon became less overt in his music. Beginning in the 1980s, Dylan began touring full-time, sometimes with fellow legends Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and the Grateful Dead. Notable albums during this period included Infidels (1983); the five-disc retrospective Biograph (1985); Knocked Out Loaded (1986); and Oh Mercy (1989), which became his best-received album in years. He recorded two albums with the all-star band the Traveling Wilburys, also featuring George Harrison, the late Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne. In 1994, Dylan returned to his folk roots, winning the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album for \"World Gone Wrong.\" In 1989, when Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Bruce Springsteen spoke at the ceremony, declaring that \"Bob freed the mind the way Elvis freed the body ... He invented a new way a pop singer could sound, broke through the limitations of what a recording artist could achieve, and changed the face of rock and roll forever.\" In 1997, Dylan became the first rock star ever to receive Kennedy Center Honors, considered the nation's highest award for artistic excellence. Dylan's 1997 album \"Time Out of Mind\" re-established this one-time folk icon as one of the preeminent of rock's wise men, winning three Grammy Awards. He continued his vigorous touring schedule, including a memorable performance in 1997 for Pope John Paul II in which he played \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\" and a 1999 tour with Paul Simon. In 2000, he recorded the single \"Things Have Changed\" for the soundtrack of the film Wonder Boys, starring Michael Douglas. The song won Dylan a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for Best Original Song. As of December 2016, Dylan had recorded 35 studio albums. On August 13, 2021, a woman known as \"JC\" filed a lawsuit accusing Dylan of sexual assault.

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Bob Dylan (born May 24, 1941, Duluth, Minnesota, U.S.) is an American folksinger and songwriter who moved from folk to rock music in the 1960s, infusing the lyrics of rock and roll, theretofore concerned mostly with boy-girl romantic innuendo, with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry. Hailed as the Shakespeare of his generation, Dylan sold tens of millions of albums, wrote more than 500 songs recorded by more than 2,000 artists, performed all over the world, and set the standard for lyric writing. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016. (See Editor’s Note: About the author.) He grew up in the northeastern Minnesota mining town of Hibbing, where his father co-owned Zimmerman Furniture and Appliance Co. Taken with the music of Hank Williams, Little Richard, Elvis Presley, and Johnny Ray, he acquired his first guitar in 1955 at age 14 and later, as a high school student, played in a series of rock and roll bands. In 1959, just before enrolling at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, he served a brief stint playing piano for rising pop star Bobby Vee. While attending college, he discovered the bohemian section of Minneapolis known as Dinkytown. Fascinated by Beat poetry and folksinger Woody Guthrie, he began performing folk music in coffeehouses, adopting the last name Dylan (after the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas). Restless and determined to meet Guthrie—who was confined to a hospital in New Jersey—he relocated to the East Coast. Arriving in late January 1961, Dylan was greeted by a typically merciless New York City winter. A survivor at heart, he relied on the generosity of various benefactors who, charmed by his performances at Gerde’s Folk City in Greenwich Village, provided meals and shelter. He quickly built a cult following and within four months was hired to play harmonica for a Harry Belafonte recording session. Responding to Robert Shelton’s laudatory New York Times review of one of Dylan’s live shows in September 1961, talent scout–producer John Hammond investigated and signed him to Columbia Records. There Dylan’s unkempt appearance and roots-oriented song material earned him the whispered nickname “Hammond’s Folly.” Dylan’s eponymous first album was released in March 1962 to mixed reviews. His singing voice—a cowboy lament laced with Midwestern patois, with an obvious nod to Guthrie—confounded many critics. It was a sound that took some getting used to. By comparison, Dylan’s second album, The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan (released in May 1963), sounded a clarion call. Young ears everywhere quickly assimilated his quirky voice, which divided parents and children and established him as part of the burgeoning counterculture, “a rebel with a cause.” Moreover, his first major composition, “Blowin’ in the Wind,” served notice that this was no cookie-cutter recording artist. About this time, Dylan signed a seven-year management contract with Albert Grossman, who soon replaced Hammond with another Columbia producer, Tom Wilson. In April 1963 Dylan played his first major New York City concert, at Town Hall. In May, when he was forbidden to perform “Talkin’ John Birch Paranoid Blues” on Ed Sullivan’s popular television program, he literally walked out on a golden opportunity. That summer, championed by folk music’s doyenne, Joan Baez, Dylan made his first appearance at the Newport Folk Festival and was virtually crowned the king of folk music. The prophetic title song of his next album, The Times They Are A-Changin’ (1964), provided an instant anthem. Millions jumped on the bandwagon when the mainstream folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary reached number two on the Billboard pop singles chart in mid-1963 with their version of “Blowin’ in the Wind.” Dylan was perceived as a singer of protest songs, a politically charged artist with a whole other agenda. (Unlike Elvis Presley, there would be no film of Dylan singing “Rock-a-Hula Baby” surrounded by bikini-clad women.) Dylan spawned imitators at coffeehouses and record labels everywhere. At the 1964 Newport Folk Festival, while previewing songs from Another Side of Bob Dylan, he confounded his core audience by performing songs of a personal nature rather than his signature protest repertoire. Although his new lyrics were as challenging as his earlier compositions, a backlash from purist folk fans began and continued for three years as Dylan defied convention at every turn. On his next album, Bringing It All Back Home (1965), electric instruments were openly brandished—a violation of folk dogma—and only two protest songs were included. The folk rock group the Byrds covered “Mr. Tambourine Man” from that album, adding electric 12-string guitar and three-part harmony vocals, and took it to number one on the singles chart. Other rock artists were soon pilfering the Dylan songbook and joining the juggernaut. As Dylan’s mainstream audience increased rapidly, his purist folk fans fell off in droves. The maelstrom that engulfed Dylan is captured in Don’t Look Back (1967), the telling documentary of his 1965 tour of Britain, directed by D.A. Pennebaker. In June 1965, consorting with “hardened” rock musicians and in kinship with the Byrds, Dylan recorded his most ascendant song yet, “Like a Rolling Stone.” Devoid of obvious protest references, set against a rough-hewn, twangy rock underpinning, and fronted by a snarling vocal that lashed out at all those who questioned his legitimacy, “Like a Rolling Stone” spoke to yet a new set of listeners and reached number two on the Billboard chart. It was the final link in the chain. The world fell at Dylan’s feet. And the album containing the hit single, Highway 61 Revisited (1965), further vindicated his abdication of the protest throne. At the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, Dylan bravely showcased his electric sound, backed primarily by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After an inappropriately short 15-minute set, Dylan left the stage to a hail of booing—mostly a response to the headliner’s unexpectedly abbreviated performance rather than to his electrification. He returned for a two-song acoustic encore. Nonetheless, reams were written about his electric betrayal and banishment from the folk circle. (Read Britannica’s essay “When Dylan ‘Went Electric.’ ”) By the time of his next public appearance, at the Forest Hills (New York) Tennis Stadium a month later, the audience had been “instructed” by the press how to react. After a well-received acoustic opening set, Dylan was joined by his new backing band (Al Kooper on keyboards, Harvey Brooks on bass, and, from the Hawks, Canadian guitarist Robbie Robertson and drummer Levon Helm). Dylan and the band were booed throughout the performance; incongruously, the audience sang along with “Like a Rolling Stone,” the number two song in the United States that week, and then booed at its conclusion. Backed by Robertson, Helm, and the rest of the Hawks (Rick Danko on bass, Richard Manuel on piano, and Garth Hudson on organ and saxophone), Dylan toured incessantly in 1965 and 1966, always playing to sold-out, agitated audiences. On November 22, 1965, Dylan married Sara Lowndes. They split their time between a townhouse in Greenwich Village and a country estate in Woodstock, New York. In February 1966, at the suggestion of his new producer, Bob Johnston, Dylan recorded at Columbia’s Nashville, Tennessee, studios, along with Kooper, Robertson, and the cream of Nashville’s play-for-pay musicians. A week’s worth of marathon 20-hour sessions produced a double album that was more polished than the raw, almost punklike Highway 61 Revisited. Containing some of Dylan’s finest work, Blonde on Blonde peaked at number nine in Billboard, was critically acclaimed, and pushed Dylan to the zenith of his popularity. He toured Europe with the Hawks (soon to reemerge as the Band) until the summer of 1966, when a motorcycle accident in Woodstock brought his amazing seven-year momentum to an abrupt halt. Citing a serious neck injury, he retreated to his home in Woodstock and virtually disappeared for two years. During his recuperation, Dylan edited film footage from his 1966 European tour that was to be shown on television but instead surfaced years later as the seldom-screened film Eat the Document. In 1998 some of the audio recordings from the film, including portions of Dylan’s performance at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester, England, were released as the album Live 1966. In 1967 the Band moved to Woodstock to be closer to Dylan. Occasionally they coaxed him into the basement studio of their communal home to play music together, and recordings from these sessions ultimately became the double album The Basement Tapes (1975). In early 1968 Columbia released a stripped-down album of new Dylan songs titled John Wesley Harding. At least partly because of public curiosity about Dylan’s seclusion, it reached number two on the Billboard album chart (eight places higher than Bob Dylan’s Greatest Hits, released in 1967). In January 1968 Dylan made his first postaccident appearance at a memorial concert for Woody Guthrie in New York City. His image had changed; with shorter hair, spectacles, and a neglected beard, he resembled a rabbinical student. At this point Dylan adopted the stance he held for the rest of his career: sidestepping the desires of the critics, he went in any direction but those called for in print. When his audience and critics were convinced that his muse had left him, Dylan would deliver an album at full strength, only to withdraw again. Dylan returned to Tennessee to record Nashville Skyline (1969), which helped launch an entirely new genre, country rock. It charted at number three, but, owing to the comparative simplicity of its lyrics, people questioned whether Dylan remained a cutting-edge artist. Meanwhile, rock’s first bootleg album, The Great White Wonder—containing unreleased, “liberated” Dylan recordings—appeared in independent record stores. Its distribution methods were shrouded in secrecy (certainly Columbia, whose contract with Dylan the album violated, was not involved). Over the next quarter century Dylan continued to record, toured sporadically, and was widely honored, though his impact was never as great or as immediate as it had been in the 1960s. In 1970 Princeton (New Jersey) University awarded him an honorary doctorate of music. His first book, Tarantula, a collection of unconnected writings, met with critical indifference when it was unceremoniously published in 1971, five years after its completion. In August 1971 Dylan made a rare appearance at a benefit concert that former Beatle George Harrison had organized for the newly independent nation of Bangladesh. At the end of the year, Dylan purchased a house in Malibu, California; he had already left Woodstock for New York City in 1969. In 1973 he appeared in director Sam Peckinpah’s film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid and contributed to the sound track, including “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door.” Writings and Drawings, an anthology of his lyrics and poetry, was published the next year. In 1974 he toured for the first time in eight years, reconvening with the Band (by this time popular artists in their own right). Before the Flood, the album documenting that tour, reached number three. Released in January 1975, Dylan’s next studio album, Blood on the Tracks, was a return to lyrical form. It topped the Billboard album chart, as did Desire, released one year later. In 1975 and 1976 Dylan barnstormed North America with a gypsylike touring company, announcing shows in radio interviews only hours before appearing. Filmed and recorded, the Rolling Thunder Revue—including Joan Baez, Allen Ginsberg, Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, and Roger McGuinn—came to motion-picture screens in 1978 as part of the four-hour-long, Dylan-edited Renaldo and Clara. Lowndes and Dylan divorced in 1977. They had four children, including son Jakob, whose band the Wallflowers experienced pop success in the 1990s. Dylan was also stepfather to a child from Lowndes’s previous marriage. In 1978 Dylan mounted a yearlong world tour and released a studio album, Street-Legal, and a live album, Bob Dylan at Budokan. In a dramatic turnabout, he converted to Christianity in 1979 and for three years recorded and performed only religious material, preaching between songs at live shows. Critics and listeners were, once again, confounded. Nonetheless, Dylan received a Grammy Award in 1980 for best male rock vocal performance with his “gospel” song “Gotta Serve Somebody.” By 1982, when Dylan was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, his open zeal for Christianity was waning. In 1985 he participated in the all-star charity recording “We Are the World,” organized by Quincy Jones, and published his third book, Lyrics: 1962–1985. Dylan toured again in 1986–87, backed by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and in 1987 he costarred in the film Hearts of Fire. A year later he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Traveling Wilburys (Dylan, Petty, Harrison, Jeff Lynne, and Roy Orbison) formed at his house in Malibu and released their first album. In 1989 Dylan once again returned to form with Oh Mercy, produced by Daniel Lanois. When Life magazine published a list of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century in 1990, Dylan was included, and in 1991 he received a lifetime achievement award from the Recording Academy. In 1992 Columbia Records celebrated the 30th anniversary of Dylan’s signing with a star-studded concert in New York City. Later this event was released as a double album and video. As part of Bill Clinton’s inauguration as U.S. president in 1993, Dylan sang “Chimes of Freedom” in front of the Lincoln Memorial. As the 1990s drew to a close, Dylan, who was called the greatest poet of the second half of the 20th century by Allen Ginsberg, performed for the pope at the Vatican, was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature, received a Kennedy Center Honor, and was made Commander in the Order of Arts and Letters (the highest cultural award presented by the French government). In 1998, in a comeback of sorts, he won three Grammy Awards—including album of the year—for Time Out of Mind (1997). In 2000 he was honored with a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for best original song for “Things Have Changed,” from the film Wonder Boys. Another Grammy (for best contemporary folk album) came Dylan’s way in 2002, for Love and Theft (2001). In 2003 he cowrote and starred in the film Masked & Anonymous and began favoring keyboards over guitar in live appearances. The next year he released what portended to be the first in a series of autobiographies, Chronicles: Volume 1. In 2005 No Direction Home, a documentary directed by Martin Scorsese, appeared on television. Four hours long, yet covering Dylan’s career only up to 1967, it was widely hailed by critics. A soundtrack album that included 26 previously unreleased tracks came out before the documentary aired. In 2006 Dylan turned his attention to satellite radio as the host of the weekly Theme Time Radio Hour and released Modern Times, which won a Grammy Award for best contemporary folk album. Dylan also received an award for best solo rock vocal performance for “Someday Baby.” In presenting to Dylan Spain’s Prince of Asturias Prize for the Arts in 2007, the jury called him a “living myth in the history of popular music and a light for a generation that dreamed of changing the world,” and in 2008 the Pulitzer Prize Board awarded him a special citation for his “profound impact on popular music and American culture.” In 2009 Dylan released Together Through Life, which debuted at the top of the British and American album charts. He was still actively performing as he entered his 70s, and his 35th studio album, the rootsy Tempest (2012), found him as vigorous as ever. Dylan then turned his attention to the so-called Great American Songbook, especially standards recorded by Frank Sinatra. The resulting albums—Shadows in the Night (2015), Fallen Angels (2016), and the three-disc Triplicate (2017)—earned Dylan praise for his deeply felt interpretations. He returned to spectacular lyrical form yet again with Rough and Rowdy Ways (2020). Dylan continued to receive awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2012). In 2016 he won the Nobel Prize for Literature for, as noted by the prize-bestowing Swedish Academy, “having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.”",

                "content": "Travis Michael Kelce (/ˈkɛlsi/ ⓘ KEL-see;[a] born October 5, 1989) is an American professional football tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Chiefs in the third round of the 2013 NFL draft and later won Super Bowls LIV, LVII, and LVIII with the team. He played college football for the University of Cincinnati Bearcats football program. Considered one of the greatest tight ends of all time,[11][12] Kelce is a nine-time Pro Bowler and a seven-time All-Pro, with four first-team and three second-team selections. He holds the NFL records for most consecutive and most overall seasons with 1,000 receiving yards by a tight end: seven.[4] He holds the record for most receiving yards by a tight end in a single season with 1,416 in 2020, despite playing in only 15 games.[5][13] During the 2022 season, Kelce became the fifth NFL tight end to reach 10,000 career receiving yards and reached the milestone faster than any tight end in NFL history.[4] Kelce was named to the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team.[14][15] During the 2023 season, he surpassed Jerry Rice in career playoff receptions en route to Super Bowl LVIII, his fourth Super Bowl appearance in five seasons. Outside of football, Kelce has appeared on reality and scripted television, including being the namesake of the dating show Catching Kelce on E!, hosting the March 5, 2023, episode of Saturday Night Live, and in advertisements. He co-hosts the podcast New Heights with his brother Jason, covering topics from football to popular culture. The show was ranked as the 8th most popular show in the US on Apple Podcasts in 2024.[16] Kelce's relationship with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift has drawn massive media coverage and stimulated viewership and revenue for his team and its league. Kelce was born on October 5, 1989, in Westlake, Ohio. His father, Ed Kelce, is a former sales representative in the steel industry, and his mother, Donna, is a former bank executive. Kelce's older brother Jason played center for the Philadelphia Eagles for 13 seasons.[17] Kelce attended Cleveland Heights High School in his hometown of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, where he played football, basketball, and baseball.[18] He was a three-year letter winner as quarterback for the Tigers. As a senior in 2007, he ran for 1,016 yards and 10 touchdowns and threw for 1,523 yards, 21 touchdowns, and eight interceptions. His 2,539 yards of total offense garnered him All-Lake Erie League honors.[19][20] Considered a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, Kelce accepted a scholarship offer from the University of Cincinnati over offers from Akron, Eastern Michigan, and Miami (OH).[21] He joined his brother, Jason Kelce, who was the starting left guard for the Bearcats. After redshirting in 2008, he appeared in 11 games in 2009, playing at tight end and quarterback out of the Wildcat formation. He tallied eight rushes for 47 yards and two touchdowns and had one reception for three yards.[22] He was suspended for the 2010 season after testing positive for marijuana, a violation of team rules.[23][24] Returning for the 2011 season, he played tight end, recording 13 catches totaling 150 yards and two touchdowns.[25] In 2012, his last collegiate season, he set personal season highs in receptions (45), receiving yards (722), yards per receptions (16.0), and receiving touchdowns (8). Kelce earned first-team all-conference honors[26] and in March 2013, was named the College Football Performance Awards Tight End of the Year.[27] Kelce graduated in 2022 with a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies degree,[28] he received his diploma during an April 2024 podcast event at the Fifth Third Arena with his brother Jason.[29] Kelce was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round (63rd pick overall) of the 2013 NFL draft.[33] The Chiefs had hired Andy Reid as their new head coach during the off-season. Reid was familiar with Kelce, having drafted and coached his brother, Jason Kelce, in 2011 during his time as the head coach of the Eagles.[34][35] On June 6, 2013, the Chiefs signed Kelce to a four-year, $3.12 million rookie contract that also included a signing bonus of $703,304.[36] Kelce injured his knee in the preseason. The injury was later diagnosed as a bone bruise. After being limited the first two weeks of the season due to the injury and being inactive the next three games, Kelce was placed on injured reserve on October 12, 2013, after having a microfracture surgery performed on his knee.[37] He only played one snap, on special teams in the Chiefs' Week 2 game against the Dallas Cowboys.[38] During Week 3 against the Miami Dolphins, Kelce recorded his first NFL touchdown on a 20-yard reception from quarterback Alex Smith.[39] On November 30, he was fined $11,025 for \"unsportsmanlike conduct\" during a 29–16 loss to the Denver Broncos. Kelce made an inappropriate hand gesture and motion at Broncos linebacker Von Miller. Chiefs' head coach Andy Reid later called this \"immature\".[40] In the next game against the Arizona Cardinals, Kelce had seven receptions for 110 yards for his first NFL game with over 100 receiving yards.[41] In the regular-season finale against the San Diego Chargers, he had an offensive fumble recovery for a touchdown in the 19–7 victory.[42] Kelce was the Chiefs' leading receiver during the 2014 season, totaling 862 yards off 67 receptions.[43] Kelce began the 2015 season with his first NFL multiple touchdown game, with six receptions for 106 yards and two touchdowns in the 27–20 victory over the Houston Texans.[44] It was his only 100-plus-yard game, but he had at least one reception in all 16 games,[45] and was ranked a top-five tight end by ESPN.[46] He started all 16 regular season games and recorded 72 catches for 875 yards and five touchdowns, earning his way to his first Pro Bowl.[47][48] The Chiefs finished the regular season with an 11–5 record and made the playoffs.[49] In his first NFL playoff game, Kelce had eight receptions for 128 yards in a 30–0 Wild Card Round victory over the Texans.[50] In the Divisional Round against the New England Patriots, Kelce had six receptions for 23 yards as the Chiefs lost 27–20.[51] He was ranked 91st by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[52] On January 29, 2016, Kelce signed a five-year, $46 million contract extension.[53] He was ranked 91st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[52] During Week 8 against the Indianapolis Colts, Kelce had seven receptions for 101 yards and a touchdown.[54] In the next game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he was ejected after receiving two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties after arguing with two officials over not having a pass interference penalty called.[55] The second resulted from him sarcastically throwing his towel at field judge Mike Weatherford in a flagging motion due to being upset about the first penalty. He was later fined $24,309 for his outburst.[56] During Week 13 against the Atlanta Falcons, he had eight receptions for 140 yards.[57] In the next game, Kelce recorded 101 receiving yards against the Oakland Raiders, his fourth consecutive game topping 100.[58] He joined Jimmy Graham and former Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez as the only NFL tight ends ever to do so.[59] In a Christmas Day win over the Broncos, Kelce had career bests of 11 receptions for 160 yards and a career-long 80-yard touchdown on a screen pass.[45] He finished the season with career highs in yards (1,125) and receptions (85).[60] His 1,125 receiving yards led the league among tight ends and his 85 receptions were second among tight ends behind Dennis Pitta of the Baltimore Ravens.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs Will it catch on in the Chiefs locker room? Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs' star tight end, has recently embraced a new nickname among his friends: \"The Kansas City Stallion.\" This revelation comes with the fact that the Super Bowl winner has developed a huge affection for Italian culture, a passion that has blossomed alongside his relationship with music star Taylor Swift. The couple's shared love for Italy became evident after a romantic getaway to Lake Como earlier this year. Their Italian escapades have been well-documented, with reports suggesting they are considering purchasing a residence in the picturesque region. Additionally, Swift reportedly rented the iconic Monza F1 race track to celebrate Kelce's 35th birthday, further cementing their connection to Italian culture. Kelce's immersion into all things Italian has not gone unnoticed by his inner circle. Friends have observed his frequent use of Italian phrases \"We have been calling him the Kansas City Stallion,\" an insider told The U.S. Sun. \"He loves Sylvester Stallone - one of his favorite actors and a childhood idol. He's even started using Italian words like 'Grazzie! Tutto bene!' \"Travis now loves Italy and Italian things so much that he is learning and loving brands and items from there, and Taylor knows it!\" His growing appreciation for Italy does not stop there though. Friends claim he has also developed an affection for Italian fashion and cuisine. In light of this, they affectionately dubbed him \"The Kansas City Stallion,\" a nod to both his admiration for actor Sylvester Stallone and the Italian word for stallion, \"stallone.\" Taylor Swift has embraced Kelce's newfound enthusiasm, playfully participating in the jest. For his recent birthday, she gifted him luxury items from renowned Italian brands like Armani and Ferragamo, along with vintage Italian wines, aligning with his refined tastes. The couple's Italian adventures offer them a respite from their high-profile lives. According to sources close to them, these cultural escapades provide a significant departure from the limelight, allowing them to enjoy quality time together. Kelce, currently focused on securing another Super Bowl victory with the Chiefs, eagerly anticipates returning to Italy with Swift once the NFL season concludes. And more importantly, Swift is said to find the nickname quite endearing. Their shared experiences and mutual appreciation for Italian culture have only strengthened their bond, with Swift joining in the light-hearted teasing. Time will tell if the \"The Kansas City Stallion\" nickname also spreads in the Chiefs' locker room, as these things so often do in the sports world. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

                "content": "Anthony Marshon Davis Jr. (born March 11, 1993), nicknamed \"AD\", is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He previously played for the New Orleans Pelicans. He plays the power forward and center positions. Davis is a nine-time NBA All-Star and has been named to four All-NBA First Teams and five NBA All-Defensive Teams. In his first season with the Lakers, he won the 2020 NBA Finals. In 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[1] He also won the inaugural NBA Cup in 2023 with the Lakers. Davis is widely regarded as one of the greatest power forwards of all time.[2][3][4][5] Davis played one season of college basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats, when he was first team All-American and the Consensus National Player of the Year. He also won the USBWA National Freshman of the Year, NABC Defensive Player of the Year and the Pete Newell Big Man Award. Davis led the NCAA in blocks and set Southeastern Conference and NCAA Division I freshman single-season blocked shots records. He led Kentucky to a national championship and was named the most outstanding player of the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Davis left college for the NBA after one season and was drafted as the first overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft by the New Orleans Hornets, and was selected that summer to play in the 2012 Olympics. After his rookie season, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. The next season, he became an All-Star for the first time and led the NBA in blocked shots per game. He has since become the youngest player to score at least 59 points in an NBA game. In 2017, he was named the recipient of the NBA All-Star Game MVP Award after setting an All-Star Game scoring record of 52 points. Davis was traded to the Lakers in 2019. He has won gold medals with the United States national team on their 2012 Olympic team, 2014 World Cup team and 2024 Olympic team. As the first to win an NCAA national championship, FIBA World Cup, NBA championship, and Olympic gold medal, Davis is recognized by the governing bodies as the inaugural player to achieve basketball's version of the Grand Slam.[6][7][8][third-party source needed] He is also one of only eight players to ever achieve the basketball Triple Crown. Born in Chicago,[9] Davis grew up in the Englewood neighborhood[10] and played high school basketball for Perspectives Charter School,[11] where he had attended school since sixth grade.[12] The team plays in the Blue Division of the Chicago Public High School League, which is ignored by the media because of its lower level of competition.[13][14] Perspectives is a charter school that operates as a math and science academy; it has a strong academic reputation, but minimal athletic success.[15][16] The school had no gymnasium and Davis's middle school basketball teams practiced at the nearby Second Presbyterian Church[14] in Chicago's historic South Loop District. In junior high school, he was known as \"the little guy who would shoot threes from the corner\".[13] He ended his freshman year at a height of 6 feet 0 inches (1.83 m).[13] By the beginning of his sophomore year, he had grown another 1 inch (2.5 cm), and he finished the year at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m).[13][17] Davis began his junior basketball season at 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m),[13][17] saying he felt fortunate to have had such a rapid growth spurt without any knee pains.[18] During his junior year, his family considered having him transfer to one of Chicago's basketball powerhouses, but Hyde Park Career Academy head coach Donnie Kirksey advised against it, saying \"If you're good enough, they'll find you wherever you are\".[13] Perspectives finished the season 8–15.[13] Although he remained unnoticed nationally and locally after three seasons of Chicago Public League play,[12][19] he was soon thereafter rated as the number one player in the class of 2011 by Scout.com[20] and was listed in the ESPNU 100.[21] Attention came when he started playing on Tai Streets' Meanstreets (AAU team) traveling system in the spring of his junior year.[13] In late April, Syracuse University offered him a scholarship.[12] That spring, NBA Top 100 Camp Director Dave Telep invited him to the camp based on his dominant first-half performance of the first game of the Fort Wayne, Indiana Spiece Fieldhouse event.[22] In August 2010, Davis played in the Nike Global Challenge in Hillsboro, Oregon. In the opening game, he had 23 points and 9 rebounds.[23] Davis verbally committed to Kentucky on August 13, 2010, choosing it over DePaul, Ohio State and Syracuse.[24][25] On August 24, 2010, he became the number one rated player in the national class of 2011 at Scout.com.[26] Before Davis committed to Kentucky, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that his father had asked Kentucky for $200,000 in exchange for a commitment from Davis.[27] The report was initially released on Wednesday August 4, 2010 by Sun-Times reporter Michael O'Brien.[28] Citing \"a reliable source\", he posted the following text: \"Rumors/sources that have Davis choosing Kentucky are also alleging that the commitment cost $200,000.\" The sentence was later edited to say \"rumors that Davis's commitment is for sale have surfaced since he cut his list of schools down about a month ago.\" The sentence was removed later that day from the Sun-Times' high school sports website following a threat from a University of Kentucky lawyer.[29][30] Anthony Davis Sr. declined to speak to the Chicago Tribune on August 4 regarding the allegation; on July 30, however, he denied the allegations to the Sun-Times, stating, \"We haven't asked anyone for anything, and no one has offered us anything\".[29] The article was reposted on the Sun-Times' website and included in the print edition on Friday August 6. O'Brien wrote \"sources from three separate universities told the Sun-Times that Davis Sr. asked for money in return for his son's commitment, with the amounts ranging from $125,000 to $150,000.\"[28][31][32] The University of Kentucky and the Davis family both threatened to sue the Sun-Times over the article;[28][33] however, no lawsuits were filed by Kentucky or the Davis family. The Davises and Kentucky claim the restated publication was false.[34] Illinois' one-year statute of limitations on libel cases expired before any lawsuits were filed.[14] Davis signed his National Letter of Intent on November 10, 2010.[21][35] He began his senior season on the Chicago Sun-Times area 2010 Top 50 list.[36] He was a pre-season first team all-state selection by the Sun-Times.[37] By that time, he stood at 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 m).[13][17] His team's game against Whitney M. Young Magnet High School was nationally televised on ESPNU.[38] Perspectives finished the season with a 6–19 record.[39] Despite his growth, Davis continued to perform aspects of the role of a guard during the season by bringing the ball up the court and shooting outside shots.[40] For the season, he averaged 32 points, 22 rebounds and 7 blocks.[24] In high school, Davis earned numerous honors for his basketball abilities, including being named to the 2011 McDonald's All-American Game and the 10th annual Jordan Brand Classic.[41][42] He was a first team USA Today All-USA high school basketball team selection.[43][44] He was a first-team Parade All-American.[45] He was also a first team All-American selection by SLAM Magazine (along with Gilchrist, Rivers, Beal, Quincy Miller and Marquis Teague) and Dime Magazine (along with Gilchrist, Rivers, Beal and Myles Mack).[46][47] He was a first team selection to the ESPN Rise boys' high school basketball All-American team.[48] In the statewide voting for Illinois Mr. Basketball by coaches and media, he placed fourth.[49] The Chicago Sun-Times selected him as a Class 3A first team All-State selection.[50] The Chicago Sun-Times selected him as an all-Public League selection.[51] The Illinois Basketball Coaches Association included him in the Class 3A/4A boys all-state first team.[52] In the March 30, 2011 McDonald's All-American Game, in front of a hometown crowd at the United Center, Davis made his first five field goals on his way to a 14-point, 6-rebound, 2-steal and 4-block performance.[53][54] In the April 9 Nike Hoops Summit, Davis led the USA Basketball team to a 92–80 victory over the world team with a team-high 10 rebounds to go with 16 points and two blocks.[55][56] He was named co-MVP of the April 16 Jordan Brand Classic game after posting 29 points (on 13-for-15 shooting), 11 rebounds and four blocks in a losing effort.[57][58] Davis's 29 points was the second-highest point total in the first 10 years of the Jordan Brand Classic, following only LeBron James's 34-point performance.[58] Sources: Davis committed to the Kentucky Wildcats, coached by John Calipari. Before his college career began, he was being mentioned as the first overall selection in the 2012 NBA draft.[59][60][61] In late February Dick Vitale mentioned the possibility that Davis might complete the men's college basketball awards Grand Slam of National Player of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year, Freshman of the Year and the No. 1 overall pick in the upcoming draft.\"[40] During the exhibition portion of the season for the 2011–12 Wildcats, Calipari described Davis as follows: \"He's 6–10 with a 7–3 wingspan and he can shoot the 3 and dribble the ball and lead the break. . .\"[62] Less than a month into the season, ESPN's Andy Katz described him similarly: \"Davis offers a multitude of skills for the Wildcats with his ability to block shots, run the floor, score in the low post and face up to the basket.\"[63] Since Calipari had coached Marcus Camby, who was also a tall shot-blocker, Davis drew comparisons to Camby.[63] ESPN selected Davis as a preseason All-American along with teammate Terrence Jones.[64] Some sources, such as Blue Ribbon, selected Connecticut's Andre Drummond as the preseason Freshman/Newcomer of the Year ahead of Davis,[65][66] although Davis was the only freshman on the ESPN 10-man preseason team.[67] Davis only received one vote for the Associated Press preseason All-America team.[68] \"Anthony is a tremendous shot blocker with great size and length. He can make 3-pointers, dribble the ball and he can get up and down the court faster than some of our guards because of his long, looping strides. He's a different player than Marcus Camby, but he's physically ahead of where Marcus was to start his freshman season.\" After most of the pre-conference schedule but before the 2011–12 Southeastern Conference men's basketball schedule, Davis's teammate, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, was mentioned as a possible Southeastern Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year.[69] However, after less than a month of Southeastern Conference play, Davis was not only being mentioned as conference player of the year, but also National Player of the Year.[70] By mid-February, he was considered a National Player of the Year front-runner with his primary competition coming from Thomas Robinson of Kansas.[71] As the season progressed, he continued to battle Robinson while developing a college level offensive game.[72][73] Davis averaged a double-double and 6.5 blocks in the two games (November 15, 2011 and April 2, 2012) they played against each other, both on neutral courts.[74] Davis led the Wildcats to a perfect 16–0 record in conference play en route to the SEC conference regular season championship.[75] Davis finished the year with averages of 14.2 points per game, 10.4 rebounds per game, 4.7 blocks per game and a field goal percentage of 62.3%.[76] The Wildcats entered the SEC Tournament as heavy favorites and defeated LSU and Florida before losing to the Vanderbilt Commodores in the championship game.[75] Despite the loss, the Wildcats earned the number one overall seed in the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.[77] In the Wildcats' six NCAA Tournament games, Davis averaged 15.2 points, 11.2 rebounds and 4.6 blocks per game, and led the team to its eighth NCAA championship.[78][79] Davis was named the 2012 Sporting News Men's College Basketball Player of the Year.[80] On March 19, he won the US Basketball Writers Association's (USBWA) Robertson trophy.[81][82] The Commonwealth Athletic Club of Kentucky named Davis the Adolph Rupp Trophy winner on March 22.[83] CBSSports.com recognized Davis as their national player of the year.[84] On March 30, he became the second freshman (Kevin Durant) to win the Associated Press College Basketball Player of the Year.[85] On March 31, he won the John R. Wooden Award.[86] The following day he won the Naismith College Player of the Year.[87] He was Kentucky's first Naismith winner and the first from the SEC in 42 years (Pete Maravich).[88] Davis was named to the 2012 Sporting News All-American first team.[80] He was also named first team All-American by the United States Basketball Writers Association.[89] On March 20, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) chose him as a first team All-American.[90] Davis was a CBSSports.com first team All-American.[84] Davis was named a first team Associated Press All-American, making him a unanimous first team All-American selection.[91][92] During the 2012 NCAA Tournament, Davis was selected to the NCAA South Regional All-Tournament Team.[93] Then, in the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament final four, he posted 18 points, 14 rebounds and 5 blocks against Louisville.[94] In the championship game, he had 16 rebounds, 6 blocks, 5 assists, 3 steals and 6 points against Kansas.[74] He won the NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player and was selected to that All-Tournament team.[95] He was the fourth freshman to win the Most Outstanding Player award.[96] Davis was named the USBWA National Freshman of the Year.[97] He was selected by the USBWA as the Player of the Year for its 10-man 2011–12 Men's All-District IV (Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida) Team.[98] Davis was a first team selection to the NABC Division I All-District 21 team on March 14.[99] On April 1, he was also awarded the Pete Newell Big Man Award and the NABC Defensive Player of the Year.[100] CollegeInsider.com recognized him with the Lefty Driesell Award as Defensive Player of the Year and the Kyle Macy Award as Freshman of the Year.[101] Davis twice earned SEC Player of the Week (POTW) honors (Week of February 6 and 27, 2012)[102][103] and four times, when he was not Player of the Week, he earned SEC Freshman of the Week (FOTW) honors (November 14, 2011, February 1, 2012, January 16, 2012 and May 3, 2012).[104][105][106][107] He earned his first FOTW honor for debuting with a double-double, including 23 points, 10 rebounds, 5 blocks and 3 assists against Marist on November 11, 2011.[104][108] Only Jones and Sam Bowie had previously had 20 or more points and 10 or more rebounds in their Kentucky Freshman debut.[109] His second FOTW came in a week in which he averaged 14.0 points, 11.5 rebounds, six blocks, 1.5 steals and 1 assist in wins over Lamar and fourth-rated Louisville.[105][110][111] His third FOTW award came when he averaged 16 points, 7 rebounds, 4 blocks, 2.5 steals and 2 assists in wins at Auburn and at Tennessee where both his point totals were game highs.[106][112][113] He earned his fourth FOTW when he averaged 15.5 points, 10 rebounds and 4 blocks in wins over Georgia and at Florida.[107][114][115] He earned his first POTW recognition for averaging 20 points, eight rebounds, 7.5 blocks and 2 assists in wins over Tennessee and at South Carolina.[102][116][117] For Davis's second POTW he posted a pair of double-doubles to average 20.5 points, 11 rebounds, 3.5 blocks and two steals in wins at Mississippi State and over Vanderbilt.[103][118][119] The February 25 win against Vanderbilt clinched the 2011–12 SEC championship for Kentucky as Davis tallied a career-high 28 points as well as 11 rebounds and 5 blocked shots.[120] ESPN's Andy Katz described his SEC title-clinching performance as the most complete performance of his career.[73] He was also selected as the SEC Player of the Year, SEC Freshman of the Year, SEC Defensive Player of the Year and a first team All-SEC honoree.[121] The SEC awards were selected by the league's 12 coaches who were not permitted to vote for their own players. Thus, no awards were unanimous.[122] Sporting News also selected him as Freshman and Player of the Year for the SEC.[123] Also, the Associated Press selected him as Player and Newcomer of the Year for the SEC as well as an All-SEC performer.[124] Following the 2012 SEC tournament, he was selected to the SEC All-Tournament Team.[125] During the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, Davis blocked more shots per game than most Division I men's teams.[40][126] In the January 17 contest against Arkansas, Davis set the Kentucky men's basketball record for single-season blocked shots surpassing Melvin Turpin and Andre Riddick, who each had 83. In the game, he established a career high with 27 points and added 14 rebounds and 5 blocked shots.[127] On February 4, against South Carolina, Davis established the SEC freshman record with 116 blocks surpassing Shaquille O'Neal's total set for LSU.[102] One of the most notable blocks of the season was a block of John Henson with four seconds left to preserve a 73–72 victory when number one Kentucky hosted number five North Carolina on December 3.[128][129] On March 15, Davis established a Kentucky single-game record for the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament by blocking 7 against Western Kentucky.[130] On March 25, Davis established the SEC single-season blocked shots record in the NCAA Tournament South Regional Championship game victory over Baylor,[93] surpassing Jarvis Varnado's total of 169.[131] On March 31, he tied DeMarcus Cousins with 20 double-doubles for the Kentucky freshman-season record.[132] He also surpassed Cousins' Kentucky freshman rebounds record of 374 with 415 rebounds.[133][134][135] With six blocks in the championship game, he achieved a total of 186 for the season, surpassing Hassan Whiteside's 2010 total of 182, to set an NCAA Division I freshman record. This also tied the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game record for blocks established by Joakim Noah in the 2006 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.[136] Starting in the championship game gave him a total of 40 starts for the season, which tied Kentucky's single-season record along with teammate Marquis Teague.[136] Davis declared for the 2012 NBA draft alongside the rest of the national championship team starting five: fellow freshmen Kidd-Gilchrist and Teague, and sophomores Jones and Doron Lamb.[137] At the 2012 NBA Draft Combine, Davis measured at 6 feet 9.25 inches (2.06 m), 221.8 pounds (100.6 kg) and had the second-longest wingspan—7 feet 5.5 inches (2.27 m)—of any player participating.[138] On June 28, the New Orleans Hornets selected Davis with the first overall pick.[139] Davis became the fifth Chicago-area first overall selection following Cazzie Russell (1966), LaRue Martin (1972), Mark Aguirre (1981) and Derrick Rose (2008).[140] On July 24, 2012, Davis signed a three-year $16 million guaranteed contract with the Hornets as prescribed by the NBA's collective bargaining agreement.[141] On November 1, 2012, Davis made his debut against the San Antonio Spurs. He scored a team high 21 in a losing effort.[142] On November 2, Davis suffered a concussion that sidelined him for two-and-a-half games until November 9.[143][144] In his November 9 return, he posted his first double-double with 23 points and 11 rebounds as well as 5 blocks, 2 steals and 2 assists in a victory over the Charlotte Bobcats.[145] On November 17, he totaled 28 points and 11 rebounds against the Milwaukee Bucks.[146] On November 20, Davis was announced to be out of the lineup for \"a stress reaction\" on his ankle.[147] He was cleared to play on December 11, 2012 after missing 11 games.[148][149] On December 18, he posted a career-high 4 steals to go along with 15 points and a then-career-high 16 rebounds against the Golden State Warriors in his first start since being disabled on November 20.[150] Davis appeared in the February 15, 2013 Rising Stars Challenge during the 2013 NBA All-Star Game weekend.[151] Davis was removed from the Hornets' lineup on February 27 following a collision with Brook Lopez the prior night in which he sprained his left shoulder.[152] On March 5, Davis returned to the starting lineup with 17 points, 15 rebounds and 4 blocked shots against the Orlando Magic.[153] On March 9, Davis established a career high in rebounds with 18 to go along with 20 points against the Memphis Grizzlies.[154] On March 20, Davis tipped in the game-winning basket over Kevin Garnett against the Boston Celtics with 0.3 seconds remaining.[155] On April 10, Davis suffered a season-ending left knee medial collateral ligament sprain and bone bruise.[156] He was injured in a collision with Marcus Thornton of the Sacramento Kings.[157] He was a 2013 NBA All-Rookie First Team selection,[158] and finished second in NBA Rookie of the Year voting (with 306 points) to Damian Lillard (605).[159] His 20 double-doubles was the most in his rookie class.[160] As a rookie, he proved to be mostly a pick-and-roll threat on offense, but was effective in fast break transition and on the offensive boards. He needed to develop his isolation and post-up skills.[161] His rookie skill set was said to resemble a young Lamar Odom, but he added over 10 pounds (4.5 kg) following his rookie season.[162] After the 2012–13 season, the Hornets renamed themselves the Pelicans.[163] Davis donated $65,000 toward the construction of a basketball court at his alma mater, Perspectives.[164][165] On October 16, 2013, during the preseason of Davis's sophomore year for the 2013–14 New Orleans Pelicans, the Pelicans exercised the team's third-year option on Davis's contract.[160] Davis began the 2013–14 NBA season with the newly-renamed Pelicans with a pair of double-doubles, posting 20 points and 12 rebounds against Indiana on October 30[166] and 26 points and 17 rebounds against Orlando on November 1.[167] In the Orlando game, Davis became the youngest player in franchise history to record 25 points and 15 rebounds in a game.[167] In the third game of the season against Charlotte on November 2, Davis established career highs with 6 blocks and 6 steals, while helping New Orleans to its first victory. He also became the first player with 6 blocks, 6 steals and 25 points in a game in the last 20 years and only the fifth with at least 5 blocks, 5 steals and 25 points in that period.[168] For the week, Davis earned an NBA Player of the Week nomination, but lost out to Kevin Love.[169] On November 8, against the Los Angeles Lakers, Davis scored a career-high 32 points and tied a career high with 6 blocks, along with 12 rebounds, becoming the youngest player ever to have at least 30 points, 10 rebounds and 5 blocks in an NBA game.[170][171] On November 16, he established a new career high with 8 blocks against Philadelphia.[172] He again had 8 blocks on November 20 against the Utah Jazz. With two 8-block games in the Pelicans' first 11 games of the 2013–14 NBA season, Davis matched the number of 8-block games that Roy Hibbert had at that time in the 2012–13 and 2013–14 NBA seasons combined. No other players had two 8-block games as recently.[173] According to ESPN, while drawing a charging foul from Amar'e Stoudemire, Davis suffered a non-displaced fracture in his left hand in the first quarter against the New York Knicks on December 1.[174] Yahoo! Sports claims the injury came on an attempted alley oop.[175] On December 3, the Pelicans announced a four-to-six-week layoff was expected.[176] The injury came the night before he was supposed to play in his hometown of Chicago, marking the second year in a row that he was sidelined for his chance to play in his hometown.[177] Davis returned to the lineup on December 18 against the Los Angeles Clippers with 24 points, 12 rebounds and 3 steals.[178] He returned to the starting lineup in the next game with 21 points, 9 rebounds, 2 blocks and a steal against Portland on December 21. He missed 7 games due to the injury.[179][180] In his seventh consecutive 20-point game (all losses), Davis posted 31 points and 17 rebounds against Golden State.[181] In the subsequent game on January 20, he helped the Pelicans snap an 8-game losing streak with 27 points, 10 rebounds, 4 assists and 4 blocks against Memphis.[182] On January 26, Davis established a new career high with 19 rebounds, in addition to posting 22 points and 7 blocks, in a 100–92 victory over the Orlando Magic.[183] On January 27, Davis was a finalist for Western Conference Player of the Week but lost out to Kevin Durant.[184] The January 28 contest against the Cleveland Cavaliers featuring the last three first overall NBA draft picks (Anthony Bennett, Davis and Kyrie Irving), Davis posted 30 points, 8 blocks, 7 rebounds and 3 assists.[185] However, he dislocated his left index finger causing him to miss the next game the following night.[186] On January 29, he was named a Rising Stars Challenge participant as part of the 2014 NBA All-Star Game weekend.[187] On February 7, he was selected to replace Kobe Bryant in the 2014 NBA All-Star Game.[188] On February 26, Davis sprained his left shoulder late in the first half against the Dallas Mavericks. He did not play in the rest of the game, and his subsequent availability was listed as day-to-day.[189][190][191] Despite his shoulder sprain, Davis matched his career high with 32 points on February 28 against the Phoenix Suns.[192] He was one of six Western Conference Player of the Week nominees on March 10.[193] On March 14, Davis established a career high with 36 points against Portland.[194] On March 16, 2014, (the very next game) Davis scored a career-high 40 points along with a career-high 21 rebounds in a 121–120 overtime win against the Boston Celtics. The performance was the first 40-point, 20-rebound effort of the 2013–14 NBA season. Davis was the fourth-youngest player (21 years and 5 days) to achieve 40/20 in a game and the youngest since Shaquille O'Neal in 1993.[195] In addition to his career game, Davis set a New Orleans' franchise record with six straight games of at least 28 points. Glen Rice set the previous best stretch with five straight in the 1990s. It was also the first 40-point performance by a Pelican/Hornet since David West on February 26, 2010.[196] Davis was again a finalist for NBA Player of the Week on March 17 and 24.[197][198] In late March, Davis began suffering a series of injuries. On March 28, Davis injured his left ankle, after four minutes of play against the Jazz.[199] He missed the rest of the game and the next one.[200] Davis returned to the lineup on March 31 against Sacramento.[201] However, on April 2, Davis endured back spasms that caused him to miss the second half against the Nuggets.[202] Davis saw limited minutes on April 4 and missed a game on April 9 due to his back.[203] On April 10, the team announced that Davis would miss the remaining four games.[204] Davis finished the season as the NBA leader in blocked shots per game (2.82).[205] Davis was the youngest NBA leading shot blocker at 21 years, 36 days (on April 16, 2014).[206] The record was surpassed 10 seasons later by Victor Wembanyama at 20 years, 101 days (on April 14, 2024).[207][208] Because of his improved performance this season against his rookie season, Davis finished third in the NBA Most Improved Player Award voting behind Lance Stephenson and Goran Dragić.[209] Davis began the 2014–15 NBA season against the Orlando Magic with one of the best season-opening performances of all time: 26 points, 17 rebounds, 9 blocks, 3 steals and 2 assists. It was the first 9-block season-opener since Nate Thurmond had 12 to open the 1974–75 NBA season. The performance also marked the first 26-point/17-rebound/9-block/3-steal effort since Hakeem Olajuwon during the 1989–90 NBA season.[210] On November 8, against the San Antonio Spurs, he posted 27 points, 11 rebounds and 6 blocks, including the game-winning basket with 6.6 seconds remaining. It marked the 5th time Davis had 25 points, 10 rebounds and 5 blocks since the beginning of the prior season. No other player has had multiple such games in that time.[211] On November 22, Davis scored a career-high 43 points along with 14 rebounds against the Utah Jazz.[212] He was a finalist for October/November Western Conference Player of the Month.[213] On December 2, Davis fell one assist and one block short of becoming the youngest NBA player to ever record a five-by-five with a 25-point, 10-rebound, 4-assist, 6-steal, 4-block performance against the Oklahoma City Thunder.[214] Davis entered the December 12, 2014 contest against the Cleveland Cavaliers with a player efficiency rating (PER) of 32.9, which would be the highest in NBA history if maintained for the full season. Davis was injured in the game and left in the first quarter.[215] Davis was sidelined in the subsequent contest.[216] He was a finalist for December Western Conference Player of the Month.[217] On February 6, despite having missed his last 11 three-point shots and having a career 2-for-23 three-point career record, Davis made a game-winning three-point buzzer beater against Oklahoma City Thunder as part of a 41-point, 10-rebound double-double. The 41-point performance marked a New Orleans record 13th consecutive 20-point performance, surpassing Pete Maravich of the 1976–77 New Orleans Jazz.[218] On February 7, 2015, Davis injured his shoulder after falling off the rim when he received an alley-oop.[219] As a result of the injury, he withdrew from the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, and was replaced on the roster by Dirk Nowitzki and in the starting lineup by LaMarcus Aldridge.[220][221][222] Davis missed five games in late February and early March to the shoulder sprain.[223] He returned against the Detroit Pistons with a very dominant game performance of 39 points, 13 rebounds and 8 blocks, numbers that only Hakeem Olajuwon and Dwight Howard had achieved in a game in the prior 30 years. Davis also reached 437 career blocks, a franchise record.[224] On March 9, Davis tied his career high with 43 points and added 10 rebounds, 2 blocks and a steal in a 114–103 win against the Milwaukee Bucks.[225] On March 15 in a double overtime game against the Denver Nuggets, Davis became the first player in NBA history to tally 36 points, 14 rebounds, 9 blocks and 7 assists in a game since blocks became a statistic in 1973. Only David Robinson has had at least 30 points, 11 rebounds, 8 blocks and 7 assists in a game.[226] On March 16, Davis earned Western Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, March 9, through Sunday, March 15 and was a finalist for Western Conference Player of the Month of March.[227][228] In the final game of the regular season, a must-win game that would send the Pelicans to the 2015 NBA playoffs, Davis recorded 31 points, 13 rebounds and 3 blocks in a 108–103 victory over the defending-champion San Antonio Spurs. The playoff berth was Davis's first and the franchise's first since 2011.[229] Davis's season was one of the most impressive in NBA history, finishing the season averaging 24.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 2.9 blocks, and leading the league in player efficiency rating with 30.89.[230] He was a finalist for Western Conference Player of the Month again in April.[231] In his first career playoff series, Davis averaged 31.5 points, 11.0 rebounds and 3.0 blocks per game. Although swept by the overall number one seeded Golden State Warriors, who went on to win the NBA championship,[232] Davis joined Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Karl Malone as the only players in the past 20 seasons to average 30 points and 10 rebounds in the playoffs.[233] Davis also became the first player in 40 years to average 30 points and 10 rebounds in a player's first playoff series, with the only other players to do so being Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bob McAdoo.[233] At the end of the season, Davis finished 4th in the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting,[234] 5th in the NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting,[235] sixth in the NBA Most Improved Player Award voting.[236] He was selected to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career, becoming the first player to make the first team in his first three seasons since Derrick Rose did so in the 2010–11 NBA season.[237][238] He was also an NBA All-Defensive Team second team selection.[239] On July 9, 2015, Davis signed a five-year, $145 million contract extension with the Pelicans.[240][241] On November 6, he tied his career-high of 43 points in a loss to the Atlanta Hawks.[242] On December 1, he tied a career-high 9 blocked shots in an offensive off night against the Memphis Grizzlies.[243] On December 20, in a win over the Denver Nuggets, Davis scored a single-quarter career-high 19 first quarter points to finish the game with 27.[244] On January 15, Davis converted an alley oop dunk from Jrue Holiday with 2 seconds remaining to give New Orleans a 109–107 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.[245] On January 28, Davis was named as a reserve for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game.[246] He again came close to a five-by-five with a 28-point, 10-rebound, 4-assist, 4-block, 4-steal effort on February 3 against the San Antonio Spurs.[247] The following day, he was named to the NBA All-Star Weekend Skills Challenge lineup.[248] On February 21, in a win over the Detroit Pistons, Davis scored a franchise-record 59 points and pulled down 20 rebounds. The previous franchise record was 50 points by Jamal Mashburn exactly 13 years earlier against the Memphis Grizzlies. Davis joined Shaquille O'Neal and Chris Webber as the only NBA players with 50 points and 20 rebounds in a game since 1983.[249] Davis also became just the 20th player in NBA history to score at least 59 points in a game,[250] and became the youngest player in NBA history to score 59 points in a game, and the second youngest (behind Bob McAdoo) to record 50 points and 20 rebounds in a game. The 59 points was an NBA-wide season high at the time.[251] The total was not surpassed until the final night of the season when Kobe Bryant posted 60 in his final career game.[252] Davis posted a third 40-point game (40 points and 13 rebounds) on March 9 against the Charlotte Hornets.[253] On March 20, he was ruled out for the rest of the season with a left knee injury and a torn labrum in his left shoulder.[254][255] Upon being deactivated, Davis claimed that he had been playing through left shoulder pain since his rookie season.[256] On October 26, Davis began the season with a 50-point, 16-rebound, 7-steal (career high),[257] 5-assist, 4-block performance against the Denver Nuggets. He was one block short of his first five-by-five. It was the first 50-point, 15-rebound, 5-assist, 5-steal performance in NBA history since steals became an officially recorded statistic in the 1973–74 season.[258] His 50-point night was the second highest scoring output of his career and was the most by any NBA player in a season opener since Michael Jordan scored 54 points in 1989.[259] Two days later, he had 45 points and 17 rebounds against the Golden State Warriors, becoming the first back-to-back-game 40-point scorer in Pelicans history (since the New Orleans Hornets creation in 2002).[260] On November 10, he scored 32 points against the Milwaukee Bucks, helping the Pelicans record their first win of the season after starting 0–8.[261] On November 19, Davis posted 38 points and 16 rebounds, including 11 of the Pelicans' final 16 in an overtime win against the Charlotte Hornets.

Davis scored 40 for the sixth time this season, and it was his highest-scoring game since he put up 45 against Minnesota on November 23.[268] On February 19, 2017, playing on his team's home floor for the NBA All-Star Game, Davis notched 52 points and 10 rebounds, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's previous All-Star record high of 42 points, and also won the game's Most Valuable Player award.[269] This record has since been broken by Jayson Tatum in 2023.[270] On March 11, 2017, Davis scored 46 points and grabbed 21 rebounds in a 125–122 overtime win over the Charlotte Hornets.[271] On March 31, 2017, Davis had 19 points, 12 rebounds and five blocks in a 117–89 win over the Sacramento Kings. During the game, Davis became the first player in Pelicans history to reach 2,000 points in a season.[272] Following the season, he edged out Rudy Gobert as the center on the All-NBA first team.[273] He was also named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team for the second time.[274] On November 22, 2017, Davis had 29 points and 11 rebounds in a 107–90 win over the San Antonio Spurs.

It was his fourth consecutive game with 30-plus points and 15-plus rebounds. Davis also became just the third Laker in franchise history to record 30-plus points and 15-plus rebounds in four consecutive games, joining Elgin Baylor (had seven such streaks) and Shaquille O'Neal (November 19–26, 1999).[356][357] On December 2, Davis scored a then season-high 44 points, along with 10 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 blocks in a 133–129 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks.[358] On December 4, Davis scored a season-high 55 points along with 17 rebounds and three blocks in a 130–119 win over the Washington Wizards.

Davis became only the fourth player to score at least 99 points in a two-game span while shooting at least 70% from the field; Elgin Baylor had three of those streaks, Wilt Chamberlain had two and David Thompson had one. He also became the first Laker with back-to-back 40-point games since Kobe Bryant in March 2013.[359][360] On December 5, Davis was named the NBA Western Conference Player of the Week for Week 7 (November 28 – December 4), his eighth career NBA Player of the Week award and first with the Lakers. He led the Lakers to 3–1 week with averages of 37.8 points, 13.0 rebounds and 3.25 blocks.[361] On January 25, 2023, Davis returned after missing the previous twenty games with a right foot injury. He posted 21 points, 12 rebounds and four blocks in 26 minutes off the bench in a 113–104 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[362] On February 26, he led the Lakers to a 111–108 come-from-behind victory over the Dallas Mavericks with 30 points and 15 rebounds.[363] It was the biggest comeback of the season at that time, and the Lakers' biggest comeback in franchise history since 2002.[364] On March 5, Davis recorded 39 points, eight rebounds and six assists in an 113–105 win over the reigning champions the Golden State Warriors.[365] On March 7, Davis put up 30 points and a season-high 22 rebounds in a 112–103 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. He also became the first Laker to drop multiple games with at least 30 points and 20 rebounds in a season since Shaquille O'Neal in 2003–04 season.[366] On April 3, Davis was named NBA Western Conference Player of the Week for Week 20 (March 27 – April 2). Davis averaged 38.7 points (.652 FG%, .806 FT%), 11.7 rebounds, 1.0 steals and 2.0 blocks in three games, as the Lakers finished the week 3–0 with road victories over Chicago, Minnesota and Houston.[367] He also earned NBA Western Conference Player of the Month for March/April on April 11, 2023.[368] In Game 1 of the Lakers' first-round playoff series against the Memphis Grizzlies, Davis recorded 22 points, 12 rebounds, three assists, three steals and a playoff career-high seven blocks in a 128–112 win.[369] In Game 3 of the Lakers' first-round playoff series against the Memphis Grizzlies, Davis put up 31 points, 17 rebounds, two assists, two steals and three blocks in a 111–101 win.[370] In Game 1 of the Lakers' second-round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors, Davis posted 30 points, a playoff career-high 23 rebounds, five assists and four blocks in a 117–112 win. He joined Tim Duncan as the only players in NBA history to put up at least 30 points, 20 rebounds, five assists and three blocks in a playoff game.[371] In Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals, Davis recorded 40 points, 10 rebounds, three assists, three steals and two blocks in a 132–126 loss against the Denver Nuggets.[372] The Lakers ultimately lost the series to the eventual NBA champion Nuggets in a four-game sweep.[373] During the 2023 playoffs, Davis became the third Lakers player with 50 blocks in a single postseason, behind only Shaquille O'Neal and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.[374] On August 4, 2023, Davis signed a three-year contract extension with the Los Angeles Lakers.[375] On December 10, 2023, Davis won the inaugural NBA Cup with the Lakers after winning the 2023 NBA In-Season Tournament. Davis had 41 points on 16-for-24 shooting, 20 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 blocks against the Indiana Pacers in the championship game. Davis was recognized as a member of the All-Tournament team.[376][377] On January 9, 2024, he scored 20 of his season-high 41 points in the fourth quarter on 13-of-17 shooting, 2-of-2 from three, 13-of-14 from the free throw line along with eleven rebounds and six assists in a 132–131 win over the Toronto Raptors.[378] On January 13, Davis recorded his second career triple-double with 15 points, 15 rebounds, a career-high 11 assists and four blocks in a 132–125 loss against the Utah Jazz.[379] On February 1, Davis was named as reserve for the 2024 NBA All-Star Game, his ninth selection.[380] On February 5, Davis put up his third career triple-double with 26 points, 15 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 124–118 win over the Charlotte Hornets. He also became the first player in Lakers franchise history to put up at least 25 points on 75% shooting, 15 rebounds, and 10 assists in a game.[381] On February 29, Davis posted 40 points, 15 rebounds, four assists and three blocks in a 134–131 overtime win over the Washington Wizards.[382] On March 10, Davis logged 27 points, a season-high 25 rebounds, a career-high seven steals, five assists, and three blocks in a 120–109 victory against the Minnesota Timberwolves; he became the first player in NBA history to record 25+ points, 25+ rebounds, 5+ assists, and 5+ steals in a single game.[383][384] On March 16, he suffered an eye contusion in a game against the Golden State Warriors.[385] The Lakers lost the game 128–121.[386] On March 26, Davis recorded 34 points, 23 rebounds, two assists, two steals and four blocks, playing a career-high 52 minutes in a 128–124 double overtime win over the Milwaukee Bucks.[387][388] In Game 4 of the Lakers' first round playoffs series against the Denver Nuggets, Davis posted 25 points, 23 rebounds, and 6 assists in a 119–108 win. The Lakers would go on to lose to the Nuggets in five games despite strong play from Davis.[389] In the Lakers' season opener on October 22, Davis logged 36 points, 16 rebounds, four assists and three blocks in a 110–103 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. He had a perfect fourth quarter where he scored 11 points without missing a field goal attempt. Davis posted his 15th game as a Laker with 35+ points and 15+ rebounds – tying Wilt Chamberlain for the fourth-most in team history. The Lakers are 13–2 in those games.[390][391] On October 25, Davis scored 35 points in a 123–116 victory against the Phoenix Suns. He became the 3rd Lakers player to make consecutive 35-point games during his first two season games, after Jerry West and Elgin Baylor.[392] On November 15, Davis scored a season-high 40 points and grabbed 12 rebounds, including drilling two pivotal 3-pointers in the fourth quarter of a 120–115 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[393] On December 6, Davis recorded 38 points, 10 rebounds and 8 assists in a 134–132 overtime loss against the Atlanta Hawks.[394] On December 16, Davis tied his season-high with 40 points and grabbed 16 rebounds in a 116–110 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.[395] On May 2, 2012, following a rash of injuries to players who had been on the 20-man Team USA basketball roster in January (notably center Dwight Howard), Davis was named as one of the finalists for the 2012 Olympic basketball team. Davis, along with Greg Monroe, was under consideration to fill the vacancy at center resulting from Howard's injury. Davis would be the first American player since Emeka Okafor (2004) to have competed in the Olympics without any prior NBA experience.[406] By the beginning of July, he was one of six players (along with Blake Griffin, James Harden, Rudy Gay, Andre Iguodala and Eric Gordon) competing for the final three roster spots, according to USA Basketball director Jerry Colangelo.[407] Tyson Chandler, Kevin Love, Griffin and Davis were the only true post players among the final 15.[407] It was reported that Davis \"suffered a severely sprained ankle in a workout\" on June 30 and \"almost assuredly [would] bypass a chance to play for Team USA [that] summer in the London Olympics.\"[408] On July 12, 2012, however, he was selected for the Olympic team after Griffin suffered an injury to the same knee he injured in the 2012 NBA playoffs, making him the only college player on the team.[409] The team went undefeated in London and won the gold medal match over Spain.[410] Davis was also a member of the 2014 national team that won the gold medal in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup over Serbia on September 14. He averaged 12.3 points, 6.6 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game in 9 games played, while shooting 54.9% from the field.[411][412][413] On April 15, 2024, Davis was named to the 2024 U.S. Olympic team, returning to the national team after a 10-year gap.[414] He helped Team USA win the gold medal, and in six games, he averaged 8.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.2 steals and a team-high 1.5 blocks per game while shooting 62.5% from the field.[415] On June 19, 2022, Davis signed with FaZe Clan, joining Faze Clan's Nuke Squad for Call of Duty.[416] Davis is the son of Anthony Davis Sr.[29] Davis Sr. is 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m), and his mother, Erainer, is 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m).[9][417] He has a twin sister, Antoinette and an older sister, Lesha who played basketball at Daley College.[14][417] He has cousins named Jarvis, Marshaun and Keith Chamberlain. Keith has played professional basketball in Germany and Latvia and their father, Keith Sr., served as Davis's elementary school athletic director.[418] Davis married Marlen Polanco on September 18, 2021. They have three children together.[419] On June 15, 2012, he signed with Arn Tellem and Thad Foucher of the Wasserman Media Group as his agents.[420][421] Tellem left to become an NBA executive in 2015,[421] and Davis signed with Rich Paul of Klutch Sports Group in 2018.[422] Davis trademarked his unibrow sayings \"Fear The Brow\", \"Raise The Brow\", and \"Street Clothes Davis\" in June 2012.[30][423][424] In 2014, he launched AD's Flight Academy, which holds charitable events in the Greater-New Orleans area.[425] *Ruled ineligible after tournament",

                "content": "It’s been almost 30 years since we last saw Happy Gilmore, the long-driving hero who won the Tour Championship in 1996. Now, we finally get to catch up with him in a new sequel. That’s right, Adam Sandler is returning to the golf green as Happy Gilmore, and he’s bringing along a few new and familiar faces. Joining the film alongside Sandler are original Happy Gilmore stars Julie Bowen and Christopher McDonald and brand-new co-star Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio (aka Bad Bunny). And now, you can see a photo from set, featuring Sandler as Happy Gilmore facing down none other than Shooter McGavin (McDonald). Want more? Watch the special teaser below, which offers season’s greetings, a happy new year, and Happy Gilmore himself, back on the green in his Timberlands and a hockey jersey. The clip also features glimpses of Bowen and McDonald, as well as new faces, like Travis Kelce, who says what we’re all thinking: “It’s great to see you back, Mr. Gilmore.” Back in September, Sandler posted an Easter egg teasing his character’s upcoming antics and showcasing the same Bruins jersey seen in the clip above. Sandler fans have been eager for all updates on the long-awaited sequel. Characters from Happy Gilmore have even popped up in Jack and Jill, Little Nicky, and Hubie Halloween. Now, Sandler’s hotheaded driver is finally coming back, alongside his entire team. Original Happy Gilmore co-writer Tim Herlihy is returning to write Happy Gilmore 2, Happy Gilmore director Dennis Dugan will serve as executive producer, and Happy Gilmore producers Jack Giarraputo and Robert Simonds also produce. Murder Mystery director Kyle Newacheck will also reunite with Sandler to direct the sequel. Read on for more information while we wait for Happy to make his grand comeback to the world of golf. The Happy Gilmore 2 cast includes: At the end of the original Happy Gilmore, Sandler’s titular character was finally at rest after a long, strenuous season of golf (and one knockdown brawl with The Price Is Right’s Bob Barker). On a mission to raise enough money to pay the IRS for his grandmother’s years of delinquent back taxes (oops), the failed hockey player took his skills on the road as the most unorthodox golf player the Tour Championship had ever seen. Along the way, Happy made allies (the late, great Carl Weathers’ one-handed Chubbs Petersen and a homeless caddy played by Allen Covert) and enemies (Christopher McDonald’s arrogant Shooter McGavin and the aforementioned Bob Barker), but he ultimately triumphed in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. He showed the golf snobs who’s boss, saved his grandmother’s house, and returned home at last. It’s currently unclear how the film will resurrect Gilmore’s golf career, but one thing’s for sure: In the real world, at least, Happy Gilmore is a legend. Even the world’s best golfers agree. Stay tuned for more as we follow Happy Gilmore’s triumphant return to the world of sports. Happy Gilmore returns!",

                "title": "Football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as \"football codes\". There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football.[5][6] The expansion and cultural power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, the Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9] The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.[10] Common rules among the sports include:[11] In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking.[10] In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players offside, and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a crossbar between the goalposts. There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word \"football\". It is widely assumed that the word \"football\" (or the phrase \"foot ball\") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.[13] There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe that were played on foot.[14] There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation. The Chinese competitive game cuju is an early type of ball game where feet were used, in some aspects resembling modern association football. It was possibly played around the Han dynasty and early Qin dynasty, based on an attestation in a military manual from around the second to third centuries BC.[15][16][17] In one version, gameplay consisted of players passing the ball between teammates without allowing it to touch the ground (much like keepie uppie). In its competitive version, two teams had to pass the ball without it falling, before kicking the ball through a circular hole placed in the middle of the pitch. Unlike association football, the two teams did not interact with each other but instead stayed on opposite sides of the pitch.[18] Cuju has been cited by FIFA as the earliest form of football.[4] The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (蹴鞠), and was developed during the Asuka period.[19] This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from about 600 AD. In kemari, several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground. The Silk Road facilitated the transmission of cuju, especially the game popular in the Tang dynasty, the period when the inflatable ball was invented and replaced the stuffed ball.[20] The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as ἐπίσκυρος (episkyros)[21][22] or φαινίνδα (phaininda),[23] which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215 AD). These games appear to have resembled rugby football.[24][25][26][27][28] The Roman politician Cicero (106–43 BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, the follis.[29][30] Episkyros is described as an early form of football by FIFA.[31] There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John Davis went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit in Greenland.[32] There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal. In 1610, William Strachey, a colonist at Jamestown, Virginia recorded a game played by Native Americans, called Pahsaheman.[citation needed] Pasuckuakohowog, a game similar to modern-day association football played amongst Amerindians, was also reported as early as the 17th century. Games played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by indigenous peoples are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball, and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially the Iroquois Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, lacrosse (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of \"football\".[citation needed] On the Australian continent several tribes of indigenous people played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as Marn Grook (Djab Wurrung for \"game ball\"). The earliest historical account is an anecdote from the 1878 book by Robert Brough-Smyth, The Aborigines of Victoria, in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in Victoria, Australia, that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: \"Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a possum and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it.\" Some historians have theorised that Marn Grook was one of the origins of Australian rules football. The Māori in New Zealand played a game called Kī-o-rahi consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target.[citation needed] These games and others may well go far back into antiquity. However, the main sources of modern football codes appear to lie in western Europe, especially England. Mahmud al-Kashgari in his Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk, described a game called tepuk among Turks in Central Asia. In the game, people try to attack each other's castle by kicking a ball made of sheep leather.[33] The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in England. An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, attributed to Nennius, which describes \"a party of boys ... playing at ball\".[34] References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks,[35] date from the 12th century.[36] The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as \"mob football\", would be played in towns or between neighbouring villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash en masse,[37] struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal's bladder[38] to particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes.[39] The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter,[38] and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns (see below). The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by William FitzStephen in about 1174–1183. He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday: After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game. The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents.[40] Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of \"ball play\" or \"playing at ball\". This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked. An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at Ulgham, Northumberland, England: \"Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David\".[41] Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a \"football game\" at Newcastle, County Down being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard.[42] Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at Shouldham, Norfolk, England: \"[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself\".[41] In 1314, Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: \"[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [rageries de grosses pelotes de pee][43] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future.\" This is the earliest reference to football. In 1363, King Edward III of England issued a proclamation banning \"...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games\",[44] showing that \"football\" – whatever its exact form in this case – was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, such as handball. A game known as \"football\" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906. There is evidence for schoolboys playing a \"football\" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word \"pass\" in the most recent translation is derived from \"huc percute\" (strike it here) and later \"repercute pilam\" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as \"goal\" is \"metum\", literally meaning the \"pillar at each end of the circus course\" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to \"get hold of the ball before [another player] does\" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation \"Throw yourself against him\" (Age, objice te illi). King Henry IV of England also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word \"football\", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for \"foteball\".[41][45] There is also an account in Latin from the end of the 15th century of football being played at Caunton, Nottinghamshire. This is the first description of a \"kicking game\" and the first description of dribbling: \"[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions.\" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: \"[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.[41] Other firsts in the medieval and early modern eras: In the 16th century, the city of Florence celebrated the period between Epiphany and Lent by playing a game which today is known as \"calcio storico\" (\"historic kickball\") in the Piazza Santa Croce.[49] The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football. For example, calcio players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino. This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930). There have been many attempts to ban football, from the Middle Ages through to the modern day. The first such law was passed in England in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667.[50]: 6 Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s. Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world. American football also faced pressures to ban the sport. The game played in the 19th century resembled mob football that developed in medieval Europe, including a version popular on university campuses known as old division football, and several municipalities banned its play in the mid-19th century.[51][52] By the 20th century, the game had evolved to a more rugby style game. In 1905, there were calls to ban American football in the U.S. due to its violence; a meeting that year was hosted by American president Theodore Roosevelt led to sweeping rules changes that caused the sport to diverge significantly from its rugby roots to become more like the sport as it is played today.[53] While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its public schools (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its \"mob\" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students, and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between \"kicking\" and \"running\" (or \"carrying\") games first became clear. The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools – mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes – comes from the Vulgaria by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at Eton and Winchester colleges and his Latin textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase \"We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde\".[54] Richard Mulcaster, a student at Eton College in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as \"the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football\".[55] Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (\"sides\" and \"parties\"), positions (\"standings\"), a referee (\"judge over the parties\") and a coach \"(trayning maister)\". Mulcaster's \"footeball\" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football: [s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.[56] In 1633, David Wedderburn, a teacher from Aberdeen, mentioned elements of modern football games in a short Latin textbook called Vocabula. Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as \"keeping goal\" and makes an allusion to passing the ball (\"strike it here\"). There is a reference to \"get hold of the ball\", suggesting that some handling was allowed. It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players (\"drive that man back\").[57] A more detailed description of football is given in Francis Willughby's Book of Games, written in about 1660.[58] Willughby, who had studied at Bishop Vesey's Grammar School, Sutton Coldfield, is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field: \"a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals.\" His book includes a diagram illustrating a football field. He also mentions tactics (\"leaving some of their best players to guard the goal\"); scoring (\"they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win\") and the way teams were selected (\"the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness\"). He is the first to describe a \"law\" of football: \"they must not strike [an opponent's leg] higher than the ball\".[59][60] English public schools were the first to codify football games. In particular, they devised the first offside rules, during the late 18th century.[61] In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were \"off their side\" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a scrum or similar formation. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, Rugby, Harrow and Cheltenham, during between 1810 and 1850.[61] The first known codes – in the sense of a set of rules – were those of Eton in 1815[62] and Aldenham in 1825.[62]) During the early 19th century, most working-class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many children were part of the labour force. Feast day football played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules. Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, Marlborough and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, Westminster and Charterhouse). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school cloisters, making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.[citation needed] William Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have \"with a fine disregard for the rules of football, as played in his time [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game.\" in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern association football, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,[63] the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was running forward with it as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards. The boom in rail transport in Britain during the 1840s meant that people were able to travel farther and with less inconvenience than they ever had before. Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two-halves, one half played by the rules of the host \"home\" school, and the other half by the visiting \"away\" school. The modern rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century. This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first lawnmower in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.[64] Apart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see § British schools). Public schools' dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after the Factory Act 1850, which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children. Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day. From 1850, they could not work before 6 a.m. (7 a.m. in winter) or after 6 p.m. on weekdays (7 p.m. in winter); on Saturdays they had to cease work at 2 pm. These changes meant that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football. The earliest known matches between public schools are as follows: Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example London's Gymnastic Society which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.[68][66] The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called \"The Foot-Ball Club\" who were located in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the period 1824–41.[69][70] The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.[70] In 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school. These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football.[71] This further assisted the spread of the Rugby game. The earliest known matches involving non-public school clubs or institutions are as follows: One of the longest running football fixture is the Cordner-Eggleston Cup, contested between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College, Melbourne every year since 1858. It is believed by many to also be the first match of Australian rules football, although it was played under experimental rules in its first year. The first football trophy tournament was the Caledonian Challenge Cup, donated by the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne, played in 1861 under the Melbourne Rules.[83] The oldest football league is a rugby football competition, the United Hospitals Challenge Cup (1874), while the oldest rugby trophy is the Yorkshire Cup, contested since 1878. The South Australian Football Association (30 April 1877) is the oldest surviving Australian rules football competition. The oldest surviving soccer trophy is the Youdan Cup (1867) and the oldest national football competition is the English FA Cup (1871). The Football League (1888) is recognised as the longest running association football league. The first international Rugby football match took place between Scotland and England on 27 March 1871 at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh. The first international Association football match officially took place between sides representing England and Scotland on 30 November 1872 at Hamilton Crescent, the West of Scotland Cricket Club's ground in Partick, Glasgow under the authority of the FA. In Europe, early footballs were made out of animal bladders, more specifically pig's bladders, which were inflated. Later leather coverings were introduced to allow the balls to keep their shape.[84] However, in 1851, Richard Lindon and William Gilbert, both shoemakers from the town of Rugby (near the school), exhibited both round and oval-shaped balls at the Great Exhibition in London. Richard Lindon's wife is said to have died of lung disease caused by blowing up pig's bladders.[a] Lindon also won medals for the invention of the \"Rubber inflatable Bladder\" and the \"Brass Hand Pump\". In 1855, the U.S. inventor Charles Goodyear – who had patented vulcanised rubber – exhibited a spherical football, with an exterior of vulcanised rubber panels, at the Paris Exhibition Universelle. The ball was to prove popular in early forms of football in the U.S.[85] The iconic ball with a regular pattern of hexagons and pentagons (see truncated icosahedron) did not become popular until the 1960s, and was first used in the World Cup in 1970. The earliest reference to a game of football involving players passing the ball and attempting to score past a goalkeeper was written in 1633 by David Wedderburn, a poet and teacher in Aberdeen, Scotland.[86] Nevertheless, the original text does not state whether the allusion to passing as 'kick the ball back' ('repercute pilam') was in a forward or backward direction or between members of the same opposing teams (as was usual at this time).[87] \"Scientific\" football is first recorded in 1839 from Lancashire[88] and in the modern game in rugby football from 1862[89] and from Sheffield FC as early as 1865.[90][91] The first side to play a passing combination game was the Royal Engineers AFC in 1869/70.[92][93] By 1869 they were \"work[ing] well together\", \"backing up\" and benefiting from \"cooperation\".[94] By 1870 the Engineers were passing the ball: \"Lieut. Creswell, who having brought the ball up the side then kicked it into the middle to another of his side, who kicked it through the posts the minute before time was called\".[95] Passing was a regular feature of their style.[96] By early 1872 the Engineers were the first football team renowned for \"play[ing] beautifully together\".[97] A double pass is first reported from Derby school against Nottingham Forest in March 1872, the first of which is irrefutably a short pass: \"Mr Absey dribbling the ball half the length of the field delivered it to Wallis, who kicking it cleverly in front of the goal, sent it to the captain who drove it at once between the Nottingham posts\".[98] The first side to have perfected the modern formation was Cambridge University AFC;[99][100][101] they also introduced the 2–3–5 \"pyramid\" formation.[102][103] Rugby football was thought to have been started about 1845 at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, England although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times. In Britain, by 1870, there were 49 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game.[104] There were also \"rugby\" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the Rugby Football Union (RFU). The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871.[105] These rules allowed passing the ball. They also included the try, where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest. Regardless of any form of football, the first international match between the national team of England and Scotland took place at Raeburn Place on 27 March 1871. Rugby football split into Rugby union, Rugby league, American football, and Canadian football. Tom Wills played Rugby football in England before founding Australian rules football. During the nineteenth century, several codifications of the rules of football were made at the University of Cambridge, in order to enable students from different public schools to play each other. The Cambridge Rules of 1863 influenced the decision of the Football Association to ban Rugby-style carrying of the ball in its own first set of laws.[106] By the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football. Sheffield Football Club, founded in 1857 in the English city of Sheffield by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football.[107] However, the club initially played its own code of football: the Sheffield rules. The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an offside rule. The code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included free kicks, corner kicks, handball, throw-ins and the crossbar.[108] By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England. At this time, a series of rule changes by both the London and Sheffield FAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in 1877. There is archival evidence of \"foot-ball\" games being played in various parts of Australia throughout the first half of the 19th century. The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in Melbourne, the capital city of Victoria. In July 1858, Tom Wills, an Australian-born cricketer educated at Rugby School in England, wrote a letter to Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle, calling for a \"foot-ball club\" with a \"code of laws\" to keep cricketers fit during winter.[109] This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football. Through publicity and personal contacts Wills was able to co-ordinate football matches in Melbourne that experimented with various rules,[110] the first of which was played on 31 July 1858. One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College. Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity. Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the Melbourne Football Club (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859. Club members Wills, William Hammersley, J. B. Thompson and Thomas H. Smith met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various rugby football rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. H. C. A. Harrison, a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted \"a game of our own\".[111] The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the mark, free kick, tackling, lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for throwing the ball. The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the Geelong Football Club's rules, making the game then known as \"Victorian Rules\" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured bouncing the ball while running and spectacular high marking. The game spread quickly to other Australian colonies. Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in other parts of the world, and the Australian Football League emerged as the dominant professional competition. During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at Uppingham School, and he issued his own rules of what he called \"The Simplest Game\" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863, another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster. At the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the London Metropolitan area met for the inaugural meeting of the Football Association (FA). The aim of the association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and hacking (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows: IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run. X. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.[112] At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed. Most of the delegates supported this, but F. M. Campbell, the representative from Blackheath and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: \"hacking is the true football\". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the \"Laws of the Game\", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as association football. The term \"soccer\", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an Oxford University abbreviation of \"association\".[113] The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a mark, which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a free kick at goal, from 15 yards (13.5 metres) in front of the goal line. As was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century, North American schools and universities played their own local games, between sides made up of students. For example, students at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire played a game called Old division football, a variant of the association football codes, as early as the 1820s.[52] They remained largely \"mob football\" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, violence and injury were common.[51] The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. Yale University, under pressure from the city of New Haven, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while Harvard University followed suit in 1861.[51] In its place, two general types of football evolved: \"kicking\" games and \"running\" (or \"carrying\") games. A hybrid of the two, known as the \"Boston game\", was played by a group known as the Oneida Football Club. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal football club in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the Boston game on Boston Common.[51][114] The game began to return to American college campuses by the late 1860s. The universities of Yale, Princeton (then known as the College of New Jersey), Rutgers, and Brown all began playing \"kicking\" games during this time. In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the English Football Association.[51] In Canada, the first documented football match was a practice game played on 9 November 1861, at University College, University of Toronto (approximately 400 yards west of Queen's Park). One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school.[116] In 1864, at Trinity College, Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland, Frederick A. Bethune, and Christopher Gwynn, one of the founders of Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules based on rugby football.[116] A \"running game\", resembling rugby football, was then taken up by the Montreal Football Club in Canada in 1868.[117] On 6 November 1869, Rutgers faced Princeton in a game that was played with a round ball and, like all early games, used improvised rules. It is usually regarded as the first game of American intercollegiate football.[51][118] Modern North American football grew out of a match between McGill University of Montreal and Harvard University in 1874. During the game, the two teams alternated between the rugby-based rules used by McGill and the Boston Game rules used by Harvard.[119][120][121] Within a few years, Harvard had both adopted McGill's rules and persuaded other U.S. university teams to do the same. On 23 November 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit Convention in Springfield, Massachusetts, agreeing to adopt most of the Rugby Football Union rules, with some variations.[122] In 1880, Yale coach Walter Camp, who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations. Camp's two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby were replacing the scrummage with the line of scrimmage and the establishment of the down-and-distance rules.[122] American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death.[123] This led U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on 9 October 1905, urging them to make drastic changes.[124] One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass. Though it was underutilised for years, this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.[125] Over the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. In 1903, the Ontario Rugby Football Union adopted the Burnside rules, which implemented the line of scrimmage and down-and-distance system from American football, among others.[126] Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in 1929.[127] American and Canadian football remain different codes, stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not. In the mid-19th century, various traditional football games, referred to collectively as caid, remained popular in Ireland, especially in County Kerry. One observer, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of caid during this period: the \"field game\" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic \"cross-country game\" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary. \"Wrestling\", \"holding\" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed. By the 1870s, rugby and association football had started to become popular in Ireland. Trinity College Dublin was an early stronghold of rugby (see the Developments in the 1850s section above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of caid had begun to give way to a \"rough-and-tumble game\" which allowed tripping. There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as hurling and to reject imported games like rugby and association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by Maurice Davin and published in the United Ireland magazine on 7 February 1887.[128] Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football). The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) was founded in 1886,[129] but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. Professionalism had already begun to creep into the various codes of football. In England, by the 1890s, a long-standing Rugby Football Union ban on professional players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport. The demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better \"spectator\" sport. Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the line-out. This was followed by the replacement of the ruck with the \"play-the-ball ruck\", which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled. Mauls were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck. The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby League, the first time the name rugby league was used officially in England. Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as rugby union. The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904.[130] Its first president was Robert Guérin.[130] The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries. Rugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players. In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional rugby leagues were launched in Australia the following year. However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match. This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in Bordeaux. During the second half of the 20th century, the rules changed further. In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of downs: a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately). The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the six tackle rule. With the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five-metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10 metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes. The laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league. In particular, goals from marks were abolished, kicks directly into touch from outside the 22-metre line were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive ruck or maul, and the lifting of players in line-outs was legalised. In 1995, rugby union became an \"open\" game, that is one which allowed professional players.[131] Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared – and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification – the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future. The word football, when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this, much controversy has occurred over the term football, primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the English-speaking world. Most often, the word football is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region (which is association football in most countries). So, effectively, what the word football means usually depends on where one says it. In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as football, while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, football historically referred to rugby union, but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word football in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league, depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the Barassi Line). In francophone Quebec, where Canadian football is more popular, the Canadian code is known as le football while American football is known as le football américain and association football is known as le soccer.[132] Of the 45 national FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) affiliates in which English is an official or primary language, most currently use Football in their organisations' official names; the FIFA affiliates in Canada and the United States use Soccer in their names. A few FIFA affiliates have recently \"normalised\" to using Football, including: Several of the football codes are the most popular team sports in the world.[9] Globally, association football is played by over 250 million players in over 200 nations,[137] and has the highest television audience in sport,[138] making it the most popular in the world.[139] American football, with 1.1 million high school football players and nearly 70,000 college football players, is the most popular sport in the United States,[140][141] with the annual Super Bowl game accounting for nine of the top ten of the most watched broadcasts in U.S. television history.[142] The NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world and has the highest revenue[143] out of any single professional sports league.[144] Thus, the best association football and American football players are among the highest paid athletes in the world.[145][146][147] Australian rules football has the highest spectator attendance of all sports in Australia.[148][149] Similarly, Gaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance,[150] and the All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event of that nation's sporting year.[151] Rugby union is the most popular sport in New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji.[152] It is also the fastest growing sport in the U.S.,[153][154][155][156] with college rugby being the fastest growing[clarification needed][157][158] college sport in that country.[159][dubious – discuss] 20.75–21.25 inches (52.7–54.0 cm) (transversal) 20–21 inches (51–53 cm) (transversal) 20.75–21.375 inches (52.71–54.29 cm) (transversal) 58 - 62 centimeters (circular) 54.5 -55.5 centimeters (circular) 6.25–6.75 inches (15.9–17.1 cm) (transversal) 6.25–6.75 inches (15.9–17.1 cm) (transversal) These codes have in common the prohibition of the use of hands (by all players except the goalkeeper, though outfield players can \"throw-in\" the ball when it goes out of play), unlike other codes where carrying or handling the ball by all players is allowed The hockey game bandy has rules partly based on the association football rules and is sometimes nicknamed as 'winter football'. There are also motorsport variations of the game. These codes have in common the ability of players to carry the ball with their hands, and to throw it to teammates, unlike association football where the use of hands during play is prohibited by anyone except the goalkeeper. They also feature various methods of scoring based upon whether the ball is carried into the goal area, or kicked above the goalposts. These codes have in common the absence of an offside rule, the prohibition of continuous carrying of the ball (requiring a periodic bounce or solo (toe-kick), depending on the code) while running, handpassing by punching or tapping the ball rather than throwing it, and other traditions.

Football, also called association football or soccer, is a game involving two teams of 11 players who try to maneuver the ball into the other team’s goal without using their hands or arms. The team that scores more goals wins. Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators. Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Though “folk football” had been played since medieval times with varying rules, the game began to be standardized when it was taken up as a winter game at public schools. The Football Association, formed in 1863, codified the rules of the game and hosted the first cup competition between regional football clubs in Britain. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA, estimated that at the turn of the 21st century there were approximately 250 million football players worldwide. The World Cup is football’s premier tournament. It is a quadrennial tournament and is likely the most popular sporting event in the world, drawing billions of television viewers every tournament. football, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal. Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The team that scores more goals wins. Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators. Simple in its principal rules and essential equipment, the sport can be played almost anywhere, from official football playing fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets, school playgrounds, parks, or beaches. Football’s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), estimated that at the turn of the 21st century there were approximately 250 million football players and over 1.3 billion people “interested” in football; in 2010 a combined television audience of more than 26 billion watched football’s premier tournament, the quadrennial monthlong World Cup finals. For a history of the origins of football sport, see football. Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization, which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the game’s status from the early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester College, Charterhouse, and Eton College. Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. The variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing except with former schoolmates. As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, whose students joined most public schools in 1848 in adopting these “Cambridge rules,” which were further spread by Cambridge graduates who formed football clubs. In 1863 a series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan London and surrounding counties produced the printed rules of football, which prohibited the carrying of the ball. Thus, the “handling” game of rugby remained outside the newly formed Football Association (FA). Indeed, by 1870 all handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited by the FA. The new rules were not universally accepted in Britain, however; many clubs retained their own rules, especially in and around Sheffield. Although this northern English city was the home of the first provincial club to join the FA, in 1867 it also gave birth to the Sheffield Football Association, the forerunner of later county associations. Sheffield and London clubs played two matches against each other in 1866, and a year later a match pitting a club from Middlesex against one from Kent and Surrey was played under the revised rules. In 1871 15 FA clubs accepted an invitation to enter a cup competition and to contribute to the purchase of a trophy. By 1877 the associations of Great Britain had agreed upon a uniform code, 43 clubs were in competition, and the London clubs’ initial dominance had diminished.",
