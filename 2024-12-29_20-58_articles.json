                "content": "The Gonzaga Bulldogs are an intercollegiate men's basketball program representing Gonzaga University. The school competes in the West Coast Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Gonzaga Bulldogs play home basketball games at the McCarthey Athletic Center in Spokane, Washington, on the university campus. Gonzaga has had 15 of its players receive the WCC Player of the Year award,[2] and two players, Frank Burgess in 1961 with 32.4 points per game, and Adam Morrison in 2006 with 28.1 points per game, have led the nation in scoring. Morrison was named the Co-National Player of the year for the 2005–06 season. Since the mid-1990s, Gonzaga has established itself as a major basketball power in a mid-major conference.[a] They have been to every NCAA tournament held since 1999, a year in which they made a Cinderella run to the Elite Eight, and have appeared in every final AP poll since the 2008–09 season. Gonzaga had an active weekly poll streak of 143 weeks, starting from the 2016–17 season and ending on January 15, 2024, being tied for the tenth longest streak in Division I history.[4] They have also appeared in all but one WCC conference title game since 1995, and in every conference title game since 1998, winning 16 of them. This culminated in 2016–17, when the Bulldogs went to their first Final Four in school history, advancing to the national championship game, where they lost to North Carolina. They returned to the Final Four in 2021, losing in the national championship game to Baylor. Gonzaga introduced a basketball program during the 1907–08 basketball season and, although the season wasn't an official one, they achieved a record of 9–2 (.818) under head coach George Varnell.[5] In the 1908–09 season, Varnell became the first official coach for Gonzaga, earning a 10–2 (.833) record. William Mulligan coached the following season and acquired an 11–3 (.786) record.[6] Frank McKevitt took over for Mulligan during the 1910–11 basketball season, acquiring an 8–1 (.889) record.[6] From 1944 to 1994, the Bulldogs compiled a record of 628–531 (.542), earning regular season titles in 1965–66 and 1966–67 (Big Sky) under Hank Anderson,[7][8] and in 1993–94 (WCC) under Dan Fitzgerald.[9][10] That season also saw the team qualify for its first postseason tournament, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT),[11][12][13][14] while being led by forward Jeff Brown, who was the WCC Player of the Year, and point guard Geoff Goss, who was made the All-WCC First Team that season. In the following season, the fourth-seeded Bulldogs won the WCC tournament to secure their first appearance in the NCAA tournament.[15][16][17][18][19] In 1997, Gonzaga assistant coach Dan Monson, the son of veteran Oregon and Idaho head coach Don Monson, became the head coach of Gonzaga as Fitzgerald wanted to focus on his athletic director's duties.[20] During his first season, Monson led the Zags to a 24–10 record and a WCC regular season title, which was not enough to land an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament.[20] They earned a bid into the NIT and beat Wyoming 69–55 in the first round in Laramie,[21] but fell at Hawai'i 78–70 in the second round.[22][23][24] During the 1998–99 season, the Bulldogs had a 28–7 record after winning the conference tournament, and were seeded tenth in the West regional of the NCAA tournament.[25] In the tournament's \"Cinderella\" run and Gonzaga's \"coming out party\" (Gonzaga has made the NCAA tournament each year since) the Zags beat seventh-seeded Minnesota 75–63 in the first round in Seattle and followed it with an 82–74 win over second-seeded Stanford to advance to the regional semifinals in Phoenix.[26] Gonzaga beat Florida 73–72 to advance to the regional finals after Casey Calvary tipped in the winning basket with four seconds remaining.[20] They trailed eventual national champion UConn by one point with a minute remaining before losing 67–62 in the regional finals.[27] After Monson departed for Minnesota that summer,[28][29] assistant coach Mark Few was promoted to head coach on July 26, 1999.[30][31] In his inaugural season, Few led the Zags to a 26–9 record, which was highlighted by winning the WCC tournament and advancing to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament with wins over Louisville and St. John's in Tucson, Arizona.[32] In the 2000–01 season, the Bulldogs faced a tough schedule highlighted by games against Arizona, Washington, Florida, and New Mexico.[33] Despite starting the season 5–1, the Zags dropped four of their next five games.[34] Gonzaga rebounded and finished the regular season 15–6[34] before winning their third consecutive WCC tournament title.[35] The win gave the Bulldogs an automatic bid into the NCAA tournament, where they were seeded twelfth in the South regional.[36] In the first round in Memphis against fifth-seeded Virginia, Casey Calvary put back a blocked shot with nine seconds left to give the Zags an 86–85 victory.[37] Gonzaga then beat 13th-seeded Indiana State 85–68 in the second round to advance to their third consecutive Sweet 16.[38] In Atlanta, the Zags lost to defending national champion Michigan State 77–62 and finished the season with a 26–7 record.[39] Prior to the 2001–02 season, the Bulldogs were unanimously favored to win the WCC title in the WCC preseason coaches poll.[40] Few led the Zags to a share of the WCC regular season title, as Pepperdine also had a 13–1 conference record.[41] The Bulldogs would avenge their only conference loss of the season by defeating Pepperdine 96–90 for their fourth straight WCC tournament title.[42] The win gave the Zags an automatic bid as a six-seed in the NCAA tournament, opening against 11th-seeded Wyoming.[43] Despite beating the Cowboys four years earlier in the NIT,[43] they lost 73–66, marking the first time the Zags lost in the first round of the tournament under Mark Few.[44][45] In the 2002–03 season, Few led the Bulldogs to their fifth regular season title in six years with a 12–2 conference record.[46] Despite this, Gonzaga lost to San Diego in the WCC tournament championship game 72–63,[47] marking the first time the Zags had lost in the championship game in four years.[48] Gonzaga garnered a nine-seed in the 2003 NCAA tournament, where they beat Cincinnati 74–69 to advance to the second round of the tournament for the fourth time in five years.[49] The Bulldogs would go on to lose to Arizona 96–95 in double overtime to finish 24–9.[50][51] The 2003–04 season marked the first time that the team participated in the annual Battle in Seattle game.[52] Gonzaga faced third-ranked Missouri, who was the highest-ranked regular season opponent that the Zags had played against up to that point; they would go on to win the game in an 87–80 overtime victory.[53] This season marked the last time Gonzaga would play home games in the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre; their last game in the building took place February 28, 2004, where they beat Santa Clara 80–64.[54] The win gave the Bulldogs their first undefeated run through the WCC in school history with a 14–0 conference record.[54] Gonzaga would go on to receive an automatic bid into the 2004 NCAA tournament with a two-seed, which was the highest seed they had received in school history in seven tournament appearances.[55] The Bulldogs would go on to beat 15th-seeded Valparaiso 76–49[56] before being upset in the second round by tenth-seeded Nevada 91–72, where they finished the season 28–3.[57] Gonzaga opened up the 2004–05 season with a home game against Portland State in the new 6,000-seat McCarthey Athletic Center on November 19, 2004.[58] Despite losing five seniors, including second-round NBA draft pick Blake Stepp,[59] Few was still able to lead the Zags to their ninth regular season title since 1994 with a 12–2 conference record.[60] The Bulldogs would go on to win their second straight WCC Tournament title,[61] giving them an automatic bid into the 2005 NCAA tournament as a three-seed.[62] The Zags beat 14th-seeded Winthrop 74–64[63] before falling to Texas Tech 71–69 in the second round, where they ended the season with a 26–5 record.[64] Before the 2005–06 season got underway, Gonzaga junior Adam Morrison became the first player in team history to be named to the preseason Associated Press All-America team.[65] The Zags also received their highest preseason ranking in program history at number seven in the USA Today/ESPN preseason poll.[66] The Bulldogs captured their third straight WCC Tournament title when they beat Loyola Marymount 68–67 in the championship game.[67] They received an automatic bid into the 2006 NCAA tournament as a three-seed, where they beat Xavier 79–75 in the first round.[68] The Zags would go on to beat Indiana Hoosiers 90–80,[69] where they would advance to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2001.[45] Despite being ahead by as many as 17 points, the Bulldogs ended their season in the Sweet 16 by losing to UCLA 73–71, finishing 29–4.[70][71] The 2006–07 season marked the first time that the Zags suffered at least ten losses in a season since the 1997–98 season.[72] Despite this, Few still led the Bulldogs to their seventh straight regular season title with a conference record of 11–3.[73] Gonzaga would go on to win the WCC Tournament for the fourth year in a row, being the only Division I school to do so that year.[74] They received an automatic bid into the 2007 NCAA tournament, where they were given a 10-seed.[75] The Zags would end their season by losing in the opening round for the first time since 2001, as Indiana beat Gonzaga 70–57.[76] In 2007–08 the Bulldogs went 25–8, but lost in the Round of 64 as a #7 seed to a Davidson team that went to the Elite Eight as a #10 seed. The 2008–09 team won both the WCC Regular Season Championship and the WCC Tournament Championship. Entering the NCAA tournament as a #4 seed, the team reached the Sweet Sixteen, before losing to eventual NCAA Champions North Carolina. For the next five seasons, the team advanced to the NCAA tournament, but fell in the Round of 32 each time. The 2012–13 team became the first Gonzaga squad to be ranked as the #1 team in the country and was awarded as a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament for the first time. The Zags also won over 30 games for the first time in program history with a 32–3 overall record. The 2014–15 team advanced all the way to the Elite Eight before losing to eventual national champion Duke. This was the first time since 1999 that Gonzaga had advanced to the Elite Eight. Gonzaga also won the WCC regular-season and tournament championships for the third consecutive season. The 2014–15 also set the school record for wins in a single season with 35. The 2015–16 team suffered 4 losses at home and nearly missed the NCAA tournament entirely, but shared the WCC regular-season crown with Saint Mary's and then won the WCC Tournament. The Zags were awarded a #11 seed and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, dismantling #6 seed Seton Hall and #3 seed Utah, before falling to Syracuse by three points. The 2016–17 team won its first 29 games, setting a new school record for consecutive games won, before falling to WCC rival BYU. The Zags made the NCAA tournament as a #1 seed and advanced to the school's first-ever championship game, with wins over South Dakota State, Northwestern, West Virginia, Xavier, and South Carolina. The Zags set a new school record for wins in a single season with 37 and also had the most wins of any team that season. The 2017–18 team also enjoyed success. Despite what was considered a \"rebuilding year\" after the Loss of Karnowski, Williams-Goss, Mathews and Collins among others (causing the Bulldogs to not be picked to win the West Coast Conference), the team won the WCC regular season title outright before winning the WCC tournament. In the NCAA tournament, the Bulldogs advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the fourth consecutive year. They were ultimately bounced by Florida State, and finished the season at 32–5. Near the end of that season, Gonzaga considered a potential move to the Mountain West Conference (MW) after nearly 40 years as a WCC member. When asked by a reporter from the San Diego Union-Tribune about rumored MW expansion plans, MW commissioner Craig Thompson confirmed that six schools had been considered, with Gonzaga being the only school he specifically named.[77] A later Union-Tribune report indicated that talks were advanced enough that the conference's presidents planned a vote on an invitation to Gonzaga during the MW men's and women's basketball tournaments in Las Vegas, but decided to delay the vote until after the Final Four.[78] The vote ultimately never took place, as Gonzaga athletic director Mike Roth notified both conferences during the Final Four that the school would remain in the WCC for the immediate future.[79] In the 2018 Maui Invitational Final on November 21, 2018 #3 Gonzaga defeated #1 Duke 89–87 for their first win over Duke and first win over a number 1 ranked team in team history.[80] The 2020–21 season would be a historic year for the team, going 26–0 in the regular season and being the final undefeated team in the country. They would earn the #1 overall seed in the tournament and cruise to the national championship game over Norfolk State, Oklahoma, Creighton, USC, and UCLA. In the national championship, their undefeated season came to an end, losing to Baylor 86–70. Basketball started at Gonzaga in February 1905 after a gymnasium was put in as an addition to the east end of the new college building that was being built.[81] In 1955, the basketball team moved from the gymnasium, nicknamed \"the cave\",[82] and began to play at the newly constructed Spokane Coliseum.[83] On June 3, 1964, construction began for a new 3,800-seat athletic facility called the John F. Kennedy Memorial Pavilion.[82] To raise money for the $1.1 million project, Gonzaga's student body had each student pay $10 per semester until $500,000 was raised. The university matched that amount, while the remaining $100,000 came from contributions.[82] Gonzaga's first game in the pavilion took place on December 3, 1965, against Washington State, who beat the Bulldogs 106–78.[84][85] In 1986, the facility was renamed the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre after an eponymous donor donated $4.5 million to finance a remodel of the arena that could hold up to 4,000 people.[86][87] After competing for over 39 years in the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre,[88] Gonzaga trustees approved construction for a new 6,000-seat arena on April 11, 2003.[89] The McCarthey Athletic Center was named after Gonzaga trustee Philip G. McCarthey and Gonzaga regent Thomas K. McCarthey, who contributed a significant portion of the funds needed to build the arena.[90] The first official game took place on November 19, 2004, against Portland State, whom the Zags would beat 98–80 in front of a sold-out crowd.[58][91] The Bulldogs opened the arena with a 38-game winning streak, which was the nation's longest active winning streak at the time.[92] When combined with 12 wins at the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, the overall home-game winning streak ended at 50 games with a loss to the Santa Clara on February 12, 2007.[92] In February 2015, BYU snapped Gonzaga's 41-game home winning streak in the McCarthey Athletic Center, which was also the longest active home winning streak in the NCAA at the time.[93] Through February 6, 2020, the Zags are 223–15 (.937) in the McCarthey Athletic Center, which includes a 105–8 (.929) record in non-conference games, a 116–7 (.943) record in conference games, and a 2–0 (1.000) record in the WCC Tournament.[94][95] On December 13, 2003, Gonzaga participated in a neutral court game at KeyArena that would later become an annual event known as the Battle in Seattle.[52] The event marked the first time that a regular season Gonzaga basketball game was broadcast nationally on CBS Sports, as Craig Bolerjack called the action while Clark Kellogg provided commentary.[96] Ranked third in the country, Missouri was the highest ranked regular season opponent that Gonzaga had faced up to that point; the Bulldogs would go on to beat the Tigers 87–80 in overtime.[53] The 2005 Battle in Seattle is remembered for Adam Morrison's game-winning shot against Oklahoma State that sealed a 64–62 victory for the Bulldogs.[97] Gus Johnson's call at the end of the game with Bill Raftery[98] was ranked fourth on a list of 25 of his most \"over-the-top calls\" by Complex.[99] Johnson's call at the end of the game: Zags no timeouts. They gotta hurry. But here comes the All-America. Morrison... six... fires... OH... HE BANKED IN A THREE! [Raftery shouts \"OH!\"] OH... WOW... [Raftery: ONIONS!] WHAT A GAME... [Raftery shouts \"OH!\" again] LARRY BIRD... BABY... [Raftery makes an unintelligible sound...] WHOA! [Raftery laughs in the background... Replay is shown as Raftery says, \"Look at the clock. And when you're sleepless in Seattle, why not get a little kiss... Gus... Oh! Major onions... all on his own! Look at the contesting... oh, what a smooch... woo... wow!\"] Crunch time you go to your best player. [Raftery says, \"This kid is extraordinary... and watch the contesting Gus, it's not like he's standing still. Two defenders, knowing... look at that.] Adam Morrison refusing to let his team lose.[99] In 2008, the game broke the state attendance record for a regular season college basketball game, as a sold-out crowd of 16,763 watched the Bulldogs play Connecticut.[100] In the 2016–17 season, Gonzaga failed to schedule the Battle in Seattle, ending an annual tradition of participating in the event every December for 13 consecutive years. Representatives from the Zags cited an inability to find a quality opponent to schedule and wanting to maintain strong résumé.[101] The Zags have compiled an 9–6 (.600) record in the event since they first appeared in it back in 2003.[102] Gonzaga's biggest rivalry is with fellow West Coast Conference foe Saint Mary's. Many analysts and members of the media have touted the Gaels vs. Zags as one of the best, if not the best, college basketball rivalry on the West Coast,[103][104] as both teams have been consistently the two top teams in the conference over the last 2 decades. Gonzaga and Saint Mary's have combined to win 24 out of the last 26 conference championship games (Gonzaga 20, Saint Mary's 4, San Diego 2). Currently Gonzaga leads the series 81–35. Gonzaga's most heated in-state rivalry is with Washington. They played a 10-year home-and-home series from 1997 to 2006, but then it went dormant until they were forced to play each other in first round of the 2015 Battle 4 Atlantis tournament. In 2016, they began a new home-and-home series in Spokane and have agreed to continue the rivalry annually until at least the 2025–26 season. The Huskies lead the series 30–20. Although the Zags have won 14 of the last 16 matchups, the most recent game was won by Washington on December 9, 2023, 78–73. Gonzaga also has an in-state rivalry with Washington State. The two schools are both based in Eastern Washington, with Pullman only 79 miles away from Spokane. Following the collapse of the Pac-12 and Wazzu's temporary move to the West Coast Conference for some sports including basketball, the rivalry became renewed in the 2024–25 season. In October 2024, Gonzaga announced that they had joined the new Pac-12, solidifying the return of the rivalry. The Cougars lead the series 98–52, but Gonzaga has won 13 of the last 16 matchups, including the most recent game in 2015, 69–60. A notable rivalry with Brigham Young University (BYU) has developed throughout the past decade. BYU and Gonzaga first played on December 16, 1949, with Gonzaga winning 46–41. The two teams would not meet again until March 19, 2011, in the third round of the NCAA tournament, as a BYU team led by Jimmer Fredette advanced to the Sweet Sixteen by defeating the Zags 89–67. The following season, BYU left the Mountain West Conference and joined the West Coast Conference for the 2011–2012 season. BYU is one of few teams to win multiple times at the McCarthy Athletic Center in Spokane over the last decade, with wins at the Kennel in 2015, 2016 and 2017. BYU was the only team to beat #1 ranked Gonzaga during the 2016–17 regular season in which Gonzaga earned its first trip to the Final Four and National Championship game. BYU has played Gonzaga in the West Coast Conference tournament Final in 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2021 with Gonzaga winning all four of these matchups. Gonzaga leads the overall series 25–7, with the most recent meeting on February 11, 2023, in which Gonzaga won 88–81 in Spokane. BYU departed the WCC for the Big 12 Conference, starting with the 2023–2024 season, and since then, no matchups have been confirmed for the future between the Cougars and Zags. Freshman enrollment at Gonzaga in the mid-nineties hovered around 500 students annually, including a total of 569 as late as 1998.[105] In 1999, enrollment jumped to 701 five months after the Zags went to the Elite Eight.[105] This trend continued after Gonzaga won five games in the 1999 and 2000 NCAA tournaments, as freshman enrollment increased to 796 in 2000 and to a then-record 979 in 2001.[105] A 65 percent increase in the size of the freshman class between 1997 and 2003 is part of a phenomenon called the Flutie effect, the increase in attention and applications for admission that results after a particularly notable and unexpected sporting victory by a school's athletic team. Gonzaga University president Rev. Robert Spitzer said that the team's success was responsible for the school receiving the $23 million required to build the McCarthey Athletic Center, most of which was received through major gifts.[106] Gonzaga has been viewed as reaping benefits from its basketball-related exposure to this day. The university's financial position and fundraising success dramatically improved. This led to a campus building boom; the McCarthey Athletic Center proved to be just the first of a series of major campus buildings that opened between 2004 and 2017. Booming freshman enrollment led Gonzaga to introduce a more selective admissions process in 2003, which led to a significant increase in the academic credentials of incoming freshmen. Even with greater selectivity, freshman enrollment has continued to grow, reaching 1,200 for 2016–17.[107] Under Mark Few: National champion Postseason invitational champion Conference regular season champion Conference regular season and conference tournament champion Division regular season champion Division regular season and conference tournament champion Conference tournament champion Since the season of Gonzaga's 1999 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament run to the Elite 8, Gonzaga has played a total of 132 games against teams ranked in the AP Top 25 Poll. Gonzaga has a record of 61–71 (.462) against such teams. They have beaten top-3 teams seven times in all, taking down #3 teams four times (Missouri in 2003–04, Georgia Tech and Oklahoma State in 2004–05, and Iowa in 2020–21), #2 twice (North Carolina in 2006–07 and UCLA in 2021–22), and #1 once (Duke in 2018–19). Teams in bold represent games Gonzaga played in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The Bulldogs have appeared in 26 NCAA tournaments. The COVID-19 pandemic caused the cancellation of the 2020 NCAA tournament. This interrupted, but did not end, the Bulldogs' ongoing streak of 25 consecutive tournament appearances, including 9 straight Sweet 16 appearances. Gonzaga's combined record is 46–26 (.639). The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition. The Bulldogs have appeared in three National Invitation Tournaments (NIT). All five games were played on the road, and Gonzaga's combined record is 2–3 (.400). Note: Players' year is based on remaining eligibility. The NCAA did not count the 2020–21 season towards eligibility. Roster Last update: August 27, 2024 Eight McDonald's All-Americans have played for Gonzaga. Of these, five have started their college basketball careers with the Bulldogs—Zach Collins,[277] Jalen Suggs, Hunter Sallis, Chet Holmgren, and Nolan Hickman. Suggs was selected for the 2020 McDonald's All-American game, which was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[278][279] The 2021 McDonald's All-American game, to which Hickman and Holmgren were selected, was also canceled due to COVID-19. Twelve 5-star rated players have committed to Gonzaga, as rated in the final ranking projections by at least one major college basketball recruiting service (247Sports.com, ESPN.com, Rivals.com, and Scout.com). Among these players, eight began their college careers with the Bulldogs: Austin Daye, Domantas Sabonis, Zach Collins, Oumar Ballo, Jalen Suggs, Nolan Hickman, Chet Holmgren, and Hunter Sallis. Only Ballo did not make his debut immediately after his arrival at Gonzaga; he was to have debuted in the 2019–20 season, but was not academically cleared to play by the NCAA and was redshirted that season. In this table, seasons at Gonzaga are categorized by the calendar years in which they end. Gonzaga has retired five jersey numbers.",

                "content": "National Football League (1970–present) The Cincinnati Bengals are a professional American football team based in Cincinnati. The Bengals compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. The team plays its home games at Paycor Stadium in downtown Cincinnati.[7] Former Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown began planning for the creation of the Bengals franchise in 1965, and Cincinnati's city council approved the construction of Riverfront Stadium in 1966. Finally, in 1967, the Bengals were founded when a group headed by Brown received franchise approval by the American Football League (AFL) on May 23, 1967, and they began play in the 1968 season.[8] Brown was the Bengals' head coach from their inception to 1975. After being dismissed as the Browns' head coach by Art Modell (who had purchased a majority interest in the team in 1961) in January 1963, Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus. He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city, Hamilton County, and Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds (who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games. Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL, which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season, Brown agreed to join the AFL as its 10th and final franchise. The Bengals, like the other former AFL teams, were assigned to the AFC following the merger. Cincinnati was also selected because, like their neighbors the Reds, they could draw from several large neighboring cities (Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky; Columbus, Dayton, and Springfield, Ohio) that are all no more than 110 miles (180 km) away from downtown Cincinnati, along with Indianapolis, until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season.[9] After Paul Brown's death in 1991, controlling interest in the team was inherited by his son, Mike Brown. In 2011, Brown purchased shares of the team owned by the estate of co-founder Austin Knowlton and is now the majority owner of the Bengals franchise.[7] The Bengals won the AFC championship in 1981, 1988, and in 2021. After each of the 1981 and 1988 conference championships, they went on to lose to the San Francisco 49ers, in Super Bowls XVI and XXIII. The team struggled greatly in the 1990s and the early 2000s, during which time they were sometimes referred to disparagingly as \"The Bungles,\" a term coined by Steelers broadcaster Myron Cope.[10] [11][12][13][14] Following the 1990 season, the team went 14 years without making the NFL playoffs or posting a winning record. The Bengals went through several head coaches in that period, and many of their top draft picks did not pan out. The team's fortunes improved in the mid-2000s and into the mid-2010s, which saw them become more consistent postseason contenders, but they continued to struggle in the playoffs.[15][16][17][18] The turning point for the Bengals was during the 2021 season, when they won their first playoff game in 31 years and advanced to the first of two consecutive AFC Championship games. In 2021, they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 27–24 in overtime and advanced to Super Bowl LVI, their first appearance in the Super Bowl in 33 years, where they lost to the Los Angeles Rams 23–20.[19] They advanced to the AFC Championship game again in 2022 but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the Chiefs, by a score of 23-20 (the same exact score as in Super Bowl LVI).[20] The team does not have an official general manager. However, Duke Tobin is often, though incorrectly, referred to as the Bengals' general manager because he handles most personnel decisions.[21] In a 2011 survey, Brown was rated as among the worst team owners in American professional sports.[22] In a Forbes article on the value of NFL teams as of August 2022, the Cincinnati Bengals were ranked last with a value of $3 billion.[23] In 1967, an ownership group led by Paul Brown was granted a franchise in the American Football League. Brown named the team the Bengals in order \"to give it a link with past professional football in Cincinnati\".[24] Another Cincinnati Bengals team had existed in the city and played in three previous American Football Leagues[25] from 1937 to 1942. The city's world-renowned zoo was also home to a rare white Bengal tiger. In a possible insult to Art Modell – or possibly as a homage to the Massillon Tigers – Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word \"BENGALS\" in black lettering. One of the potential helmet designs Brown rejected was a striped motif that was similar to the helmets adopted by the team in 1981 still in use today; however, that design featured stripes which were more uniform in width.[26] The Bengals began play in the 1968 season. In 1966, the American Football League agreed to a merger with its older and more established rival, the National Football League.[27] Among the terms of the merger was that the AFL was permitted to add one additional franchise; the NFL wanted an even number of clubs in the merged league, so a team needed to be added to bring the number of clubs in the merged league to 26 teams. For the AFL, a key motive behind their agreement to accept a new team was that the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million – 400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the new team provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement. Prior to the merger's announcement, Brown had not seriously considered joining the American Football League and was not a supporter of what he openly regarded to be an inferior competition, once famously stating that \"I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.\"[28] However, with the announcement of the merger, Brown realized that the AFL expansion franchise would likely be his only realistic path back into the NFL in the short to medium term, and ultimately acquiesced to joining the AFL after learning that the team was guaranteed to become an NFL franchise after the merger was completed in 1970. There was also a major problem: Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds were in need of a facility to replace Crosley Field, which they had used since 1912. By this time, the small park was antiquated and rundown, and parking issues had plagued the city since the early 1950s, while the park also lacked modern amenities – issues that were exacerbated by the Mill Creek Expressway (I-75) project that ran alongside the park. While New York City – which had lost both its National League teams in 1957 after the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles, and the Giants relocated to San Francisco – had actively courted Reds owner Powel Crosley to relocate his team there, Crosley was adamant that the Reds remain in Cincinnati and tolerated the worsening problems with the Crosley Field location. With assistance from Ohio governor Jim Rhodes, Hamilton County and the Cincinnati city council agreed to build a single multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city: the new facility had to be ready by the opening of the 1970 NFL season, and was officially named Riverfront Stadium. With the completion of the merger in 1970, the Cleveland Browns were one of three NFL teams that agreed to move to the AFL-based American Football Conference to give both conferences an equal number of teams and were placed in the AFC Central, the same division as the Bengals. An instant rivalry was born, fueled initially by Paul Brown's rivalry with Art Modell.[29][30] For their first two seasons, the Bengals played at Nippert Stadium, the current home of the University of Cincinnati Bearcats.[31] The team held training camp at Wilmington College in Wilmington, through the 1968 preseason. The team finished its first season with a 3–11 record[32] and running back Paul Robinson, who rushed for 1,023 yards, and was named the AFL Rookie of the Year.[33] Founder Paul Brown coached the team for its first eight seasons.[34] One of Brown's college draft strategies was to draft players from non-traditional football schools. Punter/wide receiver Pat McInally attended Harvard University, and linebacker Reggie Williams attended Dartmouth College and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals' roster. Because of this policy, many former players went on to have successful careers in commentary and broadcasting as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had a knack for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.[35] In 1970, the Bengals moved to play at Riverfront Stadium, a home they shared with the Cincinnati Reds until the team moved to Paul Brown Stadium in 2000. Notable players of the 1970 team included Virgil Carter, Chip Meyers, Jack Meckstroth, Bob Trumpy, and Lemar Parrish. Virgil Carter threw for 1,647 yards. Chip Myers paced all receivers, catching 32 passes for 542 yards. Bob Trumpy contributed to the receiving game, too.[36] The team reached the playoffs three times during that decade, but could not win any of those postseason games. In 1975, the team posted an 11–3 record, giving them what remains the highest winning percentage (.786) in franchise history. But it only earned them a wild card spot in the playoffs, behind the 12–2 Pittsburgh Steelers, who went on to win the Super Bowl; the Bengals lost to the Oakland Raiders 31–28 in the divisional playoffs.[37] The Bengals reached the Super Bowl twice during the 1980s – in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XXIII – and lost against the San Francisco 49ers both times.[38][39] The team appeared in the playoffs in 1990, making it to the second round before losing to the Los Angeles Raiders.[40] Before the following season got underway, Paul Brown died at age 82.[41] Due to declining health, he had already transferred control to his son, Mike Brown, but was reported to still influence the daily operations of the team.[42] The Bengals' fortunes changed for the worse as the team posted 14 consecutive non-winning seasons and were saddled with numerous draft busts. The Bengals began to emerge from that dismal period into a new era of increased consistency, however, after the team finished with its worst record in team history, 2–14, which led to the hiring of Marvin Lewis as head coach in 2003.[43] Carson Palmer, the future star quarterback, was drafted in 2003, but did not play a snap that whole season, as Jon Kitna had a comeback year (voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year).[44][45] Despite Kitna's success, Palmer was promoted to starting quarterback the following season.[46] The team finished with an 8–8 record and missed the postseason in 2004.[47] Under Palmer, the team advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1990 losing in the Wild Card Roundto the Pittsburgh Steelers 31–17 in the 2005 season, which also was the first time the team had a winning percentage above .500 since 1990.[48][49][50] The Bengals returned to the playoffs again in 2009 in a season that included the franchise's first-ever division sweep. This was especially impressive since two of the teams swept by the Bengals – the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens – had made it to the AFC Championship Game the previous season. Marvin Lewis was rewarded for the accomplishment with the NFL Coach of the Year Award.[51] In the 2010 season, the Bengals posted a 4–12 record.[52] Following the disappointing 2010 season, quarterback Carson Palmer demanded to be traded. When the Bengals refused to do so, Palmer announced his retirement from the NFL.[53] He later was moved at the NFL trade deadline to the Oakland Raiders.[54] In the 2011 NFL draft, the Bengals selected wide receiver A. J. Green in the first round and quarterback Andy Dalton in the second round.[55] The Bengals improved to 9–7 in the 2011 season, and clinched a playoff spot.[56] Dalton and Green became the most prolific rookie WR-QB duo in history, connecting 65 times for 1,057 yards. However, they lost to the Houston Texans, 31–10, in the Wild Card round.[57] In the 2012 season, the Bengals clinched a playoff spot once more with a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, going to the playoffs in back-to-back years for the first time since 1982.[58] However, the Bengals faced the Texans in the first round yet again and took another early exit, losing 19–13.[59] In the 2013 season, for the third straight year, the Bengals clinched a playoff berth and also won the AFC North, finishing with an 11–5 record.[60] But once again, the Bengals were defeated in the wild card round, this time by the San Diego Chargers, 27–10.[61] Most of the blame was put on Andy Dalton, who threw two interceptions and fumbled on a forward dive. This made the Bengals 0–5 in playoff games since Mike Brown took over as owner. The 2014 season started well, with the Bengals winning their first three contests against the Baltimore Ravens, Atlanta Falcons, and Tennessee Titans. However, they lost their Week 5 road matchup with the New England Patriots, 43–17. An overtime tie with the Carolina Panthers and a shutout loss to the Indianapolis Colts followed the primetime loss to the Patriots. Finishing the season 10–5–1 as the fifth seed, they lost to the Colts, 26–10, in the first round of the playoffs.[62][63] This was the first time the franchise made the playoffs four straight seasons. In 2015, the Bengals got out to a franchise-best 8–0 start with a 31–10 win over the Cleveland Browns.[64] Unfortunately, in Week 14 they would lose starting quarterback Andy Dalton to injury. He would not return that season, leaving A. J. McCarron to start under center. The Bengals finished with a franchise record-tying 12–4 mark.[65] Additionally, they lost to the division rival Pittsburgh Steelers, 18–16, in the Wild Card round in the final minute, making them the first franchise in NFL history to lose five straight opening-round playoff games.[66] This frustration continued in 2016 for the Bengals: they finished the 2016 campaign with a 6–9–1 record, losing several key players to injury, including A. J. Green, Giovani Bernard, and Jeremy Hill.[67][68] They missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010, marking the first time Andy Dalton missed the playoffs as the Bengals' starting quarterback. One notable game was a 27–27 tie against the Washington Redskins which was played in London in 2016.[69] Following a rough 2016 season, the Bengals looked forward into 2017. However, after starting 0–3, the Bengals never found their footing. At one point in the season, the Bengals were 5–9. There were rumors that Marvin Lewis would not return for the next season as the Bengals' head coach. However, after two come-from-behind victories over the Lions and Ravens that eliminated both teams from the playoffs, the Bengals finished 7–9.[70] The final two games were convincing enough for owner Mike Brown to give Lewis a new two-year contract.[71] The 2018 campaign began with promise for the Bengals under Lewis. Cincinnati began the season with a 4–1 record with impressive wins over the Colts, Ravens, Falcons, and Dolphins. However, the Bengals suffered many setbacks after the hot start: defensive coordinator Teryl Austin was fired mid-season because of defensive woes,[72] A. J. Green was injured and officially out for the last four games, and Andy Dalton injured his thumb in the Bengals' first game against the Browns and replaced by Jeff Driskel for the rest of the season.[73][74] The Bengals ended 2018 with a final record of 6–10 and finished last place in the AFC North.[75] On December 31, 2018, with one year to go on his contract, Lewis and the Bengals mutually parted ways after three straight losing seasons under his watch.[76] In 2019, they hired head coach Zac Taylor.[77] The 2019 campaign started off with reasonable success, with the Bengals barely losing to Seattle 21–20 at CenturyLink Field; but what started with promise ended in disaster.[78] The Bengals then lost 10 more games and were 0–11 heading into December 2019. To open the month of December, they got their first win of the season against the Jets, 22–6, in Cincinnati.[79] They eventually lost to the Patriots and then to the Dolphins, 38–35, in overtime after Dalton led the team back from 23 points down in the fourth quarter. With the loss to the Dolphins, the Bengals officially clinched the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft.[80] They capped off the season with a win against the Cleveland Browns, finishing 2–14, equaling the 2002 season as the team's worst record in history.[81][82] In 2020, the Bengals improved under rookies Joe Burrow and Tee Higgins.[83] Starting the season with a 2–5–1 record going into the bye week, including an overtime tie to the Philadelphia Eagles. Going into Week 11 facing the Washington Football Team, they lost Joe Burrow to a season-ending knee injury that all but ended their season, only winning two more contests against the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans.[84] Finishing the season 4–11–1.[85] In 2021, the Bengals won the AFC North with a 10–7 record, which included dominant sweeps of the rival Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens.[86] Led by Joe Burrow, who was playing in his first full season after recovering from his devastating knee injury in Week 11 of his rookie season and rookie receiver, and Burrow's college teammate at LSU, Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati would win the AFC North for the first time since 2015. They beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 34–31, in a Week 17 thriller to clinch the division. They then won their first playoff game since the 1990 season, beating the Las Vegas Raiders, 26–19, in the Wild Card round.[87] After that, they upset the top-seeded Tennessee Titans, 19–16, when Evan McPherson kicked a game-winning 52-yard field goal. A week later, they advanced to their first Super Bowl since 1989 when McPherson kicked a 33-yard field goal in overtime to cap off a comeback from being down 21–3 and shock the No. 2 seed Chiefs, 27–24. They lost a close Super Bowl to the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI, 23–20.[88] In Week 1 of the 2022 NFL season, the Bengals lost, 23–20, to the Pittsburgh Steelers in overtime, breaking a three-game winning streak the Bengals had against Pittsburgh. After falling to a 4–4 record in Week 8, the Bengals proceeded to win 8 straight games to tie a franchise-record for single-season wins and earn a 3 seed in the AFC playoffs.[89][90] They defeated divisional rival Baltimore in the first round 24–17, behind a 98-yard fumble recovery returned for a touchdown by Sam Hubbard.[91][92] Despite missing three starting offensive linemen, the Bengals followed that up with a decisive 27–10 road win over the favored Buffalo Bills to reach a second straight AFC Championship appearance for the first time in franchise history.[93] Once again, they faced the Kansas City Chiefs in the Championship Game, but this time they lost 23–20, in another thrilling game.[94] In the 2023 season, during their Week 11 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, Joe Burrow would suffer a wrist injury that would rule him out the rest of the season.[95] The consistent play of backup quarterback Jake Browning kept the Bengals alive in the postseason hunt after Burrow's injury.[96] The Bengals finished the season 9–8 and missed the playoffs.[97] When the team debuted in 1968, the Bengals' uniforms were modeled after the Cleveland Browns. When Paul Brown was fired by Art Modell, Brown still owned the equipment used by Cleveland, so after the firing, Paul Brown packed up all his equipment, which he then used for his new team in Cincinnati. The Cleveland Browns' team colors were brown, orange, and white, and their helmets were solid orange with a white dorsal stripe over the crest. The Bengals' team colors were orange, black, and white, and their helmets were a similar shade of orange, with the only variations being the word \"Bengals\" in black block letters (with a white outline) on either side of the helmet and no stripe on the helmet. The Cincinnati Bengals were unique in the NFL, as they did not have secondary uniform numbers on the jerseys (called \"TV numbers\") until they appeared on the sleeves in the 1980 season; they were the only NFL team that didn't have them prior to that point. That same year, the team changed their helmet face mask color from gray to black. The team did not discard their Cleveland-like uniforms until 1981. During that year, a then-unique uniform design was introduced: Although the team kept black jerseys, white jerseys, and white pants, they were now trimmed with orange and black tiger stripes. The team also introduced the orange helmets with black tiger stripes that are still in use today. Sports Illustrated likened the Bengals' new helmets to \"varicose pumpkins.\"[98] In 1997, the Bengals designed a logo consisting of a leaping tiger, and it was added to the uniform sleeves (with this, the TV numbers moved to the shoulder). Another alternate logo consisted of a Bengal's head facing to the left. However, the orange helmet with black tiger stripes continued to be the trademark. In 2004, a new tiger stripe pattern and more accents were added to the uniforms. The black jerseys now featured orange tiger-striped sleeves and white side panels, while the white jerseys began to use black tiger-striped sleeves and orange shoulders.[99] A new logo consisting of an orange \"B\" covered with black tiger stripes was introduced.[100] The team also started rotating black pants and debuted an alternate orange jersey, with white side panels and black tiger-striped sleeves. The Bengals have worn their black uniforms at home throughout their history, with some exceptions, such as the 1970 season, when the Bengals wore white at home for the entire season as well as most of the 1971 season (the Bengals were the first AFL team to wear white at home, as its rules required the home team to wear their dark jerseys, unlike the NFL, which allowed the home team choice of jersey color starting in 1964). Since 2005, the Bengals have worn white for September home games where the heat could become a factor. In 2016, the Bengals unveiled their all-white Color Rush alternate uniform, featuring black tiger stripes along the sleeves and pants. Orange was only used on the Nike mark, on the team logo, and as an outline color on the player's name.[101] The club announced a new uniform design on January 21, 2021. The new uniform design would be worn beginning with the 2021 NFL season.[102] The set retains the signature striped helmet, while simplifying the look by removing the side and shoulder panels, creating a new stripe pattern for the sleeves, getting rid of the number block shadow, and removing the stroke on the player's name. This set also puts the team's wordmark on the chest and lacks TV numbers on the sleeves. The shade of orange was changed, as well. The Bengals wore three different pants with this set: black pants with orange stripes, white pants with black stripes, and white pants with orange stripes. The white pants with black stripes were worn with the white jersey in 2021 playoff games at Tennessee and Kansas City. The white pants with orange stripes were worn with the black jersey in Super Bowl LVI against the Rams.[103] In 2022, after the NFL rescinded the \"one-helmet rule,\" the Bengals unveiled an alternate black-striped white helmet. In addition, the team brought back the all-white Color Rush uniform to be paired with the white helmets.[104][105] This would last one season, however, as the team decided to pair the white helmet with the primary white uniform for two games in 2023, effectively retiring the Color Rush uniform for the time being.[106] In 2024, the Bengals added orange pants to the uniform rotation after Madden NFL 25 leaked the option to the public.[107] The Bengals then unveiled a new all-orange uniform combination to be worn September 8 against the Patriots.[108] The team's official mascot is a Bengal tiger named Who Dey.[109] Its jersey number is 1.[110] Aside from Who Dey, the team also has the Ben-Gals, the team's cheerleading squad,[111] which included Laura Vikmanis, the oldest cheerleader in league history.[112] Carol Motsinger in 2015 said, \"In 2012, Cincinnati welcomed another tiger named Who Dey. This time, one that walks on four legs. More than 1,000 Bengals season ticket holders named a Malayan tiger Who Dey at Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. He was recently traded to a zoo in Kansas.\"[113] The Ohio History Central notes: \"In 1940, a third American Football League formed, and the Cincinnati Bengals joined it. Unfortunately, World War II began the following year, causing manpower shortages as men joined the armed forces. This prompted this newer AFL to cease playing after the 1941 season. Paul Brown, former coach of the Cleveland Browns, received authorization from a modern American Football League to create a team in Cincinnati. Brown chose the name Bengals to memorialize the teams of the same name that had represented Cincinnati in the past.\"[114] The Bengals' historic rivalry with the Cleveland Browns is often referred to as the \"Battle of Ohio\", started as the result of former Browns head coach and team founder Paul Brown starting the Bengals franchise after leaving the Browns.[115] The colors of each team are similar since Paul Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by the Browns for the Bengals, and the Bengals' original uniforms were identical to the Browns' uniforms, excluding the word \"Bengals\" on the helmet. The rivalry reached its peak during the 1980s when both teams were vying viciously for a spot in the playoffs. During the 1990s the rivalry also butted heads when Brown's sons were in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Bengals.[116] The Bengals lead the series 53–48 as of the end of the 2023 season.[117] The Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers have played each other twice a year since becoming division rivals in 1970. This rivalry has gained intensity since the 2000s, as the teams have met twice in the playoffs, with both games being marked by hard hits and injuries with the most infamous example occurring in the 2005 playoffs.[118][119][120] The Steelers lead the overall series 70–39 and the postseason series 2–0.[121] However, the Steelers have been more dominant recently, posting a record of 28–7 since 2004, when they drafted Roethlisberger. There were two times that the rivalry has met during the playoffs: the Wild Card rounds of 2005 and 2015, with the Steelers winning both meetings at Cincinnati. The 2005 game is marked as a special time in the rivalry because this is when Steelers defensive tackle Kimo Von Oelhoffen injured Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer,[122] while the 2015 game is also special because Bengals running back Jeremy Hill fumbled the ball in the waning minutes when the Bengals had a 16–15 lead over the Steelers to give the latter one last chance. They used that chance wisely as they drove down the field (with the help of two costly personal fouls by the Bengals) and kicked a game-winning field goal.[123] The Bengals' rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens began when the original Browns franchise relocated to Baltimore to become the Ravens. Since then, the rivalry heated up when longtime Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis was hired as the head coach of the Bengals. The Ravens lead the all-time series 30–27 as of the 2023 season.[124] The Bengals won the only playoff meeting in the 2022 AFC Wild Card round.[125] The Joe Burrow-led Bengals have developed a recent rivalry with the Kansas City Chiefs, with Burrow being the only AFC quarterback to date to hold a winning record against Mahomes.[126] As of the 2023 season, the Bengals lead the all-time series 18–16.[127] The Bengals have played the Titans more than any non-divisional opponent by a significant margin. The Titans lead the all-time series 41–37–1.[128] A no-huddle offense was commonly used by all teams when time in the game was running low. However, Sam Wyche, the head coach of the Bengals in 1988, along with offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet, made the high-paced offense the standard modality for the ball club regardless of time remaining. By quickly substituting and setting up for the next play—often within 5–10 seconds after the last play despite being afforded 45 seconds—the Bengals hindered the other team's defense from substituting situational players, regrouping for tactics, and resting. In response, the NFL instituted rules allowing the defense ample time for substitutions when offensive substitutions were made. The hurry-up tactic was used by the franchise during the late 1980s while Sam Wyche was the coach. A rival for AFC supremacy during this time was the Buffalo Bills, coached by Marv Levy, who also used a version of the no-huddle offense starting with the 1989 season. The Bengals had beaten the Bills three times in 1988 (pre-season, regular season, and the AFC Championship Game). Marv Levy threatened to fake injuries if the Bengals used the \"no-huddle\" in the AFC Championship. Wyche was notified that the commissioner had ordered the \"no-huddle\" illegal for the game. The official notified Wyche and the Bengals' team just two hours before the game kickoff.[129] Wyche asked to talk directly to the commissioner and word immediately came back that the \"no-huddle\" would not be penalized. Levy did not have his players' fake injuries in the game but installed his version the next year, 1989. The Bengals first used the \"no-huddle\" in 1984.[130] Most of the high-profile games (the various games for AFC titles and regular-season games) between the two led to these changes in NFL rules. Wyche also first used the timeout periods as an opportunity to bring his entire team to the sideline to talk to all eleven players, plus substitutes, at one time. This allowed trainers time to treat a cut or bruise and equipment managers time to repair an equipment defect. The West Coast offense is the popular name for the high-percentage passing scheme designed by former Bengals assistant Bill Walsh.[131] Walsh formulated what has become popularly known as the West Coast offense during his tenure as assistant coach for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975, while working under the tutelage of Brown (and before embarking on his legendary coaching tenure with the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s). Bengals quarterback Virgil Carter was the first player to successfully implement Walsh's system, leading the NFL in pass completion percentage in 1971.[132] Ken Anderson replaced Carter as Cincinnati's starting quarterback in 1972 and was even more successful. In 1975 he would bring widespread recognition to the West Coast offense as well as to the Cincinnati team and its quarterback in a nationally televised Monday night contest between the Bengals and a Buffalo Bills team built around the running game of star player O. J. Simpson. Anderson's 447 passing yards were enough to overcome Simpson's 197 yards on the ground in a game that proved a milestone, providing a striking contrast between the \"old\" game of defense-minded football and the new game of higher scores and more action through a sophisticated aerial attack.[133] The game, in effect, offered its viewers a glimpse of the future of professional football. Anderson, who was drafted by Paul Brown in 1971 and installed as starting quarterback in 1972, made four trips to the Pro Bowl, won four passing titles, was named NFL MVP in 1981, and set the record for completion percentage in a single season in 1982 with 70.66%. Defeated frequently during the 1970s by the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team that won four Super Bowls with 9 future Hall of Fame players, the Bengals under Anderson and head coach Forrest Gregg would finally break through the Steel Curtain, defeating the Steelers during both of their meetings in 1980 and again in 1981. Anderson, who had been named the \"team franchise\" by Bengal tight end Bob Trumpy, would ultimately prove his worth with a career record of 91 wins and 81 losses.[134] The defense created to combat the West Coast offense also came from Cincinnati. Then-Bengals defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau (who later served as the team's head coach from 2000 to 2002) created the zone blitz in the 1980s in response to the West Coast offense.[135] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 13 reserve, 16 practice squad In addition, Despite not being formally retired, the Bengals have certain numbers that are in limited circulation: There are four members of the Hall of Fame that have spent some portion of their career with the Bengals, but only Anthony Muñoz and Ken Riley spent their entire playing careers with the Bengals. Listed below are only Hall of Famers whose induction includes their tenure with the Bengals. Bengals founder and first coach Paul Brown is in the Hall of Fame, but was inducted before founding the team and is not credited as a Bengals Hall of Famer. Additionally, the Bengals have had two head coaches, Forrest Gregg and Dick LeBeau inducted for their playing career. In 2007, in celebration of their 40th anniversary the Bengals named an all-time team voted on by the fans.[148] Source:[149] The Bengals announced they would begin a Ring of Honor in 2021.[150] The inaugural class included Pro Football Hall of Fame tackle Anthony Muñoz and Paul Brown, who was the franchise's founder and first coach,[151] with Ken Anderson and Ken Riley added after a season ticket holder vote.[152] *Posthumous induction → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The Bengals contract with iHeartMedia as their radio partner,[153] with their flagship radio stations being WCKY (1530) and WEBN (102.7 FM), along with WLW (700) if not in conflict with the Reds. Most preseason and regular season games, are telecast on WKRC-TV, channel 12, the CBS affiliate. Mike Watts and Anthony Muñoz are the TV announcers for preseason games, with Mike Valpredo as the sideline reporter.[154] Games that feature an NFC opponent playing at Paycor Stadium will be televised on WXIX, channel 19, the local Fox affiliate. WLWT-TV airs games when the Bengals are featured on Sunday Night Football. The radio broadcasting crew consists of Dan Hoard (play-by-play), and Dave Lapham (analyst).[155] \"The Bengal Growl\" is the Bengals fight song. It was written by Bengals entertainment director George \"Red\" Bird upon the team's founding in 1968. Bird had been friends with Paul Brown for over 30 years. The two had met at Massillon Washington High School when Brown was head football coach and Bird was director of the famed Massillon Tiger Swing Band. Bird had served as the Browns' music and entertainment director in 1946, and kept that role until Brown convinced him to come to Cincinnati in 1968. His first task was to pen a fight song along the lines of the Browns' fight song, \"Hi! O-Hi-O for Cleveland!\" The song remains very popular among Bengals fans, who are known to belt out the song at \"Bengals backer\" bars all over the country. In 2021, Elizabeth Blackburn, now the team's head of strategy and fan engagement, told The Athletic recalled stopping at one such bar in San Francisco during the 2015 playoffs, and was surprised to hear the viewers break out into the song. As a measure of how popular the song remains among the Bengals fan base, when Blackburn wrote an editorial on her efforts to overhaul the team's image for the Bengals Web site, Blackburn specifically mentioned that the song was not going anywhere.[156] \"Welcome to the Jungle\" is also a fight song for the Bengals.[157][158] The song is mainly played before kick-offs to intimidate visiting teams. \"Who Dey?!\" is the name of a chant of support by fans of the Cincinnati Bengals, in use since the 1980s. The entire chant is: \"Who dey, who dey, who dey think gonna beat dem Bengals?\"[159] The answer screamed in unison, \"Nobody.\" Sometimes fans will instead shout \"Who Dey?\" to represent the entire cheer. \"Who Dey\" is also the name of the team's mascot, a Bengal tiger.[110] Saying \"Who Dey\" at Bengals games is steeped in local beer lore. Hudy, a leading product of Hudepohl Brewing Company 1978 through the late 1980s, bears a phonetic similarity to the \"Who Dey\" chant. Beer vendors who carried full cases of bottled local beer up and down the steep upper stairs of what was then Riverfront Stadium would call out \"If Hudy\", \"Burger\" and other local beer names. Raucous fans would often chant back and forth with them as the vendors called out. During the 1980 season, the banter with the Hudepohl vendors grew organically into the now famous (Hu-Dey) -Who They?- chant.[160] The full Who Dey chant was first known to be used by fans of the 1980 Cincinnati Bengals.[161] While the origin of the chant is disputed, one possible source for the chant is a 1980 commercial for (the now-defunct) Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which used this tagline: \"Who's going to give you a better deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!\" Cincinnati fans who had seen the commercial many times may have just copied it when cheering.[162] The chant bears some similarities to the phrase \"Who Dat?\", which was officially adopted by the New Orleans Saints in 1983 but had been used by Louisiana's high school team fans for some time. The saying \"Who Dat?\" originated in minstrel shows and vaudeville acts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then it was taken up by New Orleans Jazz and various Big band folks in the 1920s and 1930s. In the late 1960s, local Louisiana High Schools, St. Augustine High School and Patterson High School reportedly have been using the cheer and Gulf Coast fans of Alcorn State University and Louisiana State University picked up the cheer in the 1970s. Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana claims to have originated the cheer in the late 1960s in their version: \"Who dat talking 'bout beating dem Jags?\"[163]",

                "content": "The Colorado Buffaloes football program represents the University of Colorado Boulder in college football at the NCAA Division I FBS level, and is a member of the Big 12 Conference. The team was a charter member of the Big 12 before leaving to join the Pac-12 Conference after the 2010 season. After 13 seasons in the Pac-12, the Buffaloes returned to the Big 12 in 2024. Before joining the Big 12, they were members of the Big Eight Conference. The CU football team has played at Folsom Field since 1924.[1] The Buffs all-time record is 716–520–36 (.577 winning percentage) as of the 2022 season. Colorado won the 1990 National Championship. The football program is 27th on the all-time win list and 40th in all-time winning percentage. Beginning in 1890, the Buffaloes have appeared in 29 bowl games (36th all-time), and won 27 conference championships, 5 division championships and an AP national championship in 1990. Folsom Field was built in 1924, and since then, Colorado has a 308–169–14 record at home through the 2016 season. The road game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers on November 24, 2006, was Colorado's 1,100th football game. The game on September 12, 2015, against Massachusetts was the school's 1,200th football game. Colorado won one national championship in football for 1990.[4]: 120 [5] Colorado won the national championship in 1990 under the direction of head coach Bill McCartney, who helmed the team from 1982 to 1994. While the Georgia Tech won the United Press International Coaches Poll, Colorado won the Associated Press, Football Writers Association of America and other polls. Colorado played the most difficult schedule in the country, beat more ranked teams and conference champions, and had a more talented roster.[6] Colorado capped the season with a 10–9 win over Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl, a rematch of the 1989 season Orange Bowl Game which Notre Dame won 21–6. Colorado's tie came against Tennessee, who was ranked No. 8, the first week of the season when Colorado was ranked No. 5. The second week gave the Buffs a scare, scoring with 12 seconds left in the game on a 4th and Goal attempt. The next week gave Colorado its only loss of the season, losing 23–22 to Illinois and dropping Colorado to No. 20 in the polls. Colorado then went on to beat teams ranked (at the time) No. 22 Texas, No. 12 Washington, No. 22 Oklahoma, and No. 3 Nebraska. They ended the season 7–0 in the Big Eight Conference for the second straight season. They then capped the season with a win over Notre Dame who were number 1 until a loss in their second to last game of the regular season.[7] Colorado has won 26 conference championships in over a century of college play, spanning through five conferences. † Co-champions † Co-champions The Buffaloes have played in 1,109 games during their 125 seasons, through 2014. In those seasons, 11 coaches have led Colorado to postseason bowl games: Bunny Oakes, Dallas Ward, Marcel M. Mazur, Bud Davis, Eddie Crowder, Bill Mallory, Bill McCartney, Rick Neuheisel, Gary Barnett, Dan Hawkins, Mike MacIntyre and Karl Dorrell.[8] Ten coaches have won conference championships with the Buffaloes: Fred Folsom, Myron Witham, William Saunders, Oakes, Jim Yeager, Sonny Grandelius, Mallory, McCartney and Barnett. The Buffaloes won the national championship in 1990, and have won a total of 28 conference championships. McCartney is the all-time leader in games coached with 153, total wins with 93, and conference wins with 58.[9] Folsom had the longest tenure as head coach, remaining in the position for 15 seasons. Harry Heller and Willis Keinholtz are tied for the highest overall winning percentage. Each served a single season and won eight of his nine games for a winning percentage of .889. Of coaches who served more than one season, Folsom leads with a .765 winning percentage. Davis, in terms of overall winning percentage, is the worst coach the Buffaloes have had with a .200 winning percentage. No Colorado coach has been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, although McCartney was inducted into the Orange Bowl Hall of Fame in 1996. Mike MacIntyre had brief success with the program. Hired on Dec. 10, 2012,[10] MacIntyre compiled a 30–44 record over five-plus seasons at Colorado. In 2016, MacIntyre lead Colorado to a 10–2 regular season and a trip to the Pac-12 Championship Game. It was the first winning season for Colorado since 2005, ending a 10-year streak of finishing below .500. 2016 was also the best season for the Buffaloes since 2001. As well, it marked their first time playing in a conference championship game since the 2005 Big 12 Championship Game. The team also went 8–2 in the Pac-12 after having five conference wins in the previous five seasons. Mike MacIntyre was named the Walter Camp 2016 Coach of the Year by the Walter Camp Foundation, the second Colorado football coach to earn the honor (Bill McCartney in 1989). MacIntyre was also awarded the 2016 Pac-12 Coach of the Year, American Football Coaches Association's coach of the year and comeback coach of the year awards, the Associated Press coach of the year, and the Eddie Robinson coach of the year by the Football Writers Association of America. In 2018, the Buffaloes started out the season 5–0 with wins against rivals Colorado State, Nebraska, Arizona State, and UCLA - however, MacIntyre was fired as the head coach on November 18, 2018, after a six-game losing streak.[11] Mike Sanford was named interim Head Coach after Karl Dorrell was fired during the 2022 season, Sanford was previously the Buffaloes Offensive Coordinator for the start of the 2022 campaign.[12] On December 3, Colorado announced Deion Sanders as Head Football Coach.[13] A traditional college football rivalry with the Nebraska Cornhuskers restarted in the 1980s (many historical documents show the importance of this game going back to 1898) when Bill McCartney declared the conference opponent to be their rival. His theory was since Nebraska was such a powerhouse team, if Colorado was able to beat them then they would be a good team. Colorado began to repeatedly threaten Nebraska in the late 1980s, following their win over the Huskers in 1986, and then surpassed the Huskers for the Big 8 crown in 1989. In 1990, Colorado beat Nebraska 27–12 in Lincoln for the first time since 1967, en route to their first national title. From 1996 to 2000, the series was extremely competitive, with the margin of victory by NU in those five years being only 15 points combined. The rivalry was further buoyed by the introduction of the Big 12 Conference in 1996, which moved Oklahoma and Oklahoma State to the southern division with the four new schools from Texas, formerly in the Southwest Conference. Nebraska had traditionally finished the Big 8 conference schedule with a rivalry game with Oklahoma, but the two were now in different divisions, which meant they met every other year in the regular season. Colorado replaced Oklahoma as Nebraska's final conference game of the regular season, which further intensified the rivalry. In 2001 No. 1 Nebraska came to Folsom Field undefeated and left at the short end of a nationally televised 62–36 blowout. Both teams departed the Big 12 in 2011, as NU headed east to join the Big Ten and the future of the rivalry was in doubt. On February 7, 2013, Colorado and Nebraska agreed to renew the rivalry.[14][15][16][17][18][19] Colorado traveled to Lincoln in 2018 and won 33–28 (winning against Nebraska for the first time since 2007 and the first time in Lincoln since 2004). On September 7, 2019, Colorado mounted an improbable comeback after being down 17–0 at half, to win the game in overtime, 34–31. After a 3-year break, Nebraska lost 36–14 to Colorado in Boulder in 2023, but then won against Colorado 28-10 in 2024. Nebraska leads the series 49–21–2 through the 2023 season.[20] Colorado's in-state rival is the Colorado State Rams of the Mountain West Conference, located north of Boulder in Fort Collins. The two schools are separated by 45 miles (72 km) and both consider it important and noteworthy to beat the other for bragging rights for the next year. The two football teams annually compete in the Rocky Mountain Showdown for the Centennial Cup, played in Denver, Fort Collins, and Boulder. The trophy takes its name from the state of Colorado's nickname of \"The Centennial State\". The Buffaloes lead the series 67–22–2 through the 2023 season.[21] The rivalry with Utah ran from 1903 to 1962, in which Utah and Colorado played each other nearly every year; through 1962 they had met 57 times.[22] At the time, it was the second-most played rivalry for both teams (Utah had played Utah State 62 times;[23] Colorado had played Colorado State 61 times[24]). The rivalry was dormant until 2011, when both teams joined the Pac-12, renewing the rivalry on an annual basis. The Colorado–Utah rivalry remains the fifth-most played rivalry in Utah's history, and eighth-most in Colorado's history.[25][26] Utah leads the series 34-32-3 through the 2022 season.[27] Colorado has participated in 29 bowl games, with a record of 12–17 (.414). Colorado has one inductee into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The following is a list of Consensus All-Americans from CU as listed[when?] in NCAA record books.[2] The following players have been honored by having their uniform numbers designated as retired numbers by the Buffaloes.[42][43] † = Posthumous honored In 2020, Colorado athletic director Rick George announced plans to re-issue uniform numbers 24, 67, and 11, with the support of the noted players (or their families).[42] Contemporary uniforms issued with those numbers will include a commemorative patch.[42] Nonetheless, no player has used any of those numbers since the announcement.[44][45][46][47] Uniform number 19 will remain unused for 19 years, after which it may be re-issued.[42] On November 1, 2023, Colorado's Big 12 opponents from 2024 through 2027 were revealed.[48] Home Schedule Away Schedule Announced schedules as of December 19, 2023.[49] Others beyond 2031: vs. North Texas, Sept. 4, 2032; at North Texas, Sept. 3, 2033; vs. Colorado State, Sept. 17, 2033; at Colorado State, Sept. 16, 2034; vs. Colorado State, Sept. 19, 2037; at Colorado State, Sept. 11, 2038.",

                "title": "Rapid Recap: Patriots Discharged by Playoff-Bound Chargers",
                "content": "Patriots.com Writer FOXBOROUGH – The Chargers punted on the first possession of their game Sunday against the New England Patriots, but from there Los Angeles posted seven-straight scoring drives while pulling away and coasting to an eventual 40-7 victory that secured them a playoff spot. Drake Maye briefly left the game for a concussion evaluation but returned and threw a long touchdown pass to Pop Douglas, one of few highlights for New England on the day. The Patriots offense struggled to sustain drives and had the game's only meaningful giveaway. Combined with the defense's inability to get off the field or force any meaningful turnovers of their own, and it was a lopsided result without many positives for the 3-13 Pats to take away. Here's how the disappointing loss went down. 1. Maye Departs Early Patriots rookie quarterback Drake Maye was briefly lost just three plays in the game, as he scrambled up the sideline on the offense's first third down and sustained a hard hit that dropped him to the ground. Maye walked off the field and into the blue medical tent before making his way to the team's locker room, and he was then announced as questionable to return with a head injury. It was the second time this season that Maye sustained a hard hit and had to depart, with the first coming in a 25-22 win over the Jets in Week 8. The Chargers opened the scoring on their next possession, converting a 4th-and-3 along the way of an 11-play, 86-yard drive. Justin Herbert laid out a perfect pass to a diving Derius Davis for a 23-yard touchdown. That came just one play after Herbert completed a 19-yard pass to Quentin Johnston on fourth down to keep the drive alive. After the Patriots offense went three-and-out with Jacoby Brissett at quarterback, the Chargers again went on a long scoring drive, lasting 12 plays and traveling 67 yards. A good tackle by Marte Mapu delivered a third-down stop, holding the Chargers to a 27-yard field goal that made it 10-0 Los Angeles. It was a rough start for the Pats, losing their starting quarterback and then watching the Chargers grab a 10-point lead. 2. Maye Re-Enters the Chat Against expectations, Maye returned to the sideline in the second quarter and re-entered the game after the Chargers took their 10-0 lead. The Gillette Stadium crowd gave the rookie QB a nice ovation as he re-took the field and Maye immediately scrambled on first down and took a hit while sliding that tacked on 15 yards for an unnecessary roughness penalty, quickly taking New England to midfield. The good vibes were short lived, as Maye turned and tried to execute a toss play but Pop Douglas couldn't handle the toss and the ball hit the ground for the second time in three possessions. This time the Chargers recovered, taking over at the New England 44. It was hard to discern what went wrong on the play, but the result was unwelcome as the Chargers would add another touchdown to their lead, making it 17-0 on a six-yard touchdown catch by Ladd McConkey. The Chargers dominated the first half while establishing the 17-point lead, holding a 21:58 to 5:07 advantage in time of possession, while stacking 15 first downs to New England's two, both of which came via penalty. Also among the bad news was the loss of Christian Gonzalez who suffered a concussion while trying to make a second-quarter tackle and was ruled out of the game just before halftime. 3. Maye Takes a Shot to Pop Things were looking bleak as the Patriots got the ball back just before the two-minute warning but that's when the rookie quarterback helped deliver a spark of life. First, Maye threw an 18-yard strike to Kendrick Bourne on a crossing route, and then followed that up with a 12-yard scramble that put the Pats in Chargers territory. On the next play, Chargers defender Bud Dupree jumped offsides, handing the Patriots a free play. Maye made the most of it, heaving the ball to the end zone with pressure in his face. Pop Douglas saw the ball in the air, pulled up and made a great adjustment to come down with the catch just inside the end zone for a quick-strike touchdown. That cut the lead to 17-7 and turned around New England's rough start, but the Chargers stayed aggressive with their final possession of the half, going for a 4th-and-3 and converting it in Patriots territory. It was a risky play with under 30 seconds left, but when Yannick Ngakoue took a roughing the passer penalty on the very next play it moved LA into scoring territory. The Chargers tacked on a 38-yard field goal to take a 20-7 lead into the locker room, as the Patriots defense could not deliver a stop and build off of the momentum from Douglas' score. 4. Chargers keep piling it on After a quick Patriots three-and-out to open the third quarter, the Chargers once again executed a long, sustained drive and capped it off with a touchdown bomb. It was a 10-play, 94-yard drive, as Herbert lofted a perfect throw to McConkey for a 40-yard touchdown that made it 27-7 Chargers midway through the third quarter and effectively sealed the win for LA. After forcing a punt on the Chargers first possession of the game, LA scored three touchdowns and two field goals on their next five possessions, pulling away from a Patriots defense that was on their heels and getting carved up. Two failed Patriots 4th-down attempts set the Chargers up for 10 more points as the lead grew to 30 points. 5. Patriots are now 3-13 With the loss, the Patriots fall to 3-13 on the 2024 season while losing their sixth straight game for the second time this season. Maye's early departure set an unfortunate tone but it mattered little when the defense allowed scores on four of the Chargers five first-half possessions. The Patriots offense was clunky on their own, contributing a momentum-killing fumble when the game was still close, but the defense couldn't get a stop or turnover to stem the tide and open the door for a realistic comeback attempt. Los Angeles kept adding to their lead every time they touched the ball and thoroughly controlled the time of possession throughout the game. Now the Patriots have one more game against a Buffalo team that might have little to play for if they beat the Jets and lock up the AFC's second overall seed.

                "title": "Chargers Patriots Week 17 Game Recap",
                "content": "Editorial Director The Chargers are now 10-6 after they trounced the Patriots with a 40-7 win on Saturday. Here are five takeaways from Week 17. 1. Chargers clinch a playoff berth Step 1 is complete. The Chargers clinched a playoff berth Saturday as they walloped the Patriots with a 40-7 road win. \"I can't wait for our new season to begin,\" Derwin James, Jr. said in a joyous postgame locker room. Justin Herbert added: \"It's a testament to all the hard work we put in this offseason. The way things have gone, it's been an honor to play alongside this team. We had a huge opportunity today and we went out and took it.\" Tuli Tuipulotu said: \"Great vibes. We're always happy with the win but we're extra happy that we clinched today.\" The lopsided win ensured that the Bolts would make the playoffs in Year 1 under Jim Harbaugh, but the Chargers Head Coach deflected the credit to his players. \"There's no coach who could have it better than coaching these players. Nobody,\" Harbaugh quipped. \"Maybe the only one would be future [me].\" Either way, it's been clear for awhile that the first season of Chargers General Manager Joe Hortiz and Harbaugh has been a resounding success after the group took over a five-win team in January. \"They've done such a great job of getting the right guys here,\" Herbert said. \"You look in that locker room and everyone plays for each other.\" jim and joe 💙 pic.twitter.com/pNWV0rhxJn The Chargers knew all week that they would clinch a postseason spot with a win in New England. They pounced early, dominating on both sides of the ball on the way to their largest margin of victory since a 35-point win during the 2019 season. All in all, the Bolts outgained the Patriots by nearly 250 yards as they turned a double-digit halftime lead into a rout over the final two quarters. \"All three phases showed up today and that's the type of football we want to be playing in December and January and hopefully on,\" Herbert said. \"Especially in these big games, that's what you want to see.\" Morgan Fox added: \"At the end of the day, it's what you play for. Now you take this group to the dance and see what we can do in the playoffs.\" The Chargers ended the game in the No. 6 spot but could still end up as either the fifth, sixth or seventh seed depending on outcomes of other games. The Bolts are at the Raiders in Week 18. The date and time for that game is still be to be determined. Harbaugh and his players said postgame there is more on the horizon for this group. \"The antidote for complacency is great leadership and that's what our players have given us,\" Harbaugh said. \"Now it's onward and keep grinding. \"Keep tightening up as we move forward, that's our mission now,\" Harbaugh added. \"11 [wins] sounds better than 10 so now we're going to go get ourselves prepared for our next game.\" Bradley Bozeman added: \"We know we're going to the playoffs and we're playing in the first round, but that's all we're promised. Go in and get back to work.\" 2. Offense rolls past Pats Greg Roman said last week that he thought the Bolts offense was starting to peak at the right time. Turns out the Chargers Offensive Coordinator was spot on with his foreshadowing. \"We had a great plan,\" Herbert said. \"All week, we knew how big of a game this was for us and guys were dialed in, focused. We executed today and it was awesome to see.\" The Bolts offense produced perhaps their best outing of the season Saturday as they set season bests in multiple categories. Points? Yep. The Bolts previous high was 34 at home against both the Bengals and Broncos. First downs? Check. The Chargers had 27 of them, topping their previous best of 24. Time of possession? The Chargers held the ball for a whopping 40 minutes and 34 seconds on Saturday. Total yards? The Bolts had 428, just seven shy of their season high. The Chargers were also money on third downs, converting 10 of 17 tries for a stellar 58.8 percent success rate. \"We definitely put it together today, for sure,\" Bozeman said. Ladd McConkey set a pair of franchise rookie records and Herbert led the way with a dominating performance in which he threw for 281 yards and three scores while making history in the process. Herbert surpassed 20,619 career passing yards in the first half Saturday, which passed Hall of Famer Peyton Manning for the most in NFL history through the first five seasons of a career. Herbert also threw a pair of touchdowns in the opening half in New England and became just the third player in NFL history with 3,000 passing yards and 20 passing touchdowns in each of his first five pro seasons. \"Justin Herbert played a near flawless game,\" Harbaugh said. He later added: \"I can't think of one play or one throw or one check that he made … just an incredible performance by an incredible player.\" 3. James leads the way for defense It wasn't just the Bolts offense that was lights out Saturday. The Chargers defense showed up ready to go from the opening snap as the unit swarmed the Patriots all game long. \"We played great,\" Tuipulotu said. \"Coming into this game, we wanted to play a complete game and I feel like, as a defense, we did that.\" The defense got off to a red-shot start by allowing just six total yards on New England's first six plays. \"All of us just being on the same page,\" Kristian Fulton said. \"When we communicate and guys are talking pre snap, it allows us to play fast and play physical. We wanted to set the tone early and I feel like we did that.\" James took over from there as he had a masterful performance with a pair of sacks and a fumble recovery. The Bolts do-it-all safety had half of the team's four sacks as Tuipulotu and Mack also each had one. \"Blitzing Derwin was working,\" Fox said with a laugh. \"Having a weapon like DJ, anytime you can send somebody down and not get blocked, it's huge. Once we started bringing pressure and rushing, guys were winning across the board.\" Harbaugh said of James: \"He does it every single game.\" James, who has developed into a lethal player in his nickel role, set the tone early and often for the Bolts on Saturday. \"[They] just wanted me around the ball and cause havoc,\" James said. \"I feel like my teammates did a great job covering in the secondary so I could get the sacks, and other guys holding the edge so I could get the sacks. A lot of team ball out there.\" Overall, the unit allowed just 181 total yards and 11 first downs, both marks that are the second-lowest totals of the season behind a Week 2 win over the Panthers. Get an inside look at the postgame celebration from the Bolts 40-7 win over the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium. 4. Harbaugh gets aggressive on 4th downs In recent weeks, Harbaugh had decided to punt on fourth down twice while in opposing territory. He flipped the script Saturday, crediting a strong day from the Chargers offensive line for giving him the belief to keep the offense on the field. \"We've got No. 10 back there. And the way the offensive line was performing, the big guys up front getting the job done,\" Harbaugh said. \"They were handling their man, they're handling the movement, they're handling the games and the twists. \"Our guys executed at a super high level, so yeah, that gave me a lot of confidence that Justin was getting the protection,\" Harbaugh added. \"If he can finish the throwing motion then I know that the ball is going to be thrown accurately.\" The Bolts first went for it on fourth-and-3 from the Patriots 42-yard line late in the first quarter. Herbert found Quentin Johnston for 19 yards to move the sticks as Derius Davis caught a 19-yard score on the very next play. Harbaugh also kept his offense on the field in the waning moments of the first half. With the Bolts up 17-7, they had fourth-and-3 from the Patriots 44. Once again, Herbert had time and found Stone Smartt through the air for a first down. The Chargers later kicked a field goal, one of four makes on the day for Cameron Dicker. Overall, the Chargers converted both of their fourth-down tries Saturday, which led to 10 points. \"When you go for it on fourth down and get it every time, it shows the offense the trust he has in us,\" Bozeman said. Harbaugh added: \"I thought that was the best offensive line play we've had the entire season.\" Browse through live action photos of the Bolts Week 17 matchup against the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium 5. Dobbins scores in return J.K. Dobbins showed his perseverance one again. The Chargers running back got back in the action Saturday after missing the past four games with a knee injury he suffered back in Week 12 against Baltimore. The Bolts activated Dobbins off Injured Reserve on Friday. \"I felt great. It was a good day,\" Dobbins said. \"Got to get better, but it was a great day.\" Dobbins was both efficient and explosive in his first game back as he finished with 76 yards on 19 carries with a long of 13 yards. Dobbins also punctuated his return with a 2-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter. \"He brings so much energy to our run game and he's great out of the backfield in the pass game,\" Herbert said. \"And one of the most underappreciated aspects of his game is [pass] protection. He does such a great job on third down picking up blitzes and he knows exactly what he's doing.\" Dobbins' return helped the Bolts run for 147 yards against the Patriots. In the four games Dobbins missed, the Bolts averaged roughly 75 rushing yards per game. \"Really proud of J.K. Dobbins … and everything he's overcome,\" Harbaugh said.

                "content": "NEW! Find where to watch all of your favorite sports! Ladd McConkey scores on a 40-yard touchdown pass from Justin Herbert to extend the Chargers' lead to 27-7 vs. the Patriots. (0:20) FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- As New England Patriots coach Jerod Mayo elected to punt from his team's own 28-yard line, down 30 points with 11 minutes left in the fourth quarter of Saturday's game, the few Patriots fans left began to chant \"Fire Mayo.\" It was that kind of game Saturday, as the Los Angeles Chargers dominated the struggling Patriots in front of a barren crowd at Gillette Stadium en route to a 40-7 win. It was the Patriots' second home loss by 30-plus points this century. The victory clinched a playoff spot for the Chargers and gave them double-digit wins for the third time since 2010. The loss dropped the Patriots to 3-13, their second straight season with 13 losses, but it moved them closer to clinching a top pick in the NFL draft. The Patriots will end their season next week with a home game against the Buffalo Bills. The Chargers will head to Las Vegas for their season finale against the Raiders, a game that could have playoff-seeding implications. The Chargers would secure the fifth seed with a win over the Raiders and a Steelers loss next week. Describe the game in two words: Thunderous trouncing. Saturday's win was the Chargers' best performance of the season, scoring a season-high 40 points. A week after the Patriots nearly beat the Bills, the Chargers pummeled them from the beginning of this game to secure a playoff spot. Promising trend I: J.K. Dobbins looks healthy. Dobbins had been one of the best running backs in the NFL, but a sprained left MCL sidelined him for the Chargers' past four games. He appeared to be his old self in his first game back Saturday, as he scored a touchdown and gained 76 rushing yards, which is more than any Chargers running back had in his absence. Promising trend II: The offensive line protected Herbert. This had been an issue all season, and without starting right guard Trey Pipkins II, it appeared it could continue Saturday. But the Chargers had one of their best blocking games of the season. The Patriots pressured Herbert on only six of his 39 dropbacks (15%), his second-lowest pressure rate in a game this season (12% in Week 11 versus the Bengals). -- Kris Rhim Next game: at Raiders (TBD, Sunday) Quarterback Drake Maye left the game on the Patriots' third offensive play after Chargers defensive back Cam Hart's helmet made contact with Maye's helmet, providing a scare on a day when the team was never competitive. Maye remained down after the hit, then visited the medical tent and locker room to be evaluated for a concussion. He eventually returned in the second quarter and was one of the few reasons for Patriots fans to watch in a game the Chargers controlled throughout. Cornerback Christian Gonzalez -- along with Maye, arguably the team's two best players -- wasn't as fortunate. He left in the second quarter to be evaluated for a concussion and was later ruled out. The game was a disappointment for the Patriots, who were hoping to build momentum after playing the AFC East-champion Bills tough last week in a 24-21 loss. Instead, it sparked more questions about first-year head coach Jerod Mayo and the direction of the franchise. Describe the game in two words: No charge. The Patriots ran 15 offensive plays in the first half, tied for the fewest by any team in a first half in the past five seasons -- a reflection of how they were outclassed from the start. Pivotal play: Trailing 10-0 midway through the second quarter, Maye's errant pitch to receiver DeMario Douglas was recovered by Chargers safety Derwin James Jr. and quickly turned into a touchdown to give the Chargers a 17-0 lead. It was the Patriots' 22nd giveaway of the season and their league-worst 29th fumble. Eye-popping stat: With his 36-yard touchdown strike to Douglas, Maye now has three touchdown passes this season of at least 35 air yards, the most such TD passes by a Patriots quarterback since Tom Brady had three in 2009. Biggest hole in the game plan: Mayo said in a pregame radio interview that Antonio Gibson would start at running back over Rhamondre Stevenson after Stevenson fumbled for a league-high seventh time last week, but Stevenson ended up starting the game. Perhaps Mayo misspoke -- otherwise, it appeared the Patriots forgot to follow their own plan. Stevenson finished with two carries for 1 yard. Gibson picked up some garbage-time action to tally 63 yards on 12 carries. Silver lining: Cole Strange, the Patriots' 2022 first-round pick, who spent his first two seasons at left guard, made his first career start at center and seemed to account well for himself. Strange tore his patella tendon last December and didn't return to the game-day roster until last week at Buffalo as a backup option along the offensive line and on the field goal protection unit. So this was his most extended action since the injury, and he showed he could be a viable option at center in the future. -- Mike Reiss Next game: vs. Bills (TBD, Sunday)",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) As spontaneous celebrations rippled throughout the Los Angeles Chargers' locker room after their resounding 40-7 win over the New England Patriots, coach Jim Harbaugh grabbed general manager Joe Hortiz and wrapped him up in a bear hug. “Love you!” Harbaugh said. “Love you!” Hortiz responded. “Great job! Let's keep it going,” Harbaugh replied, finally loosening his grasp. The Chargers (10-6) are back in the playoffs. But the message is clear: They have their eyes on achieving much more. Justin Herbert threw three touchdown passes and Los Angeles locked up its second playoff appearance in three seasons with Saturday's victory. “We had a good opportunity tonight and we went out and took it,\" Herbert said. “We had a good plan. All week we knew how big of a game this was for us. Guys were dialed in, focused and we executed today.” It also secured the fourth postseason appearance in Harbaugh’s five seasons as an NFL coach, adding to the three he made during his stint with the San Francisco 49ers. “You talk to them and there's more to do,” Harbaugh said. “There's no coach who could have it better than to be coaching these players. Nobody. Maybe the only person would be future us, could have it better than us.” Herbert finished 26 of 38 for 281 yards to become the third player in NFL history with at least 3,000 passing yards and 20 touchdown passes in each of his first five seasons. He joins Pro Football Hall of Famer Peyton Manning and Russell Wilson. Ladd McConkey had eight catches for 94 yards and pulled in TD throws of 6 and 40 yards. With a 10-yard reception in the second quarter, he passed 1,000 yards receiving for the season, making him the third Chargers rookie receiver to reach that milestone. JK Dobbins rushed 19 times for 76 yards and a TD. The Patriots (3-13) have lost six straight games, their second such losing streak of the season. They are now 2-14 the last two seasons at home. “We just didn’t play well enough in any phase of the game,” coach Jerod Mayo said. “No complementary football, and that’s what you get.” Asked if he thinks he is coaching for his job, Mayo said it comes with the territory. “I’m always under pressure and it’s been that way for a very long time, not just when I became the head coach of the Patriots,\" he said. New England quarterback Drake Maye finished 12 of 22 for 117 yards and a touchdown. He became the first rookie quarterback in franchise history with a TD pass in eight straight games. But he was sacked four times, and a second-quarter fumble marked his eighth straight game with at least one turnover. Los Angeles outgained New England 428-181 for the game. Maye briefly left the game to be evaluated for a head injury following a blow to his helmet in the first quarter. He was scrambling near the sideline on third down of the Patriots’ first possession when he was hit by Chargers cornerback Cam Hart, jarring the ball loose as Maye spun out of bounds. No flag was thrown on the play and Maye stayed down on the turf for several seconds before eventually getting up and jogging off the field. He initially sat on the bench before going to the medical tent for evaluation. He was replaced by backup Jacoby Brissett in the next series, which ended in a punt. But after further evaluation in the locker room and a Cameron Dicker 27-yard field goal put the Chargers in front 10-0, Maye returned to the game for the Patriots’ third series, at the 10:15 mark of the second quarter. Maye scrambled for 9 yards on his first play back, ending with him being hit by linebacker Junior Colson as he slid to the ground. Colson was flagged for unnecessary roughness. Five plays later, Maye mistimed a toss to Demario Douglas, causing a fumble that was recovered by Derwin James. The Chargers took over on the New England 24 and nine plays later, Herbert connected with McConkey for a 6-yard touchdown pass to put Los Angeles in front 17-0. Chargers: WR Joshua Palmer left the game in the third quarter with a heel injury. DB Elijah Molden limped off the field after a collision in the third quarter. He returned but was later driven off the field on a golf cart because of a shin injury. Patriots: In addition to Maye, CB Christian Gonzalez left the game in the second quarter to be evaluated for a head injury and was later ruled out with a concussion. McConkey, a second-round draft selection, also set a Chargers rookie record for catches, surpassing Keenan Allen, who had 71 in 2013. Chargers: Visit Las Vegas in their regular-season finale. Patriots: Host Buffalo next Sunday in their season finale. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "content": "Senior Staff Writer INGLEWOOD, Calif. – It took the slimmest of margins, but the Rams (10-6) found a way to hold on for a narrow 13-9 win over the Cardinals (7-9) Saturday night at SoFi Stadium. Up 13-9 with 2:01 remaining, the Rams watched the Cardinals – armed with two timeouts – drive downfield all the way to the Rams' 5-yard line. Then cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon corralled Arizona quarterback Kyler Murray's deflected pass in the endzone for the game-sealing interception, which was upheld upon further review by the officials, allowing the Rams to survive. Wide receiver Puka Nacua finished with 10 catches for 129 yards in the win, which was achieved despite the Cardinals winning the time of possession battle 36:55-23:05. Defensive end Braden Fiske finished with two sacks in the win, and outside linebacker Michael Hoecht had his third blocked kick of the season. Running back Kyren Williams had 56 rushing yards and 1 touchdown, while kicker Joshua Karty made his lone field goal attempt (53 yards) and extra point attempt. With their win over the Cardinals and the Bengals' win over the Broncos, the Rams can clinch the NFC West in Week 17 via the Strength of Victory tiebreaker over the Seahawks with three wins from any of these five teams this weekend: Commanders, Bills, 49ers, Vikings, Browns. Here is the complete game recap: Neither team was able to get into a rhythm offensively early on until late in the first quarter, when the Cardinals mounted a lengthy drive that went reached 11:04 in the second quarter. However, that series was upended after the Rams stonewalled Cardinals running back James Conner for no gain on 4th and 1 from the Rams 14. The Rams finally broke through with 3:23 in the first half on a 1-yard run by Williams to take a 7-0 lead. The series was helped by explosive completions from Stafford of 29 yards to Cooper Kupp and 15 yards to Nacua. A 53-yard field goal by Karty with 27 seconds left in the second quarter gave the Rams a 10-0 lead going into halftime. Receiving the second-half kickoff, the Cardinals opened the third quarter with a lengthy scoring drive finished off with a 1-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Kyler Murray to tight end Trey McBride. However, the ensuing extra point attempt was blocked by Rams outside linebacker Michael Hoecht, giving the Rams a 10-6 lead with 8:31 left in the third quarter.

Los Angeles had the ball once, and that drive lasted just 2 minutes and 12 seconds, whereas Arizona had the ball for 12:48 of that period. The second lengthy drive spilled into the fourth quarter before L.A.'s defense got a third down stop and held Arizona to a 28-yard field goal to maintain a slim 10-9 lead with 14 minutes left in the fourth quarter. A promising drive on the ensuing possession left the Rams settling for a 25-yard field goal by Karty for a 13-9 lead with 6:33 remaining. On the following series, Kobie Turner's key second-down sack ultimately forced the Cardinals to go for it on 4th and 10 from the Rams 40. Murray's desperation heave landed in the arms of Rams safety Kamren Kinchens for the interception, giving the ball back to the Rams with 3:02 remaining. However, the Rams were forced to punt on the ensuing possession, giving the ball back to the Cardinals at their own 36 with 2:01 remaining. Witherspoon came up with the big interception with 42 seconds left, allowing the Rams run out the remaining clock to secure the win.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Los Angeles Rams are one step closer to clinching the NFC West title after defeating the division rival Arizona Cardinals, prevailing with a 13-9 win in an ugly, mistake-filled game that was probably too close for comfort Saturday night from SoFi Stadium. This game started extremely slowly, with the teams combining for seven punts and a turnover on downs on the first eight drives of the game. That turnover on downs came deep in Rams territory, with a pair of rookie Rams defenders stoning James Conner on a fourth-and-1, preventing the Cardinals from taking an early lead. The Rams would eventually get the game's first touchdown, which came on a 1-yard plunge from Kyren Williams at the tail end of a drive marked by some pretty remarkable throws from Matthew Stafford to Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua. The Rams would only manage a couple of field goals throughout the remainder of the game, but that proved to be enough as the Cardinals struggled to get anything going offensively and failed to capitalized on their opportunities when they did -- including when they missed the extra point on their lone touchdown, which prevented them from kicking a game-tying field goal late in the game. Kyler Murray ended up being intercepted in front of the end zone on each of Arizona's final two drives, with Kamren Kinchens and Ahkello Witherspoon making great plays on the ball to end a couple of scoring threats. The victory was L.A.'s fifth straight as it pulled to the top of the division, storming up the standings from behind the Cardinals and Seahawks. They can clinch a division title with strength-of-victory tiebreakers as soon as Sunday, and will otherwise have an opportunity to do so next week with a victory over the Seahawks. Mostly because they were playing against the Cardinals. The Rams did not play particularly well. Matthew Stafford was uncharacteristically inaccurate. Kyren Williams didn't have a big game running the ball. They gained just over 250 total yards, collected just 12 first downs and held the ball for just 23 minutes of game time. And yet, they managed to come away with 13 points, which was all they needed. Miscues and missed opportunities. The Cardinals took nine penalties. They scored a touchdown on just one of their four trips inside the red zone. Their extra point on that score was blocked. They went 6-for-13 on third down but 0-for-2 on fourth. Kyler Murray took four sacks, including one that lost an incredible 18 yards. He also threw a pair of late interceptions. That's how you lose a game where you outgain the other team by more nearly 150 yards and control the ball for nearly two-thirds of the game's running time. Early in the second quarter, after they had put together the first drive of the game of any consequence, the Cardinals found themselves facing a fourth-and-1 deep in Rams territory. They brought running back James Conner on the field, then handed him the ball up the middle. And Conner, who came into the game questionable with a knee injury and eventually left it with the same ailment, got absolutely stuffed by a pair of Rams rookies. The Rams wouldn't even score on their ensuing drive, but stoning the Cards on their first real opportunity kept the game scoreless for a few more possessions, and they would ultimately get the game's first score a few drives later. You know where we had to go with this one. Our long national nightmare ended: Finally! Trey McBride got himself into the end zone. He actually nearly caught a touchdown pass earlier in the drive, only to have it knocked down by a Rams defensive back. It took a couple more plays, but McBride put an end to the league's most ignominious streak. And now we can all just appreciate what a good player he is, instead of worrying about a silly statistical quirk. The Rams are now 10-6 and have a chance to clinch the NFC West on Sunday if they get the right combination of wins and losses to capture the strength-of-victory tiebreaker over the Seahawks. Otherwise, they have the opportunity to do so next week, when they play Seattle in their regular-season finale. The Cardinals fell to 7-9 with this loss and have now dropped five of their last six. They finish up their season next week with a visit from the 49ers, who will be playing on a short week after taking on the Lions on Monday night. Ahkello Witherspoon comes away with the interception to win it for the Rams. Ball got knocked up into the air and Witherspoon went full body extension to haul it in. Had full control the whole time even while it hit the ground. Wow. This is some pretty bad clock management here from the Rams. They should have called their timeout before that third-down play. Cards caught a big break with both the punt being downed before the two-minute warning and now the injury to Kam Kinchens, which means Arizona still has two timeouts left with first-and-10 from the 20. Huge stop for Arizona as Puka slipped on his route and Stafford's throw was a bit too far inside. Cards have another chance to drive for a game-winning touchdown, armed with two timeouts. Kyler Murray tried to get himself a scramble-drill touchdown pass on fourth-and-10, but Kam Kinchens had other ideas. The play at first conjured images of Murray's Hail Mary touchdown to DeAndre Hopkins a few years back, but this time it was the opposing DB who came down with the ball as Kinchens picked him off just outside the end zone. Just like the Cardinals, the Rams stalled out in the low red zone. A bunch of missed opportunities for both teams tonight. Arizona needs a touchdown to take the lead. Puka is up to 10 catches for 129 yards on 12 targets. Baller. After the curious decision by the Rams to punt on fourth-and-1, the Cards drove 80 yards deep into Rams territory but stalled inside the red zone. Chad Ryland field goal makes it a 1-point game with 14 minutes remaining. A couple of nice scramble drill throws from Kyler to Harrison have the Cardinals in position to score again. By the way, they now have the ball just 1 yard away from the spot where the Rams punted. Kurt Warner just compared him to Anquan Boldin. (Warner played with Boldin in Arizona.) Also, this is nuts: Extremely suspect decision to punt on fourth-and-1 here. Rams pinned the Cardinals deep but if you can't get 1 yard, what are you doing as an offense? McBride FINALLY has his touchdown catch. Nice play design with him and the other tight ends shifting out to the perimeter and then McBride motioning back inside and getting a quick screen with Elijah Higgins and Tip Reiman blocking for him. The streak continues... Ahkello Witherspoon knocked down what looked like it was about to be Trey McBride's first TD of the year. L.A. got into Cards territory again but stalled out about and had to settle for a 53-yard field goal from Joshua Karty. That said, they look like they will take a two-score lead into the half, unless Arizona puts together a pretty quick scoring drive in the next 27 seconds. The Rams caught a big break on that third-and-10. Puka Nacua looked pretty easily short of the first down but the Rams got their next play off before there could be a review. The Rams will have a chance to take a two-score lead here at the end of the half. Arizona has had one real drive with any success moving the ball, and it ended with a turnover on downs deep in L.A. territory. Kyren gets the scoring started by plunging in from the 1-yard line. It's a 9-play, 60-yard scoring drive, highlighted by several really nice plays from Stafford and capped off by Williams' 16th touchdown of the season. Matthew Stafford NEVER scrambles. I believe he had one scramble all season coming into this game. He just picked up a huge first down with his legs right there, giving the Rams an opportunity to score. And he just did it again, this time to Nacua. Sheeeeesh. Well, that throw looked much more like the Matthew Stafford we've seen throughout his career. Outrageous throw under pressure on the deep corner route to Cooper Kupp. Got clobbered as he let it go. James Conner is now being looked at by trainers on the sideline. He was questionable coming into this game after being limited all week. All we hear about McBride lately is about how he hasn't scored a receiving touchdown yet this year. But the dude is just an awesome player, as he showed on that catch over the middle. Unfortunately, it's coming back due to an illegal man downfield penalty. The Rams are averaging 2.8 yards per play. This is some truly gross offense. Just when it looked like we might get some points, instead we will not. Arizona drove deep into Rams territory but rookie DL Jared Verse stuffed James Conner on fourth-and-1 to get the ball back for L.A. Marvin Harrison Jr.'s best game of the season came back in Week 2 against these same Rams. He had 2 touchdowns in the first quarter, after which the Cardinals were blowing the Rams out and basically ran the ball the rest of the day. He has 2 catches for 41 yards so far. We've now opened the game with five consecutive punts. Maybe we will see some points soon. Kyler Murray tried to get into his improvisation mode on third-and-long, but there was nowhere for him to go with several Rams defenders awaiting him in the backfield. Making matters worse, he tripped over his feet and took an 18-yard sack. Yikes. Marvin Harrison Jr. has been almost exclusively asked to make contested catches this season, and has generally struggled to do so. But he just made a fantastic grab to get the Cardinals out of the shadow of their own end zone. Nice job of getting the ball on his back shoulder. Very strange start for Stafford. He missed on back-to-back throws on first and second down to open L.A.'s second drive. Inaccurate on first and then not on the same page as the receiver on second. Rams punted again after that. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) The Los Angeles Rams spent the entire second half struggling on offense while bending just enough on defense to preserve a tiny lead. Arizona even backed Los Angeles into its own end zone in the final minute, needing just one big play to steal a win. Ahkello Witherspoon and the Rams hung on by their fingertips, and now they're on the brink of another NFC West title. Witherspoon made a diving interception on a deflected pass in the end zone with 37 seconds to play, and the Rams barely maintained command of the division race with a 13-9 victory over the Cardinals on Saturday night. Puka Nacua had 129 yards receiving and Kyren Williams scored the only touchdown for the Rams (10-6), who grinded through a difficult offensive night and survived a hair-raising fourth quarter for their fifth consecutive victory. “We didn’t do a whole lot great, to be honest with you,” said Matthew Stafford, who passed for 189 yards in the Rams’ ninth win in 11 games. “Didn’t run it great. Didn’t throw it great. But found a way to get a win and get enough points.” The Rams host Seattle (9-7) in their regular-season finale next weekend, but they could already have coach Sean McVay’s fourth division title clinched before then. If the Bills, Browns, Vikings, Commanders and 49ers combine for three wins - or two wins and a tie - over the next two days, Los Angeles will be NFC West champions based on its strength of schedule, no matter what happens against Seattle. If the Rams don’t get that strength-of-schedule help this week, they’re still in command of the division race: The Seahawks will have to beat the Rams and get help from multiple teams to claim the West while denying the Rams’ sixth playoff berth in eight seasons under McVay. The Rams narrowly avoided a winner-take-all finale against Seattle by holding off the Cardinals, who played a tremendous defensive game one week after getting eliminated from playoff contention. Kyler Murray passed for 321 yards and threw two late interceptions for Arizona (7-9), which managed just three points out of three drives into Rams territory in the fourth quarter. Arizona drove to the Los Angeles 5 in the final minute, but the Rams called an all-out blitz on first down. Murray’s quick pass deflected off tight end Trey McBride's helmet, and Witherspoon made a 10-fingertip interception in the end zone that was upheld by video review even though the ball touched the ground while between his hands. “Just the way the NFL works, you never really know, honestly,” Witherspoon said. “I thought I stuck it. You saw by my celebration. But once I saw that replay, any time that ball hits the ground, you never know.” McBride made both his 100th reception and his first touchdown catch of the season for Arizona, which has lost five of six. McBride had 12 catches for 123 yards, and Marvin Harrison Jr. had 96 yards receiving. “The ball didn’t bounce our way,” Arizona coach Jonathan Gannon said. “Got the ball at the end, thought we were going to win, and they made a good play. It stings because we’re there, but we’re not there. When we play our brand of ball, we can compete and beat everyone, but it doesn’t mean a lot.” Williams' 14th rushing TD of the season 3:23 before halftime opened the scoring and capped the Rams' first good drive. Arizona finally scored midway through the third quarter on a 1-yard catch by McBride, who got his first touchdown on the 98th reception of his franchise-record season for a tight end. The Cardinals got to 10-9 early in the fourth quarter with Chad Ryland's short field goal after their second straight impressive drive. Rams rookie Joshua Karty made his second field goal with 6:41 left. Arizona drove to the Rams 40, but stalled before rookie Kam Kinchens intercepted Murray's fourth-down heave to the goal line with 3:02 left. But Kinchens cost the Rams a few dozen yards of field position by returning it to the 11 instead of batting it down, and the Rams' offense punted the ball back to the Cards just 1:01 later. “I felt like for sure we were going to win that game,” Murray said. “We drove down the field, and (there's) nothing the defense can do to stop us, and at the end a (lousy) turn of events. We got unlucky.” Michael Hoecht blocked Arizona's extra-point attempt in the third quarter. The 6-foot-4 linebacker leads the NFL this season with three blocked kicks, the second-most in Rams history. Cardinals: CB Garrett Williams was evaluated for a concussion in the second half. ... RB James Conner suited up despite a knee injury, but had just four ineffective carries before getting shut down. Rams: RT Rob Havenstein sat out with a shoulder injury incurred during practice this week. The veteran missed his fifth game of the season, and backup Joe Noteboom committed three holding penalties. The Rams have won three straight and 11 of their last 15 over Seattle. The Cardinals finish at home against the 49ers. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "title": "Bengals vs. Broncos score, takeaways: Cincinnati wins wild one in OT to keep playoff hopes alive - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Cincinnati Bengals are still alive in the AFC playoff race. Led by Joe Burrow's four touchdowns (one rushing), the Bengals recorded a 30-24 overtime win over the Denver Broncos, who missed a golden opportunity to clinch their first playoff berth since 2015. Denver forced overtime after Marvin Mims Jr. made an incredible touchdown catch on fourth down in the final seconds of regulation. The Bengals prevailed, though, when Burrow hit Tee Higgins for the game-winning score with 1:07 left in overtime. Burrow was magnificent, throwing for 412 yards and three touchdowns on 39 of 49 passing. He also ran for a score that gave Cincinnati a 24-17 lead late in regulation. All three of his touchdown passes went to Higgins, who caught 11 passes for 131 yards while playing through multiple injuries. Cincinnati won despite starting the game with consecutive drives that ended with unsuccessful fourth-down conversion attempts. The Bengals also survived Cade York's 33-yard field goal attempt hitting the left upright on their second drive of overtime. The Broncos lost despite a solid game by Nix and a pass rush that sacked Burrow seven times. Here's a full breakdown of how the Bengals kept their season alive. The Bengals weren't perfect by any means on Saturday, but they were certainly resilient. In a season that had previously been defined by near misses, the Bengals overcame their mistakes by coming up with game-changing plays when it mattered most. Once again, Burrow gave the Bengals an MVP-caliber performance. Facing Denver's vaunted pass rush, Burrow stood tall and completed a litany of clutch completions, none bigger than his 31-yard completion to Higgins in overtime that set up their game-winning touchdown connection. One of Burrow's biggest plays took place late in the third quarter after a penalty wiped out his nifty 50-yard touchdown pass to Andrei Iosivas. Earlier this year, a similar penalty would have signaled a downward spiral for the Bengals, who started the year with a 4-8 record. But Burrow refused to let that happen, as he kept the drive alive with a 19-yard run on third-and-13 one play later. The drive ended with Burrow's second touchdown pass of the game to Higgins. Burrow and Higgins were great, but they had plenty of help. Ja'Marr Chase caught nine passes for 102 yards, tight end Mike Gesicki caught 10 of 12 targets for 82 yards, and running back Chase Brown had 91 all-purpose before leaving the game with an ankle injury late in regulation. Defensively, the Bengals stepped up when the offense came up short on its early fourth-down attempts. Cincinnati allowed just three points in the first half and forced two crucial punts in overtime. Linebacker Germaine Pratt's interception of Nix late in the fourth quarter set up Burrow's go-ahead touchdown run. Denver's defense entered the night with a league-high 51 sacks, and added to its tally on Saturday night. Zach Allen was virtually unblockable with 3.5 sacks that included 1.5 sacks on consecutive plays on the first drive of overtime that forced a Bengals punt. But when the pass rush didn't get home, Burrow more often than not made the Broncos defense play. After stopping the Bengals twice on fourth down early in the game, Denver allowed Cincinnati to convert on 7 of its 13 third-down attempts. They also allowed the Bengals to convert on a key fourth down (an 11-yard completion from Burrow to Brown) that led to Cincinnati's go-ahead touchdown early in the fourth quarter after Denver had tied the score moments earlier. Offensively, the Broncos received a gritty game from Nix, whose night included a perfectly thrown touchdown pass to Courtland Sutton, a 51-yard bomb to Mims and his game-tying touchdown pass to Mims that forced overtime. But Nix and the rest of the Broncos offense were unable to rekindle that magic in overtime. It's safe to wonder whether or not Broncos coach Sean Payton elected to play it safe on offense in overtime, as Denver could have clinched a playoff berth with a tie. After its defense forced a punt to start overtime, the Broncos offense had a chance to make a game-changing play. Facing a third-and-6 from its own 14-yard line, Nix dropped back and fired a deep pass to Troy Franklin, who was wide open roughly 30 yards downfield. But Nix overthrew Franklin, who dove for the ball but was unable to make the catch. The Broncos punted instead of possibly driving for the game-winning score. While the night had more \"impressive plays,\" the play of the game has got to be Burrow's game-winning touchdown pass to Higgins. The score was the Bengals' first overtime touchdown in franchise history. The Bengals will travel to Pittsburgh next week for another must-win game. Cincinnati will also need Denver to lose next week against the Chiefs, who will likely rest Patrick Mahomes and other key starters with the AFC's No. 1 seed already secured. The Bengals also need the Colts and Dolphins to lose one of their final two games. The Broncos simply need to defeat the Chiefs. If they do, they'll finally snap their playoff drought, which currently stands at nine years. Burrow hits Higgins for a short TD, as Bengals prevail, 30-24. Bengals keep their playoff hopes alive. The Broncos will have to win next week to clinch a playoff berth. Burrow hits Higgins for 31 yards, as the Bengals are now at the Broncos' 3-yard line. Bengals get to the Broncos' 47 at the two minute warning on a 16-yard completion from Burrow to Iosivas. Denver will punt after Nix misfires on third down. Let's see what Joe Burrow can do. Cincy has no timeouts. Biggest play of the season for both teams. It's third-and-9 on Denver's 24 with 2:33 left in OT. Cade York's kick hits the upright. Broncos have another chance to win the game. Broncos can also play for a tie, that would be good enough to get the final playoff spot. Burrow hits Higgins on a slant for 20, and Cincinnati is on Denver's 21. Higgins makes up for his false start penalty on the previous play. Burrow hits Gesicki for 12 yards and the Bengals are at the Broncos' 36-yard-line. Gesicki has 10 catches tonight. Impressive stand by the Bengals, but this punt is on Nix, who overthrows his intended receiver on third-and-6. Bengals start on their own 46. Any score wins the game. Zach Allen has 3.5 sacks tonight, and his half sack on third-and-14 forces a Bengals punt, their first tonight. Any score will win the game for Denver. Broncos penalty gives the Bengals a first down near midfield. Khalil Herbert is in for Chase Brown, who appears to be done for the day after getting hurt late in the fourth quarter. It's officially a right ankle injury for Brown. Cincinnati will get the ball first in OT. Cincy will win the game if they score a TD on this drive. If they kick a FG, the Broncos will get a chance to extend OT with a FG or can win the game with a TD. If the Bengals don't score here, any Broncos score will win the game. Marvin Mims makes an incredible catch in the end zone on 4th and 1. Hilton tired to jar it loose, but Mims never loses his grip on the ball. Broncos face a 4th and 1 on the Bengals' 25 with 14 seconds left. They have enough time to complete something in play and spike the ball. Nix hits Sutton on consecutive plays as the Broncos are now inside the 35-yard-line. Under 50 seconds left. Burrow sneaks for a score as the Bengals take a 24-17 lead with 1:24 left. The Broncos have one timeout to work with. Burrow three total TD's today. Chase Brown is down after getting to within a yard of the end zone. Looks like his right leg as he intentionally slid to keep the clock moving. He's walking off under his own power, which is a good sign. Burrow hits Chase for 11 on third-and-6 and are on the Broncos' 6. Denver uses second timeout. Burrow is now up to 315 yards tonight. Another MVP like performance. Nix throws his sixth pick in the past three games, this one to Germaine Pratt on a third-and-15 play. On the next play, Burrow hits Chase for 38 yards and the Bengals are in FG range at the 2-minute warning. Tee Higgins makes a third down catch that was initially ruled incomplete, but the officials overrule the call, determining that Higgins had possession before Patrick Surtain II forced a fumble. Broncos take over at their own 40 with 5:08 left. Score tied, 17-17. Nix hits Marvin Mims for a 51-yard bomb, and we've got a tied score with 8:48 left. Mims split the safeties and used his 4.38 40 speed to track down Nix's pass. Higgins makes an incredible catch to give the Bengals a 17-10 lead with 11:33 left. So Bengals eventually get a TD on this drive after one was called back. Higgins has 2 TD's tonight despite playing through multiple injuries. Burrow's monster season continues tonight. Now has 41 TD's on the year and is making a case for league MVP. Burrow hits Chase Brown for 11 yards on 4th and 2, as the Bengals keep the drive live and are in the red zone early in the fourth quarter. This is the Bengals' 5th drive. They haven't punted and have been in the red zone 4 times. Burrow and Iosivas connect for a TD, but it's coming back on an illegal shift penalty. Gesicki went in motion while Brown was also moving. Burrow picked up the first down on a 19-yard run on the next play. Losing the TD hurts, but Bengals keep possession as the third quarter ends. Cincinnati has just one TO left after taking one with 1:01 left in the third. Burrow was just sacked again by Jonathon Cooper, who is taking advantage of Amarius Mims' absence. Nix hits Courtland Sutton for the game-tying TD. Sutton beat Bengals rookie Josh Newton, who has played well today and over the past few weeks. But he wasn't about to stop Sutton, who scores Denver's first offensive TD in 12 quarters. McLaughlin had three runs of over 11 yards on that drive. This looks like the Broncos' offense that started the game. McLaughlin rips off an 11-yard run as Denver quickly gets into Bengals territory. Cincinnati has to settle for 3 in the red zone after getting a little too pass happy. Here's how the Bengals' 4 drives have gone: Turnover on downs in Broncos territory, turnover on downs in the red zone, TD, FG An illegal contact penalty gives the Bengals a first and goal after Burrow was sacked on third down. A penalty on the next play gave the Bengals the ball on the Broncos' 3. The Broncos challenged Andrei Iosivas' 26-yard grab that would give the Bengals a first down on the Broncos' 25-yard line. The ball came out after Iosivas had already secured the catch, and the officials obviously saw it that way, too. Bengals with a chance to add to their lead at the start of the second half. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

                "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY Joe Burrow threw his third touchdown pass to Tee Higgins with 1:07 left in overtime, and the Cincinnati Bengals kept their slim playoff hopes alive with a wild 30-24 win over the Denver Broncos on Saturday. Following a Broncos punt, Burrow completed a 31-yard pass to Higgins to the Denver 3, then went back to the lanky receiver for the game-ending play. Higgins finished with 11 receptions for 131 yards. Cade York had a chance to win it for the Bengals with about three minutes left in overtime, but his 33-yard field goal bounced off the left upright. Denver then went three-and-out, including a Bo Nix incompletion on third down, handing the ball right back to Cincinnati (8-8). It was the Bengals' first win this season against a team with a winning record. They need another victory in their final game at Pittsburgh and some help from other teams to make it to the postseason for the first time since 2022. The Broncos (9-7) would have secured an AFC wild card with a victory over the Bengals. They'll have another opportunity to earn a postseason berth when they host Kansas City next weekend. Burrow continued his stellar season, going 39-for-49 for 412 yards and three touchdowns, all to Higgins. Ja'Marr Chase finished with nine receptions for 102 yards. Burrow has at least 250 yards passing and three touchdowns in eight straight games, extending his NFL record. Burrow's 1-yard touchdown run gave Cincinnati a 24-17 lead with 1:29 left in regulation. On the play before Burrow's TD, Chase Brown hurt his right ankle on what appeared to be an awkward slide while going down in what looked like an effort to help the Bengals run out the remaining time. Brown's injury stopped the clock, and Nix threw a spectacular 25-yard touchdown pass to a leaping Marvin Mims Jr. for the tying score with 8 seconds left. Nix was 24-for-31 for 219 yards and three touchdowns with one interception. Mims finished with eight catches for 103 yards and two TDs. Broncos: CB Damarri Mathis left in the first quarter with a hamstring injury. Bengals: Right tackle Amarius Mims left late in the first half with a hand injury. Broncos: Finish the regular season at home against the AFC West champions. The day and time for the game have yet to be announced. Bengals: At Pittsburgh at a date and time still to be determined. The Bengals lost to the Steelers 44-38 on Dec. 1. Reporting by The Associated Press. [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

                "title": "Iowa State Cyclones football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Iowa State Cyclones football program is the intercollegiate football team at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. The team is coached by Matt Campbell. The Cyclones compete in the Big 12 Conference, and are a Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) member of the NCAA. The Cyclones play their home games at Jack Trice Stadium, with a capacity of 61,500. The Iowa State Cyclones football team drew an average home attendance of 60,384 in 2023, the 28th highest in college football.[3] Football first made its way onto the Iowa State campus in 1878 as a recreational sport, but it wasn't until 1892 that an organized group of athletes first represented Iowa State in football. In 1894, college president William M. Beardshear spearheaded the foundation of an athletic association to officially sanction Iowa State football teams. The 1894 team finished with a 6–1 mark, including a 16–8 victory over what is now the University of Iowa.[4] One of the pioneers of football, Pop Warner, spent time at Iowa State early in his career. In 1895 despite already being the coach at Georgia he was offered $25 per week to come to Iowa State, whose season started in mid-August while Georgia's started a month later, as well as to provide weekly advice during the rest of the season.[5] Soon after Warner left for Georgia, Iowa State had its first game of the season. Iowa State came into Evanston as the underdog Iowa State then defeated Northwestern 36–0. A Chicago sportswriter called the team \"cornfed giants from Iowa\" while the Chicago Tribune's headline read, \"Struck by a Cyclone\". Since then, Iowa State teams have been known as the Cyclones. Overall, the team had three wins and three losses and, like Georgia, Iowa State retained Warner for the next season. In 1896 the team had eight wins and two losses.[6] Despite leaving Cornell in 1898, Warner remained as the head coach of Iowa State for another year. During his last three years at Iowa State the team had a winning season but Warner was unable to match his 1896 triumph.[6] After playing at Iowa and then serving as an assistant coach for two years, Clyde Williams came to Ames as an assistant coach for ISU. Williams served as the Cyclones' head football coach for six seasons from 1907 to 1912. During that time, he had a coaching record of 32–15–2. This ranks him fifth at Iowa State in total wins and fourth at Iowa State in winning percentage.[7] In addition, he led Iowa State to two Missouri Valley Conference football titles in 1911 and 1912, which are the only two conference football championships in school history.[8] In addition to his football contributions Williams was the school's first men's basketball coach from 1908 to 1911, where he compiled a 20–29 record. He also served as Iowa State's baseball coach, and was their athletic director from 1914 to 1919. In 1914 Iowa State completed construction of their new football field and it was named Clyde Williams Field in honor of the former coach. Williams was inducted into the State of Iowa Hall of Fame in 1956. He is also one of the few people inducted into both the University of Iowa Athletics Hall of Fame (inducted 1993) and the Iowa State athletics Hall of Fame (inducted 1997).[9] The success Iowa State found in the inception of their football program was not replicated for most of the mid-20th century. In 1922 after having two different head coaches in as many years, ISU hired up-and-comer Sam Willaman away from East Technical HS in Cleveland, OH. When Willaman came to Iowa state, he brought with him six of his former East Tech players, including Jack Trice. Trice was the first African-American player at Iowa State, and one of the first African-Americans to play football in the Midwest. Trice suffered a severe malicious injury during a game at Minnesota in 1923, and died from complications. In 1997, Iowa State's Cyclone Stadium was renamed Jack Trice Stadium in his honor,[10] becoming the first and as of 2020, the only, major college football stadium to be named for a black man.[11] In his first season, Willaman's team finished with a 2–6 record, but posted a winning record in each of the three years that followed. His career coaching record at Iowa state was 14–15–3. This ranks him 16th in total wins and 13th in winning percentage in Iowa State football history.[7] In February 1931, George F. Veenker accepted an offer to become the head football coach for Iowa State.[12] Under Veenker, Iowa State experienced a brief period of success. When Veenker joined Iowa State, the team was coming off a winless season in 1930 and had lost 16 consecutive games dating back to October 1929. In his first year, the 1931 team defeated Missouri 20–0, Oklahoma 13–12, and Kansas State 7–6, compiling a 5–3 record and finishing in second place in the Big Six Conference. In November 1931, the Ames Daily Tribune-Times called Veenker \"a veritable miracle man of football\" for taking a school where \"Cyclone football morale couldn't have been lower\" and turning the program around in his first season. The highlight of Veenker's career as Iowa State's football coach was a 31–6 victory over the Iowa Hawkeyes in 1934. The game was the last meeting between the two schools until 1977. Veenker resigned in 1936, leaving an overall record of 21–22–8.[13] Shortly after Veenker's death in 1959, the university-owned golf course was renamed Veenker Memorial Golf Course in his honor.[14] During the 1938 season, James J. Yeager was in his second year as head coach. Despite going 3–6 in 1937, the Cyclones would go on to a then-best record of 7–1–1. The team was led by outstanding senior guard, Ed Bock. At the conclusion of the season Bock became the first consensus first-team All-American in Iowa State history.[15] Bock was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1970.[16] In 1942, Iowa State hired former Green Bay Packers All-Pro guard and three-time NFL champion Mike Michalske to be the new head coach. Michalske achieved moderate success in his five seasons at Iowa State, finishing with an 18–18 record. Abe Stuber took over as the Cyclones head coach in 1947 and coached the team until 1953, compiling a record of 24–38–3.[17] Vince DiFrancesca was the 21st head coach at Iowa State, leading the team to a record of 6–21–1 from 1954 to 1956.[18] Oregon State assistant coach Clay Stapleton was the head football coach at Iowa State for ten seasons. He is known mainly for his 1959 team the \"Dirty Thirty\". The Cyclones' struggles continued under his tutelage. Seven-win campaigns in 1959 and 1960 were the only winning seasons of his tenure.[19] Stapleton was relieved of his duties following the 1967 season. In 1968, in an attempt to turn the team around, Iowa State hired former standout Tennessee running back and up-and-coming Arkansas assistant Johnny Majors as the 24th head coach in program history. The rebuilding process got off to a slow start as the Cyclones finished 3–7 in his first two seasons. In 1970 the process started moving forward, and the team finished tied for 6th in the Big Eight with a record of 5–6. The 1971 team was picked to finish last in the Big Eight, but overcame odds to finish 4–3 in the conference and 8–3 in the regular season. The only teams they lost to in the conference, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Colorado, ended up first, second, and third in the final rankings. The team was led by junior running back George Amundson, who Majors called \"the finest athlete I have coached in any job I have had.\" Iowa State had one defensive all-conference pick, LB Keith Schroeder. Amundson rushed for 1,260 yards, including a school-record 15 touchdowns. End Keith Krepfle had 40 receptions for 570 yards and 12 touchdowns. Quarterback Dean Carlson threw for a school-record 1,867 yards. These efforts were enough to earn a bid to the 1971 Sun Bowl, the first bowl game in program history. Iowa State was slated to play against LSU on December 18, 1971. Iowa State was outmatched by LSU and future NFL quarterback Bert Jones, falling to the Tigers, 33–15. LSU was ranked 11 after the bowls, but Iowa State was left out of the top 20.[20] In 1972, Iowa State saw the loss of five starters and the move of George Amundson from running back to quarterback to replace Dean Carlson. The Cyclones lost linebacker Matt Blair to a pre-season injury, which forced him into a medical redshirt. The Cyclones tied Nebraska 23–23 on a missed extra point by Iowa State's Tom Goedjen. Three players went on to be named to the first team All-Big Eight team as well be honored as All-Americans, offensive lineman Geary Murdoch, defensive end Merv Krakau and quarterback George Amundson. Amundson was named Big Eight player of the year over Heisman Trophy winner, Johnny Rodgers. It was in this year that Iowa State became known as D-Tackle U, similar to Penn State's moniker \"Linebacker U\". Iowa State's 5–5–1 regular season record was enough to earn them an invitation to the 1972 Liberty Bowl against Georgia Tech. Despite outstanding play, Iowa State lost 31–30 on a failed late-game two-point conversion attempt by George Amundson.[21] At the conclusion of the 1972 season, Majors announced his departure from Iowa State to take the head coaching job at Pittsburgh.[22] In order to continue the success experienced under Johnny Majors Iowa State hired Earle Bruce out of Tampa. With newfound excitement around ISU football, the university broke ground on a new $7.6 million stadium that would eventually become Jack Trice Stadium. Despite future Minnesota Vikings star linebacker Matt Blair being a first team All-American, the Cyclones struggled to a 4–7 finish in Bruce's inaugural 1973 season. Over the next two seasons the Cyclones experienced moderate success but both seasons ended again with 4–7 records. However, Bruce's fourth team blossomed as one of the best teams in school history. En route to their 8–3 final record, the Cyclones scored wins against No. 7 Missouri and No. 9 Nebraska. In spite of the Cyclones' finishing the 1976 season ranked No. 19 in the AP Poll, Iowa State was ultimately snubbed by the bowls. Even so, Bruce was selected as Big Eight Coach of the Year.[23] Iowa State followed up their strong 1976 campaign with another eight-win season in 1977. The Cyclones beat No. 9 Nebraska for the second time in a row and were ranked as high as No. 16 in the AP Poll at one point. Their 5–2 conference record and 8–4 overall record were good enough for a bid to the 1977 Peach Bowl against North Carolina State. Ultimately Iowa State lost the game 14–24.[24] The Cyclones returned 14 starters from the 1977 Peach Bowl team including Heisman Trophy candidate, Dexter Green and Outland Trophy hopeful, Mike Stensrud. Iowa State's post season hopes came down to their last game against Colorado which was nationally televised. The game was close throughout, with ISU clinging to a 17–10 halftime lead. The second half was a defensive battle, but the ISU defense came up with big plays down the stretch. Mike Stensrud had 16 stops and caused a fumble to help ISU preserve a 20–16 win over the Buffaloes. The win earned ISU a bid to the 1978 Hall of Fame Classic against Texas A&M. Iowa State opened the game with two touchdowns, but was unable to convert the extra point on either attempt. The Cyclones were not able to contain future first round NFL draft pick Curtis Dickey, who rushed for 278 yards and a touchdown, and Iowa State lost 28–12.[25] At the conclusion of the 1978 season, Bruce announced he would leave Iowa State to take the head coaching job at Ohio State.[26] In order to continue the success found under Earle Bruce, Iowa State hired Oklahoma assistant Donnie Duncan as its 26th head football coach. He held the position for four seasons, from 1979 until 1982. His 1980 and 1981 Cyclones squads both made appearances in the national rankings. The 1981 Cyclones began the season at 5–1–1 and rose to No. 11 in the AP Poll. Led by future NFL players Dwayne Crutchfield, Dan Johnson, Karl Nelson and Chris Washington, the Cyclones tied No. 5 Oklahoma 7–7 and downed No. 8 Missouri 34–13.[27] However, the success was short lived, and Duncan resigned with a career record of 18–24–2 after the 1982 season.[28] Following the 1982 season Iowa State hired Jim Criner, who had won the 1980 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship as the head coach at Boise State.[29] During Criner's tenure the Cyclones experienced mild success, however they were embroiled in controversy, with multiple players arrested on different charges as well as several NCAA allegations of wrongdoings. The allegations included coaches giving players cash as well as giving recruits rides and meals. Criner's rough tenure came to an end November 12, 1986, when the school announced his firing.[30] Criner's final career record at Iowa State was 17–25–2.[7] Jim Walden succeeded Jim Criner at Iowa State, where he compiled a 28–57–3 over eight seasons. ISU had been hit with scholarship reductions by the NCAA, both because of infractions by the previous coach, and an overall reduction in scholarships for Division I-A for the 1988 season.[31] In his first four years as Iowa State's head coach, he had just 57, 61, 63, and 67 scholarship players.[32] Walden had only 47 scholarship players on the squad that he took to Lincoln to play Nebraska on October 28, 1989, and they lost 49–17.[33] Walden was the last Iowa State coach to defeat Oklahoma, until Matt Campbell, which they did on October 20, 1990.[34] Oklahoma was ranked 16th in the nation at the time.[35] They had narrowly missed an upset the year before, losing in Ames 43–40. Walden's best record with the Cyclones was 6–5 in 1989. After the 1989 season, Walden was offered the head coaching job at the University of Arizona, but he declined, citing a number of people at Iowa State telling him it would be \"devastating\" if he left. In retrospect, Walden said he was \"too dumb\" to leave.[36] Walden's teams were plagued with injuries, especially at quarterback. In 1991, third-string quarterback Kevin Caldwell, who had begun the season as a tailback, started the final five games under center for the Cyclones.[37] Walden played four different quarterbacks in a 41–0 loss to Kansas in 1991.[38] In 1992, Walden installed the triple-option offense[39] and had mixed results. Iowa State lost to in-state rivals Iowa and UNI early in the 1992 season. The loss to UNI was Walden's first to a Division I-AA school. It was also UNI's first victory over the Cyclones since 1900.[40] Iowa State bounced back to shock the seventh-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers at home on November 14, 1992. The victory was even more improbable as Walden's third-string quarterback, Marv Seiler, would make his first career start.[41] Walden's 1993 squad went 3–8, but with an upset of 18th ranked Kansas State.[42] Walden ended the 1993 campaign with a walk-on quarterback, Jeff St. Clair. In the spring of 1994, Walden recruited running back Troy Davis out of Miami, Florida. Davis later had consecutive 2,000-yard rushing seasons, but not until after Walden's departure. After starting the 1994 campaign 0–2, many fans began to criticize Walden's coaching ability. He began his weekly press conference by handing out the records of Dennis Erickson, Johnny Majors, and Earle Bruce while they were at Washington State and Iowa State. He then handed out Iowa State's overall record in football since fielding its first team in 1892, which, at the time, was 423–461–45, a .480 percentage, and compared his record to that one. Walden claimed that he was as good a coach or better than Erickson, Majors, and Bruce.[43] On Thursday, November 3, 1994, after starting the season 0–7–1, Walden informed his team that he would resign at season's end.[44] He was allowed to coach his final three games by the university, but was banned from coaching his last game at Colorado because of criticizing the officials after the Kansas State game. Kansas State's Nyle Wiren had body-slammed Walden's quarterback Todd Doxzon into the turf head first.[45] No penalty was called and Walden, with nothing to lose, went off on the officiating after the game: \"I've kept quiet too long, but since I'm leaving there's nothing they can do about me. I think the refereeing in this league is atrocious ... What do you do with bad officials? Do they get fired? You fire bad players and bad coaches. Bad officials get a raise and go fishing.\"[46] Walden coached his final game on November 12 against Nebraska in Ames. Iowa State had an 0–8–1 record and Nebraska was undefeated, with a No. 1 ranking. Unbelievably, Walden's Cyclones hung with the Huskers. At the end of the third quarter, Nebraska led by only two points, 14–12. The final quarter proved to be too much for Walden's team, and Nebraska won the game 28–12.[47] The Cyclones finished with a winless 0–10–1 record in Walden's final 1994 season. Walden ranks sixth at Iowa State in total wins and 22nd in winning percentage.[7] To turn the program around Iowa State hired Wisconsin defensive coordinator, Dan McCarney. The lone bright spot that McCarney inherited was sophomore running back phenom Troy Davis. Davis would go on to break nearly every Iowa State rushing and touchdown record, most that still stand.[48] Davis twice earned unanimous All-American honors, and became the first NCAA Division I-A running back to rush for over 2,000 yards in back-to-back seasons, a feat that has yet to be repeated. Davis finished 5th and 2nd in Heisman voting in his 1995 and 1996 campaigns respectively.[48] McCarney would go 10–34 in his first four seasons as the Cyclones head coach. In McCarney's sixth season, the Cyclones were finally able to put together a competitive team. The 2000 Cyclones were quarterbacked by Sage Rosenfels. Sage is among many former Cyclones from the 2000 team to make it to the NFL. Others were J. J. Moses, Reggie Hayward, Ennis Haywood, Tony Yelk, Mike Banks, Jordan Carstens, Tyson Smith and James Reed. Despite Iowa State being picked by the media to finish 5th in the Big 12 North Division, the Cyclones finished with a 5–3 conference record and a 9–3 overall record.[49] ISU finished the season ranked No. 25 and their nine wins were the program's best total since 1906. The Cyclones were then invited to play in the Insight.com Bowl against Pittsburgh, Iowa State's first appearance in a bowl game since the 1978 Peach Bowl. Iowa State was able to beat the Panthers 37–29, earning their first bowl victory in program history.[50] In an interesting side note, Pittsburgh's defensive coordinator in this game, Paul Rhoads, would eventually become the 31st Iowa State head coach. The 2001 season saw the emergence of JUCO transfer Seneca Wallace and star wide receiver Lane Danielson. The dynamic duo led the Cyclones to a last-second win over Iowa,[51] a 7–5 overall record, and an invitation to the Independence Bowl against Alabama, their second consecutive bowl game. The Cyclones just missed a 47-yard field goal attempt with 0:46 remaining in the fourth, which would have given State the lead and potential victory. The Cyclones lost the game 13–14. Subsequent to the game there was some question about whether or not the field goal was actually good, as it sailed directly over one of the uprights.[52] Seneca Wallace would lead the Cyclones to a 6–1 start in 2002, including a near-win against the Florida State Seminoles in the Eddie Robinson Classic at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. Wallace dove towards the goal line at the last second but was ruled out shy of the end zone. During a later home game versus Texas Tech, Wallace scored on a 12-yard touchdown by running an estimated 120 yards backwards, forwards, and sideways on the field. Wallace dodged tackles and received numerous blocks from his teammates, including one devastating block by running back Michael Wagner. The play briefly catapulted Wallace into Heisman Trophy contention and was recognized by ESPN as the \"Play of the Week.\" It has since been recognized as one of the great plays in college football history. The play is known among Iowa State fans simply as \"The Run.\" Ultimately their 7–7 record was enough to receive a bid to the Humanitarian Bowl against Boise State on the Broncos' blue home field where they were defeated, 16–34.[53] The 2004 season would be much more successful than the disappointing 2–10 2003 campaign for the Cyclones. Redshirt freshman Bret Meyer took over the quarterback spot and paired up with fellow redshirt freshman receiver Todd Blythe to make a lethal combination. The season got off to a slow start with a 2–4 overall record and a 0–3 record in the conference. McCarney turned the season around by winning the next four games in a row. The Cyclones had a chance to win the Big 12 North title but fell short after a Missouri defender intercepted a pass intended for Jon Davis in the end zone. The Cyclones would go on to play the Miami RedHawks in the 2004 Independence Bowl. In the Independence Bowl, Iowa State prevailed for a 17–13 win as Meyer rolled up 236 yards of total offense. Meyer and Stevie Hicks each rushed for over 100 yards, an Independence Bowl first. All-Big 12 cornerback Ellis Hobbs iced the win with a 41-yard interception return in the game's final minute, and the Cyclones held on to win 17–13.[54] The Cyclones continued their success under McCarney in the 2005 season. High points during the season include a blowout win against No. 8 Iowa and a home victory over No. 22 Colorado. They missed out yet again on the Big 12 title when they lost in overtime to Kansas after a missed field goal by Bret Culbertson. They led the game in the 4th quarter but allowed Kansas to come back.[55] The Cyclones earned a berth in the 2005 Houston Bowl, but lost 24–27 to the TCU Horned Frogs. TCU opened the game with back-to-back first quarter rushing touchdowns. The Cyclones responded with two Bret Meyer touchdown passes and forced a TCU safety. Late in the fourth quarter the game was tied at 24–24 but the Cyclones ultimately suffered yet another bowl loss on a fourth-quarter field goal.[56] McCarney stepped down as head coach after a 4–8 2006 season, and finished his Iowa State head-coaching career as the program's winningest head coach with a 56–85 all-time record.[57] To replace Dan McCarney, Iowa State hired much-touted Texas defensive coordinator Gene Chizik.[58] The Cyclones wore 1977 throwback jerseys for the 2007 contest against Iowa and re-introduced gold pants as a standard part of their uniform. It marked the 30th anniversary since the resumption of the Cy-Hawk rivalry as well as the 30th anniversary of the 1977 Iowa State Peach Bowl team. They finished the season 3–9, including a 15–13 win over Iowa, and back-to-back wins against Kansas State and Colorado. All three wins were upsets. In 2008, Iowa State opened with two wins against weaker non-conference foes, before losing their next 10 games to finish the season 2–10. Chizik left the Cyclones suddenly after the season to become the head football coach at Auburn amid great acrimony.[59] Auburn defensive coordinator Paul Rhoads was introduced as the 31st head coach of the Iowa State Cyclones on December 20, 2008.[60] Rhoads had previously spent time at Iowa State as an assistant coach in the late 1990s and was raised only 20 miles from Ames in Ankeny.[61] His father, Cecil, was one of the winningest coaches in Iowa high school history,[62] coaching for more than three decades and has been inducted into the Iowa High School Football Coaches Hall of Fame. Rhoads' contract was reported to be a 5-year deal worth $5.75 million plus incentives.[63] To round out his coaching staff, Rhoads hired up-and-coming offensive coordinator out of Rice, Tom Herman and veteran defensive coordinator Wally Burnham. Rhoads opened his ISU career with a win over FCS North Dakota State. He then led Iowa State to a victory at Kent State first year, ending a 17-game Cyclones road losing streak.[64] In October 2009 the Cyclones defeated Baylor to end an 11-game losing stretch against conference opponents,[65] and then went on to defeat Nebraska in Lincoln for the first time since 1977.[66] Their 6–6 record was enough to earn them an invitation to the Insight.com Bowl against Minnesota. Rhoads would win his first bowl game in his inaugural year as coach at Iowa State, beating the Golden Gophers 14–13.[67] The lone highlight of the 2010 season was the first ever win at Texas in school history, upsetting the 22nd-ranked Longhorns 28–21.[68] The Cyclones would finish the season 3–5 in the Big 12 and 5–7 overall. In 2011 Iowa State started off the season 3–0 including a triple-overtime win over Iowa in Ames, and a win over Connecticut in East Hartford. The Cyclones would drop the next four games, starting out 0–4 in conference play, but they quickly bounced back with a 41–7 win on October 29 at No. 19 Texas Tech. In that game, Iowa State managed to rack up 512 total yards, the most since the Nov 22, 2008 game at Kansas State. Several other school records were broken, including first-ever win in Lubbock, largest margin of victory against a ranked opponent, and most points scored against a ranked opponent since November 9, 1996.[69] On November 18, Iowa State faced off against undefeated No. 2 Oklahoma State led by Heisman frontrunner Brandon Weeden and two time Biletnikoff winner Justin Blackmon[70] in Ames. Down 24–7 early in the second half, Iowa State came back with 17 unanswered points to force overtime. In overtime, Iowa State scored on its first play from scrimmage, but Oklahoma State answered back with their own touchdown. In the second overtime, Iowa State forced an interception and ran three Jeff Woody dives in a row to beat Oklahoma State 37–31, smashing Oklahoma State's chances of playing for a national championship and Brandon Weeden's Heisman shot. Iowa State became bowl eligible with the win and improved to 6–4. The win over Oklahoma State marked Iowa State's first ever win against an opponent in the top 6 (AP polls).[71] The Cyclones finished the season 6–6 and would receive an invitation to face the Rutgers Scarlet Knights in the Pinstripe Bowl, which they went on to lose, 27–13.[72] The Cyclones opened the 2012 season 3–0 including a 9–6 win at Iowa for the first time in 10 years. The other major highlight of the season was ending TCU's then-longest winning streak in college football by upsetting the No. 15 ranked Horned Frogs in Fort Worth 37–23.[73] The 2012 season ended 6–7 and a berth in that year's Liberty Bowl against the Tulsa Golden Hurricane. Iowa State opened the game strong but they ultimately lost 31–17.[74] While things appeared to be moving in a positive direction for the Cyclones, Rhoads' future teams were unable to continue the success of his earlier teams. In his final three seasons, the Cyclones won just four Big 12 games (including a winless conference record in 2014) and went 8–27 overall. The 2015 season proved to be particularly difficult, as the Cyclones held double-digit halftime leads against both Oklahoma State and Kansas State only to lose both games late in the fourth quarter. Following a 38–35 loss to Kansas State on November 21, in which he came under heavy criticism for play-calling in the game's final 90 seconds,[75] Rhoads was fired as head coach, effective at the conclusion of the season.[76][77] Matt Campbell, who had been the head coach at the University of Toledo, was named head coach at Iowa State on November 29, 2015.[78] Campbell signed a six-year contract worth $2 million his first year.[79] Campbell finished his first season as a Cyclone with a record of 3–9. Despite the disappointing record there were several high points during the season that showed progress including several near upsets and a blowout win over Texas Tech. The 66–10 rout of the Red Raiders included breaking several school records including points scored in a conference game.[80] In Campbell's second season, the Cyclones experienced greater on-field success. After opening the season 2–2, the Cyclones upset the eventual conference champions the No. 3 ranked Oklahoma Sooners.[81] This was Iowa State's first win in Norman since 1990 and only their sixth win against Oklahoma all-time. They followed up the Oklahoma win by going undefeated in the month of October, including a win over No. 4 TCU.[82] During the season the Cyclones were ranked as high as No. 14 in the AP Poll.[83] Finishing the regular season 7–5 and fourth in the Big 12, Iowa State was invited to the Liberty Bowl where they defeated No. 20 Memphis 21–20, their first bowl victory in eight years.[84] Campbell agreed to a six-year, $22.5 million extension with the school on November 27, 2017.[85] On November 30, 2017, Campbell was named the Big 12 Coach of the Year.[86] In the 2018 season, the Cyclones had a disappointing 1–3 start. However, coach Campbell lead the Cyclones to a regular season record of 8–4, including 6 Big 12 conference wins, and a win over No. 6 West Virginia.[87] The Cyclones were invited to the Alamo Bowl, where they lost 28–26 to Washington State.[88] On December 3, 2019, Campbell and Iowa State agreed to a contract extension through 2025.[89] Featuring Quarterback Brock Purdy,[90] and All-American Running Back Breece Hall,[91] the 2020 season was one of the most successful seasons in Cyclones history. Despite losing their season opener to the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns from the Sun Belt Conference, they recovered quickly and defeated No. 18 Oklahoma two weeks later in Ames. Two weeks later, the No. 17 Cyclones lost to No. 6 Oklahoma State 24–21 in Stillwater. This would be their only conference loss for the season, as they went on to win the rest of their regular season games and clinched a spot in their first-ever Big 12 Championship Game, a rematch with No. 10 Oklahoma. At the time of the Big 12 Championship Game, the Cyclones were ranked No. 6 in the College Football Playoff rankings, their highest CFP ranking ever. Although the Cyclones lost this game 27–21, they were invited to the Fiesta Bowl, where they defeated the No. 25 Oregon Ducks 34–17 in their first-ever New Year's Six bowl game. After the season ended, the Cyclones finished ranked No. 9 in both the AP and Coaches Poll, their highest final ranking ever. On February 8, 2021, Campbell and Iowa State agreed to a contract extension through 2028.[92] In 2023, the Cyclones team became embroiled in an illegal sports-betting scandal. Both defensive lineman Isaiah Lee and the Cyclones’ leading rusher for the 2022 season Jirehl Brock were charged following an investigation into illegal sports betting, and they subsequently left the team. Three other players charged in the investigation were quarterback Hunter Dekkers, offensive lineman Jacob Remsburg and tight end DeShawn Hanika all of which remained on the team roster, with Remsburg being the only to play again for the Cyclones.[93] Iowa State has won two conference championships in school history. Both Iowa State conference championships were during their membership in the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MVIAA), which would later be known as the Big Eight Conference.[1] Iowa State currently has the longest conference championship drought in FBS history.[94] † Co-champions Iowa State competed in the Big 12 North Division from 1996 to 2010, winning a share of one division title during that time (since 2011, the conference has had the top two teams matched for the title game). † Co-champions As of Week 1 of the 2022 season, Iowa State has made 70 appearances[95] in the Associated Press poll and been ranked in the final Associated Press poll of the season three times.[96] Iowa State has appeared in 19 bowl games. Their overall bowl record is 6–13.[97] Iowa State has had 32 head coaches in program history.[18] The current head coach is Matt Campbell.[98] Every year, several publications release lists of their ideal \"team\". The athletes on these lists are referred to as All-Americans. The NCAA recognizes five All-American lists. They are the Associated Press (AP), American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), Sporting News (TSN), and the Walter Camp Football Foundation (WCFF). Since the establishment of the team in 1892, Iowa State has had 16 players honored a total of 24 times as First Team All-America for their performance on the field of play. Included in these selections are 6 consensus selections, with four individuals earning the honor (Troy Davis and Breece Hall having earned the honor twice).[99][100] In 1951, the College Football Hall of Fame opened in South Bend, Indiana. Since then, Iowa State has had two players inducted into the Hall of Fame. Ed Bock is widely considered the greatest offensive lineman in Iowa State history. During his 1938 senior season the team finished with a then best 7–1–1 record. At the conclusion of the season Bock became the first consensus first team All-American in ISU history. Following his football career at Iowa State Bock worked for the Monsanto Chemical Company where he eventually rose to become CEO and President. Bock was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1970.[16] Troy Davis is considered the greatest running back in Iowa State history. Davis twice earned consensus All-American honors and was the first NCAA Division I-A running back to rush for over 2,000 yards in back-to-back seasons, a feat that has yet to be repeated. Davis finished 5th and 2nd in Heisman voting in his sophomore and junior seasons, respectively.[48] After completing his college career, Davis went on to have a 10-year career in the NFL and CFL, including as a member of the Edmonton Eskimos 2005 Grey Cup championship team. Davis was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in the class of 2016.[103] The Heisman Trophy is awarded annually to the nation's most outstanding college football player. In 1959 after Dwight Nichols led the Big 7 in total yardage (1,358) and points (54) he became the first player in Iowa State history to receive Heisman votes coming tied for 7th place overall. After his stellar 1972 campaign George Amundson became the second player in ISU history to receive Heisman votes when he finished in 7th place.[106] In 1995 after a 23-year absence Troy Davis became the third Cyclone to gain Heisman attention when he finished 5th. Then in 1996 at the conclusion of his second consecutive 2,000 yard season Davis nearly won the Heisman but ultimately was runner-up.[107] In 2020, Breece Hall became the fourth Cyclone to receive Heisman votes when he finished in 6th place.[108] Iowa and Iowa State played each other 24 times between 1894 and 1934, before the Cy-Hawk Trophy was established. It was originally conceived and created as a traveling trophy by the Greater Des Moines Athletic Club in 1976, the trophy was first presented to the winner by Iowa Governor Robert D. Ray in 1977. That game was the first meeting between the two since 1934. The series halted after 1934 after then University of Iowa Athletic Director and head football coach Ossie Solem would not return calls to reschedule the rivalry. The rivalry was once again temporarily put to a halt in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 69 games in the series played through 2022, 40 of them have been played in Iowa City while 29 games have been contested in Ames. Iowa leads the series 47–24 through the 2024 season.[110] The teams first met in 1917, when both schools were members of the Big Eight Conference. The match-up continued as an annual conference game through the schools' shift into the Big 12 Conference. The series has been dominated by long winning streaks for both teams, with each team's longest winning streak at 10 games. Iowa State leads the series 54–50–4 through the 2024 season.[111] Missouri and Iowa State first met in 1896 and the regional rivalry was born. Before the 1959 match-up between the two schools, which took place in Ames, Iowa, field testing showed that the telephones the two schools used to communicate with their coaches in the coaches box were wired so that either school could hear what was happening on the other sideline. The problem was fixed before the game, but neither of the two coaches knew that. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company of Ames then decided to have a trophy made to commemorate the incident, and thus the Telephone Trophy was born.[112][113] When Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC the rivalry was essentially ended. Missouri leads the rivalry 61–34–9 all-time.[114] Jack Trice Stadium (formerly Cyclone Stadium) is a stadium in Ames, Iowa. It is primarily used for college football, and is the home field of the Iowa State University Cyclones. It opened on September 20, 1975 (with a win against Air Force), and with hillside tickets it officially has 61,500 seats. The current record for single-game attendance, 61,500, was set on September 5, 2015, when the Cyclones played Northern Iowa. In 1997, the stadium was named in honor of Jack Trice, ISU's first African American athlete and the school's first athletics-related fatality. The stadium is the only stadium in Division I named for an African American individual.[115] The Steve and Debbie Bergstrom Indoor Training Facility opened in March 2004. It is a 92,000-square-foot (8,500 m2) multi-purpose, indoor practice facility. Inside the facility is a full-sized football field. Though typically associated with football, it is also used for practice by the softball and soccer teams, as well as community events. The building sits just northwest of Jack Trice Stadium and is part of the Johnny Majors Practice Complex. The facility cost $9.6 million to build and was funded by private gifts to the athletic department and ISU Foundation. On October 26, 2012, Iowa State dedicated a $20.6 million, 156,000 square-foot, expansion of the football facility with an additional lead gift from the Bergstrom family. This included replacing the playing surface of the indoor facility, a state-of-the-art strength and conditional facility, a coaches office complex, positional meeting rooms, an auditorium, and spacious locker rooms. This completed the goal for Iowa State to have a stand-alone football-only training facility.[116] Built in 1995 and located off the north end zone of Jack Trice Stadium, The Jacobson Athletic Building formerly housed the football offices, locker rooms, meeting rooms, strength and conditioning room, and sports medicine room. The space was renovated in 2008 and 2009 to use the vacated space by the football team. It now is home to men's and women's golf, tennis, swimming, wrestling, cross country and track and field. This allows the entire athletic department staff to be under one roof with the exception of men's and women's basketball and volleyball.[117] Originally, the Iowa Agricultural College (Iowa State University) teams were known as the \"Cardinals.\"[118] The name was changed after Sept. 29, 1895, when under legendary coach Pop Warner[119] the Cardinals routed the Northwestern Wildcats, 36–0. Inspired by an extremely active tornado (then called \"cyclone\") season, the next day, the Chicago Tribune headline read: \"Struck by a Cyclone.\" The article went on to say, \"Northwestern might as well have tried to play football with an Iowa cyclone as with the team it met yesterday.\" Since then the Iowa State teams have been known as the \"Cyclones.\"[118] Jack Trice was Iowa State's first African-American athlete; he was also the first and only Iowa State athlete to die from injuries sustained during athletic competition. He died three days after his first game playing for Iowa State against the University of Minnesota on October 6, 1923. He suffered a broken collarbone early on, but continued to play until he was trampled by a group of Minnesota players. It is disputed whether he was trampled on purpose or if it was an accident. A statue commemorates him outside of the stadium that is named for him, Jack Trice Stadium. His legacy was forgotten until the 1970s, when students discovered a plaque commemorating him in State Gym. They decided to put up a petition to name the stadium, at the time known as Cyclones Stadium, after him. Originally they got the field named after him in 1984. The stadium was named Jack Trice Stadium in 1997. It is the only NCAA Division I stadium named after an African-American.[120] The members of the Iowa State Chapter of Alpha Sigma Phi man and maintain a cannon that is discharged at home football games when the Iowa State team takes the field, following the first kickoff, the kickoff following half-time, all Iowa State kickoffs, and immediately following an Iowa State touchdown.[121] Iowa State uses a cardinal, named Cy, as its mascot instead of an actual tornado or Cyclone. In 1954, the student pep council began the process of creating a mascot to build school spirit. As it would be difficult to, quote \"stuff a cyclone\", a cardinal was selected from the school's official colors and original team namesake. The name of Cy was selected via a naming contest, being submitted by 17 people.[122] Prior to the football matchup against the University of Colorado on November 12, 2005, a tornado touched down in Ames, Iowa, and forced fans to either stand out in the parking lot and watch the storm or flee to shelter in Hilton Coliseum. It created such an atmosphere that Iowa State was able to win over the favored Buffaloes 30–16. When asked about the event, Colorado coach Gary Barnett said, \"I thought we had a pretty good mascot. But when we showed up at Iowa State and they had a real tornado, that's the real deal.\"[121] Iowa State is well regarded for tailgating. The layout of Jack Trice Stadium on a flood-plain accommodates ample parking space immediately surrounding the stadium. Cyclone fans typically arrive hours before kick-off in large SUVs and RVs to grill popular Midwestern foods such as pork loin, bratwurst, hamburgers and hot dogs. Located immediately outside and north of Jack Trice Stadium, the victory bell is rung following a Cyclone victory. Forged in 1890 the victory bell served on campus to signal dismissal from classes before being moved to Clyde Williams Field and subsequently to Jack Trice Stadium.[121] To go along with the installation of the new video board and sound system prior to the 2011 football season, a tornado siren is sounded after touchdowns, defensive stands, and other big plays. While the tornado siren is a new tradition, it is one that numerous Cyclones fans have asked the Iowa State athletic director to implement for many years, especially since the Colorado-Iowa State game of November 12, 2005, when a tornado touched down in Ames and sirens were heard throughout town during what normally would have been pregame activities. Since then, its implementation has become an extremely popular aspect of the Jack Trice Stadium experience.[citation needed] Schedules as of Aug 30, 2024.[123]",

                "content": "The Nebraska Cornhuskers football team competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, representing the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in the Big Ten Conference. Nebraska has played its home games at Memorial Stadium since 1923 and sold out every game at the venue since 1962.[5] Nebraska is among the most storied programs in college football history and has the eighth-most all-time victories among FBS teams.[6] NU has won forty-six conference championships and five national championships (1970, 1971, 1994, 1995, and 1997), along with seven other national titles the school does not claim. Its 1971 and 1995 title-winning teams are considered among the best ever.[7][8] Nebraska's three Heisman Trophy winners – Johnny Rodgers, Mike Rozier, and Eric Crouch – join twenty-four other Cornhuskers in the College Football Hall of Fame.[9] The program's first extended period of success came just after the turn of the twentieth century. Between 1900 and 1916, Nebraska had five undefeated seasons and completed a stretch of thirty-four games without a loss, still a program record.[10] Despite a span of twenty-one conference championships in thirty-four seasons, the Cornhuskers did not experience major national success until Bob Devaney was hired in 1962. Devaney won two national championships and eight conference titles in eleven seasons as head coach, but perhaps his most lasting achievement was the hiring of Tom Osborne as offensive coordinator in 1969.[11] Osborne was named Devaney's successor in 1973 and over the next twenty-five years established himself as one of the best coaches in college football history with his trademark I-formation offense and revolutionary strength, conditioning, and nutrition programs.[12][13][14] Following Osborne's retirement in 1997, Nebraska cycled through five head coaches before hiring Matt Rhule in 2022.[15] Nebraska has had thirty-one head coaches in the program's history, with five others coaching at least one game on a non-permanent basis. The program has been coached by Matt Rhule since 2023. Seven past Nebraska head coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: Edward N. Robinson, Fielding H. Yost, Dana X. Bible, Biff Jones, Bob Devaney, Tom Osborne, and Frank Solich. Osborne is the program's all-time leader in most major categories; his 0.836 career winning percentage is fifth-highest in major college football history.[17] Thirteen Nebraska coaches have won a conference championship at the school, and Devaney and Osborne combined to win five national titles. Nebraska has won five consensus national championships.[18] The first of these came in 1970 under the leadership of head coach Bob Devaney and featured a unique quarterback rotation between Van Brownson and Jerry Tagge.[19] Nebraska entered the 1971 Orange Bowl ranked third nationally, but losses by No. 1 Texas and No. 2 Ohio State – along with a late game-winning touchdown rush by Tagge – gave NU its first consensus title. The Cornhuskers repeated as national champion the following season with Tagge as the full-time starter, a team that is often considered one of the best in college football history.[20] Nebraska was challenged just once all season, a 35–31 victory over No. 2 Oklahoma in Norman that was billed the \"Game of the Century.\"[20] Wins over Colorado and Alabama (the latter in the 1972 Orange Bowl) made NU the only national champion to defeat the teams that finished No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 in the final AP poll.[20] Tom Osborne replaced Devaney in 1973, and despite several near-misses, did not win his first national title until over two decades into his tenure.[a] Nebraska's 1994 title-winning season, nearly derailed when star quarterback Tommie Frazier was sidelined with blood clots in September, was capped by a 24–17 victory over Miami in the Orange Bowl.[21] With Frazier at full strength the following season, NU repeated as national champion; its 62–24 Fiesta Bowl victory over Florida was the largest margin of victory in a national title game until 2023. The team is often considered among the best in college football history.[22][23] Osborne's final title came in 1997, two years later. The most significant moment of the season was a game-tying touchdown against Missouri that became known as the \"Flea Kicker.\"[24] Top-ranked Nebraska won the game in overtime, but was jumped in both major polls by Michigan. Postseason wins over Texas A&M and Tennessee vaulted NU back ahead of the Wolverines in the Coaches Poll, though not the AP Poll, sharing the national championship. Unclaimed national championships Nebraska has been awarded seven other national championships from NCAA-designated major selectors the school does not claim.[18] Nebraska has won forty-six conference championships. The earliest of these came in the short-lived Western Interstate University Football Association, one of college football's first conferences, which NU participated in for six seasons with Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri.[25] The conference dissolved in 1897 and NU spent the next decade as an independent until the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association – which became the Big Eight – was founded in 1907. Nebraska dominated the MVIAA in its early years, winning nine championships in twelve years before leaving the conference in 1919 to again play as an independent. NU rejoined in 1921 and won the conference twelve times before 1940. Following Biff Jones's departure to become the athletic director at Army in 1941, NU went twenty-two seasons without a conference championship. Devaney was hired in 1962 and quickly turned NU into a powerhouse, winning eight conference titles and two national titles during his eleven years as head coach. Osborne succeeded him in 1973 and won thirteen conference championships; the late-season meeting between Nebraska and Oklahoma often became a de-facto Big Eight championship game, as the two schools combined to win at least a share of the conference title thirty-three times during Devaney and Osborne's combined thirty-six-year tenure.[7] Osborne's final conference championship was a victory in the 1997 Big 12 Championship Game in the second year of its existence. Nebraska won the Big 12 again two years later, its most recent conference championship. Nebraska won ten division championships. Nine of these were in the Big 12's North Division, which NU played in until its departure for the Big Ten in 2011. Nebraska won one division title across thirteen seasons in the Big Ten's Leaders Division and West Division; the conference disbanded its divisions prior to the 2024 season.[27] † Co-champion Nebraska has played in fifty-four bowl games, including a then-record thirty-five straight from 1969 to 2003, with a record of 27–27.[28] Nebraska declined an invitation to play in the second-ever Rose Bowl Game following the 1915 season and did not make its bowl debut until 1941. Twenty-one years later, Bob Devaney's first season ended with the first bowl victory in program history, a 36–34 victory over Miami (FL) in the 1962 Gotham Bowl.[28] During Devaney's tenure, Nebraska began a stretch of thirty-five consecutive seasons with a bowl appearance, a streak that ended in 2004. The program regularly featured in the Orange Bowl due to the Big Eight's bowl affiliations, playing in the game seventeen times between 1954 and 1997, first against SEC opposition and later against the ACC.[28] Memorial Stadium, known as The Sea of Red, has been home of the Cornhuskers since 1923 and is the location of an ongoing NCAA-record 403-game sellout streak. The sellout streak dates back to 1962, Bob Devaney's first season at Nebraska.[29][30] The stadium becomes the \"third-largest city in Nebraska\" on game days, as its capacity exceeds that of every Nebraska town except for Omaha and Lincoln.[31] The stadium has undergone a series of expansion since 1923, bringing the official capacity to 85,458.[1] The largest crowd in Memorial Stadium history occurred on September 20, 2014, a Nebraska win over Miami with an announced attendance of 91,585.[2] Three statues sit outside of the stadium. The oldest, unveiled in 1997, depicts six Nebraska defenders tackling a ball carrier.[32] Creator Fred Hoppe said, \"the monument displays the sense of pride that Nebraskans have for their football team.\" In 2006, Hoppe created a statue of Tom Osborne with his arm around quarterback Brook Berringer, which is located outside the Osborne Athletic Complex.[33] On August 30, 2013, a bronze statue of Bob Devaney was unveiled at the main entrance of the newly remodeled east stadium. Sculptor Joe Putjenter also created the Tunnel Walk gates inside the stadium.[34] Before the construction of Memorial Stadium, Nebraska played its home games at Antelope Park and Nebraska Field. Gameday traditions Since 1993, Nebraska's home games have opened with the \"Tunnel Walk\" as the team takes the field before kickoff, typically to the Alan Parsons Project instrumental \"Sirius.\" The team first emerged from the southwest corner of the field and later, upon the completion of the Osborne Athletic Complex in 2006, from the northwest corner. When NU's home locker room was moved to the Osborne Legacy Complex in 2023, the team's entrance was moved to the northeast corner of the stadium. The Tunnel Walk is preceded by a \"Husker Power\" chant – half the stadium chants \"Husker\" in unison and the other half responds with \"Power.\"[35] Fans have released red helium balloons when Nebraska scores its first points at home games since the 1930s.[36] Global helium shortages and environmental concerns in recent years have threatened the tradition, which was paused in 2012 and 2022.[37][38] Walk-on program NU accepted its first walk-ons in the early 1960s and Tom Osborne began an official program in 1973 when the NCAA reduced the number of scholarships schools could offer.[39] Nebraska stocked its program with walk-ons from across the region throughout Osborne's and Frank Solich's tenures, and as a result the school's rosters were often unusually large – NU had 202 players on its 2002 Rose Bowl team, while opponent Miami had 107.[40] Osborne credited his walk-ons with providing flexibility to better scout future opponents and provided them the same access to training facilities and academic counseling as those with scholarships.[41] Though NU's expansive walk-on program is most frequently associated with Osborne, the school has typically maintained a larger-than-usual roster since his retirement as well.[40][42] Six former Nebraska walk-ons have become All-Americans and twenty-nine have played in the National Football League.[43] Helmets Nebraska's first helmet was red with a single white stripe, later changed to plain white with a black number on the side. From 1967 to 1969, the helmet featured a red, offset \"NU\" on each side. In 1970, this was changed to the now-familiar single \"N,\" although a few \"NU\" helmets remained as late as 1971. The change was necessitated due to a shortage of \"U\" stickers, and when the program claimed its first national championship, the single N remained.[44] Aside from a facemask swap from gray to red, the helmet design is unchanged since. Jerseys The Cornhuskers wore full shoulder stripes in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which were phased out as mesh and tearaway jerseys became popular. From 1980 to 1983, Nebraska's jerseys featured only a block \"N\" on the sleeves. Stripes and TV numbers were permanently re-added in 1984, although both have decreased in size as jersey sleeves have shortened.[45] A patch was added to the left shoulder to commemorate the hundredth season of Nebraska football in 1989; it remained for future seasons and was altered to read \"Nebraska Football: A Winning Tradition.\"[46] Player last names first appeared on jerseys for road games and bowl games in the late 1970s, but home jerseys remained nameless except for seniors playing their final home game. Last names were permanently affixed to all jerseys in 1988.[45] Nebraska's defense is often referred to as the \"Blackshirts,\" a reference to the black jerseys worn by starting defensive players during practice. The tradition originated in 1964 when Bob Devaney wanted a way to more quickly distinguish between his various units.[47] Depictions of the Blackshirts often include a skull and crossbones. Pants Nebraska traditionally wears white pants at home and red on the road, with rare exceptions. The team first donned red pants with red jerseys for its 1986 contest with Oklahoma; the combination was unofficially retired after a Nebraska loss.[48] Nebraska first wore all-white uniforms in the 1991 Florida Citrus Bowl and again for its first three road games in 1992; NU lost three of these games and \"surrender suits,\" as they became known, were not used again for a decade.[49] Nebraska wore white-on-white in Bill Callahan's final game as head coach, a 65–51 loss to Colorado in 2007, and again on four occasions in 2014.[50] From 1968 through 1994, Nebraska's pants had two stripes down each side. These were removed prior to the 1995 season and the pants remained stripe-less until 2001. In 2002, Nebraska featured large side panels on its jersey and pants, and wore all-white in every road game – the changes were unpopular among fans and most were reverted, which included the return of pant stripes.[45] Pant stripes were again removed during Scott Frost's tenure as head coach as a tribute to the style from his playing career, and returned following his departure.[51] Alternate uniforms The first documented instance of Nebraska wearing alternate uniforms came against South Dakota in 1920 – the Cornhuskers were forced into blue jerseys when the visiting Coyotes mistakenly brought their home reds to Lincoln.[52] The same situation arose three years later against Oklahoma in the first-ever game at Memorial Stadium.[52] Nebraska celebrated the stadium's hundredth anniversary in 2023, wearing blue-trimmed jerseys to commemorate the occasion.[53] Nebraska did not use a pre-planned alternate design until 2009, and has used one each season since 2012. Many of these were throwback or \"fauxback\" uniforms, worn to commemorate past events or championships: 2009 (the 300th consecutive sellout at Memorial Stadium),[54] 2017 (the twentieth anniversary of Nebraska's 1997 national championship),[55] 2018 (the hundredth anniversary of the end of World War I),[56] 2021 (the twentieth anniversary of the September 11 attacks),[57] 2022 (to honor Nebraska's 1983 team),[58] and 2023 (the hundredth anniversary of Memorial Stadium).[53] Nebraska and Wisconsin played the first \"Adidas Unrivaled\" game in 2012; both schools wore uniforms featuring block letters instead of front numbers.[59] NU wore black jerseys with white stencil font numbers against UCLA the following year.[60] Nebraska wore an all-red uniform featuring black metallic stripes on the jersey and pants in 2014, and used similar all-black and all-white designs the next two seasons.[61] Nebraska wore Blackshirt-themed alternate uniforms in 2019, featuring a black jersey with a Blackshirts logo on both sleeves.[62] Scott Frost suggested this iteration may become a permanent alternate design to be worn after Nebraska's defense plays particularly well.[63] Nebraska used the uniforms again in 2020, and unveiled a white version to be worn away from home, but has not used either since.[64] Adidas has been Nebraska's official shoe and uniform sponsor since 1996. In 2017, the school and sponsor signed an eleven-year, $128 million apparel deal.[65] The \"rivalry\" between Nebraska and Colorado, one-sided for much of its history, gained traction with Colorado's resurgence in the 1990s. The teams have met 71 times, with the series dating back to 1898, a 23–10 Nebraska win. The Cornhuskers lead the series 50–21–2. The \"rivalry\" began when Bill McCartney dictated that Nebraska would become Colorado's rival by writing their name in red on the schedule when he arrived in 1982.[66] A bison head named Mr. Chip was presented to the winning team throughout the 1950s, but this exchange ended when Colorado misplaced the trophy in 1961.[67] The teams have not played annually since both programs exited the Big 12 in 2011.[citation needed] The Iowa–Nebraska rivalry debuted in 1891, a 22–0 Iowa win. Since 2011, the game is held annually the Friday after Thanksgiving. Also, the game was named the Heroes Game, and the winner keeps the Heroes Trophy. The teams have met 54 times, with the Cornhuskers leading the series 30–22–3.[citation needed] Nebraska and Kansas share a natural border rivalry and maintained the longest non-interrupted rivalry in college football history at 105 years. The teams have met 117 times, with the series dating back to 1892, a 12–0 Kansas win. The Cornhuskers lead the series 91–23–3, which includes 36 consecutive victories from 1969 to 2004. Since Nebraska's move to the Big Ten in 2011, the series has been dormant. No future games are scheduled.[citation needed] Nebraska and Kansas State were conference rivals from 1913 to 2010. With only 135 miles separating the schools, they were the nearest cross-border rivals in the Big Eight and Big 12 conferences. The teams have met 95 times, with the series dating back to 1911, a 59–0 Nebraska win. Nebraska leads the series 78–15–2, which includes 29 consecutive victories from 1969 to 1997. Since Nebraska's move to the Big Ten in 2011, the series has been dormant. No future games are scheduled.[citation needed] The 1939 game was televised in Manhattan, Kansas, making it the second televised college football game. The 1992 contest was held in Tokyo as the Coca-Cola Classic. Nebraska's series with Miami is among the most significant \"bowl rivalries\" in college football. The teams have met twelve times, with the series dating back to 1951, a 19–7 Miami win. The series is tied, 6–6. No future game is yet scheduled.[citation needed] The rivalry's most notable game is the 1984 Orange Bowl. Top-ranked Nebraska scored with seconds remaining to make the game 31–30, but NU head coach Tom Osborne opted to try for a two-point conversion instead of an extra point, even though a tie would have given Nebraska the national championship. Miami won the game and its first national title.[68] The $5 Bits of Broken Chair Trophy has been awarded to the winner of the Minnesota–Nebraska game since 2014. The teams have met 61 times, dating back to 1900, a 20–12 Minnesota win. The Golden Gophers lead the series 35–25–2. Minnesota holds the trophy after defeating the Cornhuskers in 2023. The teams will meet next in 2025.[citation needed] The Victory Bell (also known as the Missouri–Nebraska Bell) has been awarded to the winner of the Missouri–Nebraska game since 1927. The teams have met 104 times, with the series dating back to 1892, a 1–0 NU win when Missouri forfeited to protest the presence of African-American George Flippin on Nebraska's roster.[69] The Cornhuskers lead the series 65–36–3. Nebraska holds the Victory Bell after defeating the Tigers in 2010. Since Nebraska's move to the Big Ten in 2011, the series has been dormant. No future games are scheduled.[citation needed] Nebraska and Oklahoma has long been considered one of the great college football rivalries. The teams have met 87 times dating back to 1912, a 13–9 Nebraska win. The Sooners lead the series 46–38–3. Since Nebraska's move to the Big Ten in 2011, the series was dormant until 2021 when Oklahoma beat Nebraska 23–16 in Norman. Future non-conference games are scheduled for 2029 and 2030. Notably, the 2021 game in Norman marked the 50th anniversary of Nebraska's 35–31 victory over Oklahoma in the \"Game of the Century\".[citation needed] Nebraska dominated the series until 1942, going 16–3–3 in the first twenty-two meetings. The Sooners then won sixteen consecutive games, the longest streak in the series. Nebraska's 1959 win both ended the Cornhuskers' drought against the Sooners and snapped Oklahoma's 74-game conference win streak. Nebraska won the \"Game of the Century\" in 1971, of which Dave Kindred of The Courier-Journal wrote, \"They can quit playing now, they have played the perfect game.\" Oklahoma won every matchup from 1972 to 1977, a streak that ended in 1978, when Nebraska upset No. 1 Oklahoma; less than two months later, OU won a rematch in the Orange Bowl. Nebraska controlled the 1990s, including a 69–7 win in 1997, the largest margin of victory in series history. When the Big 12 was formed in 1996, the schools no longer played annually, ending a stretch of 68 consecutive years they had met. The teams met for the last time as conference opponents in the 2010 Big 12 Championship Game, when Oklahoma defeated Nebraska 23–20. The two programs combined to win 74 of 89 Big Eight championships, 41 by Nebraska and 33 by Oklahoma. The teams played eighteen times when both were ranked in the AP Poll top ten, and nine times when both were in the top five. The Freedom Trophy has been awarded to the winner of the Nebraska–Wisconsin game since 2014. The teams have met eighteen times, with the series dating back to 1901, an 18–0 Wisconsin win. The Badgers lead the series 13–5. Nebraska holds the Freedom Trophy after defeating the Badgers in 2024. The teams play annually. Winners in bold.

Campbell Trophy AP Player of the Year Twenty-seven former Nebraska coaches and players have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.[70] Nebraska has retired the number of three players and the jersey of twenty-two others.[71] The first of these was Tom Novak, the only four-time first-team all-conference selection in NU history, whose No. 60 was permanently retired shortly after the end of his playing career in 1949.[e][72] Johnny Rodgers became the second player to have his number retired after winning the 1972 Heisman Trophy – though Rodgers allowed his No. 20 to be worn by his son Terry (and several others, most recently in 2008), the university considers it \"permanently retired.\"[73] Rich Glover's jersey was retired at the same time as Rodgers's, but his No. 79 remained in circulation. Over the next several decades Nebraska retired the jersey of each of its major award winners, typically during the offseason following the end of their collegiate career.[73] Bob Brown, the first All-American coached by Bob Devaney at NU, had his No. 64 permanently retired in 2004.[f][73] In 2017, the school recognized eight of its early College Football Hall of Fame inductees – including Guy Chamberlin, whose career predated the use of numbers on jerseys – by retiring their jerseys in a ceremony celebrating the 125th anniversary of the N Club, an organization of past letterwinners.[72] The name and number of each honoree is displayed at Memorial Stadium, directly below the North Stadium press box. Nebraska leads the nation in Academic All-America selections, both in football and across all sports. Nebraska boasts seventy CoSIDA First-Team and 108 overall Academic All-America selections, both tops in the nation. The list includes fifteen Huskers that have been named first team Academic All-Americans twice in their careers. The Huskers also lead the nation with a total of 330 Academic All-Americans across all sports.[74] Nebraska has four players that have been selected as a First Team Academic All-American by entities other than CoSIDA: Don Fricke (1960), Pat Clare (1960), Jim Osberg (1965), and Tony Jeter (1965). Nebraska has had 368 former players drafted into the National Football League, including thirty-four first-round picks, two players selected first overall (Sam Francis in 1937 and Irving Fryar in 1984), and one player selected with the last pick of the draft (Stan Hegener in 1971). Guy Chamberlin, Nebraska's first consensus All-American, signed with the Decautur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) in 1920 and a year later, scored the game-winning touchdown in the controversial \"Staley Swindle\" game.[75] Chamberlin went on to win four more APFA/NFL championships as a player and coach and still has the highest winning percentage of any coach in NFL history (0.784, among coaches with at least fifty wins).[76] Former Nebraska I-back Roger Craig became the first player in NFL history to score three touchdowns in a Super Bowl in 1985. The following season, he became the first player with 1,000 rushing yards and 1,000 receiving yards in a single NFL season, and in 1988 he was named Offensive Player of the Year.[77] Craig and fullback Tom Rathman, another former Cornhusker, played five seasons together on a high-powered San Francisco 49ers offense, winning two more Super Bowls. Vince Ferragamo, Nebraska's quarterback in 1975 and 1976, started Super Bowl XIV for the Los Angeles Rams, the only former Cornhusker to start at quarterback in a Super Bowl.[78] Zac Taylor, another former Nebraska quarterback, was the head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl LVI.[78] NU was represented by at least one player in each Super Bowl from 1993 until 2019, the longest active streak of any school at the time it was snapped.[g][79] Five former Nebraska players have been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[80] There are nineteen Huskers on NFL rosters, along with three coaches.[81] Players Coaches The Big Ten Conference added four new member schools prior to the 2024 season and disbanded the division system it had used in some form since 2011.[82] Nebraska annually faces one protected rivalry in this scheduling format, Iowa. The remaining eight conference games rotate amongst the remaining sixteen teams.[83]",

                "content": "Every week for the duration of the 2024 NFL regular season, USA TODAY Sports will provide timely updates to the league's ever-evolving playoff picture − typically starting after Sunday afternoon's late games and then moving forward for the remainder of the week (through Monday's and Thursday's games or Saturday's, if applicable.) What just happened? What does it mean? What are the pertinent factors (and, perhaps, tiebreakers) prominently in play as each conference's seven-team bracket begins to crystallize? All will be explained and analyzed up to the point when the postseason field is finalized on Sunday, Jan. 5. Here's where things stand with Week 17 of the 2024 season underway: x – 1. Detroit Lions (13-2), NFC North leaders: Last week, they were in a three-way tie atop the conference and deadlocked for the division lead with Minnesota. But Philadelphia's Week 16 defeat makes it increasingly likely the Lions and Vikings will be playing for all the important regular-season marbles in Week 18. Winning out gives the Lions everything they want, including home-field advantage. So would a win at San Francisco on Monday night combined with a Minnesota loss to Green Bay. Remaining schedule: at 49ers, vs. Vikings NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. x – 2. Philadelphia Eagles (12-3), NFC East leaders: In Week 16, they lost their 10-game winning streak, an opportunity to wrap up the division and fell a game behind Detroit and Minnesota in the race for home-field advantage. Also, concussed QB Jalen Hurts won't play this Sunday. But the Eagles are still just one win or Commanders loss from locking up the division and at least the No. 2 seed. Remaining schedule: vs. Cowboys, vs. Giants 3. Los Angeles Rams (10-6), NFC West leaders: Saturday night's escape from Arizona could mean a division title if the strength-of-victory tiebreaker unfolds LA's way Sunday. \"Honestly, I have no idea,\" WR Puka Nacua said of the clinching scenario when asked on NFL Network after the triumph. \"They said we had a game at SoFi Stadium Saturday night, so that's what I showed up for.\" Barring that, there's a Week 18 meeting against Seattle that could still decide matters. Neither the Rams nor Seahawks have a pathway to a wild-card berth. Remaining schedule: vs. Seahawks 4. Atlanta Falcons (8-7), NFC South leaders: Rookie QB Michael Penix Jr. won his starting debut against the lowly Giants. But the real payoff came when the Bucs – they were swept earlier in the season by Atlanta – lost at Dallas in Week 16. The Falcons can win the division this Sunday with another victory and another Tampa Bay loss. Remaining schedule: at Commanders, vs. Panthers x – 5. Minnesota Vikings (13-2), wild card No. 1: Like Detroit, they control their own potentially high-yield fate – win out, and the NFC North and No. 1 seed are Minnesota's. Remaining schedule: vs. Packers, at Lions x – 6. Green Bay Packers (11-4), wild card No. 2: Getting swept by Detroit and losing once already to Minnesota relegated the Pack to wild-card status ... though Monday's whitewash of the Saints was the latest reminder that this might actually be the last NFC North team you want to see in January. But given Packers are guaranteed to open the playoffs on the road, it will be interesting to see how much they play their key starters over the next two weeks given the limited upside to doing so. Remaining schedule: at Vikings, vs. Bears 7. Washington Commanders (10-5), wild card No. 3: Despite beating the Eagles, they didn't quite clinch a postseason berth in Week 16 – but did remain alive in the NFC East. A win in Week 17 puts Washington into the dance. A loss could be highly problematic in the tiebreaker space as it would open an alternate avenue for the Bucs, who beat Washington in Week 1. Remaining schedule: vs. Falcons, at Cowboys 8. Seattle Seahawks (9-7), in the hunt: If they and the Rams wind up 10-7, which would require a Seahawks win at LA in Week 18, the undetermined strength-of-victory tiebreaker will prove pivotal, likely in LA's favor. But that assumes the Seahawks are not eliminated Sunday first after the Rams prevailed over the Cardinals. Remaining schedule: at Rams 9. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-7), in the hunt: The Bucs could see their aspirations to keep the NFC South throne die this weekend. However, if Atlanta beats Washington, then Tampa Bay has a more favorable shot at the NFC's final wild-card slot. Remaining schedule: vs. Panthers, vs. Saints All NFL news on and off the field. Sign up for USA TODAY's 4th and Monday newsletter. yz – 1. Kansas City Chiefs (15-1), AFC West champions: By crushing Pittsburgh on Christmas, they secured home-field advantage and a first-round bye – and really two-plus weeks off in actuality depending on whom they want to play in what's now a meaningless Week 18 contest for the champs. Remaining schedule: at Broncos, BYE y – 2. Buffalo Bills (12-3), AFC East champions: Now out of the running for the No. 1 seed, finishing second in the conference should still have meaning given the road to Super Bowl 59 could go through Western New York if the Chiefs lose their playoff opener. A win would also ensure Buffalo wouldn't have to go on the road for a playoff game unless the AFC championship is staged in Kansas City. Remaining schedule: vs. Jets, at Patriots x – 3. Baltimore Ravens (11-5), AFC North leaders: Catching fire? Probably an understatement. The Steelers' loss before Baltimore's Christmas kickoff vaulted the Ravens atop the division, and their dominant win over Houston keeps them there. A win or tie in Week 18 clinches it. Remaining schedule: vs. Browns y – 4. Houston Texans (9-7), AFC South champions: They rule a weak division for the second straight year, however Wednesday's loss locked them into the fourth seed ... which will likely mean a tough wild-card matchup, albeit in Houston, against an AFC North team. Remaining schedule: at Titans x – 5. Pittsburgh Steelers (10-6), wild card No. 1: That's three losses in a row, Wednesday's flat performance against K.C. costing them first place in the AFC North. However they can capture the divisional title by winning in Week 18 if Baltimore also loses to Cleveland. Remaining schedule: vs. Bengals x – 6. Los Angeles Chargers (10-6), wild card No. 2: Saturday's rout of the Patriots locked Bolts into the field and ensures Jim Harbaugh has been a playoff participant in four of his five NFL seasons as a head coach. Yet, having lost to the Ravens and Steelers earlier this season, the Chargers will most likely be the sixth seed – and probably head to Baltimore or Pittsburgh for a rematch. Remaining schedule: at Raiders 7. Denver Broncos (9-7), wild card No. 3: They've had win-and-in scenarios in their past two games and lost both times. Still, one more victory – or tie – will advance Denver to the playoffs for the first time since they won Super Bowl 50 with Peyton Manning and Von Miller nearly nine years ago. The Broncos' Week 18 game against Kansas City means basically nothing to the Chiefs – which could be a real advantage for Denver, which can do no better than the seventh seed. Remaining schedule: vs. Chiefs 8. Cincinnati Bengals (8-8), in the hunt: Still alive thanks to a four-game winning streak, including Saturday's overtime thriller against Denver. Though they appear like the best team outside the postseason field, the Bengals still need the most help to get in, including at least one loss by both the Colts and Dolphins. Cincinnati must also beat Pittsburgh in Week 18 and hope Denver loses again. Though the Bengals jumped Indy and Miami on Saturday, both hold tiebreakers that would move them past Cincinnati if they continue winning. Remaining schedule: at Steelers 9. Indianapolis Colts (7-8), in the hunt: Technically alive after winning in Week 16 and with a soft schedule on the way out. Their record in AFC games (6-5) is better than Miami's (5-5) and Cincinnati's (5-6). Indianapolis clinches if it winds up in a three- or four-way tie with teams all possessing 9-8 records. A two-way tie with Denver would mean the Broncos advance due to their Week 15 win over the Colts. Remaining schedule: at Giants, vs. Jaguars 10. Miami Dolphins (7-8), in the hunt: Technically alive after winning in Week 16 and with a soft schedule on the way out. They advance if tied with any combination of 9-8 teams that does not include the Colts. Remaining schedule: at Browns, at Jets Detroit clinches NFC North and NFC's No. 1 seed (first-round bye and home-field advantage) with: ▶ Win + Minnesota loss Atlanta clinches NFC South with: ▶ Win + Tampa Bay loss Philadelphia clinches NFC East with: Los Angeles Rams clinch NFC West with: ▶ Must clinch strength-of-victory tiebreaker over Seattle on Sunday (Note: Rams secure strength-of-victory tiebreaker with 2½ or more wins from the following teams: Buffalo, Cleveland, Minnesota, San Francisco and Washington. A tie equates to a half-win in this formula.) Washington clinches playoff berth with: Baltimore clinches AFC North with: ▶ Win or tie Pittsburgh clinches AFC North with: ▶ Win + Baltimore loss Denver clinches playoff berth with: ▶ Win or tie ▶ New York Giants ▶ Las Vegas Raiders ▶ New England Patriots ▶ Jacksonville Jaguars ▶ Tennessee Titans ▶ Cleveland Browns ▶ New York Jets ▶ Chicago Bears ▶ Carolina Panthers ▶ New Orleans Saints ▶ Dallas Cowboys ▶ San Francisco 49ers ▶ Arizona Cardinals x – clinched playoff berth y – clinched division z – clinched home-field advantage, first-round bye *** Follow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on X, formerly Twitter, @ByNateDavis",

It is also a founding member of the Value Alliance. The airline was established as a joint venture by Aekyung Group and the government of Jeju Province on January 25, 2005. It was established under a different Korean name (제주에어; a transliteration of \"Jeju Air\"). It received a business license on August 25, 2005, which made it the third major airline in the country after Korean Air and Asiana Airlines. On September 20, 2005, it changed its Korean name to its current form. It acquired its first aircraft on May 2, 2006, and had its first commercial flight, on the Jeju-Gimpo route, on June 5, 2006. By the end of 2006, it had five aircraft.[4] In addition to air service, the group is also the owner of a Holiday Inn Express in Seoul.[5] In 2016, it helped found Value Alliance, the world's first pan-regional low-cost carrier (LCC) alliance, comprising eight Asia Pacific LCCs.[6] In 2017, Jeju Air carried over 60 million passengers, with revenue reported of $890mm US operating profits over $80mm US. In 2018, Jeju Air carried 7.3 million international passengers along with 4.7 million domestic passengers. Its domestic traffic has been relatively flat since 2016 as it has focused almost entirely on international expansion.[7] Jeju Air flight operations were affected by the coronavirus outbreak. In November 2020, there were approximately 3,100 employees at the airline.[8] In August 2021, Jeju Air sold stock, raising $180 million for financing operations.[9] In 2024, in the National Customer Satisfaction Index (NCSI) organized by the Korea Productivity Headquarters, Jeju Air was ranked No. 1 in the LCC category for the third consecutive year.[10] Jeju Air offers scheduled domestic services, as well as international destinations including China, Japan, Oceania, and Southeast Asia.[11] Jeju Air maintains Codeshare agreements with the following airlines: As of December 2024[update], Jeju Air operates an all-Boeing 737 fleet composed of the following aircraft:[1][14][better source needed] Formerly, Jeju Air also operated the following aircraft types: Media related to Jeju Air at Wikimedia Commons",

As a child, she was enrolled in dancing classes to develop her physique, and she performed well enough to become a member of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens at 13, and was chosen as Miss Montreal at 18.[5] As a model in the 1970s and 1980s, Haddon represented Max Factor, Revlon, Estée Lauder, and L'Oréal. She appeared on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 1973 (January 29)[3] and was twice named to Harper's Bazaar's \"Ten Most Beautiful Women.\" She also appeared nude in the April 1973 issue of Playboy.[citation needed] Haddon worked as an actress, appearing in the Disney movie The World's Greatest Athlete (1973) with Jan-Michael Vincent. She moved to Europe, continued modeling and acting, and appeared in a number of film roles in French and English,[6] as well as occasional small parts in American movies. Her best known roles were in Madame Claude (1977), and North Dallas Forty (1979) opposite actor Nick Nolte.[citation needed] Haddon was originally cast for the role of Dale Arden in the 1980 film version of Flash Gordon, but producer Dino De Laurentiis replaced her with Melody Anderson just before filming commenced.[7] During Haddon's tenure as a main face for L'Oréal, sales for the Age Perfect line had increased by 50%.[8] According to The New York Times, Dayle had \"shattered age taboos\" with her multiyear contracts with L'Oréal and Estée Lauder, among other companies.[9] Clairol selected her as a spokesperson, and she later broke barriers for women over the age of 35 when she became the global face of a new anti-aging line for Estée Lauder, a first in the beauty industry. On the day that her Estée Lauder contract expired, L'Oréal signed her. She then had her own company, Dayle Haddon Concepts Inc. In early 2008 she was named a UNICEF ambassador.[10] Haddon was also the founder of a non-profit called WomenOne. The organization's motto is \"changing the world one woman at a time.\"[11] Through WomenOne, Haddon had partnered with Free The Children, an international charity, to provide scholarships for girls’ education in Kenya. Through her organization, she had raised and donated more than $150,000 for one of Free The Children's all-girls secondary schools.[12] Haddon also appeared as the face of a line of socially and environmentally responsible accessories launched by Me to We, Free The Children's partner organization.[13] She was the mother of Ryan Haddon.[14] On December 27, 2024, first responders found her unresponsive in a carriage house in Solebury Township, Pennsylvania, just outside New Hope. She was declared dead at the scene, and the cause was announced as accidental carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a defective boiler. She was 76 years old.[15]",

She was 76. Haddon was discovered in Blucas’ home in Bucks County, Pa. CBS referenced a police officer stating high levels of carbon monoxide were detected inside the property. A malfunction with the heating unit was also suspected. It has not yet been confirmed if Blucas was present at the time of death. Born and raised in Montreal, Haddon spoke both English and French. She was initially pursuing a career as a ballet dancer before becoming a model for Revlon, Estee Lauder, Clairol and Max Factor. She was featured on the cover of Vogue several times over the course of her career. She also appeared on the cover of the 1973 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and was recognized in Harper’s Bazaar’s list of “Ten Most Beautiful Women” twice.

                "content": "NEW HOPE, Pa. (AP) — Dayle Haddon, an actor, activist and trailblazing former “Sports Illustrated” model who pushed back against age discrimination by reentering the industry as a widow, has died in a Pennsylvania home from what authorities believe was carbon monoxide poisoning. Authorities in Bucks County found Haddon, 76, dead in a second-floor bedroom Friday morning after emergency dispatchers were notified about a person unconscious at the Solebury Township home. A 76-year-old man police later identified as Walter J. Blucas of Erie was hospitalized in critical condition. Responders detected a high level of carbon monoxide in the property and township police said Saturday that investigators determined that “a faulty flue and exhaust pipe on a gas heating system caused the carbon monoxide leak.” Two medics were taken to a hospital for carbon monoxide exposure and a police officer was treated at the scene. As a model, Haddon appeared on the covers of Vogue, Cosmopolitan, Elle and Esquire in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the 1973 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. She also appeared in about two dozen films from the 1970s to 1990s, according to IMDb.com, including 1994’s “Bullets Over Broadway,” starring John Cusack. Haddon left modeling after giving birth to her daughter, Ryan, in the mid-1970s, but then had to reenter the workforce after her husband’s 1991 death. This time she found the modeling industry far less friendly: “They said to me, ‘At 38, you’re not viable,’” Haddon told The New York Times in 2003. Working a menial job at an advertising agency, Haddon began reaching out to cosmetic companies, telling them there was a growing market to sell beauty products to aging baby boomers. She eventually landed a contract with Clairol, followed by Estée Lauder and then L’Oreal, for which she promoted the company’s anti-aging products for more than a decade. She also hosted beauty segments for CBS’s “The Early Show.” “I kept modeling, but in a different way,” she told The Times, “I became a spokesperson for my age.” In 2008, Haddon founded WomenOne, an organization aimed at advancing educational opportunities for girls and women in marginalized communities, including Rwanda, Haiti and Jordan.' Haddon was born in Toronto and began modeling as a teenager to pay for ballet classes — she began her career with the Canadian ballet company Les Grands Ballet Canadiens, according to her website. Haddon’s daughter, Ryan, said in a social media post that her mother was “everyone’s greatest champion. An inspiration to many.” “A pure heart. A rich inner life. Touching so many lives. A life well lived. Rest in Light, Mom,” she said. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

                "content": "The Hershey Company, often called just Hershey or Hershey's, is an American multinational confectionery company headquartered in Hershey, Pennsylvania, which is also home to Hersheypark and Hershey's Chocolate World. The Hershey Company is one of the largest chocolate manufacturers in the world; it also manufactures baked products, such as cookies and cakes, and sells beverages like milkshakes, as well as other products (through mergers and acquisitions). The Hershey Company was founded by Milton S. Hershey in 1894 as the Hershey Chocolate Company, originally established as a subsidiary of his Lancaster Caramel Company. The Hershey Trust Company owns a minority stake but retains a majority of the voting power within the company.[6] Hershey's chocolate is available in 60 countries.[7] It has three large distribution centers with modern labor management systems.[8] In addition, Hershey is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation. It is also associated with the Hersheypark Stadium and the Giant Center. The Hershey Company has no affiliation to Hershey Creamery Company, though both companies were founded in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in the same year. The companies have had a tumultuous relationship marked by multiple legal battles over trademark issues. In the mid-1990s, the companies settled their most recent legal battles out of court, with Hershey Creamery Company agreeing to add a disclaimer to its ice cream products to note that it is not affiliated with the Hershey Company.[9] After an apprenticeship to a Lancaster confectioner in 1873, Milton S. Hershey opened a candy shop in Philadelphia. The venture failed, and so did a subsequent one in Chicago. After a third failed business attempt in New York City, Hershey returned to Pennsylvania, where he founded the Lancaster Caramel Company in 1883.[10] The Hershey Chocolate Company was founded in 1894 as a subsidiary of Lancaster Caramel Company. In 1896, Hershey built a milk-processing plant so he could create and refine a recipe for his milk chocolate candies. In 1899, he developed the Hershey process, which is less sensitive to milk quality than traditional methods. In 1900, he began manufacturing the Hershey's Milk Chocolate bar. The use of fresh milk in caramels proved successful,[11] and in 1900, after seeing chocolate-making machines for the first time at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Hershey sold his caramel company for $1,000,000[11] (equal to $36,624,000 today), and concentrated on chocolate. To people who questioned him, he said, \"Caramels are just a fad, but chocolate is a permanent thing.\" In 1903, Hershey began construction of a chocolate plant in his hometown of Derry Church, Pennsylvania, later known as Hershey, Pennsylvania.[11] The town was an inexpensive place for the workers and their families to live, though the factory was built without windows, so that employees would not be distracted. To increase employee morale, Hershey provided leisure activities and created what would later become Hersheypark. The milk chocolate bars from this plant proved popular, and the company grew rapidly. In 1907, he introduced a new candy: bite-sized, flat-bottomed, conical pieces of chocolate that he named Hershey's Kiss. At first, each was wrapped by hand in a square of aluminum foil. The introduction of machine wrapping in 1921 sped up the process and added a small paper ribbon to the top of the package, indicating that it was a genuine Hershey product.[11] Today, over 70 million candies are produced daily.[12] Other products introduced included Mr. Goodbar (peanuts in milk chocolate) in 1925, Hershey's Syrup in 1926, semi-sweet chocolate chips (a mixture of milk and dark chocolate) in 1928, and the Krackel bar with crisped rice in 1938. Harry Burnett Reese invented Reese's Peanut Butter Cups after founding the H. B. Reese Candy Company in 1923.[13] Reese died on May 16, 1956, in West Palm Beach, Florida, leaving the company to his six sons.[14] On July 2, 1963, the H. B. Reese Candy Company merged with the Hershey Chocolate Corporation in a tax-free stock-for-stock merger.[15] In 1969, only six years after the Reese/Hershey merger, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups became the Hershey Company's top seller.[16] As of September 20, 2012, Reese's was the best-selling candy brand in the United States, with sales of $2.603 billion, and the fourth-best-selling brand globally, with sales of $2.679 billion. In 2024, after 61 years of stock splits,[17] the original 666,316 shares of Hershey common stock received by the Reese family represent 16 million Hershey shares valued at more than $4.4 billion, paying annual cash dividends of $87.6 million.[18][19][20] In the late 1930s, Hershey confronted labor unrest as a Congress of Industrial Organizations-backed union attempted to organize the factory workers. A failed sit-down strike in 1937 ended in violence; loyalist workers and local dairy farmers beat many of the strikers as they attempted to leave the plant. By 1940, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor successfully organized Hershey's workers under the leadership of John Shearer, who became the first president of Local Chapter Number 464 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union. Local 464 now represents the Hershey workforce. From around 1938 to 1952, Milton Hershey tried to make toilet soap, which saw a big boom after the Great Depression as well as other hygiene-related items such as shampoo, toothpaste and perfume. Hershey took this opportunity to try to open a store on the Atlantic City Boardwalk, which sold cocoa butter scented toilet soap. The shop was a success for several decades, and the soap's production was sourced from Hershey Estates. Other soaps such as keystone soap, tar soap and shaving soap were also sold at the shop. Product distribution extended from New York City to Baltimore by 1953, when the shop closed down.[21] Shortly before World War II, Bruce Murrie, son of long-time Hershey's president William F.R. Murrie, struck a deal with Forrest Mars to create hard sugar-coated chocolate that would be called M&M's (for Mars and Murrie). Murrie had a 20% interest in the product, which used Hershey chocolate during World War II rationing. In 1948, Mars bought out Murrie and became one of Hershey's main competitors.[22] In 1969, Hershey received a license from UK-based Rowntree's to manufacture and market Kit Kat and Rolo in the United States. After Hershey's competitor Nestlé acquired Rowntree's in 1988, it was still required to honor the agreement, and so Hershey continues to make and market the products in the U.S. The license would revert to Nestlé if Hershey were sold.[23] This became a sticking point in Hershey's failed attempt to attract a serious buyer in 2002, and even Nestlé rejected Hershey's asking price, feeling that the economics would not work.[24] In 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelēz International). In 2015, they sued a British importer to halt imports of British Cadbury chocolate, which reportedly angered consumers.[25][26] A merger between Mondelēz and Hershey's was considered but abandoned in 2016 after Hershey's turned down a $23 billion cash-and-stock bid.[27] In 1977, Hershey acquired Y&S Candies (based in nearby Lancaster), makers of Twizzlers licorice candies, founded in 1845. In 1986, Hershey's made a brief foray into cough drops when it acquired the Luden's cough drops brand. In 2001, the brand was sold to Pharmacia, now part of Pfizer,[28] and Luden's later was acquired by Prestige Brands.[29] Hershey's kept Luden's 5th Avenue bar. In 1996, Hershey purchased the American operations of the Leaf Candy Company from Huhtamäki. In 1999, the Hershey Pasta Group was divested to several equity partners to form the New World Pasta company, which is now part of Ebro Foods. On July 25, 2002, Hershey Trust Company announced that it sought to sell its controlling interest in the Hershey Foods Corporation. The value of Hershey stock rose 25% in a single day, with over 19 million shares traded. Over the following 55 days, criticism of the intended sale from media, the Pennsylvania Attorney General, the Hershey, and Dauphin County Orphans' Court senior judge, led the company to abandon its attempt to sell the company. Seven Hershey trustees who voted to sell Hershey Foods on September 17, 2002, for US$12.5 billion to the Wrigley Company, which is now part of Mars, Incorporated, were removed by Pennsylvania's Attorney and the Dauphin County Orphans' Court judge.[30] Ten of the 17 trustees were forced to resign and four new members who lived locally were appointed. Former Pennsylvania Attorney General LeRoy S. Zimmerman became the new chairman of the reconstituted Milton Hershey School Trustees. Zimmerman publicly committed to having the Milton Hershey School Trust always maintain its ownership of the Hershey Company. In December 2004, Hershey acquired the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corp. from The Shansby Group.[31] In 2005, Krave Jerky was founded by Jon Sebastiani after he trained for a marathon and looked for a healthy source of energy.[32] Alliance Consumer Growth, a private equity group, invested in Krave Jerky in 2012.[33] Hershey's purchased the company in 2015 for $240 million.[34] Hershey would later in 2020 sell Krave Jerky to Sonoma Brands, the food industry incubator founded by Sebastiani in 2016.[35] In July 2005, Hershey acquired the Berkeley, California-based boutique chocolate-maker Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker.[36] In November 2005, Hershey acquired Joseph Schmidt Confections, the San Francisco-based chocolatier, and in November 2006, Hershey acquired Dagoba Organic Chocolate, a boutique chocolate maker based in Ashland, Oregon. In June 2006, Philadelphia city councilman Juan Ramos called for Hershey's to stop marketing \"Ice Breakers Pacs\", a kind of mint, due to the resemblance of its packaging to a kind that was used for illegal street drugs.[37] In September 2006, ABC News reported that several Hershey chocolate products were reformulated to replace cocoa butter with vegetable oil as an emulsifier. According to the company, this change was made to reduce the costs of producing the products instead of raising their prices or decreasing the sizes. Some consumers complained that the taste was different, but the company stated that in the company-sponsored blind taste tests, about half of consumers preferred the new versions. As the new versions no longer met the Food and Drug Administration's official definition of \"milk chocolate\", the changed items were relabeled from stating they were \"milk chocolate\" and \"made with chocolate\" to \"chocolate candy\" and \"chocolatey.\"[38] In December 2011, Hershey reached an agreement to acquire Brookside Foods Ltd., a privately held confectionery company based in Abbotsford, British Columbia.[39] In 2016, Hershey acquired barkTHINS, a New York-based chocolate snack foods company for $290 million.[40][34] An August 2016 attempt to sell Hershey to Mondelez International was abandoned following objections by the Hershey Trust.[23] In 2017, Hershey acquired Amplify Snack Brands, the Austin, Texas-based manufacturer of SkinnyPop in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.6 billion.[41] In September 2018, Hershey announced the purchase of Pirate Brands from B&G Foods for $420 million in an all-cash deal.[42][43][44] These acquisitions marked Hershey's expansion into non-confectionery products. In August 2019, Hershey announced it would purchase protein bar maker One Brands LLC for $397 million.[45] In October 2019, Hershey announced a collaboration with Yuengling to produce a limited release collaboration beer titled Yuengling Hershey's Chocolate Porter, becoming Hershey's first licensed beer partnership.[46] In June 2021, Hershey acquired Lily's for $425 million.[47] In November 2021, Hershey announced plans to acquire Dot’s Homestyle Pretzels, and their co-packer, Pretzel INC for $1.2B. In 2023, the company entered the field of plant-based chocolate concocted with dairy alternatives. The snacks are marketed as Plant Based Extra Creamy and Plant Based Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.[48] Hershey brands are mostly chocolate or candy-based, and the Hershey Company also manufactures gum. Its main markets are the U.S. and Canada.[49] Unable to have children of his own, Milton S. Hershey, founder of the Hershey Company, founded the Hershey Industrial School in 1909 for white orphaned boys.[50] In 1918, three years after the death of his wife, Milton Hershey donated around $90 million to the boarding school in trust, as well as 40% of the Hershey Company's common stock.[51] The school's initial purpose was to train young men in trades but eventually shifted to focus on preparation for college.[51] The Hershey Trust Company has exercised voting rights for the school and has been a trustee since its founding.[52] Many of its designs resemble Hershey chocolate products, such as the Hershey Kisses street lights.[53] Milton Hershey was involved in the school's operations until his death in 1945. The Hershey Industrial School was renamed the Milton Hershey School in 1951.[54] The first plant outside Hershey opened on June 15, 1963, in Smiths Falls, Ontario, and the third opened on May 22, 1965, in Oakdale, California.[55] In February and April 2007, Hershey's announced that the Smiths Falls[56][57] and Oakdale[58][59] plants would close in 2008, being replaced in part by a new facility in Monterrey, Mexico. The Oakdale factory closed on February 1, 2008.[60] Hershey chocolate factory in São Roque, Brazil, was opened in August 2002. Hershey's Asia operations were largely supplied by their plant in Mandideep, India.[2] Hershey also has plants in Stuarts Draft, Virginia, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Hazleton, Pennsylvania, Memphis, Tennessee, Robinson, Illinois, and Guadalajara, Mexico. Visitors to Hershey can experience Hershey's Chocolate World visitors center and its simulated tour ride. Public tours were once operated in the Pennsylvania and California factories, which ended in Pennsylvania in 1973 as soon as Hershey's Chocolate World opened,[61] and later in California following the September 11, 2001, attacks, due to security concerns.[59] On September 18, 2012, Hershey opened a new and expanded West Hershey plant. The plant was completed at a budget of $300 million.[62] On March 9, 2018, Hershey broke ground to expand its Kit Kat manufacturing facility in Hazle Township, Pennsylvania. The expansion project has a $60 million budget and is expected to create an additional 111 jobs at the facility.[63] On August 17, 2023, it was announced that Hershey repurchased their plant in Smiths Falls, Ontario for $53 million. The plant was previously owned by cannabis company Canopy Growth.[64] Hershey has made large contributions to education. One of their most notable contributions was to the honors program at Elizabethtown College in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania.[68] The program was established in 1999 and is funded partially through the endowment. In 2015, Hershey announced a commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative to help build a sustainable supply chain to support basic nutrition for children in Ghana.[69] Hershey's long-term focus on children and families has yielded long-standing partnerships with organizations such as Children's Miracle Network, Ronald McDonald House, and United Way (UW). In 2016, the company donated more than $486,200 to those organizations.[70] Hershey has been criticized for not having programs to ensure sustainable and ethical cocoa purchases, lagging behind its competitors in fair trade measures.[71] The \"Raise the Bar, Hershey!\" campaign was launched in September 2010 by Global Exchange, Green America, the Oasis Trust, and the International Labor Rights Forum. The purpose of the Raise the Bar Campaign was to pressure Hershey to commit \"to take immediate action to eliminate forced and child labor ... from Hershey's cocoa supply\"; \"to sourcing 100% Fair Trade Certified cocoa beans by 2012 for at least one of its top five selling chocolate bars ... making at least one additional top five selling bar 100% Fair Trade Certified every two years thereafter\"; and that \"the majority of Hershey's cocoa across all products will be Fair Trade Certified by 2022\". The pressure was particularly directed at Whole Foods Market, which announced on October 3, 2012, that it would cease carrying Hershey's Scharffen Berger line.[72] The campaign stated, \"Whole Foods' decision follows more than 40 natural food retailers and coops publicly expressing concern about carrying Scharffen Berger and Dagoba products as a consequence of the giant chocolate maker's refusal to address child labor in its supply chain\".[72] The same day, Hershey's announced it would \"source 100 percent certified cocoa for its global chocolate product lines by 2020 and help to accelerate its programs to help eliminate child labor in the cocoa regions of West Africa\".[73] In 2019, Hershey announced that they could not guarantee that their chocolate products were free from child slave labor, as they could trace only about 50% of their purchasing back to the farm level. According to The Washington Post, the commitment made in 2001 to eradicate such practices within four years had not been kept, neither at the due deadline of 2005, nor within the revised deadlines of 2008 and 2010, and that the result was not likely to be achieved for 2020.[74] In 2021, Hershey was named in a class action lawsuit filed by eight former child slaves from Mali who alleged that the company aided and abetted their enslavement on cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast. The suit accused Hershey, Nestlé, Cargill, Mars, Incorporated, Olam International, Barry Callebaut, and Mondelez International of knowingly engaging in forced labor, and the plaintiffs sought damages for unjust enrichment, negligent supervision, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.[75] The case was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich in 2022.[76] In December 2022, Hershey was subjected to a lawsuit over the amount of lead and cadmium in the company's products, especially the Special Dark bar, the 70% Lily Bar, and the 85% Lily Bar.[77] The lawsuit alleged that the company failed to warn consumers about the amount of metal in the bars and was based on findings published by the Consumer Reports magazine in the United States.[78] The presence of butyric acid in Hershey's chocolate, due to the use of controlled lipolysis in the production process, results in a flavor unfamiliar to those accustomed to chocolate from other parts of the world. In the UK, this has often been compared to the smell and taste of vomit.[79][80][81][82]",

Only read on if you want to know today's Wordle answer! Our first tip is that you should use one of the best Wordle start words for every game you play. But if you want some more specific clues to today's Wordle answer, then here you go: * By vowel, we mean A, E, I, O, U. There are other letters that are sometimes considered to be vowels, depending on how they are used. Those hints should get you at least some of the way towards finding today's Wordle answer.

The answer to Wordle #1,289 starts with M, so combined with the hints above you should now have all the clues you need to get the answer and not break a Wordle streak. OK, it's now time to scroll down for the answer… So, what is today's Wordle answer for game #1,289? Drumroll, please — it's MAMBO. Hello Wordlers. A really tricky one today: outside of the hit song Mambo No. 5, I don't think I've ever heard anyone use the word MAMBO in a sentence before. And it has a unusual character for its repeated letter too. I began with ORATE, which contains all five of the most common Wordle letters, and it duly turned both 'O' and 'A' yellow. That still left a massive 73 options available, according to WordleBot. The Bot's best Wordle start words naturally improved on that. BLAST leaves 32 answers, while TABLE takes that all the way down to 14. If you opened with SALON, only 12 answers would be left over. Funnily enough, SALON was my next pick, as it contains three of the five characters I aim to prioritize on my second turn: 'L', 'I', 'S', 'N' and 'C'. 'A' turned green, while 'O' was ruled out in a second spot, taking me down to just four possible answers, according to WordleBot*. As you'll see from the footnote, none of these are especially common words, but eventually I came up with MACHO. It turned both 'M' and 'O' green, leaving only the right answer as an option. But it still took me a while to get it. After picking through my available characters multiple times, I concluded it had to be a double letter. Eventually, I tried MAMBO to complete the puzzle in four moves. Hopefully you did well today, Wordlers. See you tomorrow. * These were: CACAO, WACKO, MACHO and MAMBO Reading this in a later time zone? The Wordle answer for game #1,288 was DECRY. Hello Wordlers. A bit of a devious one today, which had me struggling for quite a while. It's an unusual word, with an unusual structure. I began with ORATE, which contains all five of the most common Wordle letters. Today, that revealed two yellow letters: an 'R' and an 'E'. That sounds helpful, but still leaves a massive 141 possible answers in play, according to WordleBot. Wordlebot's best Wordle start words were a big improvement on that, as you might imagine. DEALT leaves 14 answers, while CARET reduces that to 11. If you opened with REACT, only two options would be available. I try to prioritize 'L', 'I', 'S', 'N' and 'C' on my second go, and I did that with LINER today. It ruled out both 'E' and 'R' in two more spots, cutting me down to 23 answers, according to WordleBot*. I tried a double letter next with BERRY. Finally: three green letters in 'E', 'R' and 'Y'. Then, in my desperation to type anything, I made a mistake. I accidentally played 'L' again with LEERY. Stupid. I was really struggling now, running through all my remaining letters twice to see what I could have missed. Eventually I tried 'C' in the second slot and realized it had to be DECRY for a five-turn win. Hopefully today's puzzle didn't break your streak, Wordlers. See you tomorrow. * These were: MERCY, PERKY, JERKY, PERCH, SERUM, MERCH, EVERY, QUERY, EMERY, FERRY, MERRY, REBUS, REDUB, SPERM, BERRY, DERBY, DECRY, REEDY, REDUX, EXURB, RHEUM, REBUY and REFRY, If you're looking for a list of older Wordle answers, we can also help. Here's a list going back 20 games. The best tip I can give is to use one of the best Wordle start words. I can't stress this enough — it makes a massive difference. Without one, you'll be scrabbling around in the dark trying (and possibly failing) to find the right five letters (or possibly fewer) out of the 26 possibles. But clever people (not me) have done the math and identified the best start words based on both frequency in English and frequency among Wordle answers. So use them! Secondly, think about combinations, especially at the start and end. Some options are far more common than others — for instance, SH, ST, CR and CH all feature frequently. Vowels obviously need consideration too: not all Wordle answers will contain more than one, but plenty do, and some even have three. A good Wordle start word should have used a couple, but if they don't feature you might well want to try another one or two on your next go. Plus, remember the Y — this sometimes acts as a surrogate vowel, and is easy to forget. It also appears at the end of plenty of words. Finally, try out possibilities. So long as you don't press 'Enter' you can try possible answers to see how they look on screen. Put in likely letters plus any you know are definitely in the word, then mentally change one to the other available options. This technique has worked for me multiple times, and it's particularly helpful when the word in question is not an obvious one (like FJORD or ISLET).

(You can read my thoughts on the 5 things Wordle needs to improve if it's to keep us playing on into a fourth and fifth year.) However, it only grew in popularity towards the end of the year, then went viral in January as the world woke up to its charms. In fact, it proved so successful that The New York Times bought Wordle for a seven-figure sum in early February and the game is now part of NYT Games. It's played via the NYT Games website here, and is entirely free. Both the NYT and the game's creator, Josh Wardle, have stated that it will remain free. Some people think that Wordle has got harder since the NYT takeover, but it really hasn't. Wordle is a simple game in which your challenge is to guess a five-letter word in six attempts. Each time you guess, you're told which of your chosen letters are in the target word, and whether they are in the right place. If a letter is in the correct place, it turns green. If it's in the word but in the wrong place, it turns yellow. And if it's not in the word at all, it turns gray. There's just one puzzle a day, and everyone completes the same one. It resets at midnight each day. You'll find more information about the game in our What is Wordle? article. If you've solved Wordle and need help with other games from the New York Times, we suggest you check out our guide on today's NYT Strands answer, which will give you some hints as well as the full answer to today's puzzle. If you're eager for another game to pass the time while you wait, we've put together a list of the best Wordle alternatives. Other Wordle alternatives to try are the ultra-stressful (but very good) Squabble and the soccer-themed, Who Are Ya?. We also like the geography-based Wordle clone Worldle, the Star Wars-themed SWordle and the math-based Mathler. There are certainly plenty of options once you've finished Wordle for the day!

SPOILER WARNING: Today's Wordle answer and hints are below, so don't read on if you don't want to see them. Marc is TechRadar’s Global Editor in Chief and has been obsessed with Wordle for more than two years. He's authored dozens of articles on the game for TechRadar and its sister site Tom's Guide, including a detailed analysis of the most common letters in Wordle in every position and a guide to the best Wordle start words. He's also played every Wordle ever and only lost once and yes, he takes it all too seriously. • Wordle today has vowels in two places*. * Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too). • The first letter in today's Wordle answer is M. M is a middling letter when it comes to starting a word. It sits 10th in the rankings, with 107 occurrences in the 2,309 answers. • There are repeated letters in today's Wordle. Repeated letters are quite common in the game, with 748 of the 2,309 Wordle answers containing one. However, it's still more likely that a Wordle doesn't have one. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. • The last letter in today's Wordle is O. O is a middling ending letter. It ranks 12th in this regard, and finishes 58 Wordle answers in total. Still looking for more Wordle hints today? Here's an extra one for game #1289. If you just want to know today's Wordle answer now, simply scroll down – but I'd always recommend trying to solve it on your own first. We've got lots of Wordle tips and tricks to help you, including a guide to the best Wordle start words. If you don't want to know today's answer then DO NOT SCROLL ANY FURTHER BECAUSE IT IS PRINTED BELOW. So don't say you weren't warned! * From WordleBot's Top 20 start words Today's Wordle answer (game #1289) is… MAMBO. What is it about Wordles with multiple Ms? As my analysis of every Wordle answer shows, there are only 15 of these among the 2,309 original solutions, and so far we've had 10, including today's. I don't have an average score for the first three – MIMIC (game #48), MAXIM (#50) and GAMMA (#93) – but I do for the remainder. These are COMMA (#291, average score 4.5), MADAM (#387, 4.3), MUMMY (#491, 5.8), MAGMA (#791, 4.9), GUMMY (#1,076, 4.6), MOMMY (#1,208, 5.0) and now MAMBO, which currently has an average of 4.7. Together, they have an average of 4.82 – which must make the repeated-M pattern one of the toughest in the game overall. MAMBO is particularly difficult due to the O at the end – a relatively unusual format in its own right – and the B just before it. B is very common at the start of a word, but a lot less so elsewhere, to the extent that it only occurs in position #4 a total of 24 times. BO as an ending combination, meanwhile, only turns up five times altogether; this is the first of them. There was no salvation to be found among the best Wordle start words today, either, with only a handful of WordleBot's top 20 dipping below 100, and most way above that. My randomly chosen SKULL was in a different class entirely, though; that left 1,274 possible answers! I played the odds with my second guess, going for TRACE based on commonality of letters, but though WordleBot loved it, it was unlucky; I had only a single yellow A still, and a rather long shortlist of 65 words. Not that I actually had that many jotted down, of course; that's merely what WordleBot told me afterwards. But I had a hunch that the A would go in the second slot, and packed the rest of the word with what common letters remained to make BANDY. Finally my luck turned, as BANDY gave me a yellow B and green A. This now reduced my word pool to only two: MAMBO and MAMBA. I didn't think the latter would be an answer (although who knows…) so went with the former and walked away relatively unscathed with a 4/6. How did you do today? Send me an email and let me know. In a different time zone where it's still Saturday? Don't worry – I can give you some clues for Wordle #1288, too. * Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too). D is the ninth most common starting letter in the game, so maybe slightly less likely than you might expect. Repeated letters are quite common in the game, with 748 of the 2,309 Wordle answers containing one. However, it's still more likely that a Wordle doesn't have one. Y is the second most common ending letter in the game, behind only E. In total, 364 Wordle answers end with a Y. Still looking for more Wordle hints? Here's an extra one for game #1288. * From WordleBot's Top 20 start words Yesterday's Wordle answer (game #1288) was… DECRY. A good first guess is always helpful in Wordle, but an unlucky (or poor) opener needn't be a disaster. That's because things can change very quickly in this game, and you need only look at my board above today for proof of that. DECRY is a relatively tough Wordle, with an average score of 4.1. Its difficulty probably stems from its relative obscurity as a word; it's a little archaic, not the kind of thing you get people saying on TikTok or whatever. But letter-wise, there's really nothing to fear here. And indeed, if your start word contained C, R and E – which many do – you'll have had a very good first guess. CRANE, for instance, left only 14 answers, as did CRATE. CARET was better still, at 11. Even STARE – which doesn't have a C – left only 13. However, my opener was AMUSE, which doesn't contain a C or R, and which was therefore rather less helpful; it left 463 possible answers. With a yellow E at the end of the word, and with R not yet played, I did what I long ago learned to do at the earliest opportunity and submitted an ER word next. If I'd have been right, it would have given me the best chance of narrowing down the options quickly. If wrong… well, I'd have been playing common letters in obvious positions anyway, and sometimes that's all you can do. I went with TILER, in order to include three other likely letters, and though it didn't reveal an ER answer, it did give me plenty of information. I now knew, for instance, that there was indeed an R, but that it wasn't at the end. And I knew that the E couldn't be in either of the final two spots. WordleBot told me that I now had 18 possible answers left, but I didn't know that at the time and didn't find anywhere near that many. I did, however, come up with several that ended in RY – including FERRY, BERRY, EVERY and, yes, DECRY. I didn't find many more, but in fairness several of those on the 'bot's list seem unlikely to be solutions. For instance, DRECK – really? Or RECON, which I'm not sure counts as a proper word. That said, SNAFU was an answer once, so who knows… Anyway, I decided to play DECRY because all five letters were common and I figured it would tell me if this was a Y-ending word or not. And lo and behold, it was the actual answer. That's one of the luckiest third guesses I've had in some time, nicely offsetting some of the misfortune I had on that opening guess. I've been playing Wordle every day for more than two years now and have tracked all of the previous answers so I can help you improve your game. Here are the last 50 solutions starting with yesterday's answer, or check out my past Wordle answers page for the full list. If you're on this page then you almost certainly know what Wordle is already, and indeed have probably been playing it for a while. And even if you've not been playing it, you must surely have heard of it by now, because it's the viral word game phenomenon that took the world by storm last year and is still going strong in 2024. We've got a full guide to the game in our What is Wordle page, but if you just want a refresher then here are the basics. Wordle challenges you to guess a new five-letter word each day. You get six guesses, with each one revealing a little more information. If one of the letters in your guess is in the answer and in the right place, it turns green. If it's in the answer but in the wrong place, it turns yellow. And if it's not in the answer at all it turns gray. Simple, eh? It's played online via the Wordle website or the New York Times' Crossword app (iOS / Android), and is entirely free. Crucially, the answer is the same for everyone each day, meaning that you're competing against the rest of the world, rather than just against yourself or the game. The puzzle then resets each day at midnight in your local time, giving you a new challenge, and the chance to extend your streak. The rules of Wordle are pretty straightforward, but with a couple of curveballs thrown in for good measure. 1. Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green. 2. Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow. 3. Letters that are not in the answer turn gray. 4. Answers are never plural. 5. Letters can appear more than once. So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green. 6. Each guess must be a valid word in Wordle's dictionary. You can't guess ABCDE, for instance. 7. You do not have to include correct letters in subsequent guesses unless you play on Hard mode. 8. You have six guesses to solve the Wordle. 9. You must complete the daily Wordle before midnight in your timezone. 10. All answers are drawn from Wordle's list of 2,309 solutions. However… 11. Wordle will accept a wider pool of words as guesses – some 10,000 of them. For instance, you can guess a plural such as WORDS. It definitely won't be right (see point 4 above), but Wordle will accept it as a guess.

The Bengals assured their late-season fight for the postseason would stay alive Saturday, taking down the Broncos, 30-24, on a walk-off touchdown in overtime from Tee Higgins, his third score of the game. Denver came into the Week 17 matchup looking for either a win or tie to secure its first playoff spot since 2015. But despite a valiant effort from rookie quarterback Bo Nix to keep the Broncos in the game, plus a missed Bengals field goal in overtime, Cincinnati held on to keep its playoff hopes alive behind a huge game from Joe Burrow. Burrow totaled 412 passing yards, three touchdowns — all of which went to Higgins — and no interceptions in the thrilling win in Cincinnati. The tension between the two AFC playoff contenders heated up in the fourth quarter, when the Broncos and Bengals scored two touchdowns each in a span of around 11 minutes. Although Denver, now 9-7, didn't clinch a playoff spot as it had hoped entering Week 17, Nix also turned in an outstanding performance. The rookie completed 24 of his 31 passes for 219 yards, three touchdowns and an interception, also putting on a show with two clutch touchdown passes in the fourth quarter to Marvin Mims Jr. Three teams still trail Denver in the AFC wild-card race, including Cincinnati, which is now 8-8. With Saturday's win, the Bengals pushed the conference's playoff chaos into Week 18. Denver, Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Miami could all still compete for the No. 7 seed in the AFC due to the Bengals' overtime win over the Broncos.

BENGALS WIN IN OT ‼️Insane game.🎥: @NFL pic.twitter.com/sI7n2NmTTY 8:00 p.m. — What a beautiful, clutch snag from Tee Higgins, continuing his huge performance.

He goes for 13 yards, with his team now inside the 40-yard line. 7:56 p.m. — Burrow continues an excellent performance, going to Iosivas for 16 yards. A field goal can win it for Cincinnati, but after York's 33-yard miss just minutes ago, you can be sure they'll be strategic about when they kick it. 7:54 p.m. — Denver goes three-and-out, and this game just continues to be thrilling. After everything that's happened, the Bengals will have one more shot to win it. 2:20 remains. Cincinnati has no timeouts. They need to score to keep the AFC's final playoff spot open. 7:50 p.m. — No. Way. Cade York misses the 33-yard field goal to win it. Cincinnati would've kept its playoff hopes alive if the kick didn't hit off the upright. Now, the Broncos can clinch a playoff spot just by eating the rest of the clock, as a tie will function the same as a win. Cincinnati needs the ball back to continue its playoff fight.

Bengals playoff hopes stay alive with this 3rd down incompletion.📺: #DENvsCIN on NFL Network📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/ZraKYKcJzB 7:40 p.m. — What a game for Zach Allen. He notches back-to-back sacks on Burrow, his third and fourth of the game.

Chase Brown remains on the sidelines. 7:35 p.m. — The Bengals win the coin toss and will get the ball first in overtime. Another reminder: the Broncos make the playoffs with a win or tie.

With eight seconds left in regulation, they're tied in Cincinnati. 7:29 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Oh my goodness, Bo Nix and Marvin Mims Jr. do it again. With a playoff berth on the line on fourth down, Nix goes deep for Mims once again, and he held onto the ball in the end zone for six.

Now, Burrow goes to his star receiver, Ja'Marr Chase, for a 38-yard gain.

The five-yard scramble gives Denver a fresh set of downs, with the Broncos approaching field-goal territory. A reminder: They'll be in the 2024 NFL playoffs with a win. 7:04 p.m. — Burrow went to Higgins on a critical third down play, but he lost the football after making the short-range catch. The question was: should it have been ruled incomplete, or a fumble? After Sean Payton challenges the incompletion, the ruling is reversed, and Surtain recovered the fumble. Denver takes over, a potentially significant turn of events. What a play, PS2!!! 🎮📺: NFLN | @PatSurtainll pic.twitter.com/lSg2vX6Cvk 7:03 p.m. — An outstanding angle on the gorgeous touchdown connection between Nix and Mims: The best view you'll see of that Bo Nix-Marvin Mims connection 🔥📺: #DENvsCIN on NFL Network📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/6Vnb9Sog2r 7:01 p.m. — Chase is up to seven catches on the day and two on this drive, setting up a third and short for Cincinnati.

                "content": "Higgins' hat trick of TDs keep his team in the AFC Wild Card race as the Bengals won their fourth straight game and forced the Broncos to have to win next week in Kansas City. If the Broncos defeat a Chiefs team that has already locked up the one seed they are in. If they lose and the Bengals win, and the Colts and Dolpins tie or lose one of their next two, then the Bengals are in as the final Wild Card. Tee Higgins may have lost the fumble in the 4th quarter, but he more than made up with it with his three TDs, and this catch to set up the game winning score. The game went to OT, and after both teams were forced to punt, it was Cade York and the Bengals who had a chance to win it on this 33 yard field goal but he clanked it off the post and CIncy fans were probably thinking their season was over. Nix had his finest hour on this game tying drive that was polished off with this Hail Mary on 4th down with 8 seconds left. He found Marvin Mims in the end zone on this miracle toss to the end zone to send this game to overtime. He ended the game 24/31 with 219 yards, 3 TDs and 1 INT. The Bengals had a chance to run the clock down after picking up a first down after the 2:00 Warning, but Chase Brown hurt himself sliding down short of the goal line which stopped the clock and forced the Bengals to QB sneak it leaving time on the clock for the Broncos. After a season full of getting dragged on and off the field, the Bengals defense comes up with one of the plays of their season. Germaine Pruitt picked off Bo Nix and gave Cincy great field position with just over 2:00 to go. The Bengals had a chance to take the lead late in the 4th quarter, but Higgins, who had such a big night up until this point, got stripped and lost the ball, and possibly a chance at the playoffs. Patrick Surtain came up with the forced fumble that put the Broncos in the drivers seat. Bo Nix and Sean Payton are known for keeping it safe in the passing game, but every now and then they will let the ball fly and that's what the rookie did on this 51 yard TD pass to Marvin Mims Jr. The Bengals would respond with another long drive that Burrow built and Burrow polished off with a TD pass to Higgins in the corner of the end zone. After 25 minutes of pretty defensive football, these two teams exploded. The Broncos retook the lead with his Bo Nix TD pass to Courtland Sutton, and the floodgates were officially open. The Broncos could only muster a field goal after the 4th down stops and that allowed Burrow and the Bengals to take the lead right after the Two Minute Warning. This was just a preview of what was to come for the rest of the game. The Cincinnati Bengals are still alive in the AFC Wild Card race after a dramatic overtime win from Paycor Stadium. Joe Burrow three for 400 yards and three TDs in the 30-24 win over the Denver Broncos. It was an ugly, defensive game early on and even though the Bengals did get to move the ball early on, the Broncos came up with back to back 4th down stops to turn CIncy over on downs. This one came inside the five yard line. Higgins with a hat trick of TDs to keep his team alive in the playoff race!!! Look at this pass to Higgins on the left side to set up the game winning play.

Taking a look at the standings in the AFC, we see the Chiefs at the top of the conference with the one seed locked up. Every division is wrapped up except the AFC North which will come down to who comes out on top between the Ravens and Steelers. The Chargers and Broncos came into the week tied at 9-6 occupying two of the three Wild Card spots. If both of those teams win, they are in. The Bengals need to win out, see the Broncos lose out and see the Colts and Dolphins lose or tie one of their next two. The Broncos have the Bengals today and the Chiefs next week, but with the Chiefs having the one seed, they may not come out in full force on the final week of the season. First things first. Both of these teams need a win today before worrying about the future. The Broncos were in desperate need of a QB after having a carrousel of QBs come and go in the Mile High City. With the 8th pick in the draft, Sean Payton and the Broncos took Bo Nix out of the University of Oregon, and Payton had his man. He groomed him into being an NFL QB and it didn’t take too long. He threw four picks and zero TDs in the first three games of the season but after that he would throw 13 TDs and just 2 picks in the next nine games. He has 3,235 yards, 22 TDs and 11 INTs on the year, and is contention for Rookie of the Year but more importantly, he has this team primed for a playoff appearance. All eyes will be on Joe Burrow today in this playoff type game from Cincy. Despite the Bengals record, he has been putting up incredible numbers worthy of MVP consideration. He leads the NFL in passing yards and passing TDs with 4,229 yards and 39 TDs with just 8 INTs, but that has only translated in seven wins because the defense has been horrendous for the Bengals this year. Burrow knows if they are going to keep their playoff chances alive, he is going to need to keep playing like an MVP. As always, there was a lot of hype surrounding this Bengals team coming into the season. They missed the playoffs last year after Burrow missed the second half of the season, but he was back this season and Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase will always put you in contention. They lost their first three and four of their first five, and would struggle to string wins together. Burrow reassured that the Bengals would bounce back and if they got to 10 wins, that should get them to the postseason. Their three game losing streak that finished with a shootout against the Chargers guaranteed they weren’t going to get to 10 wins, that’s when the Bengals turned on. They have won three straight against the Cowboys, Titans and Browns, and need to keep winning to have any chance. Not much was expected of the Broncos coming into the season. They had been terrible over the last few seasons and brought in a rookie QB to get this team out of the gutter. They lost their first two games as Bo Nix dinked and dunked his way down the field, but he would turn it on and lead the Broncos to five wins over the next six games. A losing skid against the Ravens and Chiefs would bring them back to earth, but they would rattle off another four wins before their loss last week in LA. The Broncos haven’t been to the playoffs since 2015, but finally they have a QB, who is a rookie, and a defense that is the foundation of this team that is a win away from the playoffs. The Bengals rattled off their third straight win to stay alive in the playoff race and as always they were relying on their MVP caliber QB Joe Burrow to lead them there. The defense came up with a couple big plays throughout the day including their forced fumble at the 1 yard line and Burrow would lead his team on a 99 yard drive to take the lead and keep the lead for the rest of the day. Another TD pass and field goal right before the half put the Bengals up 14-0 and the defense would come up with two second half picks to hold off DTR and the Browns. Burrow would throw his third of the day on a 32 yard bomb to Ja’marr Chase to put the icing on the cake. Last Thursday it looked like the Broncos were going to cruise to a Wild Card birth as they ran all over the Chargers in the first half. A running back by committee in the first half as the Broncos went up 21-10 in the first half, but then the offense shut down. The first Fair Catch kick in a half century was awarded to the Chargers right before half and that seemed to turn the tides in LA. They stopped running the ball, and the offense slowed to a halt as the Chargers lit up the scoreboard scoring TDs on three of their four second half possessions to win the gam 34-27 and delay the Broncos playoff birth for at least another week. Hello everyone and welcome to Cincinnati where the Bengals somehow, someway still have a chance at a playoff spot after a three game winning streak. It was a rough start to the season despite an MVP type season from Joe Burrow, and they come into today’s game knowing they need to win out and get a lot of help around the league. The Broncos had a chance to clinch their playoff spot last week but were beaten in a division match up so now they have to go on the road against a red hot Bengals team in their stadium. There is a playoff spot on the line today from Cincinnati. Two teams with playoff aspirations come into the penultimate week of the season knowing the postseason is a possibility but today’s game is a must win. One team is so close they can taste it, while the other will need a win today and a near miracle in Week 18. It’s the Denver Broncos taking on the Cincinnati Bengals from Paycor Stadium and AS English will be with you all day providing stats, scores and highlights of today’s game packed with playoff implications.",

                "title": "UConn Huskies football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The UConn Huskies football team is a college football team that represents the University of Connecticut in the sport of American football. The team competes in NCAA Division I FBS as an independent. Connecticut first fielded a team in 1896, and participated in Division I-AA until 1999. The Huskies began their two-year Division I-A transition period in 2000, and became a full-fledged Division I-A team in 2002. From 2000 to 2003, the team played as an independent. The school's football team then joined the conference of its other sport teams, the Big East (later named the American Athletic Conference (AAC) in 2013), taking effect in 2004, through 2019. In 2019, the UConn football team left the American to again play as an independent, as the school's current primary conference, the current Big East, does not sponsor the sport. The Huskies are currently coached by Jim Mora.[2] The University of Connecticut began playing football in 1896 when the school was known as Storrs Agricultural College, and the team was known as the \"Aggies.\" It teamed up with Massachusetts Agricultural College and the Rhode Island College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts to form the Athletic League of New England State Colleges for the purpose of scheduling football matchups between the schools. The first year was spent playing against local high schools and YMCA clubs. The following year provided their first competition against future rivals Rhode Island, an opponent that would be played over 100 times, and Massachusetts. Other early rivals included the Ivy League and the \"Little Ivies\", particularly Yale University starting in 1948, who have played the Huskies for 50 years. Tragedy struck the team on September 27, 1919, when Gardner Dow died from injuries related to a flying tackle that he delivered in a game against New Hampshire.[3][4] The college would honor Dow by naming the athletic fields after him. These fields would become the home for most of the school's athletic teams for the next three decades. In 1924, the Aggies celebrated their first undefeated season when they finished with six wins, no losses and two ties. The defense was the strength of the team, as they allowed a meager thirteen points to be scored against them over the entire season, including a total of three points over the final seven games.[5] The team was proclaimed by The New York Times to be among the best in the country, and was led by the school's first All-America candidate in captain, Martin \"Red\" O'Neill.[6] The UConn Club memorializes O'Neill with a yearly award given to a former student-athlete who has had a successful professional career. Red O'Neill went on to become one of Connecticut's first players to play in the NFL. He played for the Hartford Blues in 1926, their only year in the NFL.[7] Another player is Art \"Pop\" Williams, winning a championship with the Providence Steam Roller in 1928 and also has the record for the most rushing career touchdowns in Providence's franchise history.[8] The Steam Roller are New England's first NFL champion. The renamed Huskies went on to become long-time members of the Yankee Conference, winning 15 conference championships. In 2012, Bill Belichick stated in an interview on WEEI that in 1983 he applied for the Huskies' head coaching position but was eventually turned down in favor of an internal hire, Tom Jackson. Connecticut hired Lew Perkins as its athletic director in 1990. One of Perkins' first projects was to gather facts for a possible upgrade of the football program to Division I-A.[9] Perkins feared that if the university did not upgrade the football program, that it ran the risk of falling behind other institutions that fielded both football and basketball teams at the highest level. However, UConn was in the middle of a budget deficit and many faculty feared that an upgrade of the football program would result in a loosening of academic standards.[9] Randy Edsall was named the 27th head football coach at the University of Connecticut on December 21, 1998, and led the Huskies from Division I-AA into Division I-A. UConn officially began the upgrade process in January 1999 by applying to join the Big East football conference.[10] They would receive a special waiver from the NCAA in order to play in Memorial Stadium while Rentschler Field was under construction.[11] UConn would become the first school to ever move from the FCS to the Bowl Championship Series as a member of the Big East after three years as an independent. The Huskies would spend the 2000 and 2001 as a transitional Division I-A program as they built their scholarship base to the maximum of 85. They recorded their first win over a Division I-A opponent on September 18, 1999, when they defeated Buffalo, 23-0. They would finish the 1999 season with a final record of 4-7, and the following 2000 season at 3-8. [12] The 2001 season brought their first win over a BCS rival with a victory over Rutgers on September 29, by a score of 20–19. The growing pains continued, as they finished the season at 2–9. The breakthrough came during the Huskies' first year as a full-fledged member of Division I-A in 2002. Led by sophomore quarterback Dan Orlovsky, they showed vast improvement over the previous two seasons, despite starting the season losing six of the first eight games. They closed Memorial Stadium in fashion by routing the last two opponents, Florida Atlantic and Kent State, by a combined score of 124–35. The 63 points scored against Kent State in the Memorial Stadium finale, was the most the Huskies ever scored in the 50 years of playing in the stadium. They concluded a successful season by defeating Navy, 38–0, and Iowa State, 37–20. The victory over Iowa State was the Huskies' first win over a bowl-bound team. Connecticut was originally scheduled to join the Big East as a football member in 2005. However, following the departure of Miami, Virginia Tech, the Huskies' entrance into the Big East was expedited by one year. Boston College would leave the Big East at the conclusion of the 2004 season.[13] The success continued in 2003, when Connecticut began play in Rentschler Field. They would finish the season with an overall record of 9–3. They opened the season with their first victory vs. a Big Ten team (34–10 over Indiana) and the final game of the season provided their first victory over an ACC opponent, when they defeated Wake Forest, 51–17. It was only the third time that a non-conference team had scored over 50 points in an ACC stadium. Despite the stellar record, the Huskies were not invited to play in a bowl game, largely due to their lack of conference affiliation. The Huskies played their first Big East conference game on September 17, 2004, when they dropped a 27–7 decision at Boston College. Their first Big East conference win came only 13 days later, when they defeated Pittsburgh 29–17. They completed their first season in the conference in 5th place with a record of 3–3. That year's overall record of 8–4 was enough to garner an invitation to the 2004 Motor City Bowl, the first bowl invitation in the school's history. The attendance of 52,552 was, at the time, a record crowd for the Bowl. The Huskies were hit hard by graduation and injuries in the 2005 and 2006 seasons. The program opened one of the best and newest college football facilities in 2006 with the completion of the $57.9 million (165,000 sq. ft.) Burton Family Football Complex & Mark R. Shenkman Training Center.[14] The 2007 season saw a quick turnaround with the Huskies' first ever Big East Conference football title, which they shared with West Virginia. For the first time UConn beat a ranked opponent at home, defeating South Florida 22–15. UConn participated in the Meineke Car Care Bowl losing to Wake Forest 24–10. That was followed up with consecutive 8–5 seasons in 2008 and 2009 with wins in both of their bowl games (over Buffalo and the SEC's South Carolina). The team was hit hard in 2009 by the on-campus murder of junior cornerback Jasper Howard, who was stabbed by a non-student outside a dance following their homecoming game win over Louisville. UConn struggled following his death, dropping their next three games and falling to 1–4 in-conference, but got a major win to break the streak at Notre Dame, a victory quoted by Coach Randy Edsall as being the program's \"Best Win\".[15] The game ball from that victory was sent to Howard's mother in Miami, one of many tributes throughout the year for the fallen player. The team honored Howard prior to every game through the 2010 season, which would have been his senior year. The 2010 season brought a second Big East Championship in four years and a trip to the 2011 Fiesta Bowl. After a loss in the Fiesta Bowl, to Oklahoma, Edsall did not fly home with or tell his players that he was leaving the UConn football program. He instead took a separate flight to Maryland to become their new head coach. It had also been noted in the media that Edsall's relationship with then-athletic director Jeff Hathaway had been strained for several years. Two weeks after Edsall left for Maryland and after nearly seven years away from college football, Connecticut native Paul Pasqualoni was hired away as defensive coordinator from the Dallas Cowboys to lead the UConn football program, by the soon to be dismissed AD Hathaway. The Big East's name changed in 2013 to the American Athletic Conference as a result of the non-FBS split that took place as part of the conference's three-way realignment between 2010 and 2013. Three members moved to the ACC as full members, Notre Dame went the ACC as a partial, Rutgers to the Big Ten and West Virginia to the Big 12. With the seven non-FBS basketball schools buying the Big East conference name for their own newly formed conference. Two teams departing to the ACC, Syracuse and Pittsburgh left the Big East with losing records against the Huskies in football.[citation needed] Following two seasons of mediocrity and a struggling offense, Pasqualoni was forced to replace his lifelong colleague George DeLeone as the offensive coordinator, just as he did prior to them both being fired at Syracuse. Pasqualoni named T. J. Weist as his OC for 2013. But Pasqualoni and Deleone (now his OL coach) were both fired after starting 0–4 with UConn's first loss as full D-I member to an FCS team, Towson 33–18 and following a humiliating defeat to Buffalo (41–12), which UConn had never lost to (8–0) as an FBS team. Weist was named the interim head coach and finished the season strong on a 3-game winning streak after starting out 0–5 and totally revamping the offense free of Pasqualoni's control. Though Weist was considered for the head coaching job, UConn AD Warde Manuel announced Notre Dame defensive coordinator and Broyles Award winner Bob Diaco as the new UConn head coach for the 2014 season. After a complete tear down of the program in 2014, which would lead to Diaco finishing the year with only around 60 scholarship players available and needing to use a dozen true freshman, the team finished 2–10. The 2015 season resulted in a revitalization for the program as they finished 6–6 and became bowl eligible for the first time since the 2010 season. On December 26, 2016, UConn announced that Diaco, who posted his 3rd straight losing year with a 3–9 record would be fired effective January 2, 2017. By not making the move immediately, the school saved $1.6 million in buyout expenses.[16] He was replaced by former coach Edsall, making his return to the program after six years.[17] Following a 3–9 third season with the Huskies, Diaco was terminated at the end of the 2016 season.[16] His replacement, Randy Edsall, returning to the program after six years, would not find similar success in his second go-around. In 2019, after several years of losing records with a $41 million sports created deficit, UConn made the choice to leave the AAC and rejoin the current edition of the Big East.[citation needed] This was seemingly a basketball move because the Big East does not have football.[citation needed] The path would be to play as an independent.[citation needed] The UConn football team left the American and became independent in August 2020 as a result of UConn's other sports rejoining the Big East, which does not sponsor football.[18] UConn cancelled their 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Their first season competing independently was in 2021. After three straight losing campaigns and a season cancelled by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Edsall elected to retire after a 0–2 start in 2021.[19] To replace Edsall, UConn hired Jim L. Mora. In his first season with the team, Mora would lead the Huskies to a surprising 6–6 regular season record, highlighted by an upset victory over then-No. 19 Liberty. Bowl-eligible for the first time since 2015, UConn was selected to play in the 2022 Myrtle Beach Bowl against Marshall, in a rematch of their last bowl game.[20] In the 2024 season, UConn had an 8–4 record, their first winning season since 2010. They were invited to compete in the Fenway Bowl against North Carolina.[21] In 2010, Connecticut had 16 players named to the Big East All-Academic Football Team,[22] an honor which requires a cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) of at least a 3.0 in a minimum of two semesters. And several times UConn was ranked as one of the top bowl teams in the country per the annual Graduation Gap Bowl report.[23][24] In 2015, the team was honored by AF Coaches Assoc. for academic achievement and the 990 single year APR score in 2014–15 under head coach Diaco was also the highest in school history. Connecticut has participated in seven bowl games, with the Huskies garnering a record of 3–4.[25] Connecticut has won 26 conference championships, 17 shared and 9 outright.[citation needed] † Co-champions The Huskies have won one division title, which they shared with UMass. † Co-champions The Yankee Conference rivalry dates back to 1897. The rivalry became dormant in 1999 as UConn moved up to the FBS and UMass remained at the FCS level. The rivalry would be revived in UMass's FBS debut, a 37–0 win for the Huskies. Since 2018, each school has won two of the four contests. The football rivalry dates back to 1897 and was centered around the Ramnapping Trophy after UConn students stole the URI mascot in 1934. The teams played nearly every year until the end of the Yankee Conference. Once UConn moved up to the FBS, the teams seldom play as Rhode Island remains an FCS program. Since 2000, there have been only three meetings: a UConn (52–7) win in 2006, a UConn (52–10) win in 2009, and a back-and-forth 56–49 UConn victory in 2018. Better known for their men's basketball rivalry, the football rivalry between UConn and bordering-state foe Syracuse dates back to 2004 and has been played 12 times.[26][27] The teams were members of the old Big East until Syracuse left in 2012 to join the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in all sports.[28][29] Since becoming a non-conference matchup, the game has been played intermittently with the next meeting coming in 2024.[30] In 1997, the Big East Conference gave the University of Connecticut and Villanova University a December 31 deadline to decide if they were going to upgrade their respective football programs and join the Big East football conference.[31] Villanova, a private institution, declined the invitation. However, in October 1997, the University of Connecticut Board of Trustees overwhelmingly endorsed, by a vote of sixteen to one, the football team's plan to upgrade the program to Division I-A status.[32] Part of the plan would be to build a new stadium, as the current stadium, Memorial Stadium, fell well below the minimum occupancy level of 30,000, as set by the NCAA. Originally, the new stadium was to be built on campus. However, the enthusiasm toward the new stadium quickly faded as the estimated expenses rose, the idea of an on-campus stadium was tabled, and the upgrade of the program was put on hold by the Connecticut state legislature.[33] A year later, the stadium issue was rehashed during an attempt to bring the New England Patriots to Hartford, Connecticut. A proposed 70,000 seat, open-air stadium in downtown Hartford would also serve as the home of the Huskies football team.[34] The plans for this stadium also fell through and the Patriots announced that they would remain in Foxboro, Massachusetts. Eventually, a new site emerged across the Connecticut River in East Hartford, when Pratt & Whitney donated land on the old Rentschler Airfield to the state for purposes of building an off-campus football stadium which is 20 miles away from the main campus. The Huskies play their home football games at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Connecticut, an off-campus facility located 20 miles (32 km) to the west of the main campus and only 3 miles east of the new Downtown Hartford-Uconn campus. The inaugural game took place on August 30, 2003, when Connecticut defeated the Indiana Hoosiers 34–10. Since the opening, Connecticut has enjoyed a decided home field advantage, posting a 68–59 record when playing at Rentschler. In 2007, the Huskies completed their home season winning each of their seven home games, becoming only the second Big East team to compile a 7–0 home record. The stadium played to an average of 97% near capacity crowds for eight years (2003–2010), prior to Paul Pasqualoni's arrival and during the Big East. The Huskies on-campus home is at the Burton Family Football Complex on Stadium Road in Storrs, Connecticut. It contains the coaches' offices, team meeting rooms, video facilities, dining hall and student-athlete lounge. Construction began in the fall of 2004 and it officially opened in July 2006. The building is named after Robert Burton, who in 2002 made a donation of $2.5 million to the University of Connecticut. The original location of the building was to be where Memorial Stadium stands.[35] However, it was later decided to construct the building across the street. Alongside the Burton Family Football Complex is the 85,000-square-foot (7,900 m2) Mark R. Shenkman Training Center. The indoor training center includes a full-length football field and an 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) strength and conditioning center.[36] The training center was made possible by a $2.5 million gift from Connecticut businessman and UConn alum Mark Shenkman.[37] Construction of the Mark R. Shenkman Training Center and the Burton Family Football Complex were handled in tandem by HOK Sport (now Populous) and JCJ Architecture. Upon completion in the summer of 2006, both buildings were granted a LEED silver designation. They are the first buildings on the University of Connecticut campus, and the first football facilities in the nation to be certified as a \"green building.\"[38] [39] [40][41] The Brian Kozlowski Award was first awarded in 1998. It honors the former UConn Husky and former New York Giants, Atlanta Falcons, and Washington Redskins tight end, Brian Kozlowski, who through hard work, effort and dedication has been able to have a lengthy NFL career.[48]: 86 Announced schedules as of August 26, 2024.[49]",

He committed to play college football at the University of Pittsburgh in August 2012.[2] As a true freshman in 2013, Conner played in 12 of 13 games. He made his collegiate debut during the Panthers' season opening loss to Florida State and had eight carries for 34 yards.[3] The following week, he scored his first career touchdown against New Mexico and finished the win with 12 carries, 119 rushing yards, and a season-high two touchdowns.[4] On December 26, 2013, Conner had a season-high 26 carries for 226 yards and a touchdown during a 30–27 victory over Bowling Green in the Little Caesars Bowl,[5] He was named the 2013 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl MVP.[6] He led the team in rushing yards with 799 and rushing touchdowns with eight.[7][8][9] Conner's 229 rushing yards broke Tony Dorsett's school record for rushing yards in a bowl game.[10][11] Conner started his sophomore season rushing for 153 yards on 14 carries and scored a season-high four touchdowns in the season-opening 62–0 win over Delaware.[12] On November 1, 2014, Conner rushed for a career-high 263 rushing yards on a career-high 38 attempts and scored three touchdowns during a 51–48 double-overtime loss to No. 24 Duke.[13] The next game, he passed 200 yards rushing for a second consecutive game with 30 carries for 220 yards and career-high-tying four touchdowns in a loss to North Carolina.[14] In his sophomore season in 2014, Conner rushed for 1,765 yards on 298 attempts and set an Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) record with 26 rushing touchdowns.[15] He led the ACC in rushing yards and ranked 7th in the Football Bowl Subdivision.[16][17] At the end of the season, he was named the ACC Player of the Year[18] and garnered American Football Coaches Association first-team All-American honors. On September 5, 2015, Conner tore his MCL during the Panthers' season opening 45–37 victory over Youngstown State.[19] He finished the game with eight carries for 77 rushing yards and scored two rushing touchdowns but missed the rest of his junior season.[20] He was also diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma during the rehab process and was finally cancer-free during the off-season.[21] Conner played in the Panthers' season-opener against Villanova and finished the victory with 17 carries for 53 yards and a touchdown while also accounting for three receptions for 15 yards and scored his first career touchdown reception.[22] The next game, Conner had 22 attempts for 117 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in a 42–39 victory over Penn State.

Underclassmen had to apply for the draft by January 16, 2017.[27] Conner attended the NFL Scouting Combine, but chose to perform only the 40-yard dash, broad jump, vertical jump, and bench press. He completed the three-cone drill, short shuttle, and positional drills at Pitt's Pro Day to finish his combine performance. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Conner was projected to be a fifth or sixth round pick by NFL draft scouts and experts.[28] Conner was ranked the 12th best running back available in the draft by Sports Illustrated and the 15th best running back by DraftScout.com.[29] The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Conner in the third round with the 105th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft.[32] Conner was the eighth running back selected in the draft.[33] He had the top selling NFL jersey throughout July, beating all rookies, as well as Marshawn Lynch, Von Miller, Dak Prescott, and Tom Brady.[34] On May 11, 2017, the Steelers signed Conner to a four-year, $3.16 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $706,288.[35][36] Conner entered training camp competing with veterans Knile Davis and Fitzgerald Toussaint for the vacant backup running back position left by DeAngelo Williams. Davis and Toussaint were released during final roster cutdowns, and Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin named Conner the backup to Le'Veon Bell to begin the regular season.[37] Conner made his NFL debut in the season-opener at the Cleveland Browns and had four carries for 11 yards in a 21–18 victory.[38] In Week 4, he had four carries for a season-high 26 rushing yards in a 26–9 victory at the Baltimore Ravens.

[86] He majored in communication at Pitt.[87] Glen Jr. also plays football, a defensive lineman with his local Erie Express professional team in the Gridiron Developmental Football League (GDFL). On April 22, 2019, the Express honored Glen as their \"Defensive Player of the Week\" with seven tackles, three tackles for loss (−16 yards), three sacks, and an interception in their 30–6 victory over the Westmoreland Wolves.[88] On December 4, 2015, Conner announced he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Despite this, he said \"I choose to not fear cancer... I will play football again.\"[89] After tearing his MCL during the Panthers' first game of 2015, Conner attended rehab and began experiencing excessive fatigue and other symptoms, leading doctors to perform a chest x-ray that revealed Hodgkin's Lymphoma.[27] He endured 12 rounds of chemotherapy and completed his last chemo appointment on May 9, 2016. During his treatment, Conner continued to participate in non-contact drills with the Pittsburgh Panthers football team as much as his body would allow.[90] Conner appeared on the April 21, 2016, episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show and met Kansas City Chiefs' safety Eric Berry, who also overcame Hodgkin's lymphoma and whom Conner saw as an inspirational figure. During Conner's treatment, the two players had spoken via text message but had never met in person.[90] On May 23, 2016, Conner announced on Twitter that he was cancer free.[91] During the 2018 season, Conner began growing a mullet, which became popular among Steeler fans and fully embracing the Yinzer culture with the hairstyle.[92] Conner joined many other Pittsburgh natives and/or sports stars that have sported the hairstyle, most prominently former Pittsburgh Penguins superstar Jaromír Jágr.[93]",

                "title": "A Letter to NFL GMs ",
                "content": "James Conner Arizona Cardinals Dear NFL GMs: My name is James Conner. I’m a running back who was born and raised in Erie, Pennsylvania. My sophomore year at Pitt I scored 26 touchdowns and was named ACC Player of the Year. But it’s more likely that you know me for one very specific thing. Cancer. It’s cool. That’s totally reasonable. I mean, at this point I’m pretty much recognized around the world as “that football player who battled Hodgkin’s and then came back to play the following year.” I went on Ellen and sat for a bunch of TV spots with dramatic lighting and sad piano music. So I understand. I’ve come to realize that me being a cancer survivor is something I’ll never get away from. It’s a part of my story, no doubt. But I’m writing you today to let you know that I am more than the guy who beat cancer. I’m writing to tell you some things that you don’t know about me. When I was a junior at McDowell High, back in Erie, I played mostly defensive end. I was sacking guys left and right, but I guess college coaches weren’t all that impressed, because I wasn’t getting any looks from recruiters. Pretty much no one knew who I was, and they weren’t really trying to find out, either. These days you hear a lot about five-star recruits. Well … I was a two-star recruit back then. I’m not positive, but I don’t think they go any lower than that. I don’t know of any one-star guys. I think a one-star guy is just like … a guy. Two-star recruits have to put in work. So that summer after my junior season I felt like I had to take matters into my own hands. I had read about a prospect camp at Pitt — which is around a two-hour car ride from Erie —and figured that I’d show up and try to make an impression on the coaches there. The only problem was that the entry fee was fifty bucks … and I didn’t have fifty bucks. I was a two-star recruit back then. I’m not positive, but I don’t think they go any lower than that. My mom was working real hard at the time to be able to pay our bills, and I knew it would be tough. So, at first, I didn’t even want to ask her for the money. Eventually, I told her that I wanted to play college football more than anything in the world, and that all I needed was one shot to show those coaches what I could do. “So how much is it, James?” “Fifty, Mom.” “That’s a lot of money for a football camp.” I explained to her that I knew this was my big shot, and how it would mean everything if she could just spot me the $50. She has always believed in me, so after we talked about it, she said I could go. I drove down to Pitt on June 6, 2012, and here’s what I did when I got there. Over and over again, I did that to dudes — just spinnin’ off linemen, beating guys around the edge with my speed, running people over. I got a scholarship offer on the spot. Full ride. No questions asked. I put that work in, and it paid off. Not many people know that I started out as a defensive player — that’s one more thing I can do. After I committed to Pitt, I switched to running back for my senior season of high school ball, and I felt like I was performing at a very high level. So that’s when the Pitt coaches decided they might be able to use me there. My response when they asked me to switch from defensive end to running back was the same as it’s always been when I’m called on to do something to help my team win. “Whatever you need me to do, Coach, I’m in!” And that just so happens to be the same thing I said when I was asked to switch back to defensive end this past year for a few plays when we needed to get some pressure on the quarterback against Virginia. There are some incredible running backs in this draft, some really talented guys, but I’m pretty sure no other back was out there doing stuff like that last year. And, speaking of last season, before I go any further it’s probably a good time for me to share a secret with you that I didn’t really discuss with anyone while our games were taking place. This is another thing not too many people know about me…. I was probably at about 60% going into last season. Now, I definitely got stronger and better with each game. But, yeah, that’s just real talk. Sixty percent. If that. I’d talk to my doctor each week, and he encouraged my determination. For most people who get 12 rounds of chemotherapy, it takes about six to eight months to recover — layin’ low, no lifting, just trying to gain back strength. With me, as soon as physically possible, I was out there with my brothers, with a mask over my mouth and a port still embedded in my chest, participating in workouts. Early on, because I only had two months to prepare for the season, it was extremely difficult for me to be at my best. To be honest with you, I’d be tired just running out the tunnel. Those first couple of games really took their toll on me. But by the time we got to the fifth game of the season, I was starting to feel normal again. And when the 10th game of the year arrived, against Clemson at Death Valley, I was hype. I felt really good and turned up! That Clemson game was just flat-out incredible. And, you know what? I’m sure you’ve got a ton of players to review before the draft, so if you’re pressed for time and want to get a good sense of what I can do on the football field, just cue up the game tape from that one and press play. On the road, against the team that would go on to win the national championship — the team with the best defense in college football — I put up more than 130 yards and two touchdowns on the ground. I also caught three passes for nearly 60 yards. It was a pretty emotional experience because it was the first time in a while that the game felt like it used to for me. Early in the first quarter, I collided with Clemson linebacker Ben Boulware so violently that I actually split his face mask. I had a bunch of memorable runs and catches during that game, but the play that really sticks out to me from that one is a carry I had with about five minutes left. We were down by eight. I took a handoff in the gun on a zone play designed to go to the left. The hole closed up fast, so I cut it all the way back, threw a stiff-arm and took it to the house. To make a big run like that near the end of the game, and help our team give Clemson its only loss of the season? That was probably the best experience I had on the football field during my four years at Pitt. It was also the moment in time when I knew I was finally all the way back. So, now that I’ve told you some things you probably didn’t know about me, it’s time for me to really make my case for why you should spend an early pick on me in this draft. First off: I’m 100% healthy. I have a clean scan showing I’m still cancer free. The knee injury I suffered a few years ago is fully healed, and I played the whole season on it without any pain. I don’t even think about it anymore. My endurance is all the way back, too. I feel good. All winter and spring, I trained hard to get back to the shape I was in during my All-America season. When I was doing my chemo treatments last year, I had to take some medications that resulted in my weight jumping all the way up to 260 pounds — I lost most of my muscle mass and gained a bunch of fat. I worked most of that off during the season, but when I started training for the combine, I was still at about 18% body fat. I’m down to around 7% now. Just call me ‘Beast Mode 2.0.’ I’m quicker than I’ve ever been — just lighter on my feet. But, you know, I’m still big. Believe me. No one’s ever gonna be psyched about having to tackle me, bet that. If you’re looking for a tough, hard-nosed back who wears down defenses, I’m your man. I know you guys love comps, so my favorite running back of all time is Marshawn Lynch, and that’s the best comparison I can give you. He’s always got such amazing willpower to go along with an “I’m not gonna be denied” mentality, and those are two things I bring to the table every time I suit up. I’m not going down on first contact. It’s just not gonna happen. I’m breaking tackles and fighting for extra yards every time I get the ball, just like Marshawn. Just call me “Beast Mode 2.0.” (As long as that’s cool with Marshawn, of course.) I’m next in line, and ready to follow in his footsteps. Anything you need from a back, I can do. Obviously I’m gonna run hard. That’s a given. But if you also want somebody who can pass-protect and catch the ball out of the backfield, I’ve shown over and over again that I can do those things extremely well. Plus, because of how I play, and the intensity I bring to the game, I’m a guy that people want to line up with — a leader. And, make no mistake about it: I’ve never had it easy. Ever since I was a two-star recruit from Erie, I’ve had to scratch and claw and outwork people, and I’ve done nothing but prove doubters wrong time and time again. So I’m more confident than ever that before all is said and done, people are going to know me more as a great football player than as a cancer survivor. I don’t set little goals. I mean, I’m trying to be in the Hall of Fame one day. That’s where I’m looking to take this. That’s where my head’s at. If that goal sounds overly ambitious, or like an unrealistic dream, just think about what I went through to get here. When the pandemic started, I guess we all needed to find hobbies to help us pass the time. For me, it was reading. This has been a pretty big year for me — tra Channing Frye and Iman Shumpert are back to explain the stakes, place bets and analyze the most valuable players in the NBA Finals. Jessica Mendoza's greatest pride is her background. The Olympic Gold Medalist shines light on her Hispanic heritage fueling her career. © 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved",

                "content": "Corbin Brian Burnes (born October 22, 1994) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers and Baltimore Orioles. The Brewers selected Burnes in the fourth round of the 2016 MLB draft, and he made his MLB debut in 2018. Burnes is a four-time All-Star. He won the National League Cy Young Award in 2021, when he led the National League (NL) in earned run average. He led the NL in strikeouts in 2022. Burnes attended Centennial High School in Bakersfield, California. In 2013, his senior year, he had a 9–4 win–loss record with a 2.23 earned run average (ERA) in 22 appearances.[1] After high school, he enrolled and played college baseball at Saint Mary's College of California.[2][3] In 2015, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League.[4] In 2016, his junior year, he posted a 9–2 record with a 2.48 ERA in 16 starts. After the season, he was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the fourth round of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft.[5] Burnes made his professional debut with the Arizona League Brewers and was later promoted to the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers.[6] In 35+2⁄3 innings pitched between Arizona and Wisconsin, Burnes posted a 3–0 record with a 2.02 ERA. He started the 2017 season with the Carolina Mudcats and was later promoted to the Biloxi Shuckers after recording a 1.05 ERA after ten starts.[7][8] Burnes finished 2017 with a combined 8–3 record and 1.67 ERA between both teams.[9] The Brewers named him their minor league pitcher of the year after the season.[10] MLB.com ranked Burnes as Milwaukee's second-best prospect going into the 2018 season.[11] He began the season with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox.[12] The Brewers promoted Burnes to the majors for the first time on July 8, 2018.[13] He made his major league debut on July 10, pitching two scoreless innings, striking out one, and recording his first major league save.[14] In the 2018 NLDS against the Colorado Rockies, he pitched four scoreless innings in relief across two appearances, earning the win in the clinching 6–0 Game 3 victory. In the 2018 NLCS, Burnes got the last six outs of their game six win against the Dodgers.[citation needed] To start 2019, Burnes began the year in the starting rotation. However, he struggled in that role, allowing 11 home runs across his first 3 starts. It was announced he would move back to the bullpen. He continued to struggle in the bullpen, compiling a 9.00 ERA through 26 appearances. He was placed on the injured list on July 15 with shoulder discomfort. He finished the season with a 1–5 record and an 8.82 ERA in 49 innings. In the shortened 2020 season, Burnes pitched to a 4–1 record and recorded an ERA of 2.11 while striking out 88 batters in 59+2⁄3 innings. He finished 6th in the NL Cy Young voting.[15] Burnes struck out 40 batters without issuing a walk in his first four starts of 2021, an unprecedented four game stretch for an MLB starting pitcher.[16] On May 13, Burnes set the MLB record for the most strikeouts to begin a season before issuing a walk, with 58, surpassing the previous record of 51, held by Kenley Jansen.[17] Burnes was named to the 2021 MLB All-Star Game.[18] On August 12, Burnes tied an MLB record after striking out 10 consecutive batters in a game against the Chicago Cubs.[19] On September 11, Burnes pitched the first eight innings of a combined no-hitter with Josh Hader against the Cleveland Indians, in which he struck out 14 batters. He held a perfect game until a seventh-inning walk to Myles Straw.[20] Burnes finished the 2021 season with an 11–5 record and led the major leagues in ERA (2.43), strikeouts per nine innings (12.6), home runs per nine innings (0.4), and strikeout-to-walk ratio (6.88).[21] He won the National League Cy Young Award, becoming the third Brewers pitcher to win the award.[22] He was also named to the first 2021 All-MLB Team as a starting pitcher.[23] Burnes was selected as the starter for Game 1 of the 2021 NLDS against the Atlanta Braves. Burnes pitched six shutout innings, striking out six. He was not credited with the win, however, as he battled in a tight pitchers' duel with Atlanta's Charlie Morton. Milwaukee won the game, 2–1.[citation needed] On March 22, 2022, Burnes signed a $6.5 million contract with the Brewers, avoiding salary arbitration.[24] The Brewers named Burnes their Opening Day starting pitcher.[25] He was named to the 2022 MLB All-Star Game.[26] In 2022, Burnes was 12–8 with a 2.94 ERA in 202 innings, and struck out a league-high 243 batters.[27] On defense, he had a .961 fielding percentage.[27] He was a finalist for the NL Gold Glove Award at pitcher, but it was won for the third straight season by Max Fried.[28] Burnes went to salary arbitration with the Brewers, with the arbiter choosing the $10.01 million salary requested by the Brewers, rather than the $10.75 million requested by Burnes. He said that the process \"definitely hurt\" his relationship with the franchise.[29] Burnes started for the Brewers on Opening Day.[30] In 32 starts for Milwaukee, he posted a 10–8 record and 3.39 ERA with 200 strikeouts, and was named an All–Star for the third straight season.[31] On February 1, 2024, the Brewers traded Burnes to the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for DL Hall, Joey Ortiz, and a compensatory draft pick.[32] He made 32 appearances - all starts - for the Orioles in 2024, pitching to a 2.92 ERA and a 15-9 record with 181 strikeouts across 194.1 innings pitched.[33] Burnes also made his fourth consecutive All-Star team.[34] After the 2024 season, Burnes became a free agent.[35] The Orioles extended the qualifying offer of $21.05 million for the 2025 season to Burnes, but he declined.[36] Burnes is a power pitcher who has thrown six different pitches: a four-seam fastball between 94–97 miles per hour (151–156 km/h), a sinker between 95–97 miles per hour (153–156 km/h), a changeup between 88–91 miles per hour (142–146 km/h), a slider between 86–89 miles per hour (138–143 km/h), a curveball between 80–83 miles per hour (129–134 km/h), and a cut fastball between 93–96 miles per hour (150–154 km/h). He virtually abandoned his four-seamer after 2020 after finding far more success exclusively using his cutter.[37] During spring training of 2024, Burnes broke out a second curveball, which he throws about 5 miles per hour (8.0 km/h) faster than his first, in strikeout situations.[38] Burnes is the son of Rick and Kandi Burnes.[39] Burnes and his wife Brooke married in 2020.[40][41] They have three children.[42][43]",

                "content": "Editions: En/mlb/arizona-diamondbacks Nobody expected this to happen in Arizona This came as a surprise to everyone involved, even the rest of the baseball fans. In a significant offseason move, the Arizona Diamondbacks have reportedly agreed to a six-year, $210 million contract with right-handed pitcher Corbin Burnes. The deal, which includes an opt-out clause after 2026, represents the largest contract in franchise history and underscores the Diamondbacks' commitment to bolstering their pitching staff for the 2025 season and beyond and competing in the National League. Burnes, who shined during his time with the Baltimore Orioles in the 2024 season, has been a standout performer since becoming a full-time starter in 2020. Known for his exceptional command and strikeout ability, The pitcher has compiled a 2.94 ERA and averaged 214 strikeouts per year over the past four seasons. His impressive track record includes winning the National League Cy Young Award in 2021 and playing a pivotal role in leading the Orioles back to the playoffs last season. The Diamondbacks, who made it to the World Series in 2023, are aiming to build on their recent success and compete with the powerhouse Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West. Adding Burnes to a rotation that already features Zac Gallen, Merrill Kelly, Eduardo Rodriguez, and Brandon Pfaadt makes the Diamondbacks' starting rotation one of the best in baseball. Burnes' agent, the renowned Scott Boras, negotiated the deal, which is part of a flurry of offseason contracts totaling over $1.6 billion. The Diamondbacks' decision to invest heavily in Burnes reflects their commitment to constructing a formidable team capable of contending for championships.

Fans are eagerly anticipating the impact that Burnes will have on the team's success and their pursuit of another deep playoff run.

                "title": "Corbin Burnes to sign with Diamondbacks: Ace agrees to six-year, $210 million deal with Arizona, per report - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Arizona Diamondbacks have landed the best starting pitcher on the free-agent market. The D-backs and righty Corbin Burnes have agreed to a six-year contract worth $210 million, reports the New York Post. According to Heyman, Burnes' contract with Arizona includes an opt-out after the 2026 season. Burnes, 30, joined the Baltimore Orioles in a three-player trade with the Milwaukee Brewers last offseason. He had a terrific season with the O's, throwing 194 ⅓ innings with a 2.92 ERA and 181 strikeouts. That earned him a fifth-place finish in the AL Cy Young voting. Burnes allowed one run in eight innings in his only start this postseason. Our R.J. Anderson ranked Burnes the second-best free agent available this offseason, behind only Juan Soto. Here's his write-up: At first blush, Burnes is clearly this free-agent class' best and most reliable starting pitcher. He's earned four consecutive trips to the All-Star Game; he's among the league leaders in innings pitched since the pandemic; and he's proved that his game works both inside the American League and outside of Milwaukee, as if there was any doubt. Yet if you look closely enough at his profile, you'll notice some hints of potential decline. For starters, Burnes' strikeout rate deteriorated for a fourth year in a row, dipping beneath a batter per inning for the first time in his career. His trademark cutter, the primary pitch in his bag, returned its worst results (highest average and lowest whiff rate) until some late-season tinkering helped get it back on course. His in-zone contact rate, meanwhile, put him in the same neighborhood occupied by Kyle Gibson, Chris Flexen, and Carson Fulmer, among others. Mind you, none of the above prevented Burnes from notching another high-quality season. His command remains superb, enabling him to control quality of contact the way few others can. Burnes himself has explained away his strikeout rate by saying he was prioritizing early outs. Maybe so, but we suspect teams will think a little longer and a little harder than they expected to before handing him a long-term deal. As noted, Burnes has seen his strikeout rate gradually slip since becoming a full-time member of the rotation in 2021. He struck out 35.6% of the batters he faced in 2021, a top-of-the-line number for a starter. That dipped to 30.5% in 2022, 25.5% in 2023, and an almost perfectly league average 23.1% in 2024. Burnes remains excellent, but that is a noticeable decline. Burnes won the NL Cy Young Award as a member of the Brewers in 2021, and he's now finished in the top 10 of the Cy Young balloting for five straight years. Burnes enters the 2025 season with a career ERA+ of 129 and a career WAR of 17.1 across parts of seven major-league seasons. With Arizona, Burnes joins a potentially strong rotation that also includes Zac Gallen, Eduardo Rodriguez, Merrill Kelly and Brandon Pfaadt. The Diamondbacks, who won the National League pennant in 2023, are coming off a 2024 season in which they went 89-73 and just missed securing a wild-card spot in the postseason. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "The NC State Wolfpack football team represents North Carolina State University in the sport of American football. The Wolfpack competes in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Prior to joining the ACC in 1953, the Wolfpack were a member of the Southern Conference. As a founding member of the ACC, the Wolfpack has won seven conference championships and participated in 34 bowl games, of which the team has won 17. NC State is coached by Dave Doeren. Since 1966, the Wolfpack has played its home games at Carter–Finley Stadium, the largest college football stadium in North Carolina. On September 16, 2010, NC State restored the tradition of having a live mascot on the field. A wolf-like Tamaskan Dog named \"Tuffy\" was on the sidelines for the Cincinnati game that day in Raleigh[3] and Tuffy has not missed a Wolfpack football game in Carter–Finley Stadium since. NC State (then known as The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts) played its first football game against a team from the Raleigh Male Academy on March 12, 1892, in what is now Pullen Park.[4][5] The team's first head coach was Perrin Busbee, who led the team during that game.[6] The Aggies, whose colors were blue and pink, won 12–6 in front of more than 200 spectators.[4][5] The following year, the school played its first intercollegiate game: a 12–6 victory over the University of Tennessee.[7][8] The program's long-standing rivalry with nearby University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill began on October 12, 1894, with a 44–0 UNC victory in Chapel Hill.[9] Eight days later, the team (then called the Farmers) lost again to UNC, 16–0 in Raleigh.[10] In 1895, under third-year coach Bart Gatling, the team finished 2–2–1[11] and wore red and white uniforms for the first time.[7] Over the next five seasons the program continued to try to establish itself, achieving only one winning season during the period. The football team has also only had scholarship football players since 1933, prior to that all Wolfpack athletics consisted entirely of non-scholarship student athletes. In 1906, in a game against Randolph-Macon in Raleigh, the Farmers attempted their first forward pass, a play that had only recently become legal and at the time was still considered a \"trick\" play.[7] The following season was the program's most successful yet. Under coach Mickey Whitehurst, A&M won the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association championship with a 6–0–1 record.[12] That season, the program also recorded its first ever victory over Virginia.[13] The Farmers played their home games that season on campus at the New Athletic Park, which would later be known as Riddick Stadium.[14] In addition to Pullen Park, the state fairgrounds had hosted some games prior to the opening of the new stadium.[15] The team won a second South Atlantic championship in 1910 under coach Edward Green, finishing with a record of 4–0–2.[16] A win over Virginia Tech in Norfolk that season was dubbed the \"biggest game ever played in the South\".[17] Coach Green led team to a third conference championship in 1913, with a record of 6–1.[18][14] The 1918 season, which was the school's first season with the name North Carolina State University,[19] was cut short due to the United States' entrance into World War I and a severe flu outbreak on campus. The team's roster was depleted, its schedule reduced to four games, and practice was suspended for five weeks in October and November. A week after practice resumed, State College, as the school was then called, led by coach Tal Stafford, was defeated 128–0 by Georgia Tech in Atlanta. Tackle John Ripple was named the program's first All-American. The following season, on October 23, the Farmers resumed play with North Carolina after a 14-year hiatus. The Tar Heels won the game 13–12 in Raleigh. It wasn't until 1920 that A&M defeated the rival Tar Heels for the first time.[14] In 1921 State College began wearing red sweaters and were referred to by the local media as the Wolfpack.[20] The program, led by coach Harry Hartsell at the time, joined the Southern Conference that year[20] and would win the conference title six seasons later under coach Gus Tebell, finishing the year with a 9–1 record.[21] Running back Jack McDowall was the team's star player that year.[22] The 1930 season saw the installation of field lighting at Riddick Stadium, as the Wolfpack defeated High Point University, 37–0, in the team's first ever night game.[14] Williams Newton took over as State's head coach in 1937, and under his tutelage the team compiled a record of 24–39–6.[23][24] Under Newton, State employed a ground-oriented, hard nose attack that put pressure on the opposing interior linemen.[25] Recruitment became difficult during at least part of his tenure as head coach due to the fact that World War II necessitated that eligible males over 18 be inducted into the U.S. military.[26] Newton left NC State after seven seasons to accept the head football coach position at South Carolina.[27] In 1944, State hired former Appalachian State head coach Beattie Feathers as the Wolfpack head football coach.[28] Feathers, a former star at Tennessee and the first NFL running back to rush for 1,000 yards in a season, compiled a 37–38–8 record in eight seasons,[29] the program's most successful coaching tenure yet. In Feathers' second season, Wolfpack defensive player Howard \"Touchdown\" Turner returned an interception 105 yards against Duke, a record that still stands as the longest play in Wolfpack history.[30][31] The 1946 season began with wins over Duke and Clemson, earning the program their first appearance in the UPI poll (19th).[32] The next year, NC State reached their first ever bowl game, the second annual Gator Bowl. The team lost to Oklahoma, 34–13,[33] and finished the season at 8–3,[32] the highest win total since finishing 9–1 in 1927. 1947 saw the Wolfpack finish 5–3–1.[34] That season was followed by a 3–6–1 campaign in 1948,[35] a 3–7 mark in 1949[36] and a 5–4–1 record in 1950.[37] The Wolfpack's first ever nationally televised game was played in 1950. State defeated eighth-ranked Maryland 16–13 in College Park.[14] The game aired on the now-defunct Dumont Television Network. After a 3–7 campaign in 1951,[38] Feathers was relieved of his duties as head coach.[28] Horace Hendrickson was promoted from assistant coach to head coach after Feathers' departure.[39] Under Hendrickson's tutelage, the Wolfpack struggled, compiling a record of 4–16.[40] Hendrickson was fired after two seasons due to the team's struggles. NC State joined the newly formed Atlantic Coast Conference in 1953 as a charter member, leaving the Southern Conference after 29 years of membership.[41][42] The team, which had finished 3–7 in 1952,[43] finished 1–9 that year under head coach Hendrickson.[44][14] Earle Edwards was hired as the team's head coach before the 1954 season.[45] Edwards had previously been an assistant at Michigan State under Biggie Munn and at Penn State under Bob Higgins.[46] Edwards' teams compiled a record of 77–88–8.[47] Edwards is the longest tenured coach in NC State Wolfpack football history and holds the program records for games coached, wins, and losses.[47] His teams won five Atlantic Coast Conference titles and made two Liberty Bowl appearances.[47] Four times he was named the ACC Coach of the Year.[47] Edwards produced eight All-Americans: Dick Christy, halfback (1957),[48] Roman Gabriel, quarterback (1960, 1961),[49] Don Montgomery, defensive end (1963),[50] Dennis Byrd, defensive tackle (1966, 1967),[51] Fred Combs, defensive back (1967),[52] Gerald Warren, kicker (1967),[53] Ron Carpenter, defensive tackle (1968),[53] and Cary Metts, center, (1968).[54] Though Edwards' tenure wasn't overly successful from a record standpoint, it was the most successful tenure of any head coach to that point and laid the foundation for future successes to occur.[55] Edwards retired after seventeen seasons as the Wolfpack's head football coach.[56] After Edwards' retirement, State promoted Al Michaels from assistant coach to head coach.[57] Things didn't pan out for Michaels, as the Wolfpack compiled a 3–8 record in his only year as head coach.[58] Michaels was fired after just one season.[59] In 1972, State hired Lou Holtz away from William & Mary as head coach.[60][61] Holtz had a 33–12–3 record in four seasons at NC State.[62] His Wolfpack teams played in four bowl games, going 2–1–1.[62][63] Holtz's 1972 team finished 8–3–1,[64] won the Peach Bowl over West Virginia[65] and finished the season ranked No. 17 in the final AP poll.[62] Holtz's 1973 team finished 9–3,[66] won the Liberty Bowl[67] and finished the season ranked No. 16 in the final AP poll.[62] The 1974 team finished 9–2–1,[68] tied Houston in the Bluebonnet Bowl[69] and finished the season ranked No. 9 in the Coaches' poll and No. 11 in the AP poll.[62] Holtz departed the Wolfpack after four seasons to become head coach of the NFL's New York Jets.[70] When Holtz moved on, Bo Rein, the offensive coordinator at Arkansas, became the youngest college football head coach upon his hiring by North Carolina State.[71] Guiding the Wolfpack football team, Rein was an advocate of the coaching philosophy of Ohio State's Woody Hayes for whom Rein played. During Rein's four years at NC State, he led the team to two bowl games, defeating Iowa State in the 1977 Peach Bowl and defeating the Pittsburgh in the 1978 Tangerine Bowl.[72] In Rein's final year at NC State, his team won the Wolfpack's last ACC title to date.[72] Despite winning the conference title, the Wolfpack were not invited to a bowl–as of the end of the 2019 season, the last bowl-eligible conference champion from a power conference to not take part in a bowl game. Among Rein's top players at NC State were Outland Trophy winner Jim Ritcher, a center for the Wolfpack who later started at guard on four Super Bowl teams with the Buffalo Bills,[73] and linebacker Bill Cowher, who later served as head coach of the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers for 15 seasons and won Super Bowl XL.[74][75] Following the 1979 season, Rein resigned as head football coach at State to accept the same position at LSU,[76] but Rein died in a plane crash before ever coaching a game for the Tigers.[77][78] Following every season, the NC State football team awards the \"Bo Rein Award\" to a player that makes a vital contribution in an unsung role.[79] After Rein's departure, NC State hired Arkansas defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin, father of Ole Miss and former Florida Atlantic, Oakland Raiders, Tennessee and USC head coach Lane Kiffin,[80] as head coach.[81] Kiffin served three seasons at State and his teams compiled a 16–17 record.[82] Kiffin's defensive coordinator during his three seasons at NCSU was Pete Carroll.[81][83] Kiffin decided to leave NCSU after three seasons to pursue coaching opportunities in the NFL. Tom Reed was hired away from Miami (OH) to take over as head coach of the Wolfpack after Kiffin's departure.[84] State struggled under Reed's leadership, posting three consecutive 3–8 yearly records en route to a 9–24 overall mark.[85] Under mounting pressure from fans, alumni and the school administration, Reed resigned after the 1985 season.[86] State chose Dick Sheridan, head coach at Furman, to take over as head coach of the Wolfpack football program in late 1986.[87] Under the tutelage of coach Sheridan, the Wolfpack compiled a record of 52–29–3.[88] State made six bowl appearances (two wins) and finished ranked in either the AP or Coaches poll three times.[88] Sheridan retired unexpectedly after seven seasons, citing health concerns and emotional issues.[89] Mike O'Cain was promoted from quarterbacks coach to head coach after Sheridan's retirement.[90] Under O'Cain, the Wolfpack compiled a record of 41–40.[91] O'Cain's seven-year tenure saw three bowl appearances, including a win in the 1994 Peach Bowl.[91] The latter part of O'Cain's tenure saw mostly mediocre teams. His 1995 and 1996 teams finished with 3–8 records,[92][93] and although the Wolfpack improved to finish 6–5,[94] 7–5[95] and 6–6[96] the next three years, he went 0–7 against archrival North Carolina.[97] NCSU fired O'Cain after the 1999 season.[97] In 2000, longtime college football assistant and NCSU alum Chuck Amato was hired as State's head football coach.[98] Although Amato had no head coaching or coordinating experience, NCSU felt that Amato's 18-year tenure as defensive line coach under Bobby Bowden at Florida State, winning two national championships, would help boost recruiting, ticket sales, and program prestige.[99] Amato accumulated an overall record of 49–37, including a record of 34–17 during the four-year period from 2000 through 2003 while Philip Rivers was the Wolfpack's starting quarterback.[100] Amato's most successful season was in 2002 when the Wolfpack won a school-record 11 games and defeated Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl. That team finished ranked No. 12 in the AP poll, their highest final ranking in 29 years.[101][100] Amato's tenure in Raleigh crested after Rivers graduated and left for the NFL. The Wolfpack finished 5–6 in 2004,[102] 7–5 in 2005,[103] and 3–9 in 2006.[104][100] On November 26, 2006, Amato was fired by NC State athletics director Lee Fowler after a seven–game losing streak capped off the 2006 season.[105] Noted losses include an upset by Akron,[106] a third straight loss to archrival North Carolina,[107] and a loss at home to East Carolina.[108][105] Highlights of the 2006 season include wins against Boston College[109] and Florida State.[110] In a statement, Fowler acknowledged Amato's \"excitement and enthusiasm.\" He continued, \"This enthusiasm fueled an $87 million renovation to Carter–Finley Stadium.\" Nonetheless, mediocre 2005 and 2006 seasons led to the decision \"to take the program in a new direction.\"[111] Even with Rivers as quarterback, Amato's teams never won more than five games in conference play, and actually finished six games under .500 in ACC play. Tom O'Brien was hired away from Boston College and named NCSU head football coach in December 2006.[112] He inherited a team that had gone 3–9 and lost its last seven games. In his first year, after opening the season 1–5,[113] his team pulled together and won four straight games, including a win over 18th-ranked Virginia[114] and tough road wins at East Carolina[115] and Miami.[116] Despite the slow start, his first Wolfpack squad went into the season finale with a bowl bid on the line.[117][118] The 2008 season will go down as one of the best of O'Brien's tenure, as the Wolfpack became the first in Atlantic Coast Conference history to start the season 0–4 in league play and finish 4–0, with an overall record of 6–7.[119] The bid to the Papajohns.com Bowl marked the ninth bowl invitation in the past 10 years for O'Brien.[120] His freshman quarterback, Russell Wilson, who would go on to become a Super Bowl winning quarterback for the NFL's Seattle Seahawks,[121] became the first rookie in the history of the Atlantic Coast Conference to be named first-team all-conference at his position and it marked the sixth time in his 19 years in the league that a quarterback under O'Brien's tutelage was named the All-ACC signal caller.[117][118] In 2009, the Wolfpack posted wins over Pittsburgh of the Big East[122] and a third-straight win over North Carolina,[123] but was decimated by injuries and finished the season 5–7.[124][117][118] After being picked to finish fourth in the Atlantic Division in the preseason in 2010,[125] the Wolfpack finished with a record of 9–4 and tied for second in the ACC,[126] was one game away from playing for an ACC title and was the third league team picked in the bowl selections. O'Brien's squad was the first Wolfpack team to garner nine wins since 2003 posted State's first winning season in five years. With the Champs Sports Bowl victory over West Virginia,[127] the 2010 squad tied the second highest win total in school history while finishing 9–4.[118] In 2011, led by future Tampa Bay Buccaneers starting quarterback Mike Glennon,[128] the Wolfpack had an 8–5 record.[129][130] On November 25, 2012, O'Brien received notice from NC State that he had been dismissed effective immediately despite navigating the team to a 7–5 regular-season record.[131][132] Athletic director Debbie Yow cited several reasons.[132] She was concerned over lagging season-ticket sales, as well as his approach to recruiting.[132] O'Brien's recruiting classes were frequently in the bottom half of the nation, and Yow wanted a coach who could bring top 25-type talent to Raleigh.[132] NCSU was obligated to pay $1.2 million of non-state funds to O'Brien, as his contract ran through the 2015 season.[133] NCSU ultimately paid O'Brien only $200,000 after the buyout was renegotiated so he could become an assistant at Virginia.[134] On December 1, 2012, Debbie Yow announced that Northern Illinois head coach Dave Doeren would be the new head coach of the Wolfpack.[135] His initial signed contract paid $1.8 million annually.[136] In Doeren's first season at the helm, the Wolfpack compiled a record of 3–9 and failed to win an ACC game.[137] In his second season, they improved to 8–5 (one of the fastest turnarounds in school history),[138] and won the 2014 St. Petersburg Bowl.[139] They also posted a decisive 35–7 win against archrival North Carolina.[140] Doeren accomplished all this with the 3rd youngest team in the nation.[141] The next year, Doeren's team finished 7–6,[142] losing the 2015 Belk Bowl.[143] The team was led by quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who was eventually selected by the New England Patriots in the 2016 NFL draft.[144] For the 2016 season, the Wolfpack again finished 7–6.[142] NC State began the season with a victory over William & Mary.[145] After losing the following week to East Carolina,[146] State won three straight, defeating Old Dominion,[147] Wake Forest[148] and Notre Dame (in a game infamously played during Hurricane Matthew).[149] NC State would then lose four games in a row, first in a heartbreaker against No. 3 Clemson,[150] then to No. 7 Louisville,[151] and finally to Boston College[152] and No. 19 Florida State.[153] The Wolfpack would close the season with a win over Syracuse,[154] a loss to Miami,[155] a victory in the regular season finale against archrival North Carolina[156] and a win over Vanderbilt in the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana.[157] On Thursday, October 5, 2017, at 8:00 pm, NC State played Louisville where quarterbacks Ryan Finley (NCSU) and Lamar Jackson (LOU) faced off in front of a national TV audience on ESPN College Football Thursday Primetime. Ryan Finley threw the football for 367 yards and Lamar Jackson threw the football for 354 yards. NC State won its first ACC divisional match-up against Louisville, with a final score of 39–25.[158] On February 24, 2022, Doeren and NC State agreed to terms on a raise and contract extension that would keep the coach in Raleigh through 2026.[159] As of November 25, 2023, Dave Doeren's teams have defeated archrival UNC 3 consecutive years and he has amassed an overall 7-4 record against the in state rival. NC State has been both independent and affiliated with multiple conferences.[160] NC State has won 11 conference championships in three different conferences.[162]: 150–156 [163] † Co-champion ‡ On-field record was 4–3, but adjusted to 5–2 due to South Carolina's use of an ineligible player, resulting in an ACC co-championship There have been 33 head coaches at NC State.[164][better source needed] NC State has participated in 36 bowl games as of the conclusion of the 2024 season, amassing a record of 17–18–1.[165] NC State rankings in final AP and Coaches polls.[166] From 1891 until 1907, the school's first teams played on the open fields that surrounded campus, either at Pullen Park, at the old North Carolina State Fairgrounds or on the farm tracts on the \"other\" side of the railroad tracks. In 1907, faculty members, alumni and students began collecting money to enclose a large tract of land behind the Main Building that would become the home of the football and baseball teams. The Aggies played their first game there against Randolph Macon, recording a 20–0 win. Wooden grandstands slowly rose on the site, and it was named Riddick Field in 1912, after popular professor W.C. Riddick, who is remembered as the father of athletics at the school.[167] The stadium did not age gracefully. At its height, it only had 14,000 permanent seats[168] and never held more than 23,000 seats total.[167] Although Riddick Stadium was considered obsolete as early as the 1950s,[167] it wasn't until 1966 that Riddick was replaced with a much more modern stadium. It was named Carter Stadium in honor of Harry C. & Wilbert J. \"Nick\" Carter, both graduates of the university. They were major contributors to the original building of the stadium. In 1979, it became Carter–Finley Stadium, named after Albert E. Finley, another major philanthropist and contributor to the university. The stadium's seating capacity is 56,919. Carter-Finley has been the home to some of the school's most decorated athletes: Gerald Warren, Dennis Byrd, the Buckey twins (Don and Dave), ACC-career rushing leader Ted Brown, Joe McIntosh, Erik Kramer, Jamie Barnette, Torry Holt, ACC-passing leader Philip Rivers, NFL No. 1 pick Mario Williams, and Russell Wilson.[167] On October 8, 2016, NC State celebrated its 50th season at Carter–Finley Stadium with a dramatic 10–3 win over Notre Dame Fighting Irish in the driving rain in the middle of Hurricane Matthew. NC State boasted a 2–0 record against the Fighting Irish, winning both of their meetings up to that time by a combined score of 38–9. In both games, Notre Dame had yet to score a touchdown against the Wolfpack. Since the 1960s, the Wolfpack has been represented at athletic events by its mascots, Mr. and Ms. Wuf. In print, the 'Strutting Wolf' is used and is known by the name 'Tuffy.' In September 2010, a purebred Tamaskan Dog became the new live mascot.[169][170][171][172][173] Bordering state rival Clemson leads the all-time series over NC State 60–31–1 through the 2023 season.[174] The name of the rivalry is derived from the textile industry which has historical importance to the economies of both North Carolina and South Carolina and the fact that both schools are among the largest university-level textile schools in the world.[175] Both NC State and Clemson were members of the Atlantic Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference, and thus played each other every year. The rivalry game is no longer protected in the expanded ACC and therefore will not be played every year going forward.[176] The two schools did play during the 2023 season in Raleigh, with NC State emerging victorious, 24-17, and at Clemson during the 2024 season with Clemson winning 59-35. The Wolfpack has now split two out of the last four meetings against the Tigers. This game is part of the larger Tobacco Road rivalry between North Carolina Power 5 universities NC State, North Carolina, Duke and Wake Forest. The series with Duke dates back to 1924 and was played every year uninterrupted from then until 2003 except for 1944.[177] After the Atlantic Coast Conference split into non-geographical divisions in 2004,[178] the Wolfpack and Blue Devils were placed in opposite divisions and weren't designated as each other's annual cross divisional opponent, thereby ending the annual series and making the rivalry intermittent.[179][180] With the ACC ending the divisional format after the 2022 season in favor of an arrangement that calls for three annual conference opponents with five rotating, the four North Carolina schools were designated as all three of each other's annual conference opponents, thus reviving the annual series between the Wolfpack and Blue Devils for the foreseeable future.[181][182] Duke dominated the early years of the rivalry but NC State has won 15 of 20 since 1990.[183] Duke leads the all-time series 43–37–5.[184][185][186] NC State leads the all-time series with non-Tobacco Road in-state rival East Carolina 19–13 with the most recent game being played in 2022, which resulted in NC State beating East Carolina in Greenville, NC.[187] The NC State and East Carolina rivalry dates back to the first meeting between the two schools in 1970, when they began playing on an annual basis which lasted until 1987. The two schools will next play during the 2025 season in Raleigh. Both schools have other larger and more prominent rivalries, but this series does stir up passion in both Greenville and Raleigh.[188][189][190] This game is part of the larger Tobacco Road rivalry between North Carolina Power 5 universities NC State, North Carolina, Duke and Wake Forest. The Wolfpack's rivalry with North Carolina is generally regarded as the most prominent college football game in the state of North Carolina.[191] The Tar Heels lead the all-time series 68–40–6 through the 2024 season.[192] The game is played annually at the end of every season during Thanksgiving week. Since the formation of the ACC in 1953, North Carolina leads the series 37–35, and NC State holds a 16–9 series advantage since 2000, including winning 13 out of the last 18 games against UNC-Chapel Hill.[192] Previously, the two schools were members of separate divisions in the Atlantic Coast Conference, but were designated as cross-over rivals, and thus played each other every year. As the ACC has expanded, the State-Carolina game has been designated as a protected rivalry, and the two schools will continue to play against each other on a yearly basis.[193] NC State has won the last 4 games in the series, winning the latest contest by a score of 35-30.[194] Current head coach Dave Doeren is 8-4 against Carolina, including a 5-1 record in Chapel Hill. This game is part of the larger Tobacco Road rivalry between North Carolina Power 5 universities NC State, North Carolina, Duke and Wake Forest. NC State leads the all-time series with Wake Forest 69–42–6 through the 2023 season, with NC State winning the latest contest, 26-6.[195] The rivalry game holds the distinction as the longest continuous rivalry between 2 ACC schools, and currently it is the second longest active streak in the nation. NC State and Wake Forest have played consecutively every year since 1910.[196] The two schools last played during the 2024 season in Raleigh,[194] with Wake Forest winning 34-30.
