                "content": "The Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team is the college football team representing the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, north of the city of South Bend, Indiana. The team plays its home games at the campus's Notre Dame Stadium, which has a capacity of 77,622. Notre Dame is one of three schools that competes as an Independent at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) level; however, they play five games a year against opponents from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), of which Notre Dame is a member in all other sports except ice hockey.[5] The Fighting Irish are among the most prestigious college football teams of all time. Since their inaugural season in 1887, Notre Dame has claimed 11 national championships, including 8 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll.[6] Seven Notre Dame players have won the Heisman Trophy. Notre Dame has 948 official victories, with an additional 21 having been vacated by the NCAA in 2016 for self-reported academic misconduct.[7] Notre Dame has had 22 undefeated seasons including 12 perfect seasons.[8] Notre Dame home games have been televised by NBC since 1991.[9][10] Football did not have an auspicious beginning at the University of Notre Dame. In their inaugural game on November 23, 1887, the Irish lost to Michigan by a score of 8–0.[11] Their first win came in the final game of the 1888 season when the Irish defeated Harvard Prep School of Chicago by a score of 20–0.[12] At the end of the 1888 season, they had a record of 1–3 with all three losses being at the hands of Michigan. Between 1887 and 1899, Notre Dame compiled a record of 31 wins, 15 losses, and 4 ties against a diverse variety of opponents ranging from local high school teams to other universities.[13] In 1894, James L. Morrison was hired as Notre Dame's first head football coach.[14] Notre Dame took a significant step toward respectability, prominence, and stability when they hired Morrison.[15] He wrote an acquaintance after his first day on the job: \"I arrived here [Notre Dame] this morning and found about as green a set of football players that ever donned a uniform... They want to smoke, and when I told them that they would have to run and get up some wind, they thought I was rubbing it in on them. \"One big, strong cuss remarked that it was too much like work. Well, maybe you think I didn't give him hell! I bet you a hundred no one ever makes a remark like that again.\"[15] In 1908, the win over Franklin saw end Fay Wood catch the first touchdown pass in Notre Dame history.[16] Notre Dame continued its success near the turn of the century and achieved their first victory over Michigan in 1909 by the score of 11–3, after which Michigan refused to play Notre Dame again for 33 years. By the end of the 1912 season they had amassed a record of 108 wins, 31 losses, and 13 ties.[17] Jesse Harper became head coach in 1913, coaching for five years until retiring in 1917.[18] During his tenure, the Irish began playing only intercollegiate games and posted a record of 34 wins, five losses, and one tie.[19] This period would also mark the beginning of the rivalry with Army and the continuation of rivalry with Michigan State.[20][21] In an effort to gain respect for a regionally successful but small-time Midwestern football program, Harper scheduled games in his first season with national powerhouses Texas, Penn State, and Army.[22] That year, Notre Dame burst into the national consciousness and helped to transform the collegiate game in a single contest. On November 1, 1913, the Notre Dame squad stunned the Black Knights of the Hudson 35–13 in a game played at West Point.[23] Led by quarterback Gus Dorais and end Knute Rockne, the Notre Dame team attacked the Cadets with an offense that featured both the expected powerful running game but also long and accurate downfield forward passes from Dorais to Rockne. This game has been miscredited as the invention of the forward pass.[24] Prior to this contest, receivers would come to a full stop and wait on the ball to come to them, but in this contest, Dorais threw to Rockne in stride, changing the forward pass from a seldom-used play into the dominant ball-moving strategy that it is today.[24][23] Irish assistant Knute Rockne became head coach in 1918.[25] During his 13 years, the Irish won three national championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925,[26] and produced players such as George Gipp and the \"Four Horsemen\".[27] Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran a 7–2–2 scheme.[28][29] Rockne took over in the war-torn season of 1918[30] He made his coaching debut on September 28, 1918, against Case Tech in Cleveland, Ohio, and earned a 26–6 victory.[31] Leonard Bahan, George Gipp, and Curly Lambeau were in the backfield.[32][33] With Gipp, Rockne had an ideal handler of the forward pass.[34][35] The Irish posted a 3–1–2 record for the season, losing only to the Michigan Agricultural Aggies. The 1919 team had Rockne handle the line and Gus Dorais handle the backfield.[36] The Irish went undefeated and were one of four teams to be selected for the national championship, although Notre Dame does not claim it.[37][38] Gipp died at age 25 on December 14, 1920,[39] just two weeks after Walter Camp elected him as Notre Dame's first All-American.[40][39] Gipp likely contracted strep throat and pneumonia while giving punting lessons after his final game on November 20 against Northwestern.[40] Since antibiotics were not available in the 1920s, treatment options for such infections were limited and they could be fatal even to young, healthy individuals.[41] Rockne was speaking to Gipp on his hospital bed when he was purported to have delivered the famous \"Win one for the Gipper\" line.[42][39][43][44][45] John Mohardt led the 1921 Notre Dame team to a 10–1 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns.[46] Grantland Rice wrote that \"Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space\" and noted that the 1921 Notre Dame team \"was the first team we know of to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game.\"[47] Mohardt had both Eddie Anderson and Roger Kiley at end to receive his passes.[48][49] The national champion 1924 team included the \"Four Horsemen\" backfield of Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Jim Crowley, and Elmer Layden.[50][51] The line was known as the \"Seven Mules\".[52] The Irish capped an undefeated, 10–0 season with a victory over Stanford in the Rose Bowl.[26] The 1926 team beat Army and was led by Christie Flanagan,[53][54] but was undone by a loss to Carnegie Tech in the penultimate game of the season. In this game, Rockne made what an Associated Press writer called \"one of the greatest coaching blunders in history\" by traveling to Chicago for the Army–Navy Game to \"write newspaper articles about it, as well as select an All-America football team.\" Carnegie Tech used the coach's absence as motivation for a 19–0 win; the upset likely cost the Irish a chance for a national title.[55] The 1928 team lost to national champion Georgia Tech.[56] \"I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man–Peter Pund,\" said Rockne. \"Nobody could stop him. I counted 20 scoring plays that this man ruined.\"[57] Among the events that occurred during Rockne's tenure none may be more famous than the Rockne's \"Win one for the Gipper\" speech.[58] Army came into the 1928 matchup undefeated and was the clear favorite.[59] Notre Dame, on the other hand, was having their worst season under Rockne's leadership and entered the game with a 4–2 record.[59] At the end of the half Army was leading and looked to be in command of the game. Rockne entered the locker room and gave his account of Gipp's final words: \"I've got to go, Rock. It's all right. I'm not afraid. Some time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are going wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go in there with all they've got and win just one for the Gipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Rock. But I'll know about it, and I'll be happy.\"[60] The speech inspired the team and they went on to upset Army and win the game 12–6.[61] The 1929 and 1930 teams both went undefeated,[62][63] winning national championships,[64][65] and the 1930 team was led by the likes of Frank Carideo, Joe Savoldi, Marchy Schwartz and Marty Brill.[65] It featured the first and only example of all four members of a backfield being named to an All-American team during the same season. The 1929 team played all of its games on the road while the new Notre Dame Stadium was being built.[66] In 1930, \"Jumping Joe\" Savoldi scored the first Notre Dame touchdown in the new stadium on a 98-yard kickoff return.[67] Savoldi is also known as \"the first hero in the lore of Notre Dame's Stadium\" based on scoring three touchdowns in the official stadium dedication game against Navy the following week.[68] Rockne coached his last game on December 14, 1930, when he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New York City.[69][70] The game raised funds for the Mayor's Relief Committee for the unemployed and needy of the city.[71] 50,000 fans turned out to see the reunited \"Four Horsemen\" along with players from Rockne's other championship teams take the field against the pros.[72] On March 31, 1931, Rockne died at age 43 in the crash of a Transcontinental & Western Air airliner in Kansas; he was on his way to help in the production of the film The Spirit of Notre Dame.[73][74][75] The crash site is located in a remote expanse of Kansas known as the Flint Hills and now features a Rockne Memorial.[76] As Notre Dame's head coach from 1918 to 1930, Rockne posted what has remained for decades the all-time highest winning percentage (.881) for a football coach in the NCAA's flagship FBS division.[77][78] During his 13-year tenure as head coach of the Fighting Irish, Rockne collected 105 victories, 12 losses, 5 ties and 3 national championships.[79][80] Rockne also coached Notre Dame to 5 undefeated and untied seasons.[79][80] Through game broadcasts during the Golden Age of Radio, Notre Dame football gained a nationwide following of \"subway alumni\", Catholics who became fans whether or not they attended the university.[81] Former Saint Louis head coach Heartley \"Hunk\" Anderson was promoted from assistant coach and took the helm of the Irish after Knute Rockne's death, leading them to a record of 16 wins, nine losses, and two ties.[82] Anderson was a former Irish player under Rockne and was serving as an assistant coach at the time of Rockne's death. Notre Dame finished 6–2–1 in 1931.[83] The Irish lost a heartbreaker by a score of 16–14 to USC on November 21 that snapped the program's 26-game unbeaten streak.[84] 1933 was a tough year for the Irish as they finished with a 3–5–2 record, the first losing season for the program since 1888. ND suffered a four-game losing streak, failing to score a point in all four losses to Carnegie Tech, Pittsburgh, Navy, and Purdue.[85] Anderson resigned as Irish head coach after the 1933 season to accept the position of head football coach at NC State.[86] Anderson was replaced by Elmer Layden, who was one of Rockne's \"Four Horsemen\" in the 1920s. After graduating, Layden played professional football for one year and then began a coaching career.[87] Layden's 1935 squad posted one of the greatest wins in school history by rallying to defeat Ohio State by a score of 18–13 in a game billed as the \"Game of the Century\".[88][89] His 1938 team finished 8–1, losing only to USC in the season finale.[90] This loss cost them a possible consensus national championship, but the team was named national champion by the Dickinson System.[91] Like Rockne before him, Layden was a goodwill ambassador for Notre Dame during his time as head coach.[92][93] He was able to schedule a home-and-home series with Michigan after meeting with Fielding H. Yost, healing a rift between the two schools.[94] The two teams had not met since 1909, when, after eight straight losses to the Wolverines, the Irish posted their first win.[95][96] They were scheduled to meet again in 1910, but Michigan canceled the game and refused to play the Irish again.[96] By the time they met again in 1943, Layden had left Notre Dame and Frank Leahy had taken his place.[96] The Irish posted a record of 47 wins, 13 losses, and three ties in seven years under Layden,[97] the most successful record of a Notre Dame coach not to win a national championship.[98] He left Notre Dame after the 1940 season to become Commissioner of the National Football League.[98][87] Boston College head coach Frank Leahy was hired by Notre Dame to take over for Layden in 1941 and was another former Irish player who played during the Rockne era. After graduating from Notre Dame, Leahy held several coaching positions, including line coach of the Seven Blocks of Granite of Fordham University that helped that team win all but two of their games between 1935 and 1937.[99] He then coached the Boston College Eagles to a win in the 1941 Sugar Bowl and a share of the national championship.[100][101] His move to Notre Dame began a new period of gridiron success for the Irish and ensured Leahy's place among the winningest coaches in the history of college football.[102] Leahy coached the team for 11 seasons from 1941 to 1943 and 1946 to 1953.[99] After finishing in the AP top 10 each of his first two seasons, Leahy's 1943 team went 9–1 and captured Notre Dame's fourth national championship (and first since the advent of the AP Poll). Quarterback Angelo Bertelli became Notre Dame's first Heisman Trophy winner. From 1944 to 1945, Leahy served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was honorably discharged as a captain.[103] Edward McKeever, Leahy's assistant coach, became interim head coach when Leahy left for the Navy.[104] During 1944, his one year at the helm, the Irish managed 8 wins and 2 losses.[105] McKeever left Notre Dame in 1945 to take over as head coach of Cornell.[106] For the 1945 season, he was replaced by Hugh Devore, who led the Irish to a 7–2–1 record.[107] Upon Leahy's return in 1946 and due to his status as a veteran himself, the Irish heavily recruited returning veterans who were often much older than incoming freshmen. Largely thanks to this influx of talent, Notre Dame went four consecutive seasons after World War II without losing a game, winning the 1946, 1947, and 1949 national championships in the process.[108] The 1946 game against Army, ending in a 0–0 tie, pitted two of the greatest teams of all time against each other and included three consecutive Heisman Trophy winners (Army's Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis and Notre Dame's Johnny Lujack, who quarterbacked the 1946 and 1947 Irish). The 1948 team missed out on a national championship due only to a 14–14 tie at USC in the final game of the season. In 1949, Notre Dame went unbeaten and untied for the second time in three seasons behind Heisman Trophy-winning end Leon Hart, who would later be selected first overall in the 1950 NFL Draft. A fifth national championship was lost because of a 1953 tie against Iowa, in a game that featured 1953 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lattner[109] that caused a minor scandal at the time, when it appeared that some Irish players had faked injuries to stop the clock, leading some to nickname those players the \"Fainting Irish\".[110][111][112] Leahy retired in 1954 reportedly due to health issues.[113] Perhaps the best example of this occurred during the Georgia Tech game in 1953. Leahy fell ill during the game, which led to him collapsing during halftime.[114][self-published source] The situation was so dire that a priest was called in to give Leahy Catholic last rites.[115] However, Leahy recovered, and the consequent diagnosis was that he was suffering from nervous tension and pancreatitis.[116] Leahy has the second highest winning percentage (.864) of any college coach in history. He led the Irish to a record of 87 wins, 11 losses, and nine ties including 39 consecutive games without a loss (37–0–2), four national championships, and six undefeated seasons.[102][117] The departure of Frank Leahy ushered in a downward slope in Notre Dame's performance.[118] 25-year old assistant coach Terry Brennan was hired as Frank Leahy's successor as the Notre Dame head coach in 1954 and would stay until 1958. Brennan was a former player under Leahy. Before joining the Irish, he had coached the Mount Carmel High School team in Chicago.[119] His first two seasons the Irish were ranked fourth and ninth respectively in the AP poll, with a loss to Purdue the only blemish on the 1954 team's schedule.[119][120] It was the 1956 season that began to darken Brennan's reputation, for it became one of the most dismal in the team's history and saw them finish the season with a mere two wins, including losses to Michigan State, Oklahoma, and Iowa.[121] One bright spot in the 1956 season was the awarding of the Heisman Trophy to Paul Hornung, who would go on to a legendary NFL career with the Green Bay Packers. Hornung is the only Heisman winner to win the award while playing for a team that had a losing record.[122] The Irish would recover the following season, posting a record of 7–3[123] and including in their wins a stunning upset of Oklahoma, in Norman, Oklahoma, that ended the Sooners' still-standing record of 47 consecutive wins.[124] In Brennan's final season, though, the Irish finished 6–4,[125] leading to Brennan's firing in mid-December.[126] Brennan's tenure can only be properly framed with the understanding that in a time of zero scholarship limitations in college football, Notre Dame's administration inexplicably began a process of de-emphasizing football, severely cutting scholarships and hindering Brennan from building a roster of any meaningful depth.[127] He departed with a total of 32 wins and 18 losses.[128] Former San Francisco, Chicago Cardinals and Washington Redskins head coach Joe Kuharich took the head coaching position at Notre Dame in 1959, realizing a longtime ambition to return to his alma mater.[129][130] He had earlier been courted by Notre Dame after the 1956 season, after the Irish finished 2–8, but before he had a chance to accept an offer, Terry Brennan was given a reprieve.[131] Kuharich brought a professional touch to Irish football, putting shamrocks on the players' helmets and shoulder stripes on their jerseys.[131][132] However, his tenure became one of the worst stretches in program history, including a school-record eight-game losing streak in 1960, a year in which the Irish finished 2–8.[133] The consensus opinion was that Kuharich never made the adjustment from pro football to college football, attempting to use complicated pro coaching techniques with collegiate players, and never adapted to the limited substitution rules in effect at the time, having big, immobile linemen playing both ways in an era where smaller, quicker players were preferred. He often said, \"You win some and you lose some\", and seemed perfectly content finishing 5–5 every year. This did not sit well with the Irish faithful, who expected Notre Dame to beat everybody.[134] When the pressure of winning became too much to bear, Kuharich resigned in the spring of 1963 and assumed the post of supervisor of NFL officials.[131] Because it was so late in the spring, the freshman team's coach Hugh Devore was named head coach for the 1963 season while the search for a permanent replacement was being conducted.[135] Kuharich compiled a 17–23 record over four non-winning seasons and remains to this day the only coach ever to have an overall losing record at Notre Dame. Despite his unsuccessful tenure, Kuharich remains the only Irish coach to post back-to-back shutouts over their greatest rival, the USC Trojans, in 1960 (17–0) and 1961 (30–0).[136] In 1964, Ara Parseghian left his job as the Northwestern head football coach when he was hired to take over the coaching duties at Notre Dame.[137] He immediately brought the team back to a level of success in Irish football history that was comparable only to Rockne and Leahy. These three coaches have an 80% or greater winning percentage while at Notre Dame – Rockne at .881, Leahy at .864, and Parseghian at .836. Parseghian's teams never won fewer than seven nor lost more than three games during the ten-game regular seasons of the era.[138] In his first year, the Irish improved their record to 9–1 behind Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback John Huarte, but they lost any hope for a national championship in the last game of the season at USC when Craig Fertig connected with a touchdown pass to Rod Sherman.[139] Parseghian earned coach of the year honors from the American Football Coaches Association, the Football Writers Association, and The Sporting News, as well as several others, and a cover story in Time magazine.[140][141] The 1966 team did finish unbeaten, finishing #1 in the AP Poll and winning the national championship in the process. The Irish had six shutout wins, each by 30 or more points. This includes a season-ending 51-0 win at #10 USC, the largest margin of victory by either side in the rivalry's history. This season is most remembered for a 10–10 tie at #2 Michigan State in the \"Game of the Century\" in which the injury-plagued Irish played for a tie rather than risking a loss.[142] It was under Parseghian as well that Notre Dame lifted its 40-plus year-old \"no bowl games\" policy,[143] beginning with the season of 1969, after which the Irish played the #1 Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl Classic, losing in the final minutes in a closely contested game.[144] The following year, Parseghian's 9–1 squad[145] ended Texas' Southwest Conference record 30-game winning streak in the Cotton Bowl.[144] In 1971, Cliff Brown became the first African-American quarterback to start a game for the program.[146] The Irish returned to glory by winning Parseghian's second national championship in 1973, sweeping through their regular-season schedule 10–0 and defeating #1 Alabama 24-23 in the Sugar Bowl by taking advantage of a fourth-quarter missed extra point by the Crimson Tide. Due to health issues, Parseghian was forced to retire from coaching after another bowl win over Alabama to conclude the 1974 season.[147] During Parseghian's eleven-year career, the Irish amassed a record of 95–17–4 and captured two national championships. The Irish finished in the AP Top 10 nine times and never ranked lower than #14 at the end of a season. Parseghian was also named coach of the year by several selectors in his national championship years of 1966 and 1973 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980.[148][149] Dan Devine was hired to take over as head coach upon Parseghian's retirement from Notre Dame in 1975.[150] Devine was already a highly successful coach and had led Arizona State, Missouri, and the NFL's Green Bay Packers.[150] Devine had been a leading candidate for the head coaching job at Notre Dame in 1964, when Ara Parseghian was hired.[151] When approached for the job following Parseghian's resignation, Devine accepted immediately, joking that it was probably the shortest job interview in history.[152] When he arrived at Notre Dame he already had a college coaching record of 120 wins, 40 losses, and eight ties and had led his teams to victory in four bowl games.[153] At Notre Dame he would lead the Irish to 53 wins, 16 losses, and a tie as well as three bowl victories.[153] His lasting achievement came midway through this run, when the 1977 Notre Dame team won the national championship, led by junior quarterback Joe Montana.[154] Before the game against USC, played at home on October 22, Devine changed the team's jerseys from navy blue & white to kelly green & gold, later known as the \"green jersey game\", resulting in a 49–19 victory over the Trojans.[155] The Irish continued to wear green for the rest of Devine's tenure at the school.[155] The championship season climaxed with a 38–10 win in the 1978 Cotton Bowl Classic over previously top-ranked Texas, led by Heisman Trophy winner Earl Campbell.[156] The win vaulted the Irish from fifth to first in the polls. The following season, the Irish lost their first two games including a shocking 3–0 loss to Missouri in South Bend, but would recover to finish the regular season 8–3 and earn a berth in the Cotton Bowl against Houston. The Irish used three Montana touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) to recover from a 22-point deficit in the fourth quarter and win 35–34, the largest fourth-quarter comeback in college football history at the time. The game became known as the \"Chicken Soup Game\" after Montana ate a bowl of chicken soup at halftime while battling the flu.[157] The 1979 and 1980 Irish did not live up to the standards set by earlier Devine teams, although the former season did see Vagas Ferguson set the single-season program rushing record (1,437 yards) that still stands today. Because he had the unenviable task of following a legend, Devine came under heavy scrutiny while at Notre Dame and it was felt that he was never fully embraced by the Notre Dame community, despite winning a national championship.[158] After a 5–2 start in his first season, rumors of incompetence were circulated and that Devine would be dismissed and replaced by Don Shula or even Ara Parseghian (who went so far as to say he would not return to Notre Dame under any circumstances).[159] Even on the day of the 1977 USC game, \"Dump Devine\" bumper stickers were being sold outside Notre Dame Stadium.[159] On August 15, 1980, Devine announced that he would be leaving Notre Dame at the end of season, saying he wanted to be able to spend more time with his wife.[158] Gerry Faust was a surprise choice when hired to replace Devine in 1981.[160] Prior to Notre Dame, Faust had been one of the more successful high school football coaches in the country. As coach of Moeller High School in Cincinnati he amassed a 174–17–2 record over 19 seasons.[161] Many of his players had gone on to play for Notre Dame; indeed, when he arrived in South Bend, he was reunited with nine of his former players from Moeller. Despite his success in the high school ranks, Faust's success at Notre Dame was mixed. In his first season, the Irish finished 5–6.[162] In Faust's second season, Notre Dame improved slightly to 6–4–1.[163] The most successful years under Faust were the 1983 and 1984 campaigns where the Irish finished 7–5 and made trips to the Liberty Bowl and Aloha Bowl respectively.[164][165] His final record at Notre Dame was 30–26–1.[166] To avoid being fired, Faust resigned at the end of the 1985 season.[167][168] He announced his resignation prior to the final game of the year, where Notre Dame suffered a humiliating 58–7 loss at Miami; Allen Pinkett scored the Irish TD. Faust proceeded to take over as head coach at Akron.[169] Lou Holtz had 17 years of head coaching experience by the time he was hired to lead the Irish.[170] He had previously been head coach of William & Mary, North Carolina State, the NFL's New York Jets, Arkansas, and Minnesota.[170] In contrast to Faust, Holtz was well known as a master motivator and a strict disciplinarian.[171][172] The tone was set with Holtz's first meeting with his team as Irish head coach in 1986, immediately demanding his players sit up straight in their chairs and look him in the eye as he spoke.[173] Holtz began in 1986 where his predecessor left off in 1985, finishing with an identical record of 5–6.[174] However, unlike the 1985 squad, which was generally outcoached and outplayed, Holtz's 1986 edition was competitive in nearly every game, losing five out of those six games by a combined total of 14 points. That would be his only losing season as he posted a record of 95–24–2 over the next ten seasons adding up to a 100–30–2 record overall.[175][176] In 1987, Holtz led the Irish to an 8–4 record.[177] Notre Dame's best player was star wide receiver Tim Brown, who would win the Heisman Trophy that season and is Notre Dame's seventh and most recent Heisman winner.[178][179] The 1988 campaign began with high hopes, as former Notre Dame coaches Rockne, Leahy, Parseghian, and Devine all won their first national championship in their third season with the program. The Irish defeated their first five opponents, ascending to the #4 ranking in the lead-up to a visit from the reigning national champion Miami Hurricanes. In a game which became known as Catholics vs. Convicts due to a popular T-shirt design on Notre Dame's campus, the Irish upset the Hurricanes 31–30 when Pat Terrell knocked down Steve Walsh's two-point conversion attempt with no time on the clock. When star players Ricky Watters and Tony Brooks showed up late for dinner right before the then top-ranked Irish played second-ranked USC in the final regular season game of 1988,[180] in a controversial move, Holtz took his 10–0 Irish squad to Los Angeles without them.[181] His move was vindicated when the Irish defeated USC anyway.[182] Holtz was named national coach of the year,[170] and a win over No. 3 West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl captured the Irish's 11th-all time national championship.[183] 1988 remains Notre Dame's most recent undefeated season and national championship.[184][185] In 1989, Holtz led the Irish to a 12–1 record. The Irish began the season in the Kickoff Classic game in East Rutherford, New Jersey, against Virginia.[186] The Irish won by a score of 36–13 and ascended to the #1 spot in the AP Poll.[187] Next, top-ranked Notre Dame defeated #2 Michigan by a score of 24–19.[188] After nine more consecutive victories to begin the season 11–0, the Irish would lose to #7 Miami in the final week of the season, ending Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak.[189] Holtz would lead the Irish to a victory in the Orange Bowl over #1 Colorado to end the season, finishing #2 in the AP poll behind Miami.[190] After beginning the 1990 season with a #1 ranking and a victory over #4 Michigan by a score of 28–24 and two more wins for a 3–0 start, the Irish took their first loss of the season, losing to Stanford by a score of 36–31. The Irish would ascend back to #1 on the strength of a home win over #2 Miami, a game that saw the end of the series between the two until 2010.[191] However, late-season losses to Penn State and Colorado in the Orange Bowl would eliminate the Irish from national championship contention.[192] The 1991 Fighting Irish began the season 8-1, but lost back-to-back games for the first time since 1987 when they again lost to Penn State. The Irish would receive a berth in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, where they defeated Florida by a score of 39–28.[193][194] In 1992, Notre Dame finished 10–1–1. After defeating Northwestern to start the season,[195] the Fighting Irish tied #5 Michigan, their first tie of the Holtz era.[196] This season saw the Irish's largest win in history against Purdue, a 48–0 win at Notre Dame Stadium, and a 28–3 Cotton Bowl against previously unbeaten #4 Texas A&M.[197][198] The Irish enjoyed another successful season in 1993, finishing the season at 11–1. After scoring 27 points in wins over Northwestern and #2 Michigan to start the season, the Irish defeated their next six opponents to enter a matchup with undefeated #1 Florida State 8–0 and ranked just behind the Seminoles at #2. For the first time, ESPN's College GameDay decided to make a visit to campus to host the show live on Saturday morning.[199] In a classic, the Irish defeated the Seminoles 31–24, ascending to the #1 ranking a day later. However, a loss to #17 Boston College on a game-winning field goal as time expired by a score of 41–39 ended the Irish's national championship aspirations.[200] The Irish would face a rematch with #6 Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl to finish the season, a game the Irish won by a score of 24–21.[201][202] Controversially, Notre Dame finished #2 in the AP poll behind a team in Florida State it had beaten. In 1994, Holtz led Notre Dame to a 6–5–1 record, the Irish's worst record since Holtz's first season in 1986.[203] The team lost three of four games midseason to drop out of the rankings for the first time since 1986. The Irish would improve to 9–3 in 1995, but lost to #8 Florida State in the Orange Bowl.[204][205] Lou Holtz's final season at Notre Dame in 1996 resulted in an 8–3 record. The season notably saw Notre Dame's first participation in the Emerald Isle Classic in Ireland, a 54–27 win over Navy, and an overtime loss to USC, snapping the Irish's 13-game non-losing streak against the Trojans.[206][207] Holtz's option offense, which helped catapult Notre Dame to many victories in the late 1980s and early 1990s, also helped rack up impressive recruiting classes. During the 1989 season, Holtz had the following future NFL players on offense: QB Rick Mirer, RB Ricky Watters, RB Anthony Johnson, RB Rodney Culver RB Dorsey Levens, and WR Raghib Ismail. In 1990, he added RB Jeff Burris (who would later move to safety), FB Jerome Bettis and TE Irv Smith. 1991 saw the additions of RB Reggie Brooks and FB Ray Zellars. 1992 saw the addition of WR Derrick Mayes. For 1993, he added FB Marc Edwards. In 1995, he added RB Autry Denson. From the 1987–1995 NFL Drafts, there were a total of 65 Notre Dame players selected.[208] Overall, Holtz took Notre Dame to one undefeated season, nine consecutive New Year's Day bowl games, and top 10 finishes in the AP poll in five seasons,[209] as well as overseeing the majority of the longest winning streak against USC in program history (11 games). Holtz retired from Notre Dame following the 1996 season,[210] but would unretire in 1999 to accept the head coaching position at South Carolina where he would serve until the completion of the 2004 season.[211][212] Bob Davie, who had been Holtz's defensive coordinator from 1994 to 1996, was promoted to head coach when Holtz retired.[213] Davie, who turned down a head coaching offer from Purdue to accept the Irish's head coaching position,[214] was a well-respected defensive mind who had also served as defensive coordinator at Tulane and Texas A&M.[215] Davie had also filled in as head coach for one game during the 1995 season when Lou Holtz was dealing with a health issue.[216] One of his first major decisions was to fire long-time offensive line coach Joe Moore, who then successfully sued the university for age discrimination.[217] On Davie's watch, the team suffered three bowl game losses (1997 Independence Bowl,[218] 1999 Gator Bowl,[219] and 2001 Fiesta Bowl),[220] and it failed to qualify for a bowl game in two others (1999 and 2001). The highlight of Davie's tenure was a 36–20 upset win in 1998 over #5 Michigan, the defending national champions.[221][222] On December 17, 1999, Notre Dame was placed on probation by the NCAA. The association's Committee on Infractions found two series of violations. The New York Times reported \"the main one involved the actions of a booster, Kimberly Dunbar, who lavished gifts on football players with money she later pleaded guilty to embezzling.\" In the second series of events, a football player was accused of trying to sell several complimentary game tickets and of using others as repayment of a loan. The player was also said \"to have been romantically involved with a woman (not Dunbar), a part-time tutor at the university, who wrote a term paper for another player for a small fee and provided players with meals, lodging and gifts.\"[223] The Dunbar violation began while Lou Holtz was head coach: \"According to the NCAA committee report, Dunbar, the woman at the center of the more serious violations, had become romantically involved with several Notre Dame football players from June 1995 to January 1998 and had a child with one, Jarvis Edison.\"[223] Notre Dame was placed on probation for two years and lost one of its 85 football scholarships each year in what the Times termed \"minor\" penalties.[223][224] Davie nearly defeated top-ranked Nebraska in 2000, with the Irish comeback bid falling short in overtime 27–24.[225] The aforementioned 2001 Fiesta Bowl was Notre Dame's first invitation to the Bowl Championship Series. The Irish lost by 32 points to Oregon State,[226] but would finish No. 15 in the AP Poll, Davie's highest ranking as head coach. Despite Davie's rocky tenure, new athletic director Kevin White gave the coach a contract extension following the 2000 season,[227] then saw the team start 0–3 in 2001 – the first such start in school history.[228] Disappointed by the on-field results, coupled with the Joe Moore and Kim Dunbar scandals, the administration decided to dismiss Davie after the 2001 season.[229] His final record at Notre Dame was 35–25.[230] On December 9, 2001, Notre Dame hired George O'Leary, the head coach at Georgia Tech, to replace Davie.[231] However, while researching a story on O'Leary, New Hampshire Union Leader reporter Jim Fennell uncovered misrepresentations in O'Leary's resume that had influenced the administration's decision to hire him.[232] The resulting media scandal embarrassed Notre Dame officials and tainted O'Leary; he resigned five days later, before coaching a single practice, recruiting a single player, or hiring a single assistant coach.[233] O'Leary's tenure is the shortest of any head coach in FBS history.[234] O'Leary would go on to become the head football coach at the University of Central Florida.[235] Once again in need of a new head coach, the school turned to Tyrone Willingham, the head coach at Stanford.[236] Willingham's hiring made him the first African American head coach in Notre Dame football history.[237] Bringing a feeling of change and excitement to campus, Willingham led the 2002 squad to a 10–2 regular season record, including an 8–0 start with wins over #7 Michigan and #11 Florida State, and a #4 ranking. This great early start, however, would be the lone highlight of Willingham's tenure, as Notre Dame finished the year with a loss to Boston College, then lopsided losses to USC and North Carolina State in the Gator Bowl.[238] The program faltered over the next two seasons under Willingham, compiling an 11–12 record.[239] During this time, Notre Dame lost a game by at least 30 points on five occasions. Furthermore, Willingham's 2004 recruiting class was judged by analysts to be the worst at Notre Dame in more than two decades.[240] Citing Notre Dame's third consecutive four-touchdown loss to arch-rival USC[241] compounded by another year of subpar recruiting efforts, the Willingham era ended on November 30, 2004 (after the conclusion of the 2004 season) when the university chose to terminate him and pay out the remainder of Willingham's six-year contract.[242] After Willingham's firing, Notre Dame initially pursued Utah head coach Urban Meyer, who had been an Irish assistant from 1996 to 2000 and had a clause in his Utah contract that stated he could take the Notre Dame head coaching job without paying a buyout.[243][244] After Meyer accepted the Florida head coaching position and turned down the Irish,[245] Charlie Weis left the NFL's New England Patriots, where he won three Super Bowls as offensive coordinator,[246] to become head football coach for the Irish beginning with the 2005 season.[247] A first-time head coach when he was hired by Notre Dame,[248] Weis was officially introduced on December 12, 2004.[249] Weis' hiring as the Irish's 30th head football coach made him the first Notre Dame graduate to hold the football head coaching position on a full-fledged basis since Joe Kuharich.[250] Weis signed a six-year contract worth about $2 million annually excluding incentives.[251][252][253] To kick off his inaugural season, Weis led the Irish to back-to-back road wins over ranked teams, the first time that had been done by a Notre Dame coach since Knute Rockne. On September 25, Weis and the Irish traveled to Seattle to face Washington and former head coach Tyrone Willingham, who was hired by the Huskies to be their head coach two weeks after getting fired at Notre Dame.[254] The Irish won by a score of 36–17.[255] Entering the rivalry game with USC, defending national champions and owners of a 27-game winning streak, the Irish had risen to #9 in the AP Poll. In one of the most famous games in the rivalry's history, USC defeated Notre Dame 34–31. The game is most remembered for Trojan running back and eventual Heisman winner Reggie Bush, who had already scored three touchdowns that day, illegally pushing quarterback Matt Leinart into the end zone on the final play of the game, in a play now known as the \"Bush Push\". The Irish won their remaining five games to earn an appearance in the Fiesta Bowl. There, they were defeated by the Ohio State Buckeyes 34–20[256] to finish the season 9–3 and #9 in the AP poll, their highest final ranking since 1993. Quarterback Brady Quinn broke numerous team passing records that season and became a top Heisman Trophy contender.[257] Wide receiver Jeff Samardzija was the team's leading receiver and also broke Notre Dame's single-season records for receiving yards and touchdowns.[258] During the 2005 season, Notre Dame signed Weis to a big raise and ten-year contract extension that was set to keep the coach in South Bend through the 2015 season.[259][260] Weis and the Irish went into the 2006 season with a No. 2 preseason ranking in the ESPN/Coaches Poll.[261] They finished the regular season with a 10–2 record, losing only to Michigan and USC. Notre Dame accepted a bid to the 2007 Sugar Bowl, losing to LSU 41–14. This marked their ninth consecutive postseason loss, the longest drought in NCAA history.[262] As a result, Notre Dame dropped to #17 in the final rankings.[263][264] In the wake of a graduating class that sent eleven players to the NFL,[265] the 2007 season included various negative milestones: the most losses in a single year (9);[266] two of the ten worst losses in program history (38–0 losses to both Michigan[267] and USC);[268] and the first 6-game losing streak for home games.[269] The Naval Academy recorded their first win over the Irish since 1963, breaking Notre Dame's NCAA-record 43-game win streak.[270] In 2008, the Irish started 4–1, but completed the regular season with a 6–6 record,[271] including a 24–23 home loss to Syracuse, the first time that Notre Dame had fallen to an eight-loss team.[272] Quarterback Jimmy Clausen was the team's star player, completing over 60% of his passes.[273][274] Despite speculation the university might fire Weis, it was announced he would remain head coach.[275] Weis's Notre Dame squad ended the season breaking the Irish's NCAA bowl losing streak by beating Hawaii, 49–21, in the Hawaii Bowl.[276] Weis entered the 2009 season with the expectation from the Notre Dame administration that his team would be in position to compete for a BCS Bowl berth.[277] Notre Dame started the first part of the season 4–2, with close losses to Michigan and USC. Sitting at 6–2, however, Notre Dame lost to Navy for the second time in three years,[278] which became the first loss in a four-game losing streak to finish the season. Quarterback Jimmy Clausen and wide receiver Golden Tate would forgo their senior seasons and enter the NFL Draft.[279] Weis was fired on November 30, 2009.[280] According to Weis' buyout, he was to be paid $6 million then $2.05 million annually until the contract ran out in December 2015 for a total of about $19 million.[281] During that time, Weis made more money annually not to coach the Irish than his successor, Brian Kelly, made to coach the team.[282] On December 10, 2009, Cincinnati head coach Brian Kelly became the 31st head coach of the Fighting Irish after leading the Bearcats to a 12–0 record and BCS bowl-game berth, but he left the team before the bowl game.[283][284] Kelly's hiring surprised very few as he was a northern Irish Catholic who was considered one of college football's rising stars.[285] In his first season, Kelly led the Fighting Irish to an 8–5 record.[286] Tragedy struck early in the season when Declan Sullivan, a junior working for the athletic department, died while filming a practice on a scissor lift in dangerously high winds.[287] Dayne Crist started the season at quarterback but was injured for a second consecutive year, this time in the Tulsa game, which the Irish lost.[288] Kelly turned to freshman quarterback Tommy Rees, who led the Irish to victories in the last three games against #15 Utah, Army in Yankee Stadium, and breaking an eight-year losing streak to USC in the LA Coliseum. Kelly guided the Irish to a 33–17 win over Miami (FL) in the 2010 Sun Bowl to finish 2010 with an 8–5 record.[289] With senior wideout Michael Floyd returning for his senior season and an outstanding recruiting class that included several highly touted defensive linemen,[290] Kelly and the Irish looked to improve on their 8–5 record from the prior year. However, an early season upset to a Skip Holtz-led South Florida team and a last-second loss to Michigan in Ann Arbor, games in which the Irish committed 10 total turnovers, left the Irish at 0–2 to start the season. The Irish bounced back to beat #15 Michigan State and had two 4-game winning streaks, with the only loss during that stretch coming at the hands of USC.[291] The Irish also broke Navy's 2-game winning streak over Notre Dame. Notre Dame lost 18–14 to Florida State in the 2011 Champs Sports Bowl, concluding the 2011 campaign with an 8–5 record overall, identical to the 2010 season.[292] In the team's losses, multiple turnovers from the quarterback position were often the culprit, and as a whole turnovers at critical times in the game often derailed potential Irish comebacks. On September 12, 2012, during the football program's 125th season, Notre Dame announced that it would leave the Big East Conference for the Atlantic Coast Conference, excluding the football and hockey programs.[293] This move became official on July 1, 2013. While the Fighting Irish football team remained an FBS independent, it agreed to play five games per season against ACC teams starting with the 2014 football season. In return, Notre Dame became eligible to participate in the ACC's sub-BCS level bowl arrangements.[294] The 2012 season was another entry in historic third seasons for Notre Dame head coaches. The Irish began the season 7–0, including wins over ranked rivals in Michigan State, Michigan, and Stanford. The game against the Cardinal required a goal-line stand against running back Stepfan Taylor in overtime to preserve the win for the Irish.[295] The season's signature win came at #8 Oklahoma with ESPN's College GameDay in town. On November 18, after a loss by #1 Oregon, Notre Dame became ranked #1 in the nation in both the AP and Coaches' polls after reaching 11–0 during the regular season for the first time since 1993, also ranking #1 in the BCS standings for the first time in the 14-year history of the selection system.[296] After defeating USC on November 24,[297] Notre Dame concluded its first 12–0 regular season, and the Irish were soon formally named to appear in the BCS National Championship Game for the first time. In that game, on January 7, 2013, the Irish lost to Alabama 42–14.[298] The strength of the 2012 Fighting Irish was its defense, captained by senior leader Manti Te'o, who broke the school record for interceptions by a linebacker with 7 and finished second to Johnny Manziel in Heisman Trophy voting. Coming off the previous year's national title game appearance, the Fighting Irish were dealt a blow when 2012 starting quarterback, Everett Golson, was suspended from the University due to an academic violation.[299] Senior Tommy Rees then took over. Notre Dame's 2013 season ended with a record of 9–4,[300] a victory over Rutgers in the Pinstripe Bowl, and a #20 AP poll ranking.[301][302] The 2014 season started off with 6 straight victories and a #5 national ranking heading into a showdown with #2 Florida State in Tallahassee, Florida. FSU won that game 31–27, on a controversial offensive pass interference call that brought back a last-second Notre Dame touchdown. The Fighting Irish bounced back with a win against Navy before dropping their final 4 games of the season. They did win the Music City Bowl by defeating the LSU Tigers and finished the season at an 8–5 record.[303] The 2015 Fighting Irish began its season with another new offensive coordinator, Mike Sanford Jr.[304] Led for most of the year by sophomore quarterback DeShone Kizer, the Irish had fourteen plays of over 50 yards during the season, which was a school record, including two touchdowns of over 90 yards (a 91-yard touchdown run by C. J. Prosise and a 98-yard touchdown run by Josh Adams). The Irish only had two in the previous 126 years of Notre Dame football. They finished the regular season averaging 34 points per game, including a 62-point effort against UMass, the most points in a game since 1996. The Irish began the season 10–1 and were in position for a College Football Playoff appearance, but lost a last-second game to Stanford to finish with a 10–2 record and a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.[305] Star linebacker Jaylon Smith was injured early in the game which became a loss to Ohio State.[306] The 2016 season ended with a 4–8 record, Brian Kelly's worst win–loss record at Notre Dame. The tone for the season was set early, with a heartbreaking double overtime loss to Texas in the season opener.[307] Just 4 games into the season, Brian Kelly fired defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder.[308] At the end of the season, starting quarterback DeShone Kizer declared for the NFL Draft[309] and backup quarterback Malik Zaire announced he would be transferring in the winter after graduation.[310][311] Amidst speculation that Kelly's job was in jeopardy and that Kelly was looking to leave Notre Dame, athletics director Jack Swarbrick announced that Kelly would return for the 2017 season.[312] The 2017 season was one of Kelly's strongest seasons at ND. An early one-point loss to #2 Georgia was the only blemish on an 8-1 start, keyed by a 49-14 blowout over rival USC. The tough running of running back Josh Adams behind an experienced and talented offensive line, which included future top-10 picks Quenton Nelson and Mike McGlinchey and won the Joe Moore Award as the best offensive line in that nation, allowed Notre Dame to string together 6 consecutive 20+ point victories. However, when #3 Notre Dame visited #7 Miami in South Florida on November 7, an embarrassing 41-8 loss effectively ended the Irish hopes of a playoff run. They ended the season with a win over LSU in the Music City Bowl.[313] The Irish opened the 2018 season at home against Michigan and won, 24–17.[314] After benching quarterback Brandon Wimbush in favor of Ian Book, the Irish then won the remainder of their regular season games, including victories over #7 Stanford, #24 Virginia Tech, #12 Syracuse, and Northwestern.[315] This led to Notre Dame's first undefeated regular season since 2012.[316] They were ranked #3 in the nation by the College Football Playoff committee and selected to play in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Cotton Bowl against Clemson.[317] Notre Dame's undefeated streak came to an end after losing to the eventual national champions 30–3 to finish the season at 12–1.[318] Kelly was named AP Coach of the Year and Home Depot Coach of the Year for the 2018 season.[319][320] Kelly and the Fighting Irish started off the 2019 season with a #9 ranking in the AP Poll. Notre Dame won their first two games before dropping a 23–17 result to #3 Georgia. Notre Dame won their next three games before dropping a 45–14 game to #19 Michigan. Notre Dame closed out the regular season with victories in their last five games, followed by a win in the Camping World Bowl 33–9 over Iowa State.[321] In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the cancellation of regular season scheduled games, Notre Dame joined the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in football for a single season in 2020 and played a full slate of conference matches.[322] The Irish won all ten of their games, including a mid-season contest against perennial conference power and top-ranked Clemson. The Fighting Irish defeated the Tigers 47–40 in double overtime. However, Clemson defeated the Irish in a rematch in the ACC Championship Game 34–10. Notre Dame qualified for the College Football Playoff as the #4 seed.[323] In the College Football Playoff Semifinals against Alabama at the Rose Bowl, Notre Dame lost 31–14 to finish with a 10–2 record.[324] In what would become Kelly's final season as head coach in 2021, the Fighting Irish were ranked #9 to begin the season, but struggled in their first two games, beating Florida State 41–38 and Toledo 32–29. Following a 24–13 loss to #7 Cincinnati, Kelly helped lead the Fighting Irish to a seven-game winning streak to finish the regular season 11–1 and earn a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.[325] On November 29, 2021, Kelly resigned as Notre Dame head coach to accept a ten-year, $95 million contract offer to become head coach at LSU.[326] In so doing, Kelly became the first Irish head coach since Thomas A. Barry in 1907 to leave Notre Dame for another coaching job.[327] Kelly left the Irish as the program's all-time winningest head coach.[328][329] On December 3, 2021, Notre Dame's defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman was promoted to the head coaching position to replace Brian Kelly, becoming the 32nd head coach in program history.[330][331] The second African American head coach in the history of the Irish football program, Freeman signed a five-year contract worth $4 million annually excluding incentives.[332][333][334] Freeman took control immediately, coaching the Irish in their Fiesta Bowl loss to Oklahoma State.[335][336] Freeman opened the 2022 season with losses to Ohio State (his alma mater) and Marshall, thus becoming first head coach in Notre Dame history to start his tenure with three losses.[337] He gained his first win the following week against the California.[338][339] Freeman's Irish would go on to finish the regular season ranked 19th with a record of 8-4, including an upset win over No. 5 Clemson.[340][341] They were awarded a berth in the Gator Bowl where they defeated South Carolina 45–38.[342][343] For the 2023 season, Freeman guided the Notre Dame program to a 10-win season. Safety Xavier Watts received the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for college football's best defensive player and the team earned victories over #17 Duke, #10 USC and #19 Oregon State in the Sun Bowl. Notre Dame finished the year ranked #14 in the final AP Top 25. Freeman and the Fighting Irish held their first home game of the 2024 season against the Northern Illinois Huskies as the #5 ranked team in the AP Top 25 and as a 28.5-point favorite to win. They fell to the Huskies 16-14, throwing two interceptions and giving up two blocked field goals. It was the second early-season home loss for the Irish against a heavy underdog in three years (following the 2022 loss to Marshall), was the first-ever win by a Mid-American Conference football program against a top 5 team, the first-ever Huskie win against a top 10 team, and one of the largest point-spread upsets in modern college football.[344] The Irish went on to complete the regular season 11-1 and hosted a home game in the first year of the expanded college football playoffs, in which they beat the Indiana Hoosiers 27-17. They then beat the Georgia Bulldogs on Jan 2, by a score of 23-10. Notre Dame's 11 claimed national championships are: Following its appearance in the 1925 Rose Bowl, Notre Dame did not play in a post-season game for 44 consecutive years (1925–1968), including after many of the team's most successful seasons from the Rockne era in the 1920s and the Leahy era in the 1940s. The university's stated reasons for its self-imposed hiatus were that bowl games were \"glorified exhibitions\" that played no part in national championship selections and that they extended the season too far to the detriment of players' academic progress.[351] Notre Dame has made 874 appearances in the Associated Press poll over 71 seasons. Notre Dame has spent 591 weeks in the Top 10, 318 weeks in the Top 5, and 98 weeks at No. 1.[352] Notre Dame has finished the year ranked in the final Associated Press poll of the season 56 times: Notre Dame has participated in eleven \"No. 1 vs No. 2\" matchups since the AP poll began in 1936.[369] They have a record of 5–3–2 in such games, with a 4–1–1 record as the No. 1 team in such matchups. Here's a list of such games: Notre Dame has played in many regular season games that have been widely regarded by both the media[370] and sports historians[371] as historic or famous games. Notre Dame has played in many games labeled \"Game of the Century\" as well as several No. 1 vs No. 2 matchups.[372] Notre Dame has also played in several bowl games considered by many sportswriters to be among the best bowl games played:[384][385] Notre Dame's all-time record after the 2023 season stands at 948 wins, 338 losses, and 42 ties. † George O'Leary did not coach a single practice or game, resigning five days after being hired for misrepresenting his academic credentials.‡ Kent Baer served as interim head coach for one game at the 2004 Insight Bowl after Tyrone Willingham was fired. Notre Dame has made 44 bowl game appearances, winning 22 and losing 21, with one game vacated.[387] After an initial appearance in a postseason contest in the 1925 Rose Bowl, the Fighting Irish refused to participate in bowl games for more than four decades;[388] Sports Illustrated's Dan Jenkins speculated that Notre Dame might have gone to as many as twenty bowl games during the self-imposed forty-five-year hiatus.[388] From 1994 to the 2006 football seasons, Notre Dame lost 9 consecutive bowl games, tied with Northwestern for the most in NCAA history. That streak ended with a 49–21 win over Hawaii in the 2008 Hawaii Bowl. In the process, Notre Dame scored its highest point total in postseason play. The record of 9 consecutive bowl losses was later tied by Northwestern in 2011, then that streak was snapped a year later. The Fighting Irish suffered in a multi-decade skid with an 0-8 record in BCS/Playoff games and an 0-10 record in major bowl games between 1994 and 2025. The losing streak would come to an end when Notre Dame beat Georgia in the 2025 Sugar Bowl. Between 2009 and 2016, and resuming again in 2018, Notre Dame has hosted an annual off-site home football game known as the Shamrock Series. The series promotes Notre Dame's athletic and academic brand, and has brought the Fighting Irish to San Antonio, New York, Greater Washington, D.C., Chicago, Indianapolis, Boston and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Notre Dame has yet to lose a game in the Shamrock Series with a record of 11-0 (including the later-vacated win over Arizona State in the 2013 season). Prior to the 2012 season, Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick announced at a news conference of plans to continue the series through 2016. He confirmed after his news conference that New York is expected to fall in that rotation and then continue to be the one consistently repeating venue for Shamrock Series games. The Shamrock Series was not held in 2017, but resumed in 2018. One of the unique aspects of the Shamrock Series is its inclusion of academic and other non-football activities in the area of that year's host city the days and hours leading up to the game, which include pep rallies, drummers' circles, and academic lectures.[389][390][391] The Shamrock Series held in Las Vegas was the largest crowd for a college athletic event in Nevada history.[392] Seven Notre Dame football players have won the Heisman Trophy, which ties them with the University of Oklahoma for the second most by any university. (Ohio State also has seven trophies that were won by only six players, while USC has the most winners with eight). Heisman voting:[394] 50 former Notre Dame players and 6 coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, located in Atlanta, Georgia.[364] Notre Dame leads all universities in players inducted. Notre Dame's home jersey is navy blue with white numerals, gold outlining, and a small interlocking \"ND\" logo on each sleeve. The away jersey is white with navy numerals, gold outlining, and the interlocking \"ND\" on the sleeves. These uniforms were introduced by Lou Holtz in 1986 and retained during the tenures of Bob Davie (1997-2001) and Tyrone Willingham (2002–04). In 2005, Charlie Weis removed the interlocking \"ND\" from the sleeves, replacing it with the player's number, the first time the Irish had worn \"TV numbers\" since 1986, when they were located on the shoulders. These jerseys remained throughout Weis' tenure. When Brian Kelly succeeded Weis in 2010, the interlocking \"ND\" returned to the sleeves, and it has remained since. The Irish traditionally have not worn player names on their jerseys during regular season games, but they were included during the coaching tenures of Dan Devine (1975–80) and Gerry Faust (1981-85). When Notre Dame appeared in the 1970 Cotton Bowl Classic, its first bowl game in 45 years, Ara Parseghian had player names placed on the backs of the jerseys, a tradition which was retained for four other bowl appearances under Parseghian. Holtz, Davie, Willingham and Weis (in the 2006 Fiesta Bowl and 2007 Sugar Bowl) did not adhere to this tradition for bowl games they coached, but it returned under Weis for the 2008 Hawaii Bowl and has been continued by Kelly and Marcus Freeman. Notre Dame's helmets are solid gold with gray facemasks, the gold being emblematic of the University's famed \"Golden Dome\". Notre Dame's tradition for the team's student managers to spray-paint the team's helmets prior to each game ended in 2011 when the football equipment staff, along with Notre Dame Athletics Director Jack Swarbrick and head coach Brian Kelly outsourced the painting process to Hydro Graphics Inc. During Gerry Faust's tenure (1981–85), Notre Dame's blue jerseys switched from the traditional navy (although Notre Dame wore green jerseys full-time between the 1977 game vs. USC and the end of the 1980 season) to royal blue with gold and white stripes on the sleeves (they also wore a green jersey with sleeve stripes for the 1983 game vs. USC). The navy blue jerseys returned for the 1984 season (the Irish wore a redesigned white jersey during the 1983 Liberty Bowl without sleeve stripes and navy blue names and numbers which was carried over to 1984). No uniform numbers have been retired by Notre Dame. Upon being issued a number, each player is given a card that lists some of the more famous players who have worn that particular number. Number 3 is perhaps the most famous number in Irish football history, having been worn by Ralph Guglielmi, George Izo, Daryle Lamonica, Coley O'Brien, Joe Montana, Michael Floyd, Rick Mirer and Ron Powlus, among others.[425] Number 5 is also notable, as it is the only number to be worn by one of the Four Horsemen (Elmer Layden) a Heisman Trophy Winner (Paul Hornung) and a National Title winning Quarterback (Terry Hanratty).[425] Number 7 has been worn by such Irish greats as 1964 Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte, 1970 Heisman runner-up Joe Theismann, Steve Beuerlein, Jimmy Clausen and Jarious Jackson.[425] In 2011, both Michigan and Notre Dame wore throwback uniforms in their game against each other. For each Shamrock Series game, Notre Dame wears specially-designed helmets, jerseys, and pants. Champion supplied football jerseys for Notre Dame for over 50 years until the Irish switched to Adidas in 2001. On July 1, 2014, the Notre Dame athletic department began wearing uniforms and footwear supplied by Under Armour. Over the years, Notre Dame has occasionally worn green instead of blue as its home jersey, sometimes adopting the jersey for an entire season – or more – at a time. Notre Dame is confirmed to have worn green as far back as 1926 against Penn State, and in 1942 they officially became an alternate color for the team.[426] Currently, Notre Dame reserves its green jerseys for special occasions. Sometimes on such occasions, the Irish will take the field for warmups dressed in blue, only to switch to green when they go back to the locker room before kickoff. This tradition was started by Dan Devine in 1977 before the USC game. Notre Dame has also been known to switch jerseys at halftime, as during the 1985 USC game and in the loss to Nile Kinnick-led Iowa in 1939, although this was to help avoid confusion between their navy uniforms and Iowa's black ones. The current design of the jersey is kelly green with gold numbers and white outlining. For the 2006 Army game, Coach Charlie Weis broke out the green jerseys as a reward to his senior players and in an attempt to end the string of losses by the Irish when wearing green. Notre Dame wore throwback green jerseys in 2007 against USC in honor of the 30th anniversary of the 1977 National Championship team but lost the game 38-0.[427] As of 2023, Notre Dame's record in green is 42-15-1, going back to 1975.[426] On at least one occasion (1992 Sugar Bowl) Notre Dame has worn an away variant of the jersey, a white jersey with green numbers. Notre Dame Stadium is the home football stadium for the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. Located on the southeast part of the university's campus in Notre Dame, Indiana and with a seating capacity of 77,622, Notre Dame Stadium is one of the most renowned venues in college football.[428] The Sporting News ranks Notre Dame Stadium as #2 on its list of \"College Football Cathedrals\".[429] and the stadium experience evokes a more traditional feel. Notre Dame Stadium is used for football-related activities and for Commencement (since 2010). Notre Dame Stadium had no permanent lighting until the expansion project in 1997. NBC paid for the lighting as they have televised all Notre Dame home football games since 1991. On April 12, 2014, it was announced during the annual Blue-Gold Spring Game that a FieldTurf synthetic surface would replace the grass field after the 2014 Commencement Weekend. In November 2014 the University of Notre Dame embarked on a $400 million stadium expansion called the Crossroads Campus Project, which was completed in time for the 2017 season. Cartier Field was the original playing field of the Fighting Irish. In 1930, it was replaced by Notre Dame Stadium, due to the growing popularity of ND football. Known by fans as \"The Gug\" (pronounced \"goog\"), The Guglielmino Athletics Complex is Notre Dame's football headquarters. The Gug houses the offices for all team staff members, an auditorium, a weight room, a training room, the equipment room, the practice locker room, a brand new napping room, and various other spaces for the football team to utilize. The complex was underwritten by Don F. Guglielmino and his family. The indoor practice facility has a synthetic turf field and a video board at midfield for replay and graphics. On the second level of the facility, there is a 1,600-square-foot recruiting lounge. In all, the facility totals 111,400 square feet, and the ceiling is 95 feet at its peak. Notre Dame has rivalries with several universities. Although the Fighting Irish competes as an Independent, they play a national schedule that includes annual or otherwise regularly scheduled rivalry games. Army, Boston College, Michigan, Michigan State, Navy, Northwestern, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Stanford, and USC are among Notre Dame's rivals. Notre Dame and the Miami Hurricanes first met during the 1955 college football season.[430] They met three times during the 1960s (1960, 1965, and 1967) and proceeded to play each other annually from 1971 to 1990 (except in 1986). Notre Dame consistently dominated the series in the 1970s, but in the 1980s, Miami began to dominate as the once docile rivalry intensified significantly. Both teams were national contenders in the later part of the decade, and both teams cost each other at least one national championship. Hostilities were fueled when the Hurricanes routed the Fighting Irish in the 1985 season finale 58–7, with Miami widely accused of running up the score in the second half. The rivalry gained national attention and both teams played their most famous games from 1988 to 1990. The game known as Catholics vs. Convicts in South Bend was won by the Fighting Irish 31–30. The following year, Miami ended Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak with a 27–10 victory. The rivalry ended after the Fighting Irish dashed #2 Miami's hopes for a repeat national championship with a 29–20 victory in South Bend. Notre Dame dropped Miami from its schedule due to the intensified rivalry. The two teams are next scheduled to meet during a yet to specified date during the 2025 season. They also will play each other in yet to be scheduled dates in the 2031, 2032, 2034, and 2037 seasons.[431] The first meeting between Notre Dame and Michigan was in 1887, the first official football game in Notre Dame's history.[432] The two schools have met 44 times in total, the latest matchup in 2019. Through the 2021 season, the two schools are both in the top five in all-time Division I winning percentage, with Notre Dame fourth and Michigan third Meeting for the first time in 1897, Notre Dame and Michigan State play for the Megaphone Trophy. The two schools played in 64 out of 70 seasons from 1948 to 2017, but have not met since. Their next scheduled game is in 2026.[433] Notable games in the series include the 1966 \"Game of the Century\". Through the 2023 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 48–28–1 and the trophy series 33–27–1.[434] Navy and Notre Dame played 93 games without interruption from 1927 to 2019. Notre Dame had a 43-game win streak during this time frame, the longest streak by one team over another in Division I-A football, which ended in 2007.[435] While the 2020 contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the series resumed in 2021. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the series 83–13–1.[436] USC is Notre Dame's primary rival, and the schools compete annually for the Jeweled Shillelagh. The rivalry has produced 39 national championships,[437]: 113–118 15 Heisman Trophy winners,[438] and 184 Consensus All-Americans through the 2021 season.[439] It is considered one of the most prominent rivalries in college football,[440][441][442][443] and has been called the greatest rivalry not dictated by conference affiliation or geography.[444] The teams have played each other annually since 1926, except from 1943 to 1945 and 2020. Notable games in the series include the 1977 \"Green Jersey\" game and the 2005 \"Bush Push\" game. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 50–37–5 and the trophy series 35–30–3.[445] Due to its long and storied history, Notre Dame football boasts many traditions unique to Notre Dame. Some of these are: Since the NFL began drafting players in 1936, 495 Notre Dame football players have been selected by NFL teams. Additionally, Notre Dame has had 65 players selected in the first round of the NFL draft, including five overall number one picks. Of the 46 Super Bowls competed, as of 2012, only 14 teams have won the event without an Irish player on the roster.[457] Looking at both participating team rosters, there have only been five Super Bowls that did not feature at least one former Notre Dame player on either team's roster – Denver vs. Atlanta, 1999; Dallas vs. Buffalo, 1994; Washington vs. Denver, 1988; Dallas vs. Denver, 1978; and Baltimore vs. Dallas, 1971.[457] Eleven former players have won multiple Super Bowls: Mark Bavaro, Rocky Bleier, Nick Buoniconti, Eric Dorsey, Dave Duerson, David Givens, Terry Hanratty, Bob Kuechenberg, Joe Montana, Steve Sylvester and Justin Tuck.[457] 13 former Notre Dame players, plus 1 non-player alumnus, have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, tying it for first with USC among all college football programs.[458][459] *McNally graduated from St. John's (MN), but started his career at Notre Dame and is listed as a hall of famer under both schools in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[460] The Fighting Irish are the only team, professional or collegiate, to have all their games broadcast nationally on the radio and their home games on television.[462] Notre Dame famously left the College Football Association, a consortium that administered television broadcast rights on behalf of over 64 schools, in 1990, in order to establish its own broadcasting deal with NBC. From 1968 to 2007, Westwood One served as the official radio partner for the Irish, broadcasting their games for 40 consecutive years.[463] Until the 2006 Air Force game, Notre Dame had a record 169 consecutive games broadcast nationally on either NBC, ABC, ESPN, or CBS.[464] The 2006 ND vs. Air Force game was broadcast on CSTV, a college sports channel owned by CBS who had an exclusive contract with the Mountain West Conference, of which Air Force is a member. Radio rights to the Fighting Irish are held by Skyview Networks, who began distributing the broadcasts as part of a multi-sport arrangement in 2020.[465] NBC has been televising Notre Dame Home football games since the 1991 season.[9] In addition to TV broadcasts, NBC also maintains several dedicated websites to ND football and Notre Dame Central,[466] which provides complete coverage, full game replays and commentary of the Notre Dame team. NBC's television contract with Notre Dame was renewed in April 2013 and was set to continue through the 2025 football season,[467] before another contract renewal was made in 2023. NBC is now set to be the home of Notre Dame football through the 2029 season. It also aired football games on NBC's streaming service Peacock started in the 2021 season, with the home opener on September 11, 2021, against Toledo aired exclusively on the streaming service.[468][469] Internationally Sky Sports has been covering Notre Dame Football home games in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Germany since 2018 as a result of Comcast's takeover of Sky Although the Notre Dame football program is not a full member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), it has an agreement to play an average of five ACC schools per season. In return Notre Dame has access to the non-College Football Playoff ACC bowl line-up.[470][471] Notre Dame utilizes a format of six home games in South Bend, five away games, and one major metropolitan area neutral site \"Shamrock Series\" home game for scheduling.[389] This includes preserving traditional yearly rivalries with USC, Stanford, and Navy,[472] five rotating ACC opponents (two away ACC games will coincide in even years with away games at Navy and three away ACC games will coincide in odd years with home games against Navy),[473] two home and home series (one home game and one away game), one one-time opponent home game, and the traveling \"Shamrock Series\" home game.[474][475] TBA: 1 additional ACC away game will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC home game and 1 additional non-ACC home game will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 3 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled.

He was the second-oldest of the original Osmond Brothers singers and the fourth oldest of the nine Osmond children. Starting in 1958, Wayne and three of his brothers (Alan, Merrill, and Jay in their respective age orders) began singing as a barbershop quartet. They were later discovered in 1961 by Jay Emerson Williams, the father of Andy Williams, at a performance at Disneyland which was being filmed for the Disneyland After Dark episode of Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. In 1962, the four Osmonds were cast over a seven-year period on NBC's The Andy Williams Show, a musical variety program. Each of these four Osmond brothers were also cast in nine episodes of the 1963–1964 ABC Western series, The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, with Wayne in the role of young Leviticus Kissel. In the band's rock formation, Wayne played guitar[2] and occasionally drums,[3] among many other instruments, with Wayne recalling shortly before his death that he learned to play eight instruments during his time with the band.[4] Wayne was found to have perfect pitch.[2] His last intended appearance with the Osmonds was October 13, 2018, although he made an additional appearance with his brothers a year later as a birthday present to their sister, Marie.[5] Osmond was born in Ogden, Utah, the fourth son out of nine children born to Olive May (née Davis; 1925–2004) and George Virl Osmond (1917–2007). Like the rest of his family, he was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. On December 13, 1974, Wayne married Kathlyn White from Bountiful, Utah, a former Miss Davis County Fair and Miss Utah of 1974. They had five children, three daughters and two sons. In the 1990s, Osmond moved to Branson, Missouri. In 1997, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor, which was successfully treated, at the expense of his hearing; the treatment damaged his cochlea, leaving Wayne nearly deaf. A stroke in 2012 left him unable to play guitar.[2] He held a pilot's license, from which he earned the nickname \"Wings,\" and continued to fly aircraft until mobility issues prevented him from doing so near the end of his life.[4] Osmond suffered another, more serious stroke and died in a hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah on January 1, 2025, at the age of 73, surrounded by his wife and children.[3][4] This article about an American musician is a stub.

                "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Wayne Osmond, a singer, guitarist and founding member of the million-selling family act The Osmonds, who were known for such 1970s teen hits as “One Bad Apple,” “Yo-Yo” and “Down By the Lazy River,” has died. He was 73. Sibling Merrill Osmond posted on his Facebook page that Wayne died this week at a Salt Lake City hospital after suffering a “massive stroke.” “I’ve never known a man that had more humility. A man with absolutely no guile,” Merrill wrote. “An individual that was quick to forgive and had the ability to show unconditional love to everyone he ever met.” Wayne Osmond was the fourth oldest of nine children raised in a Mormon household in Ogden, Utah, and the second oldest among the musical performers. The siblings' career began in the 1950s when Wayne, Alan, Merrill and Jay sang as a barbershop quartet. Their popularity grew in the 1960s after being supported by singer Andy Williams, and they peaked as a quintet in the early 1970s, with younger brother Donny Osmond the breakout star. “One Bad Apple” and other songs were often compared to the music of The Osmonds' contemporaries, the Jackson 5, and Donny was positioned as the white counterpart to the Jacksons' lead singer, Michael Jackson. The Osmonds' popularity faded by the mid-1970s, although Donny and Marie Osmond both enjoyed successful careers as solo performers and as a brother-sister duo. In the 1980s, Wayne Osmond regrouped with Alan, Merrill and Jay as a country act and had a handful of hits, including “I Think About Your Lovin.‘” But in the mid-1990s he was diagnosed with a brain tumor and lost much of his hearing from the surgery and treatment. A stroke in 2012 left him unable to play guitar. “I’ve had a wonderful life. And you know, being able to hear is not all that it’s cracked up to be, it really isn’t,” he told the Deseret News in 2018. “My favorite thing now is to take care of my yard. I turn my hearing aids off, deaf as a doorknob, tune everything out, it’s really joyful.” Wayne Osmond married Kathlyn White in 1974. They had five children. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

He was part of two national championships as a backup in 2021 and 2022. Beck was born on November 19, 2002, in Jacksonville, Florida.[1] He attended Mandarin High School and was named the 2018 Florida Mr. Football after throwing for 3,546 yards and 30 touchdowns as a junior.[2][3] Beck led Mandarin to a Florida State Championship, throwing for five touchdowns in the championship game.[4] As a senior, he recorded 1,843 yards and 20 touchdowns on 278 completions.[2] As a sophomore he committed to play baseball at Florida, before deciding to focus on football, committing to Alabama for the sport.[5] Beck would ultimately decommit from Alabama and commit to play college football at the University of Georgia.[6] As a freshman, Beck entered the season as the backup in a quarterback room including Stetson Bennett, JT Daniels, and D'Wan Mathis.

The redshirt sophomore took the helm as UGA's QB after Carson Beck got injured during the first half of the SEC Championship Game in December. Beck was attempting a deep shot into the end zone when he was hit from behind by a Texas defensive lineman in the middle of his throwing motion. RELATED: What to know about Georgia-Notre Dame CFP matchup in Sugar Bowl Beck has since had surgery on his right elbow to repair his ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) and is recovering while he also declared for the 2025 NFL Draft. But despite the shakeup during the SEC Championship, Stockton took to the field in the second half of the game -- adding a bit of spark for the Dawgs. Georgia had only scored three points in the first half, and the Dawgs went on to win the SEC Championship in overtime against Texas, 22-19. During the game, Stockton turned in a mostly efficient stewardship of the Bulldogs' offense, completing 13 of his 16 pass attempts for 135 yards with an interception. The numbers weren't eye-popping, but the Dawgs found an offensive rhythm in the second half with Stockton under center. After the SEC Championship victory, Smart had emotional praise for Stockton. \"The kid's a winner. This kid's special,\" Smart said. \"He's a winner.\" Smart elaborated in postgame comments, calling Stockton a \"phenomenal leader\" and saying that he felt like \"everybody rose up around him\" in the second half. As the Dawgs gear up for Thursday's rescheduled Sugar Bowl against Notre Dame, fans await how the new man in charge will fare in this highly anticipated game.

Gunner was elevated to the role of starting quarterback for the University of Georgia after quarterback Carson Beck suffered an elbow injury during the SEC Championship Game against Texas on December 7. Beck underwent season-ending surgery and has since declared himself for the 2025 NFL Draft. Born in Tiger, Georgia, roughly 75 miles from University of Georgia’s campus in Athens, Gunner grew up a massive fan of the Bulldogs. A son of two collegiate athletes — his father, Rob, played football at Georgia Southern and his mom, Sherri, played basketball at Erskine College — he has athletics in his blood. “The number one thing for Gunner is he’s known our community, and especially our family, his friends, and those people closest to him, believe in him,” Rob told UGASports in a story published on Sunday, December 29. “We’ve always loved him and want the best for him. This is something that he’s worked for [and] something he’s dreamed of.” Rob added, “You look at pictures of your kid, and they’re throwing the ball in your backyard and dreaming of being the starting quarterback at the University of Georgia. It has happened. It is unreal.” For more about Gunner’s story, keep reading. Gunner’s great-grandfather, V.D. Stockton, served in World War II. A newspaper at the time referred to him as “Gunner Stockton.” According to The Athletic, Gunner’s parents liked the nickname so much that they decided to give it to their son. In October 2010, Gunner’s grandfather, Lawrence Stockton, died shortly after leaving Georgia’s 34-31 overtime loss to the Florida Gators at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field. According to ESPN, Lawrence walked back to a tailgating area after the game and collapsed and died from a heart attack. He was 63 years old. Gunner shares a close bond with his oldest sister, Georgia, his only sibling. The duo shared a cute moment when Georgia was dropped off at Presbyterian College in Clinton, South Carolina in the summer of 2019. “PC officially has a baller on campus,” Gunner shared via Instagram. “I know it’s gonna be hard for you not seeing me everyday but hopefully it won’t be too hard for ya 😂. You are the best. Love you more than you know ❤️” In 2021, Gunner and Georgia took in a Bulldogs game from the sidelines of Sanford Stadium. “Pretty good way to end the week,” Gunner shared via Instagram alongside a picture of him and his sister. Gunner, Georgia and the rest of their extended family spent the holidays together in 2024, just days before the Bulldogs’ game against Notre Dame in the 2025 Sugar Bowl, as evidenced by a series of photos shared by Georgia via Instagram. Gunner originally committed to play quarterback at SEC rival South Carolina. However, he announced his decommitment in January 2021. “After much discussion and prayer with my family, I have decided to decommit from The University of South Carolina,” Gunner said in a statement at the time. “Back in August, I made the decision to commit to the University, program, and staff. A lot has changed since that time, and I feel that I should reevaluate my situation.” Gunner’s decision came on the heels of Will Muschamp, the head coach to which Gunner committed, being fired. The quarterback announced his commitment to the University of Georgia later that month. If you see a 1984 Ford F-150 driving around Georgia’s campus, that’s just the team’s starting quarterback. “It was literally broke down, parked up at their house and wouldn’t crank,” his father, Rob, told the Athens Banner-Herald in a story published on Friday, December 27. “He wanted to get it running, so me and him tinkered with it.” You have successfully subscribed.

                "title": "Fort Liberty - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Fort Liberty, formerly Fort Bragg, is a military installation of the United States Army in North Carolina, and is one of the largest military installations in the world by population, with over 52,000 military personnel.[2] The military reservation is located within Cumberland and Hoke counties,[3] and borders the incorporated city and communities of Fayetteville, Spring Lake, and Southern Pines. Fort Liberty covers over 251 square miles (650 km2). It is the home of the Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and is the headquarters[4] of the United States Army Special Operations Command, which oversees the U.S. Army 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) and 75th Ranger Regiment. It is also home to the 82nd Airborne Division, U.S. Army Forces Command, U.S. Army Reserve Command, and Womack Army Medical Center. Fort Liberty maintains two airfields: Pope Field, where the United States Air Force stations global airlift and special operations assets as well as the Air Force Combat Control School, and Simmons Army Airfield, where Army aviation units support the needs of airborne and special operations forces on post. Camp Bragg was established in 1918 as an artillery training ground. The Chief of Field Artillery, General William J. Snow, was seeking an area having suitable terrain, adequate water, rail facilities, and a climate suitable for year-round training, and he decided that the area now known as Fort Liberty met all of the desired criteria.[5] Camp Bragg was named for Braxton Bragg, a former U.S. Army artillery commander and West Point graduate who later fought for the Confederacy during the American Civil War.[6] The aim was for six artillery brigades to be stationed there and $6,000,000 was spent on the land and cantonments.[7] There was an airfield on the camp used by aircraft and balloons for artillery spotters. The airfield was named Pope Field on 1 April 1919, in honor of First Lieutenant Harley H. Pope,[7] an airman who was killed while flying nearby. The work on the camp was finished on 1 November 1919.[7] The original plan for six brigades was abandoned after World War I ended[7] and once demobilization had started. The artillerymen, and their equipment and material from Camp McClellan, Alabama, were moved to Camp Bragg and testing began on long-range weapons that were a product of the war.[7] The six artillery brigades were reduced to two cantonments and a garrison was to be built for Army troops as well as a National Guard training center.[7] In early 1921 two field artillery units, the 13th and 17th Field Artillery Brigades, began training at Camp Bragg. The same year, the Long Street Church and six acres of property were acquired for the reservation.[8] The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.[9] Due to the post-war cutbacks, the camp was nearly closed for good when the War Department issued orders to close the camp on 7 August 1921. Brig. Gen. Albert J. Bowley was commander at the camp and after much campaigning, and getting the Secretary of War to visit the camp, the closing order was canceled on 16 September 1921. The Field Artillery Board was transferred to Camp Bragg on 1 February 1922.[citation needed] Camp Bragg was renamed Fort Bragg, to signify becoming a permanent Army post, on 30 September 1922. From 1923 to 1924 permanent structures were constructed on Fort Bragg, including four barracks.[7] By 1940, the year after World War II started, the population of Fort Bragg was 5,400 and by the following year had reached 67,000. Various units trained at Fort Bragg during World War II, including the 9th Infantry Division, 2nd Armored Division, 82nd Airborne Division, 100th Infantry Division, and various field artillery groups. The population reached a peak of 159,000 during the war years.[10] Following World War II, the 82nd Airborne Division was permanently stationed at Fort Bragg, the only large unit there for some time. In July 1951, the XVIII Airborne Corps was reactivated at Fort Bragg. Fort Bragg became a center for unconventional warfare, with the creation of the Psychological Warfare Center in April 1952, followed by the 10th Special Forces Group.[11] In 1961, the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was activated at Fort Bragg, with the mission of training counter-insurgency forces in Southeast Asia. Also in 1961, the \"Iron Mike\" statue, a tribute to all Airborne soldiers, past, present, and future was dedicated. In early 1962 the 326 Army Security Agency Company, de-activated after the Korean War, was reactivated at Fort Bragg under XVIIIth Corps. In August of that year, an operational contingent of that Company was relocated to Homestead AFB Florida, due to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Circa 1963, that contingent was reassigned to the newly created USASA 6th Field Station.[12] More than 200,000 young men underwent basic combat training here during the period 1966–70. At the peak of the Vietnam War in 1968, Fort Bragg's military population rose to 57,840. In June 1972, the 1st Corps Support Command arrived at Fort Bragg.[13] In the 1980s, there was a series of deployments of tenant units to the Caribbean, first to Grenada in 1983, Honduras in 1988, and to Panama in 1989. The 5th Special Forces Group departed Fort Bragg in the late 1980s.[14] In 1990, the XVIII Airborne Corps and the 82nd Airborne Division deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. In the mid- and late 1990s, there was increased modernization of the facilities in Fort Bragg. The World War II wooden barracks were largely removed, a new main post exchange was built, and Devers Elementary School was opened, along with several other projects.[15] As a result of campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, the units on Fort Liberty have seen a sizeable increase to their operations tempo (OPTEMPO), with units conducting two, three, or even four or more deployments to combat zones. As directed by law, and in accordance with the recommendations of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, Fort McPherson, Georgia, closed and U.S. Army Forces Command and U.S. Army Reserve Command relocated to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. A new FORSCOM/U.S. Army Reserve Command Headquarters facility completed construction at Fort Bragg in June 2011. Forces Command hosted 24 June 2011, an Army \"Casing of the Colors\" ceremony on Fort McPherson and an \"uncasing of colors ceremony\" on 1 August 2011, at Fort Bragg. On 1 March 2011, Pope Field, the former Pope Air Force Base, was absorbed into Fort Bragg.[citation needed] On 1 January 2021, the United States Senate passed a veto override of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. This new law mandated Congress to establish a commission for the renaming of Department of Defense properties named after Confederate leaders. In March 2022, the commission published a list of 87 potential names for nine Army installations, including Fort Bragg, named after Confederate General Braxton Bragg.[16][17] In May 2022, the commission officially recommended that Bragg be renamed Fort Liberty. The commission further gave the Pentagon until October to accept the name change; Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin did so on 6 October 2022. Secretary Austin stated in the memorandum accepting the name change: \"In the words of Admiral Michelle M. Howard, the Naming Commission's chair, the commission's goal was to inspire Service members and military communities 'with names or values that have meaning.' The Department's implementation of the Commission's recommendations will do just that - and will give proud new names that are rooted in their local communities and that honor American heroes whose valor, courage, and patriotism exemplify the very best of the United States military.\"[18] Fort Liberty is the only installation not to be named after a specific person or people.[citation needed] According to a memorandum published by the Pentagon, the new name changes would cost the Department of Defense $62.5 million. In particular, the change to Fort Liberty would cost the Department of Defense $6,374,230, making it the most expensive name change.[19][20] In accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act, the local garrison had until early 2024 to complete the name change.[21] On 2 June 2023, Fort Liberty officially adopted its new name in a public ceremony.[22] The major commands at the installation are the United States Army Forces Command, the United States Army Reserve Command, and the United States Army Special Operations Command. Several airborne and special operations units of the United States Army are stationed at Fort Liberty, notably the 82nd Airborne Division, the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne), and the Delta Force. The latter is controlled by the Joint Special Operations Command, based at Pope Field within Fort Liberty. Fort Liberty is at 35°8'21\" north, 78°59'57\" west (35.139064, −78.999143).[23] According to the United States Census Bureau, the post has a total area of 19.0 square miles (49.2 km2), of which 19.0 square miles (49.1 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) of it is water. The total area is 0.32% water. Kiest, Simmons, Boundary Line, McFayden, Hurley and Holland lakes are intensively managed to maintain fish populations. Croatan, Quail, Deer Pen, Overhills, Big Muddy, Little Muddy, Texas, MacArthur, Smith, Mott, and Lindsay lakes are managed, but are not normally treated or restocked since their fish populations are respectable and are maintained naturally.[24] A 1.1 MW floating solar plant with a 2 MW battery was installed on Big Muddy lake for $36 million.[25][26] Fort Liberty is the only locality where the endangered Saint Francis' satyr butterfly (Neonympha mitchellii francisci) is known to occur. St. Francis' satyr is found in wetland habitats dominated by graminoids and sedges, such as abandoned beaver dams or along streams with beavers. Fort Bragg fever, a bacterial zoonotic disease, has been named after it, in reference to an outbreak in 1942. In 1990, the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker came under the protection of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This caused a tremendous problem for Fort Liberty, where many of these birds lived. Training stopped, ranges were closed, and troops were temporarily moved to other installations for training. The Army and the conservationists eventually came to an agreement, which put in place training restrictions around the woodpeckers' habitat. White stripes were painted on trees to indicate the location of the habitats, and restrictions limited the scope and duration of training that could take place within 200 feet (61 m) of these locations. Today, the clusters of woodpeckers has more than doubled in size (200 to 493), and many of the training restrictions have been lifted.[27] As of the census[1] of 2000, there were 29,183 people, 4,315 households, and 4,215 families residing on the base. The population density was 1,540.0 inhabitants per square mile (594.6/km2). There were 4,420 housing units at an average density of 233.3 per square mile (90.1/km2). Fort Bragg was not recorded as a census-designated place for the 2010 census. In 2000, the racial makeup of the base was 58.1% European American, 25.3% African-American, 1.2% Native American, 1.8% Asian, 0.9% Pacific Islander, 8.3% from other races, and 4.4% from two or more races. 15.8% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. In 2000, there were 4,315 households, out of which 85.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 88.9% were married couples living together, 7.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 2.3% were non-families. 2.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 0.0% were someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.72, and the average family size was 3.74. The age distribution in 2000 was 25.8% under the age of 18, 40.9% from 18 to 24, 32.3% from 25 to 44, 1.1% from 45 to 64, and 0.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females, there were 217.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 293.5 males. All of these statistics are typical for military bases.[citation needed] The median income for a household on the base at the 2000 census was $30,106, and the median income for a family was $29,836. 10.0% of the population and 9.6% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 11.4% of those under the age of 18 and 0.0% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line. Corvias-managed housing under IMCOM is attracting national attention because of reports of lead contamination, black mold, and asbestos from base residents.[29] Task & Purpose confirmed on 12 February 2024 that trash pickup at the installation is not occurring on a timely basis;[30] the waste management contractor was terminated for not emptying the waste dumpsters on a timely basis; the garrison command stated that trash pickup at \"barracks, child development centers, dining facilities and medical facilities\" is now getting higher priority.[31] Dependents of staff are educated by Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools for K–8.[32] For high school students attend local public schools based on what county they reside in:[32] Cumberland County Schools for Cumberland County residents,[35] and Hoke County Schools for Hoke County residents.[36] The Cumberland County parts of the military reservation are assigned to EE Smith High School.[3] The Linden Oaks area, within Harnett County, is in Harnett County Schools, and is assigned to Overhills High School.[3] Actress Martha Raye is buried on Fort Liberty in commemoration of her work with the USO during World War II and Vietnam.[55]",

                "content": "Fort Bragg is a city along the North Coast of California in Mendocino County. The city is 24 miles (39 km) west of Willits,[12] at an elevation of 85 feet (26 m).[4] Its population was 6,983 at the 2020 census. Fort Bragg is a tourist destination because of its views of the Pacific Ocean. Among its notable points of interest are Glass Beach and the California Western Railroad (popularly known as the \"Skunk Train\"). A California Historical Landmark,[11] Fort Bragg was founded in 1857 prior to the American Civil War as a military garrison rather than a fortification.[13] It was named after army officer Braxton Bragg, who at the time had served the U.S. in the Mexican–American War (and would later serve in the Confederate Army during the Civil War). The city was later incorporated in 1889.[1] The area now known as Fort Bragg was home to Native Americans since before Western expansion, most of whom belong to the Pomo tribe.[14] They historically were hunter-gatherers who lived along the northern coast of California.[15] In 1855, an exploration party from the Bureau of Indian Affairs visited the area looking for a site on which to establish a reservation; in the spring of 1856, the Mendocino Indian Reservation was established at Noyo. It was 25,000 acres (100 km2) in size, and its boundary extended north from what is now Simpson Lane to Abalobadiah Creek and east from the Pacific Ocean to Bald Hill. In the summer of 1857, 1st Lt. Horatio G. Gibson, then serving at the Presidio of San Francisco, established a military post on the reservation, approximately one and a half miles (2.4 km) north of the Noyo River, and named it for his former commanding officer Capt. Braxton Bragg, who later became a General in the Army of the Confederacy.[16] Gibson and Company M, 3rd Artillery, left Fort Bragg in January 1859 to be replaced by Company D, 6th Infantry, which stayed for two years and continued to build up the post. In June 1862, Company D, 2nd California Infantry, were ordered to garrison the post and remained until 1864. In October of that year, the Fort Bragg garrison was loaded aboard the steamer Panama and completed the evacuation and abandonment of Mendocino County's first military post. The Mendocino Indian Reservation was discontinued in March 1866, and the land was opened for settlement three years later. The last remaining building of the Fort Bragg military post is located at 430 North Franklin Street. It may have been the Quartermaster's storehouse and commissary or surgeon's quarters or hospital. The approximate boundaries of the fort extend from the south side of Laurel, east from the railroad depot to the carriage road behind Franklin, down the lane to a point 100 feet (30 m) south of Redwood Avenue, west on Redwood to just beyond the Georgia-Pacific Corporation company offices, then north to connect with the Laurel Street border at the railroad station. By 1867, the reservation and military outpost at Fort Bragg were abandoned. By 1869, small lumber mills were being built at the mouth of every creek. Ranches were settled. By 1873, Fort Bragg had an established lumber port at Noyo. In 1869, after the fort was abandoned, and the land surveyed by the U.S. Geological Survey, the land of the reservation was returned to the public and offered for sale at $1.25 per acre to settlers. In 1885, C. R. Johnson who, with partners Calvin Stewart and James Hunter, had been operating a sawmill in Mill Creek on the Ten Mile River, moved their mill machinery to Fort Bragg to take advantage of the harbor for shipping. The company incorporated in 1885 as the Fort Bragg Redwood Company. In 1891, after merging with the Noyo River Lumber Company, it was renamed the Union Lumber Company. The Fort Bragg Railroad was founded to haul logs to the mill. The first rails were run up Pudding Creek and, in 1887, reached Glen Blair. A San Francisco streetcar was purchased to carry loggers and their families on Sunday excursions to the woods. Fort Bragg was incorporated in 1889 with C. R. Johnson as its first mayor, and Calvin Stewart drafting its plat maps. Built in Fort Bragg for Horace Weller in 1886, the Weller House is the oldest existing house in the city. Since 1999, this house, converted into a hotel, has welcomed tourists from around the world. The Union Lumber Company was incorporated in 1891 by absorbing some of the smaller lumber companies in the area. Some of the new company lands were in the Noyo River watershed east of Fort Bragg making removal of logs difficult by rail, unless a tunnel was built. Johnson hired experienced Chinese tunnel builders from San Francisco. After completion of the tunnel, most of the Chinese settled in Fort Bragg and Mendocino. A six-walled Chinese town was built at Redwood and McPherson. Older residents say that eventually most of the Chinese children moved elsewhere. In 1901, the Union Lumber Company incorporated the National Steamship Company to carry lumber, passengers and supplies. As the only link to manufactured creature comforts, staples like sugar and coffee were delivered by steamship. In 1905, the California Western Railroad and Navigation Company was established and plans were pushed to get the rail line all the way to Willits, where train connections to the Northwestern Pacific would link to San Francisco. The 1906 earthquake resulted in a fire that threatened the saw mill and the city. Within Fort Bragg itself, all brick buildings were damaged. Only two were not destroyed completely. Many frame houses were knocked off their piers. The fire downtown burned the entire block bordered by Franklin, Redwood and McPherson Streets, plus the west side of Franklin. The west Franklin block burned down to approximately one half a block beyond the intersection of Redwood and Franklin. After the earthquake, most downtown reconstruction was completed within 12 months. Coincidentally, the earthquake brought real prosperity to Fort Bragg as the mills furnished lumber to rebuild San Francisco, and the lumber ships returning from San Francisco were ballasted with bricks used for rebuilding Fort Bragg.[17] With the new prosperity, the rail line to Willits was completed and in 1912 the first tourists came to Fort Bragg. By 1916 Fort Bragg had become a popular place to visit—and to settle. Commercial fishing has also played an important role in the economic base of the community. Once a major commercial fishing port, Fort Bragg was well known for producing quality fish products that were distributed to major metropolitan markets. In 1916, the Union Lumber Company built a railroad from the South Fork of Ten Mile River to Fort Bragg,[18] where its operations were.[19] By 1929, what lumber could not be sent by rail to the company mill at Fort Bragg was handled by the mill at Pudding Creek owned by the Glen Blair Redwood Company.[19][20] The Union Lumber Company established its own post office on Churchman Creek to service its logging camps there in 1931,[21] but it operated only until 1932.[12] The railroad was removed in 1945 as rail transport was replaced by haulage by truck; nowadays it is a recreational corridor in MacKerricher State Park.[18] In 1969, the Union Lumber Company was purchased by Boise Cascade and John Quincy and it became Georgia Pacific Lumber Company in 1973. The mill was shut down in 2002 after being identified as a nonperforming asset. The 400-acre (1.6 km2) piece of property within the city limits takes up almost the entire coastline of Fort Bragg, including Fort Bragg Landing. As of July 2017[update], the mill site was sold and is undergoing redevelopment, including removal of toxic waste. In 2015, members of the California Legislative Black Caucus petitioned Fort Bragg to change its name due to Braxton Bragg's links to the Confederacy.[16] The mayor of Fort Bragg at that time, Lindy Peters, stated that there was not really much interest among the residents, and cited the costs that every company and institution in the area would have to pay to change all of the addresses.[22] There were further calls to change the name in June 2020, following the murder of George Floyd. On June 22, the Fort Bragg City Council considered whether to put a proposition on the November ballot asking its residents if they would like a name change,[23] but decided instead to form an ad hoc committee to explore options for the city's name.[24] They estimated the cost to change the name would be $271,000. Among the alternative options that were explored was to simply rededicate the city to a different notable person named Bragg.[24] By late January 2022, the commission announced that it could not come to a consensus on a name change.[25] Meanwhile in 2022, the active military fort of the same name in North Carolina was renamed to Fort Liberty. Fort Bragg has an average elevation of 85 ft (26 m) above sea level.[4] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), of which 2.7 square miles (7.0 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2), comprising 1.44%, is water.[citation needed] Due to Fort Bragg's location on the shore of the Pacific Ocean, the city has very mild weather throughout the year compared to most inland places. Most of the rainfall occurs from November to April with some occasional drizzle or light showers during the summer. Fog and low overcast are common, especially during the night and early morning hours. The climate experienced in Fort Bragg is classified as warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csb).[26] Although formally known as dry-summer subtropical,[26] Fort Bragg has very cool summer temperatures for a subtropical climate type. Its Mediterranean classification is due to the dry summers with very little rainfall.[27] Freezing temperatures occur on an average of 11.6 days annually. The record maximum temperature was 91 °F (32.8 °C) on October 5, 1987. The record minimum temperature was 18 °F (−7.8 °C) on December 21, 1990, and in 2016 there was an ice storm.[citation needed] Winter days always remain well above freezing. The coldest day on record was 39 °F (4 °C) in 1972 and the coolest day of the year reached 44 °F (7 °C) on average during the 1991–2020 normals.[28] The warmest night of the year averages a moderate 58 °F (14 °C) and no overnight low has ever been recorded above 66 °F (19 °C).[28] Average annual precipitation is 43.16 inches (1,096 mm). The wettest “rain year” on record was from July 1997 to June 1998 with at least 79.13 inches (2,009.9 mm) and the driest from July 1976 to June 1977 with 14.90 inches (378.5 mm).[28] The maximum precipitation in one month was 27.02 inches (686.3 mm) in January 1909. The maximum 24-hour rainfall was 4.72 inches (119.9 mm) on February 6, 2015.[28] Snow has only ever been recorded on three days, the largest recorded total being 3 inches (7.6 cm) on December 6, 1913, the second being 2 inches (5.1 cm) on January 6, 1907, and the third being 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) on January 12, 1907.[28] The extreme maritime effect of the Pacific Ocean is demonstrated by the fact that Fort Bragg has uniquely cool summers for cities on the 39th parallel north, both domestically and internationally. To illustrate the extremes of Fort Bragg, coastal climates with warmer summers than the city are found as far north as on the 66th latitude on the Bothnia Bay in between Sweden and Finland, a net latitudinal anomaly of 27 degrees. That is nearly one-third of the distance between the poles and the equator. In places some miles inland, consistently hotter summer temperatures are found, a phenomenon typical of the Californian coastline. As of the census[31] of 2010, there were 7,273 people, 2,812 households, and 1,644 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,644.7 inhabitants per square mile (1,021.1/km2). There were 3,051 housing units at an average density of 1,119.1 per square mile (432.1/km2). The ethnic makeup of the city was 74.8% Caucasian, 16.0% Mestizo,[a] 4.6% multiethnic, 2.2% Native American, 1.5% Asian American, 0.7% African American, and 0.2% Pacific Islands American. 31.8% of the population identified as Hispanic or Latino of any ethnicity. There were 2,840 households, out of which 30.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.4% were married couples living together, 13.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 42.1% were non-families. 35.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 15.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.35 and the average family size was 3.04. In the city, the population was spread out, with 24.6% under the age of 18, 9.3% from 18 to 24, 30.0% from 25 to 44, 22.2% from 45 to 64, and 13.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 100.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 99.3 males. The median income for a household in the city was $28,539, and the median income for a family was $36,000. Males had a median income of $25,833 versus $23,287 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,832. About 11.9% of families and 20.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 26.5% of those under age 18 and 10.6% of those age 65 or over. A trail that extends over a mile along the coast from the Noyo River Headlands north along the bluff over the Pacific Ocean reaches the former Georgia-Pacific mill site.[33] It is accessible from Highway 1 (Main Street) at Cypress Street. The trail includes information signage about the area's pre-European residents, the Pomo Native Americans. The trail leads to a visitor center maintained by the Noyo Center for Marine Science. Offshore along the trail are rocks where harbor seals haul out and other sealife may be viewed.[citation needed] Built in 1892, the Guest House Museum served as lodging for the owners of Union Lumber Company, VIP visitors, and potential buyers of ULCO products. It has become the headquarters of the Fort Bragg-Mendocino Coast Historical Society, where visitors learn about the history of the area.[34] The Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens is a 47-acre (190,000 m2) garden along the coastal bluffs.[35] Glass Beach is on the edge of Fort Bragg, along the ocean. In the early 20th century, Fort Bragg residents threw their household garbage over cliffs owned by the Union Lumber Company onto what is now Glass Beach, discarding glass, appliances, and even vehicles.[36] Locals referred to it as \"The Dumps\".[37] Fires were lit to reduce the size of the trash pile.[37] In 1967, city leaders closed the area and various cleanup programs were brought on through the years to fix the damage. Over several decades the pounding waves wore down the discarded glass into the small, smooth pieces called sea glass that coat the beach. The area along the beach at the end of Elm Street is now visited by tourists.[38] Fort Bragg is the western terminus of the California Western Railroad (otherwise known locally as the \"Skunk Train\"). Steam passenger service was started in 1904, and then extended in 1911 through the Coast Redwood forests to the city of Willits, 40 miles (64 km) inland. Started in 1885 as a rail route for moving large logs to the mills, the Skunk Train now offers scenic tours through the redwoods. In 1925 self-powered, yellow \"Skunk\" rail cars were inaugurated. The little trains were quickly nicknamed for their original gas engines, which prompted folks to say, \"You can smell 'em before you can see 'em.\" In 1965 the line reintroduced summer steam passenger service between Fort Bragg and Willits with Baldwin-built steam locomotives Nos. 45 and 46, calling the colorful train \"The Super Skunk\". That train was discontinued in 2001 due to owing to the embargo of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad, then revived in September 2006 as a special event train, currently the most popular attraction for tourists in the Fort Bragg region. No.45 and 46 are now out of service waiting for overhaul. Trains continue with diesel locomotives used to power excursion trains from Fort Bragg as far as Northspur, the CWR's midpoint, on selected weekends from summer to early autumn. [citation needed] State Route 1 (the Pacific Coast Highway) passes through Fort Bragg, concurrent with and signed as Main Street within the city limits. It travels on two bridges while doing so, the Noyo River Bridge and the Pudding Creek Bridge. State Route 20's western terminus is in Fort Bragg at its junction with Route 1, traveling east it runs parallel and several miles south of the Skunk Train's route to Willits and beyond to Nevada City before terminating at a junction with Interstate 80.[citation needed] The city also has a small private airport, with an 1,850 ft × 60 ft (564 m × 18 m) paved runway.[39][40] In the state legislature, Fort Bragg is in the 2nd Senate District, represented by Democrat Mike McGuire,[41] and the 2nd Assembly District, represented by Democrat Chris Rogers.[42] Federally, Fort Bragg is in California's 2nd congressional district, represented by Democrat Jared Huffman.[43] Children in Fort Bragg are served by the Fort Bragg Unified School District,[44] typically attending Fort Bragg High School, Fort Bragg Middle School, Dana Gray Elementary and Redwood Elementary during their time in the public school system, though several alternative schools are available as well. In 2006, Three Rivers Learning Center, a charter school under the jurisdiction of Mattole Valley Charter School opened.[45] Several major movies have been filmed in and around Fort Bragg, including: As a youth, Ken Sasaki noted that his home, Ōtsuchi, Japan, is located on the same latitude as Fort Bragg and in 2001 he contacted then-Mayor Lindy Peters and visited with a delegation to open discussions on a sister city agreement. Fort Bragg students visited Otsuchi in 2002 and the Sister City Proclamation was solidified in 2005 by Mayor Dave Turner. Other student exchanges were held in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010 and the next exchange was planned for July 2011.[60][61] Following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami devastation of Otsuchi, Mayor Turner ordered that city flags be flown at half staff until the end of March to honor the thousands of lives lost.[62]",

In Fort Bragg, boat owners were quickly trying to move their boats out of the harbor. Steve Wells, a spokesman for the Fort Bragg Fire Department, said shaking in the coastal town was minimal and no damage had been reported. But far more revealing, and relevant to American politics, was the story’s opening anecdote, in which Trump offered to pay for the funeral of a Mexican American soldier who was murdered at Fort Bragg. Farther west on the Pacific Coast, a group called Change Our Name Fort Bragg has waged a similar effort, arguing that the town’s name honors a slave-holding Confederate general named Braxton Bragg and commemorates a military installation “that facilitated genocide, ethnic cleansing, and involuntary servitude of the indigenous people,” according to the group’s Facebook page.

                "content": "Anthony Edwards (born August 5, 2001), nicknamed \"Ant-Man\" or simply \"Ant\",[1] is an American professional basketball player for the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A shooting guard, he played college basketball for the Georgia Bulldogs and was selected with the first overall pick by the Timberwolves in the 2020 NBA draft. He was named an All-Star during the 2022–23 and 2023–24 seasons. Edwards also won a gold medal on the 2024 U.S. Olympic team. Edwards finished his high school career at Holy Spirit Preparatory School in his hometown of Atlanta, Georgia, where he was rated a consensus five-star recruit and one of the best players in the 2019 class by major recruiting services. As a senior, he earned McDonald's All-American and USA Today All-USA first team honors. He committed to play college basketball for Georgia, becoming the highest-rated recruit to do so, and was named SEC Freshman of the Year after his freshman season with the team. Edwards spent his early life in Oakland City, Atlanta, Georgia.[2] When he was three years old, he was given the nickname \"Ant-Man\" by his father. For much of his childhood, Edwards played football in the running back, quarterback, and cornerback positions.[3] He played youth football for the Atlanta Vikings and became one of the best Pop Warner running backs in the country by age 10.[3][4][5] Edwards switched his focus to basketball because he \"thought it looked more fun\" after watching his brothers play the sport. He often played basketball with his brothers at their grandmother's house. Entering ninth grade, he began training with Justin Holland, a former college basketball player for Liberty and an Atlanta-based basketball trainer.[3] Due to his success with the Atlanta Xpress 15-under Amateur Athletic Union team, Edwards was considered a four-star recruit by Rivals in 2016.[6] He began playing high school basketball for Therrell High School in Atlanta as a member of the 2019 class.[7] In early January 2017, Edwards transferred to Holy Spirit Preparatory School in Atlanta and reclassified to the 2020 class. He made the move in an effort to improve his academic performance, since Holy Spirit Preparatory had \"small class sizes and support to help that.\"[8] In March 2018, Edwards helped Holy Spirit Preparatory defeat The Heritage School for the Georgia Independent School Association (GISA) Class AAA state championship.[9] He reclassified back to the 2019 class in November 2018 after seeing academic improvement.[7][10] As a result, Edwards rose to become the number one recruit in the Top247 rankings by recruiting website 247Sports.[11] In his senior season, his team finished as GISA Class AAA runners-up to The Heritage School, despite 27 points from Edwards.[12] At the end of the season, he was averaging 29 points, nine rebounds, and two assists per game.[13] Edwards garnered USA Today All-USA first team recognition.[13][14] He played in the McDonald's All-American Game and Jordan Brand Classic in March and April 2019, respectively.[15][16] By consensus among major recruiting services 247Sports, ESPN, and Rivals, Edwards was rated a five-star recruit, top-five player, and the top shooting guard in the 2019 class.[17][18][19] On February 11, 2019, he committed to play college basketball for Georgia, becoming the program's best recruit in the modern recruiting era.[20][21] Edwards chose the Bulldogs over offers from Florida State, Kansas, Kentucky, and North Carolina.[7] He was drawn to Georgia because two of his favorite players, Dwyane Wade and Victor Oladipo, had been coached in college by head coach Tom Crean.[22] Sources: On November 5, 2019, Edwards made his debut for the Georgia Bulldogs, recording 24 points, 9 rebounds, and 4 steals in a 91–72 win over Western Carolina. It was the most points by a Georgia freshman debutant since Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Dominique Wilkins in 1979.[23] On November 26, he scored a season-high 37 points, including 33 in the second half, and posted six rebounds, four steals, and three blocks in a 93–85 loss to third-ranked Michigan State at the Maui Invitational. Edwards became the first Georgia freshman to score at least 37 points in a game since Jacky Dorsey in 1975.[24] In his final game at the tournament, he led all scorers with 24 points and made the game-winning shot against NCAA Division II team Chaminade.[25] On February 1, 2020, Edwards recorded 29 points and 15 rebounds, both game-highs, in a 63–48 victory over Texas A&M.[26] In his next game, he led all scorers with 32 points in an 81–75 loss to Florida.[27] On February 26, Edwards scored 36 points and collected seven rebounds, four assists and four steals, in a 94–90 overtime defeat to South Carolina.[28] As a freshman, he averaged 19.1 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game.[29] Edwards was the top scorer on his team and among freshmen nationally. He earned second-team All-SEC and SEC Freshman of the Year honors.[30] Edwards collected SEC Freshman of the Week accolades four times during the season, the most in program history.[31] He was also one of five finalists for the Jerry West Award, which recognizes the top collegiate shooting guard.[32] On March 20, 2020, in the spring of his freshman year, Edwards declared for the 2020 NBA draft as one of the most touted prospects in his class. He signed with an agent, forgoing his remaining college basketball eligibility.[33] The 2020 NBA draft was delayed by five months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2020, the Minnesota Timberwolves selected Edwards as the No. 1 overall pick on draft night. On December 23, 2020, he made his NBA debut, putting up 15 points, 4 rebounds, and 4 assists in 25 minutes, in a 111–101 win against the Detroit Pistons.[34] On March 18, 2021, Edwards scored a then career-high 42 points, along with 7 rebounds and 3 assists, in a game against the Phoenix Suns, becoming the third-youngest player to score 40+ points in NBA history.[35] After the season, he finished second in Rookie of the Year voting and was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.[36][37] On November 10, 2021, Edwards scored a then career-high 48 points on 7 three-pointers in a 123–110 loss to the Golden State Warriors.[38] On January 25, 2022, in a 109–107 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, he became the first player in NBA history to record a stat line of at least 40 points, 9 rebounds, 3 blocks, 3 steals, and 5 three-pointers in a single game; he joined Carmelo Anthony as the only players to score 40 points without an assist at 20 years old or younger.[39][40] On April 7, 2022, Edwards scored a career-high 49 points in a 127–121 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[41] In his playoff debut on April 16, 2022, he logged 36 points and 6 assists in a 130–117 Game 1 win over the Memphis Grizzlies in the opening round of the 2022 NBA playoffs.[42] Minnesota lost to Memphis despite Edwards's 30-point, 5-rebound, 5-assist, 2-steal and 2-block outing in the 114–106 close-out loss in Game 6.[43] On January 21, 2023, Edwards scored a season-high 44 points, including a season-high 8 three-pointers, along with 6 rebounds, 4 assists, 3 steals, and 3 blocks in a 113–104 win over the Houston Rockets.[44] On February 10, 2023, he was named an All-Star for the first time in his career as a reserve. Edwards and De'Aaron Fox were announced as injury replacements for injured stars Stephen Curry and Zion Williamson.[45] On April 9, in the final game of the 2022–23 season, Edwards recorded 26 points, 13 rebounds, 4 assists, 4 steals, and 4 blocks to help lead the Timberwolves to a 113–108 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, earning the eight seed in the Western Conference play-in tournament.[46] In Game 2 of the Timberwolves' first-round playoff series against the Denver Nuggets, Edwards put up 41 points in a 122–113 loss. His 41 points also set a Timberwolves franchise record for the most points scored in a playoff game, surpassing Sam Cassell's previous record of 40.[47] On April 21, in Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, Edwards scored 36 points in a 120–111 loss. He joined Kobe Bryant with the second-most 30-point NBA playoff games before turning 22 years old.[48] In Game 4, Edwards had 34 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 3 blocks and scored a crucial 3-pointer to lead the Timberwolves to a 114–108 overtime win.[49] In Game 5, the Timberwolves were eliminated from the playoffs by the eventual NBA champion Nuggets despite 29 points, 8 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2 blocks by Edwards. With the Nuggets leading 112–109 in the final seconds of the game, Edwards missed a game-tying three-pointer at the buzzer.[50] Edwards changed his jersey number from #1 to #5 before the 2023–24 season.[51] On November 13, 2023, he was named the NBA Western Conference Player of the Week for the first time in his career after leading Minnesota to an undefeated week (4–0) with averages of 31.3 points, 6.3 rebounds, 6.8 assists and 2.0 steals.[52] On January 27, 2024, Edwards recorded 32 points, 6 rebounds and a career-high 12 assists in a 113–112 loss against the San Antonio Spurs.[53] On February 1, Edwards was named to his second All-Star Game as a Western Conference reserve.[54] On April 9, Edwards put up a career-high 51 points in a 130–121 win over the Washington Wizards.[55] At the season's end, Edwards was named to the All-NBA Second Team for the first time in his career.[56] In Game 4 of the first round of the playoffs against Phoenix, Edwards scored 31 of his 40 points in the second half, along with nine rebounds and six assists in a 122–116 win to close out the series. It was the Timberwolves' first playoff series win in 20 years. He also surpassed Kevin Garnett for the most 30-point playoff games in Timberwolves franchise history, with eight.[57][58] In Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals, Edwards scored a then playoff career-high and franchise postseason-record 43 points in a 106–99 victory over the Nuggets. He joined Kobe Bryant as the only players with consecutive 40-point games at age 22 or younger in NBA postseason history.[59] In Game 4 of the Western Conference Semifinals, Edwards scored a playoff career-high and franchise postseason-record 44 points, along with five rebounds and five assists, in a 115–107 loss to the Nuggets.[60] In Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals, Edwards posted a near triple-double with 29 points, 10 rebounds and 9 assists in a 105–100 victory over the Dallas Mavericks.[61] Minnesota would go on to lose to Dallas in five games despite Edwards 28-point, 9-rebound and 6-assist outing in a 124–103 close-out loss in Game 5.[62] Edwards was a member of the United States national team that competed in the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup. He started all eight games and was selected in the All-FIBA World Cup Team. He was the leading scorer for the U.S., averaging 18.9 points per game. The team finished in fourth place.[63] He was named to the 2024 Olympic team.[64] He helped Team USA win the gold medal, and in six games, he averaged 12.8 points, 2.8 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.3 steals per game while shooting 58% from the field.[65] Edwards plays primarily as a shooting guard. He’s listed at 6’4” (1.93 meters) and weighs 225lb (102 kilograms).[66] He’s known for his explosive athleticism, often going viral for his thunderous poster dunks, including one over John Collins that the NBA named the 2023-24 Dunk of the Year.[67] The Ringer called him \"a preposterous athlete with a nice jumper and better instincts\".[68] He’s drawn comparisons to a young Michael Jordan for his ability to finish around the rim. “They have a lot of the same mannerisms. The moves, the fadeaway, the athleticism, the poster dunks… that same kind of work ethic, that same kind of ‘I don’t sleep at all at night because I’m ready to play, I’m ready to hoop,” according to teammate Mike Conley.[69] Despite pre-draft concerns that he was a limited long-range scorer, Edwards has developed an efficient, high-volume three-point shot — shooting 36% on almost eight attempts per game.[66] In 2024, he became the youngest player in NBA history to make 800 threes.[70] His stout frame, lateral speed and competitiveness have helped transform his reputation on the defensive end — Team USA coach Steve Kerr called his on-ball defense “amazing” during the FIBA World Cup.[71] His ability to match up against both long wings and shifty guards has garnered praise from Timberwolves head coach Chris Finch. Edwards himself believes his defense is “overlooked” by the national media.[72] Edwards's daughter, Aislynn, was born March 2024.[74] Edwards left the Timberwolves’ March 1 game against the Sacramento Kings at halftime to be with Aislynn's mother, Shannon, as their child was born. Edwards's mother, Yvette, and grandmother, Shirley, both died of cancer during an eight-month span in 2015, when he was in eighth grade. He has worn the No. 5 basketball jersey since high school to honor them, as they both died on the fifth day of the month.[75] After their deaths, Edwards was raised by his sister, Antoinette, and brother, Antoine, who shared legal custody of him.[76] In high school, Edwards frequently worked as an instructor at youth camps.[77] He intended to major in marketing while attending the University of Georgia.[78] During his childhood, Edwards also starred in baseball, often acting as his team's fourth or fifth hitter in the batting order. He has jokingly said he was very skilled at a variety of sports when he was younger. He owns two dogs and has also expressed his affinity for lions, although he does not believe he has the requisite space to care for one.[79] Edwards made his acting debut in the 2022 sports drama film Hustle.[80] In September 2022, Edwards posted a video to Instagram story referring to a group of shirtless men standing on a sidewalk with a homophobic slur.[81] The NBA fined him $40,000 for using \"offensive and derogatory language.\"[82] In December 2023, Paige Jordae, an Instagram model, accused Edwards of impregnating her and then offering her $100,000 to get an abortion.[83] Jordae posted screenshots of text messages with Edwards.[84] The screenshots, which were initially posted to Jordae's Instagram story, also included a screenshot of a pending wire transfer of $100,000 on November 27, 2023.[85] Edwards responded, \"I am handling my personal matters privately and will not be commenting on them any further at this time.\"[86]",

                "content": "Anthony Charles Edwards (born July 19, 1962)[2] is an American actor, director, and producer.[3][4] He played Dr. Mark Greene on the first eight seasons of ER, for which he received a Golden Globe Award and six Screen Actors Guild Awards, and was nominated for four consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards. He has appeared in various films and television series, including Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Top Gun, Zodiac, Gotcha!, Miracle Mile, Revenge of the Nerds, Planes, Northern Exposure, and Designated Survivor. Edwards was born in Santa Barbara, California, the son of Erika Kem Edwards Plack (née Weber), an artist/landscape painter, and Peter Edwards, an architect to whom he was one of five children[5][6] His maternal grandfather was designer Kem Weber. He is partly of German and Irish descent. He received a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in England and studied theatre at the University of Southern California.[7] Edward's early film appearances included roles in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), Revenge of the Nerds (1984), Gotcha! (1985) and The Sure Thing (1985). It was Edwards's role as LTJG Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw alongside Tom Cruise in the 1986 film Top Gun that brought his first widespread public acknowledgement.[8] His character, who died in an aviation accident, was among the most prominent and popular in the film. Scenes with him and his film family (played by Meg Ryan and Aaron and Adam Weis) were later reprised as flashbacks in the 2022 sequel Top Gun: Maverick. Edwards's roles following Top Gun included Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise (1987), Miracle Mile (1988), Downtown (1990), Pet Sematary Two (1992) and The Client (1994). He also had a recurring role on the TV series Northern Exposure from 1992 to 1993. His best-known role is as Dr. Mark Greene on the long-running TV series ER, from the series premiere in 1994 to the end of the eighth season in 2002. The series also afforded Edwards his first opportunity to direct. Edwards's desire to pursue directing led to his request to be written out of the series. He reportedly earned $35 million for three seasons on ER, which made him one of television's highest-paid actors.[9] Edwards received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for ER. He won a Golden Globe Award For Best Performance by an Actor-In a TV Series after being nominated four times and he has two Screen Actor's Guild Awards.[10] In 2008, Edwards returned to ER to reprise his role as Dr. Greene (in flashback scenes, where he treats the dying son of character Catherine Banfield) for one episode during its 15th and final season.[11] Following ER, he took some time to raise his children, appreciating the privilege that his ER salary provided.[12] His film appearances following ER included the science fiction film Thunderbirds (2004), the psychological thriller film The Forgotten (2004) and the crime thriller film Zodiac (2007). In 2010, Edwards appeared in the movie Motherhood, which set a record for the biggest bomb in British cinema history by garnering £88 on 11 tickets on opening weekend.[13] Motherhood did not fare much better in the United States, earning $93,388 in three weeks of release.[14] At the time, he said he took the role because \"it seemed like a very organic and real thing. It really kind of reminded me of what the dynamic in a family is like.\"[15] Edwards reunited with Val Kilmer, another actor from Top Gun, when he voiced one of the fighter jets in the Disneytoon Studios film Planes (2013).[16] In 2018, Edwards was cast in the recurring role in the third season of Netflix's Designated Survivor as Mars Harper, the President's Chief of Staff.[17] In 2020, he served as an executive producer of the film adaptation of Martin Moran's The Tricky Part.[4] In 2022, Edwards was cast as Alan Reed in Netflix's docu-series Inventing Anna.[1] Edwards received four Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for ER and won as an executive producer on Outstanding Television Movie winner Temple Grandin. He earned a People's Choice Award for Favorite Male Performer in a New Television Series (1995);[11] and won six Screen Actors Guild Awards for: Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series (1996 and 1998), and Best Ensemble Cast (1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999). He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Drama in 1998).[11] Edwards also won a Daytime Emmy for the production of the underground rock documentary N.Y.H.C. (1999) and the telepic adaptation of Kimberly Willis Holt's 1998 coming of age novel My Louisiana Sky (2001),[18] and earned the Carnegie Medal Award for My Louisiana Sky (2003).[18] After a long career in television, Edwards made his Broadway debut as his second act in 2018 in the revival of Children of a Lesser God at Studio 54.[10][12][19] In 2015 he appeared in Classic Stage Company's A Month in the Country but his stage acting career began when he was growing up in Santa Barbara.[20][21] On May 13, 2022, Edwards made his unexpected Broadway musical debut when he appeared as Dr. Walker in the Broadway production of Girl from the North Country due to COVID-19 cases impacting the cast. The show also stars his wife, Mare Winningham.[22][23] Edwards is slated to appear in the 2024 Broadway production of Prayer for the French Republic by Joshua Harmon.[24] Edwards was married to Jeanine Lobell from 1994 to 2015. They have one son and three daughters.[1][20] At the end of 2021, Edwards and longtime friend and fellow actor Mare Winningham eloped.[1][25][26] On November 10, 2017, Edwards wrote an essay on Medium, in which he stated that producer and screenwriter Gary Goddard had befriended and for years sexually assaulted him and his friends, beginning when they were 12 years old.[27][28] Edwards has been a licensed private pilot since 2012.[29]",

                "content": "This is getting to be an expensive month for Anthony Edwards. The Minnesota Timberwolves star was fined $25,000 on Monday for using “profane language” in an interview after the team's win over the Golden State Warriors on Friday. Edwards has now been fined $60,000 total in the past month. Edwards, after leading the Timberwolves to a 107-90 win over the Warriors on Friday, was talking about the team’s defensive effort to reporters while sitting at his locker when he used profanity twice. \"Everyone is guarding at a high level, but Jaden [McDaniels] and Rudy [Gobert] are being the anchors we need them to be,\" Edwards said, via Timberwolves reporter Dane Moore. \"I think that's the main thing. Naz [Reid] and Julius [Randle] are f***ing playing defense. I've never seen them play defense before. So that's f***ing incredible. And he's right here, put the camera on him. Guarding his ass off.\" While Edwards didn’t mean anything malicious with his comments, the league is going to hand down a fine for that type of language every single time. Monday’s fine came just a few weeks after Edwards was hit with a $35,000 fine for flipping off a fan in the team's win over the Sacramento Kings. Edwards gestured toward a fan in the stands at the Golden 1 Center during the first quarter of the game on Nov. 15. It’s unclear what sparked that reaction. Edwards is averaging a career-high 26.4 points, 5.4 rebounds and four assists per game this season, his fifth in the league. The 23-year-old signed a five-year, $204 million max extension with Minnesota in July 2023. The Timberwolves, who have won four of their last five, hold a 12-11 record heading into Friday’s game against the Los Angeles Lakers.",

After her junior year, her uncle Michael Markle helped secure her an internship as a junior press officer at the American embassy in Buenos Aires,[30] and considered a political career.[31][32] However, she did not score high enough in the Foreign Service Officer Test to proceed further with the US State Department[33] and returned to NU. She also attended a study abroad program in Madrid.[29] In 2003, Markle earned her bachelor's degree with a double major in theater and international studies from Northwestern's School of Communication.[31][33] According to Markle, she had some difficulty getting roles early in her career due to being \"ethnically ambiguous\" because \"I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones.\"[34] To support herself between acting jobs, she worked as a freelance calligrapher and taught bookbinding.[11][35] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital,[36][37] a show for which her father served as a lighting director.[38] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006) and CSI: NY (2006).[36] For her role in Century City, she told the casting directors that she was a SAG-AFTRA member when she was not, but after being cast, the employers were obliged to help her join the union according to the Taft–Hartley Act.[39] Markle also did several contract acting and modeling jobs. Between 2006 and 2007, she worked as a \"briefcase girl\" on 34 episodes of the US version of the game show Deal or No Deal.[11] She appeared in Fox's series Fringe as Junior Agent Amy Jessup in the first two episodes of its second season.[40] Markle appeared in small roles in the films Get Him to the Greek, Remember Me (produced by her then-partner Trevor Engelson) and The Candidate in 2010 and the film Horrible Bosses in 2011.[41] She was paid $187,000 for her role in Remember Me and $171,429 for her role in the short film The Candidate.[42] In July 2011, she joined the cast of the USA Network show Suits through to late 2017 and the seventh season. Her character, Rachel Zane, began as a paralegal and eventually became an attorney.[43] While working on Suits, she lived for nine months each year in Toronto.[44][45] Fortune magazine estimated that she was paid $50,000 per episode, amounting to an equivalent annual salary of $450,000.[46] Markle and American film producer Trevor Engelson began dating in 2004.[47][48] They were married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica on August 16, 2011.[49] They separated in July 2013, and granted a no-fault divorce in February 2014, citing irreconcilable differences.[50] Markle's subsequent live-in relationship with Canadian celebrity chef and restaurateur Cory Vitiello ended in May 2016 after almost two years.[51] In mid-2016,[52] Markle began a relationship with Prince Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II.[53][54] According to the couple, they first connected with each other via Instagram,[55] and they have also said that they were set up on a blind date by a mutual friend in July 2016.[52] On November 8, eight days after the relationship was made public by the press, the prince directed his communications secretary to release a statement on his behalf to express personal concern about pejorative and false comments made about his girlfriend by mainstream media and internet trolls.[56][57] Later, in a letter to a British media regulator, Markle's representatives complained about harassment from journalists.[58] In September 2017, Markle and Prince Harry appeared together in public in Toronto at the Invictus Games, of which Harry is founding patron.[59][60] Meghan Markle's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017, by Harry's father Charles (then the Prince of Wales).[61] The announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by the British media and prompted generally positive comments about a mixed-race person as a member of the royal family,[62] especially in regard to Commonwealth countries.[9] Markle announced that she would retire from acting[63][64] and her intention to become a British citizen.[65] In preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptized Markle and confirmed her in the Church of England on March 6, 2018.[66] The private ceremony, performed with water from the River Jordan, took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.[66] The marriage ceremony was held on May 19 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[67] Her wedding dress was designed by Clare Waight Keller.[68] Markle later revealed that there was a private exchange of vows three days earlier, with the Archbishop of Canterbury in the couple's garden.[69] However, this private exchange of vows was not a legally recognized marriage.[70][71] After the wedding, the Duke and Duchess lived at Nottingham Cottage in London, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.[72] In May 2018, it was reported that they had signed a two-year lease on Westfield Large, located on the Great Tew Estate in the Cotswolds.[73] They gave up the lease after photos of the house and its interior were published by a paparazzi agency.[73] The couple considered settling at the twenty-one room Apartment 1 within Kensington Palace,[74][75] but moved to Frogmore Cottage in the Home Park of Windsor Castle instead.[76][77] The Crown Estate refurbished the cottage at a cost of £2.4 million, paid out of the Sovereign Grant, with the Duke later reimbursing expenses beyond restoration and ordinary maintenance, a part of which was offset against rental payments that were due at the time.[78][79] Meghan gave birth to a son, Archie, on May 6, 2019.[80] The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's office moved to Buckingham Palace and officially closed on March 31, 2020, when the Sussexes withdrew from undertaking official royal engagements.[81][82] After some months in Canada and the United States, in June 2020, the couple bought a house on the former estate of Riven Rock, Montecito, California.[83][84] The next month, Meghan suffered a miscarriage.[85] She gave birth to a daughter, Lilibet, on June 4, 2021.[86] The Duke and Duchess own a Labrador named Pula and two Beagles named Guy and Mamma Mia.[87][88] Meghan previously owned a Labrador-German Shepherd cross named Bogart.[89] Markle was politically vocal before marrying Prince Harry. At age 9, she and her friends reportedly campaigned against the Gulf War.[90] Decades later, she backed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 United States presidential election and publicly denounced the opponent and eventual winner, Donald Trump. In the same year, when the referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union resulted in favor of Brexit, Markle expressed her disappointment on Instagram.[91] In 2017, Markle recommended the book Who Rules the World? by left-wing intellectual Noam Chomsky on her Instagram account.[92] In July 2018, Irish Senator Catherine Noone tweeted that the Duchess was \"pleased to see the result\" of the Irish referendum on legalizing abortion. Meghan received criticism for potentially breaching the protocol that prohibits royals from interfering in politics;[93] Noone deleted her tweet and emphasized that her statement was misleading and \"the Duchess was not in any way political\".[93] After she returned to the United States and as an eligible voter, she released a video with her husband encouraging others to register for the 2020 United States presidential election on National Voter Registration Day. Some media outlets took it as an implicit endorsement of the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, which prompted then-President Trump to dismiss their messaging at a press conference.[94] In October 2021, she penned an open letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, advocating for paid leave for parents.[95] Her remarks were met by backlash from Republican representatives Jason Smith and Lisa McClain, who found her statement \"out of touch\" and criticized her interference with American politics while utilizing her British royal titles.[96] Meghan has reportedly lobbied senators from both parties on the issue of paid family leave, including Democratic senators Patty Murray and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as Republican senators Shelley Moore Capito and Susan Collins.[97][98] She has also publicly spoken in support of federal voting protections.[99] In February 2022, she voiced her support for the Supreme Court nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson.[100] In June 2022, she publicly supported Moms Demand Action, an organization which campaigns for safer gun laws in the US.[101] In the same month, in an interview with Jessica Yellin for Vogue, Meghan criticized the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that abortion is not a protected constitutional right and voiced her support for the proposed Equal Rights Amendment.[102] After becoming engaged, Markle's first official public appearance with Prince Harry was at a World AIDS Day walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017.[103][104] On March 12, the 2018 Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey was the first royal event she attended with the Queen.[105] On March 23, Harry and Meghan made an unannounced day visit to Northern Ireland.[106] In total, Markle attended 26 public engagements prior to the wedding.[107] Meghan's first official engagement after marriage was on May 22, when she and her husband attended a garden party celebrating the charity work of King Charles III (then the Prince of Wales).[108] In July 2018, Meghan's first official trip abroad as a royal was to Dublin, Ireland, alongside Harry.[109][110] In October 2018, the Duke and Duchess traveled to Sydney for the 2018 Invictus Games.[111] This formed part of a Pacific tour that included Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.[112][113] As representatives of the Queen, the couple were greeted warmly by crowds in Sydney, and the announcement of Meghan's pregnancy hours after their arrival delighted the public and media.[113][114] During their visit to Morocco in February 2019, the Duke and Duchess focused on projects centered on \"women's empowerment, girls' education, inclusivity and encouragement of social entrepreneurship\".[115] Meghan also participated in her husband's work as youth ambassador to the Commonwealth, which included overseas tours.[116][117] As part of establishing a separate office from that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2019, the Duke and Duchess created an Instagram social media account, which broke the record for the fastest account at the time to reach a million followers.[118] In July 2019, the Duchess's security team were criticized for creating an empty zone of about 40 seats around her at Wimbledon where she was watching a match between Serena Williams and Kaja Juvan.[119] In August 2019, Meghan and her husband were criticized by environmental campaigners for using private jets regularly when taking their personal trips abroad, which would leave more carbon footprint per person compared to commercial planes. The criticism was in line with similar criticism faced by the royal family in June 2019, after it was claimed that they \"had doubled [their] carbon footprint from business travel\".[120][121] In September and October 2019, a Southern African tour included Malawi, Angola, South Africa and Botswana. Archie traveled with his parents, making it \"their first official tour as a family\".[122] Meghan completed 179 engagements in total in 2018 and 2019.[123] In January 2020, Meghan and Harry returned to the UK from a vacation in Canada and announced that they were stepping back from their role as senior members of the royal family and would balance their time between the United Kingdom and North America.[124][125] A statement released by the Palace confirmed that the Duke and Duchess were to cease to undertake royal duties as representatives of the Queen and would therefore no longer receive the relevant financial support.[126] The couple would retain their HRH styles but not use them.[126] The formal role of the Duke and Duchess was subject to a twelve-month review period, ending in March 2021. Meghan's final public solo engagement as a senior royal was a visit to Robert Clack School on March 7, 2020, in Dagenham ahead of International Women's Day.[127] She and Harry attended the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 9, 2020, which was their last engagement as a couple before they officially stepped down on March 31. Two years later, they made their first official appearance in the UK in June 2022 while attending the Platinum Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving.[128] They visited the UK and Germany in September 2022 for a number of charity events in Manchester and Düsseldorf.[129] On September 8, 2022, while Meghan and Harry were in London preparing to attend a charity event, Queen Elizabeth II died at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, and they remained in the United Kingdom for her funeral.[130] Meghan and Harry visited Nigeria in May 2024 to honor the work of the Invictus Games.

According to CNN, their trip focused on \"sports rehabilitation, mental health, and women's empowerment\".[131] Meghan co-hosted a women's empowerment summit with the head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, and she was honored in a ceremony by some of the Nigerian Chiefs.[131] In summer 2019, before announcing their decision to step down in January 2020, Meghan and her husband were involved in talks with Jeffrey Katzenberg, the founder of the now-defunct streaming platform Quibi, over a possible role in the service without gaining personal profits, but they eventually decided against joining the project.[132] In September 2019, it was reported that the couple had hired New York-based PR firm Sunshine Sachs, which represented them until 2022.[133][134][135] The couple has also been associated with Adam Lilling's Plus Capital, a venture capital fund designed to connect early stage companies with influencers and investors.[136] In June 2020, they signed with the Harry Walker Agency, owned by media company Endeavor, to conduct paid public speaking engagements.[137] In September 2020, the Sussexes signed a private commercial deal with Netflix.[138] In December 2020, it was announced that Meghan had invested in Clevr Blends, a coffee company based in Southern California.[139][140] In the same month, Meghan and Harry signed a multi-year deal with Spotify to produce and host their own programs through their audio producing company, Archewell Audio.[141] A holiday special was released by the couple on the service in December 2020,[142] while Meghan's podcast, titled Archetypes, premiered in August 2022.[143][144] In June 2023, Spotify cancelled the podcast, which ran for a single season of 12 episodes.[145][146] The Bench, a picture book written by Meghan with illustrations by Christian Robinson, was published in June 2021 by Random House Children's Books. It is based on her perception of the relationship between her husband and their son.[147] The book received a mixed response; it garnered praise for its illustrations and messaging but was criticized for its structure and writing.[148][149][150] On June 17, the book reached number one in the children's picture books category of The New York Times Best Seller list.[151] In July 2021, it was announced that Meghan would executive produce, alongside David Furnish, a Netflix animated series called Pearl.[152] The series was originally pitched to Netflix in 2018.[153][154] Pearl would depict the adventures of a 12-year-old girl who is inspired by influential women from history,[155] but the project was canceled in May 2022.[156] In the same month, it was reported that Meghan and Harry had signed a four-book publishing deal with Random House, including a wellness guide by Meghan and a memoir by Harry.[157] In October 2021, Meghan and Harry announced their partnership with Ethic, a sustainable investment firm based in New York City, which also manages the couple's investments.[158][159] According to state filings from Delaware, where the couple's Archewell foundation is registered, Meghan and Harry incorporated 11 companies and a trust beginning in early 2020 which include Orinoco Publishing LLC and Peca Publishing LLC to hold the rights for their books as well as Cobblestone Lane LLC and IPHW LLC which are holders of their foundation's logos.[160] Frim Fram Inc., which ran The Tig, had been registered earlier as a new corporation in Delaware in December 2019.[161] Harry & Meghan, a docuseries about the Sussexes, was produced by Netflix and the couple's Archewell Productions and premiered on December 8, 2022.

The collection sought to help \"unemployed and disadvantaged women\", through selling items \"on a one-for-one basis, meaning an item is donated for each item purchased\".[209] Taking advantage of the \"Meghan Markle effect\" (driving consumer purchases), in 10 days the collection provided a year's worth of clothes for the charity.[210] In February 2018, Markle and fiancé Harry attended the first annual forum of The Royal Foundation.[211] After marriage, Meghan became the foundation's fourth patron alongside Prince Harry, Prince William and his wife, Catherine.[212] In May 2019, as a part of their Heads Together initiative, the Duchess of Sussex together with her husband and in-laws launched Shout, a text messaging service for those who suffer from mental issues.[213] In June 2019, it was announced that Harry and Meghan would split from the charity and establish their own foundation.

Her trip was documented by Elle UK.[233][234] She was featured in the cover story for the October 2017 issue of Vanity Fair and the December 2017 issue of Elle France.[235][236] Shortly after her engagement to Prince Harry in 2017, she caused a surge of interest in Scottish retailer Strathberry after carrying one of its handbags to a public event.[237][238] This was reported as an indication that her fashion choices would produce results similar to the Kate Middleton effect.[237][239] After Markle and Prince Harry's first appearance as a couple, brands Mackage, Birks, R&R Jewelers, Crown Jewelers, and Everlane noted an upswing in their website hits and sales.[240][241][238] It was speculated that Markle's effect would be broader internationally because she already had a strong American appeal.[239] Consequently, the United States saw a boost in yellow gold jewelry sales in the first quarter of 2018.[242] In 2018, Tatler included Meghan with other senior royal women on its list of Britain's best dressed people.[243] Following the announcement of her pregnancy, she appeared in a Karen Gee dress that resulted in the Australian designer's website crashing.[244] Fashion website Net-a-Porter ranked Meghan as one of the best dressed women in 2018.[245] She was nominated for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[246] In 2019, British brand Reiss reported a growth in profits after Meghan was seen wearing a mini dress by them on International Women's Day.[247] In 2022, the black Armani dress worn by Meghan during her Oprah interview was selected by the Fashion Museum, Bath, as Dress of the Year 2021.[248] In the same year, she was featured in the cover story for the 2022 Fall Fashion issue of The Cut.[249] There was controversy over her claim in the interview that she had been told at the premiere of The Lion King that her marriage resulted in rejoicing in South Africa similar to that seen at Nelson Mandela's release from prison in 1990.[250] In 2018, Time selected Meghan as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World[251] and placed her on its shortlist for Person of the Year.[252] Her name appeared again on the listicle in 2021, and she and her husband were featured on one of the magazine's seven worldwide covers.[253] In 2019, the magazine named Meghan and Prince Harry among the 25 Most Influential People on the Internet.[254] She was also chosen as one of the 25 most influential women in the United Kingdom by British Vogue magazine in 2018, 2019 and 2021.[255][256][257] Her influence was also recognized in both the 2019 and 2020 editions of Powerlist, the 100 most influential Britons of African and Afro-Caribbean descent.[258] In 2022, she was named as one of the 50 Women Changing the World over the past year by Worth magazine.[259] In the same year, Variety named her as a stellar honoree for its Power of Women issue,[260][261] and Financial Times included her on its list of \"25 most influential women of 2022\".[262] In December 2022, Meghan was found to be the second most disliked member of the British royal family by statistics and polling company YouGov, behind her husband's uncle Prince Andrew.[263] In March 2023, The Independent included her on its \"Influence List 2023\".[264] Meghan and Harry's exit from the royal family was satirized in a 2023 episode of South Park.[265] In the same year, James Hibberd of The Hollywood Reporter named Meghan and Harry among the Hollywood losers of 2023.[266] Following Meghan and Harry's trip to Nigeria in May 2024, Lucia Stein of the ABC argued that the couple could have been used by the royal family, and added that \"perhaps how helpful they would have been\" had an agreement on a \"hybrid working model\" been achieved.[267] Among other things, she noted Meghan's style and meetings were extensively covered internationally. Media editor, Tina Brown commented in relation to the visit, they are \"enormously appealing to the public, and very good at [public engagement].\"[267] Brown later criticized Meghan's activities arguing that she had \"the worst judgement of anyone in the entire world\" and \"her issue is that she doesn't listen... She does what she wants to do.\"[268] In November 2016, the MailOnline was criticized for running an article on Markle's family background titled \"(Almost) Straight Outta Compton\", which triggered a response from Prince Harry's Communications Secretary.[15] In October 2019, Meghan filed a lawsuit against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), the publisher of The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline over the publication of a letter she had sent to her father.[269][270] Thomas Markle Sr. had provided the publisher with excerpts of the letter after five of his daughter's friends, including Abigail Spencer,[271] referenced it in a People article.[4][272][273] She subsequently received support from more than 70 female MPs from different parties who in an open letter condemned the use of \"outdated, colonial undertones\" against her in some national media outlets.[274] In May 2020, the court dismissed claims of the tabloid's alleged dishonesty and malice, as they were deemed either vague or irrelevant to the case.[275] In February 2021, the High Court of Justice found in a summary judgment that ANL's Mail on Sunday had invaded Meghan's privacy by publishing the letter,[276] and she won her claim for \"misuse of private information and copyright infringement\" in May 2021.[277] She was given a £450,000 down payment on her £1.5 million legal fees as an interim payment, and pursuant to copyright law, her legal team asked for a front-page statement by The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline to acknowledge her legal victory.[278] The Court of Appeal granted ANL permission to appeal against the ruling.[279] The appeal was subsequently launched by ANL in November 2021.[280] Meghan and Harry's former communications secretary Jason Knauf—who had previously denied co-authoring the letter with Meghan[281]—gave a statement to the court of appeal, mentioning that Meghan gave him briefing points to share with Finding Freedom's authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand and that Prince Harry welcomed the suggestion that they should conceal their involvement, while they both discussed the book \"on a routine basis\".[282] ANL had previously applied to use the book in their defense.[283][284] Knauf also revealed that Meghan wondered whether she should refer to her father as \"daddy\" in the letter, as she believed \"in the unfortunate event that it leaked, it would pull at the heartstrings\".[282] Meghan subsequently apologized to the court for not remembering the emails earlier, adding that the \"extent of the information\" Knauf shared with the book's authors was \"unknown\" to her.[285] She also stated in her witness statement that she was \"unable to retrieve any text messages with Mr Knauf\" due to \"an automatic deletion system\" that had been installed on her devices in 2016 for security reasons.[286] In December 2021, three senior appeal judges upheld the judgement of the High Court against ANL, prompting Meghan to call for reform of the tabloid industry.[287] In the same month, ANL's The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline published a front-page statement on Boxing Day acknowledging Meghan's victory, adding that there had been an agreement on \"financial remedies\".[288] In addition to covering a portion of Meghan's legal costs, the outlet agreed to pay her £1 in damages for invading her privacy and a confidential sum for infringing her copyright.[289] They were also banned from naming Meghan's friends, who had spoken to People magazine about the letter in 2018.[289] In November 2016, The Sun ran the headline \"Harry girl's on Pornhub\".[57] The outlet denied any smear after it was revealed that the clips were illegally uploaded scenes from the TV series Suits and not pornographic material.[57] They subsequently apologized via an official statement in February 2017.[290] In February 2018, a letter containing white powder and a racist note addressing Markle was sent to St James's Palace, triggering counter-terrorism and hate crime investigations by Scotland Yard.[291] Meghan and Harry obtained a formal apology in May 2019 from Splash News for privacy invasion at their Cotswolds residence.[292][293] In December 2019, PA Media retracted the publishing of a Christmas card photograph of Meghan, Harry, and their son Archie. The agency said that the photo was retracted because they had been advised that the photograph was \"not representative of the Christmas card sent by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\".[294] The couple had a legal warning issued to the press in general in January 2020 after the publication of paparazzi photographs.[295] In March 2020, the couple took Splash UK to court after Meghan and her son were photographed without permission in Canada during a \"private family outing\". The case was settled later that year with Splash UK agreeing to no longer take unauthorized photos of the family.[296] The Duke and Duchess announced in April that they would no longer cooperate with the Daily Mail, The Sun, Daily Mirror and Daily Express.[297] They won an apology in October from American news agency X17 for taking photographs of their son at their home using drones.[298] In March 2021, ITV News reported Meghan had complained directly to ITV's CEO about Piers Morgan's comments on mental health following her interview with Oprah Winfrey.[299] Ofcom received over 57,000 complaints about the program including one from the Duchess of Sussex.[300][301] In the same month, it was reported that an American private investigator unlawfully handed over personal details about Meghan to The Sun, including her Social Security number, cell phone number and address, when she first started dating Prince Harry in 2016. Meghan and her husband condemned the \"predatory practices\" of the British tabloids, while The Sun stated that the investigator \"was instructed clearly in writing to act lawfully\", and they did not \"use the information he provided for any unlawful practice\".[302] In July 2021, Meghan filed legal complaints against The Times for two separate articles, with the first one covering an unproven allegation from Robert Lacey's book that she had left an engagement in Fiji for not being appointed by UN Women as a goodwill ambassador and the second one claiming that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had refused to talk to Prince Harry after Prince Philip's funeral due to fears of a potential leak.[303][304] In January 2022, the couple jointly filed a legal complaint against The Times for an article reporting on Archewell raising less than $50,000 in 2020.[305] In the same month, she complained to the BBC regarding their five-part podcast Harry, Meghan and the Media, in which the presenter Amol Rajan stated that Meghan had \"apologized for misleading\" the Court of Appeal in her case against the Mail on Sunday.[306][307] The BBC responded by issuing a statement on its \"corrections and clarifications\" website to emphasize that she had \"apologized to the court for not remembering email exchanges\".[307] In March 2022, Meghan's half-sister, Samantha Markle, filed a defamation lawsuit against her in Florida, accusing her of lying in the Oprah interview and disseminating false statements via her communications secretary for the book Finding Freedom and sought damages in excess of $75,000.[308][309] In June 2022, Meghan's initial motion to dismiss the case was rejected by a judge following amendments made by Samantha in her complaint.[310] She filed a second motion in the same month.[310][311] In addition to applying for the case to be dismissed, Meghan's lawyer also applied for the discovery process to be delayed, pending the outcome of the dismissal application.[312] A Florida judge later denied the application to halt the discovery process,[313] but dismissed the lawsuit in March 2023.[314] In April 2023, Samantha refiled the lawsuit with another amended complaint that covered statements made by Meghan in her Netflix docuseries as well.[315] The lawsuit was later dismissed with prejudice in March 2024, after a judge ruled that the claimant was unable to provide evidence of defamation.[316] Samantha later appealed the decision.[317] Between December 2022 and January 2023, more than 25,000 complaints were submitted to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) about a column by Jeremy Clarkson in The Sun,[318] in which he stated that he hated Meghan \"on a cellular level\" and dreamed \"of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant, 'Shame!' and throw lumps of excrement at her.\"[319] On December 20, 2022, Conservative MP Caroline Nokes wrote to The Sun's editor, Victoria Newton, calling for \"action [to be] taken\" against Clarkson. The letter was signed by more than 60 cross-party MPs.[320] On December 23, The Sun issued an apology, stating \"columnists' opinions are their own\" but they \"regret the publication of this article\" and are \"sincerely sorry\".[321] On the following day, a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex described the apology as \"nothing more than a PR stunt\".[322] Clarkson said his column was a reference to a scene from the television series Game of Thrones and he later revealed that he had emailed Meghan and Harry on Christmas Day 2022 to apologise.[318][323] A spokesperson for the couple said Clarkson wrote solely to Harry and the article was not an isolated incident.[318] In February 2023, IPSO announced that it was launching an investigation about the article.[324] In June 2023, IPSO concluded that the column was sexist and contained a \"pejorative and prejudicial reference\" to Meghan's sex, but it rejected complaints that the piece raised an issue of fact, or was meant to harass her or included discriminatory references on the grounds of race.[325] In 2021, shortly before Meghan and Harry were due to be interviewed by Oprah Winfrey, Valentine Low reported in The Times that Meghan's former communications secretary, Jason Knauf, complained in October 2018 that her conduct at Kensington Palace had caused two personal assistants to quit and had undermined the confidence of a third employee,[326] prompting an investigation by Buckingham Palace into the bullying allegations.[327][328] The palace hired an external law firm to examine the claims, with ten aides reported to have cooperated with the review.[329][330] Criticism of Meghan for twice wearing earrings gifted from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2018, after he was accused of complicity in the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, appeared at the same time.[331][326][332] Her representatives denied her awareness of the accusations against Mohammed bin Salman and said The Times were being used by Buckingham Palace for \"a smear campaign\" against her.[333][326] The television special Oprah with Meghan and Harry was broadcast on CBS on March 7, 2021.[334] Meghan spoke about her personal and royal life and public pressure. She claimed to have been contemplating suicide during her time as a working royal and complained of a lack of protection for her and her son while being part of the royal institution.[335] There was a wide and polarized reaction to the interview.[336] In an updated epilogue for the couple's unauthorized biography, Finding Freedom by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, the authors claimed that \"two of the individuals mentioned in [Knauf's] email asked for any allegations made to HR about their experiences with Meghan to be rescinded\".[337] Speaking on behalf of the Duchess in a BBC documentary, Jenny Afia, a lawyer who represented Meghan in her case against ANL, stated that the bullying allegations were \"just not true\".[338] In June 2022, The Times reported that the results from the inquiry made Buckingham Palace modify some of the policies and procedures in its HR department, but the report would not be published to ensure the privacy of those who took part in it.[339] In September 2024 The Hollywood Reporter reported on complaints raised by American staff members about Meghan's behavior. Her spokesperson declined to comment.[340] In March 2019, European consulting firm 89up reported on their discovery of 1,103 highly connected Twitter accounts with more than two and a half million tweets in favor of Meghan, most of which appeared to be bots carrying out \"coordinated attacks\" on royal correspondents who had reported negatively on her.[341][342] In the same year, CNN had reported on research by Hope not Hate, stating that out of 5,200 \"abusive tweets directed at Meghan\" in January and February 2019, 3,600 came from a small group of trolls.[341] In March 2019, the royal family introduced new rules for followers commenting on its official social media accounts in response to the online abuse aimed at Meghan and her sister-in-law Catherine.[343] In October 2021, Twitter analytics service Bot Sentinel released their analysis of more than 114,000 tweets about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as a result of which they found 83 accounts with a combined number of 187,631 followers that were possibly responsible for approximately 70% of the negative content posted about the couple.[344][345][346] The report prompted an investigation by Twitter.[344] The company stated that it found no evidence of \"widespread coordination\" between the accounts and said that it had taken action against users who violated Twitter's conduct policy.[344] Bot Sentinel released three more reports in the following months, arguing that the accounts were part of a \"bot network\" and a similar network could be found on YouTube.[347][348][349] In January 2022, the BBC named Meghan and Harry among people whose photos and videos were used in fake instant profits advertisements and bitcoin-related investment schemes.[350] Among theories widespread on social media, including Twitter and YouTube, were unfounded assertions that Meghan had faked her pregnancies, instead using surrogate mother(s), or that her children do not exist at all.[351][352][353] Meghan's half-sister, Samantha, was reported to have run multiple Twitter accounts that targeted Meghan.[354][355] Meghan became a princess of the United Kingdom upon her marriage to Prince Harry, entitled to the style of Royal Highness.[356] After her marriage, she was styled \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex\". She also holds the titles of Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel.[357] She is the first person to hold the title \"Duchess of Sussex\".[358][359] Following the Duke and Duchess's decision to step back from royal duties in 2020, the couple agreed not to use the style of Royal Highness in practice, but they are still referred to as \"His/Her Royal Highness\" in legal settings.[360][361][362][363] During Meghan's trip to Nigeria in May 2024, Igwe Alfred Achebe, the Obi of Onitsha, and Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, the Oluwo of Iwo, gave her the chieftaincy titles Ada Mazi (transl. 'the daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace') and Adetokunbo (transl. 'royalty from across the seas').[131]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Meghan, duchess of Sussex (born August 4, 1981, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) is an American British actress and consort (2018– ) of Prince Harry, duke of Sussex and fifth in line to the British throne. Markle was born to Doria Ragland, an African American former television studio intern who later became a social worker and yoga instructor, and her husband, Thomas Markle, a lighting director who was white; the couple met on the set of the soap opera General Hospital. Markle’s parents divorced when she was a young child, but both remained active in her life. In 1995 she had an uncredited role in the sitcom Married…with Children, for which her father served as director of lighting and of photography. After graduating from Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girls Roman Catholic school, in 1999, Markle studied theatre and international studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois (B.A., 2003). Markle then returned to Los Angeles to embark on an acting career. She quickly began landing guest roles in TV shows, including CSI: NY, 90210, CSI: Miami, and Fringe, and she supplemented her income working as a freelance calligrapher. Her big break came when she was cast as paralegal Rachel Zane in the popular USA Network legal drama series Suits (2011–19). She also played leading roles in such movies as Random Encounters (2013) and Anti-Social (2015). In addition, she ran a lifestyle blog, The Tig (2014–17). Markle, who had briefly been married (2011–13) to producer Trevor Engelson, was introduced to Prince Harry by a mutual friend in 2016; Harry is the younger of the two sons of Prince Charles (later Charles III) and Princess Diana; his older brother is Prince William. An early date was a camping trip to Botswana. The tabloid press quickly discovered the relationship, and its coverage of the couple was seen by many as salacious and often insulting and racist. Late in 2016 Harry made the relationship public while berating the British press for its treatment of Markle. The couple’s engagement was announced in November 2017. The wedding took place at Windsor Castle on May 19, 2018, and Meghan was given the title duchess of Sussex. Their first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, was born on May 6, 2019. Though Meghan was often praised for her open and relaxed demeanour, the couple continued to be bedeviled by the tabloid press. In addition, a rift between Harry and Meghan and the other royals began to appear. In January 2020 the couple announced that they would retreat from their royal duties and planned to become financially independent of the royal family. It was later announced that they would, as of March 31, no longer be “working members” of the royal family. The couple subsequently relocated to Los Angeles, where they continued to support various charities. In addition, Meghan publicly discussed politics and personal subjects that were considered unsuitable topics for members of the royal family. Notably, in 2020 she revealed that she had experienced a miscarriage. On June 4, 2021, she gave birth to a daughter, Lilibet (“Lili”) Diana Mountbatten-Windsor; the name honoured both Harry’s mother and his grandmother Elizabeth II, whose nickname was Lilibet. Shortly thereafter Meghan released the children’s book The Bench, about a father-son relationship. In 2022 she began hosting the podcast Archetypes, which sought to “investigate the labels that try to hold women back.” In September 2022 Elizabeth II died, and Meghan and Harry were prominent at various events, including the funeral. In addition, they made a joint appearance with William and his wife, Princess Catherine, at Windsor Castle, despite an alleged rift between the brothers. Later that year the highly anticipated docuseries Harry & Meghan aired on Netflix. A candid look at their relationship, it chronicled the couple’s courtship, marriage, and decision to step back from their royal duties. The docuseries also highlighted Harry and Meghan’s struggles with the news media.",

                "title": "Philadelphia 76ers - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Philadelphia 76ers, also known colloquially as the Sixers, are an American professional basketball team based in the Philadelphia metropolitan area.[b] The 76ers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Wells Fargo Center located in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. Founded in 1946 and originally known as the Syracuse Nationals, they are one of the oldest franchises in the NBA and one of only 8 out of 23 to survive the league's first decade. The team is owned and managed by Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE), with founders Josh Harris and David Blitzer acquiring the team in 2011. The 76ers have had a prominent history, with many Hall of Fame players having played for the organization, including Dolph Schayes, Hal Greer, Wilt Chamberlain, Chet Walker, Billy Cunningham, George McGinnis, Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks, Bobby Jones, Moses Malone, Charles Barkley, and Allen Iverson. The 76ers have won three NBA championships. Their first came under their previous name, the Syracuse Nationals, in 1955. The second title came in 1967, a team which was led by Chamberlain. The third title came in 1983, won by a team led by Erving and Malone. The 76ers have only been back to the NBA Finals once since, in 2001, when they were led by Iverson and lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in five games. Chamberlain, Erving, Malone, Iverson, and Joel Embiid have been named the NBA's Most Valuable Player while playing for the 76ers, for a total of seven MVP awards. In 1946, Italian immigrant Danny Biasone established the Syracuse Nationals of the National Basketball League (NBL) in Syracuse, New York, for $5,000.[8] While in the NBL with teams largely consisting of small Midwestern towns, the Nationals put together a 21–23 record, finishing in fourth place. In the playoffs, the Nationals were beaten by the Rochester Royals in four games. In their second season, 1947–48, the Nationals struggled, finishing in fifth place with a 24–36 record. Despite their record, they made the playoffs, and were swept by the Anderson Duffey Packers in three straight games. Prior to the 1948–49 season, four teams left the NBL for the BAA as the foundation for a merger was laid.[9] The Nationals \"recipe for success\" began by recruiting Leo Ferris.[10] Staying in the NBL, Ferris signed Al Cervi to be player-coach and outbid the New York Knicks for the services of Dolph Schayes who made his professional debut,[11] leading the Nationals to a winning record for the first time with a record of 40–23. In the playoffs the Nationals defeated the Hammond Calumet Buccaneers, winning the series in two straight games. In the semifinals, the Nationals lost to the Anderson Duffey Packers for the second straight season in four games. In 1949, when the NBL and the BAA merged into the NBA, the Nationals were one of seven NBL teams that were brought into the NBA. The Nationals were an instant success in the NBA, winning the Eastern Division in the 1949–50 season, with a league-best record of 51–13. In the playoffs the Nationals continued to play solid basketball, beating the Philadelphia Warriors in two games. Moving on to the Eastern Finals, the Nationals battled the New York Knickerbockers, beating their big-city rivals in a three-game series. In the NBA Finals, the Nationals faced fellow NBL alums the Minneapolis Lakers. In Game 1 of the Finals the Nationals lost just their second home game of the season 68–66. The Nationals did not recover, as they fell behind 3–1 before falling in six games. Despite several teams leaving the NBA for the National Professional Basketball League before the 1950–51 season, the Nationals decided to stay put. In their second NBA season, 1950–51, the Nationals played mediocre basketball all season, finishing in fourth place with a record of 32–34. In the playoffs the Nationals played their best basketball of the season as they stunned the first-place Warriors in two straight, taking Game 1 on the road in overtime 91–89. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals were beaten by the New York Knickerbockers in a hard-fought five-game series, losing the finale by just two points. Cervi, playing less and coaching more, emphasized a patient offense and a scrappy defense, which led the league in the 1951–52 season by yielding a stingy 79.5 points per game as the Nationals won the Eastern Division with a solid 40–26 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals knocked off the Warriors again in a three-game series. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals fell to the Knickerbockers again, dropping the series in four games. The Nationals finished in second place in a hard-fought 3-way battle for first place in the Eastern Division for the 1952–53 season, with a record of 47–24. In the playoffs, the Nationals faced the Boston Celtics dropping Game 1 at home 87–81. Needing a win in Boston to keep their hopes alive, the Nationals took the Celtics deep into overtime before losing in quadruple OT 111–105, in what remains the longest playoff game in NBA history.[12] The Nationals acquired Alex Groza, and Ralph Beard as the Indianapolis Olympians folded leaving the NBA with just 9 teams for the 1953–54 season. Once again the Nationals battled for the Division title falling two games short with a 42–30 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals won all four games of a round-robin tournament involving the three playoff teams from the East. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals beat the Celtics in two straight games. In the NBA Finals, the Nationals lost to the Lakers in a hard-fought seven-game series where the two teams alternated wins throughout. With the NBA struggling financially and down to just 8 teams during the 1954–55 season, Nationals owner Biasone suggested the league limit the amount of time taken for a shot thus speeding up a game that often ended with long periods of teams just holding the ball and playing keep away. Biasone and Nationals' general manager Ferris calculated a 24-second shot clock would allow at least 30 shots per quarter speeding up the game and increasing scoring. The Shot Clock was an instant success as scoring was up 14 points per game league-wide. In the first season of the shot clock, the Nationals would take first place in the East with a 43–29 record. After a first-round bye the Nationals would beat the Celtics in four games to reach the NBA Finals for the second straight season. In the finals the Nationals would get off to a fast start, led by forward Schayes, taking the first two games at home against the Fort Wayne Pistons.[13] As the series moved to Fort Wayne the Pistons would spark back to life taking all three games to take a 3–2 series lead. Back in Syracuse for Game 6 on the Nationals kept Championship hopes alive by beating the Pistons 109–104 to force a seventh game at home. Game 7 would be as tight as the series as George King sank a free throw to give the Nationals a 92–91 lead in the final seconds. King then stole the inbound pass to clinch the NBA Championship for the Nationals. Coming off their NBA Championship the Nationals struggled during the 1955–56 season, needing a tiebreaker over the Knickerbockers to avoid finishing in last place and make the playoffs with a 35–37 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals stunned the Celtics winning the first-round series in three games by taking the final two games. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals played solid basketball again as they pushed the Warriors to a decisive fifth game. The Nationals' reign as defending champions ended with a 109–104 loss in Philadelphia. The Nationals got off to a slow start as coach Cervi was fired and replaced by Paul Seymour. Under Seymour, the Nationals rebounded and finished the 1956–57 season in second place with a record of 38–34. In the playoffs, the Nationals had trouble knocking off the defending champion Warriors advancing to the Eastern Finals with two straight wins. The Nationals were swept in three games by the eventual champions, the Celtics. Fort Wayne and Rochester had moved on to Detroit and Cincinnati for the 1957–58 season, leaving the Syracuse Nationals as the last small-town team in the big city NBA. That did not matter on the court as the Nationals held their own finishing in second place with a 41–31 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals fell in the first round as they lost a three-game series to the Philadelphia Warriors. Despite a mediocre 35–37 record for the 1958–59 season the Nationals made the playoffs again by finishing in third place. In the playoffs, the Nationals swept the Knickerbockers in two straight to reach the Eastern Finals, where they lost to the eventual champion Celtics, alternating wins before losing by 5 points in Game 7. Playing in a league now dominated by superstars like Bill Russell of the Celtics, Wilt Chamberlain of the Warriors, Bob Pettit of the St. Louis Hawks and Elgin Baylor of the Lakers, the Nationals held their own posting a solid 45–30 record, while finishing in third place after the 1959–60 regular season. In the playoffs, the Nationals lost a three-game series to Chamberlain and the Warriors. With the Lakers relocating from Minneapolis to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season, the Syracuse Nationals became the last old NBL team to still be playing in their original city in the NBA. The Nationals went on to make the playoffs again by finishing in third place with a 38–41 record. The Nationals were dangerous in the playoffs as they stunned the Warriors in three straight games. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals lost once again to the eventual champion Celtics in five games. Schayes missed 24 games during the 1961–62 season and failed to lead the team in scoring for the first time in 14 years, as Hal Greer led the way with 22.8 points per game. The Nationals finished in third place again with a 41–39 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals lost their first two games to the Warriors on the road. Facing elimination the Nationals won the next two games to force a fifth game in Philadelphia. In Game 5 the Warriors ended the Nationals' season with a 121–104 victory. With an aging team, the Nationals were expected to fade; however, with the scrappy play of Johnny Kerr, the Nationals remained a strong contender, finishing in second place for the 1962–63 season, with a record of 48–32. In the playoffs the Nationals faced the Cincinnati Royals, getting off to a 2–1 series lead. Needing one win to advance to the Eastern Finals again the Nationals lost two straight, dropping the decisive fifth game at home in overtime 131–127. The playoff overtime loss on March 26, 1963, would prove to be the last game for the Syracuse Nationals, as investors Irv Kosloff and Ike Richman purchased the team from Danny Biasone and moved the team to Philadelphia, filling the void left by the Warriors, who had moved to San Francisco. Syracuse was the last of the medium-sized cities housing an NBA team, but by then it was apparent that central New York was no longer large enough to support it. The NBA thus returned to Philadelphia one year after the Warriors had left it. A contest was held to decide on a new name for the team. The winning name, chosen by Walter Stalberg, was the \"76ers\".[14][1] The name comes from the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia in 1776. \"Sixers\" was also utilized for shorter referencing,[15] particularly in headlines. The shorter name was quickly accepted by the team for marketing purposes, and for most of the last six decades \"76ers\" and \"Sixers\" have been officially interchangeable. For their first four years in Philadelphia, the 76ers played mostly at the Philadelphia Arena and Civic Center-Convention Hall, with an occasional game at The Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania. Schayes was named head coach, a post he held for four years (the first as player-coach). In the 1964–65 season, the 76ers acquired the legendary Wilt Chamberlain from the Warriors; Chamberlain had been a high school legend at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia and began his career with the Warriors while they still played in Philadelphia. The 76ers would push the Celtics to seven games in the semifinals, with the 76ers trailing 110–109 in Game 7. After Hal Greer's pass was stolen by John Havlicek, the Celtics went on to beat the Los Angeles Lakers and win the NBA Championship. On December 3, 1965, in the midst of a game at the Boston Garden, co-owner Richman suffered a heart attack and died courtside.[16] Led by head coach Alex Hannum, the 76ers had a dream season as they started 46–4,[17] en route to a record of 68–13, the best record in league history at the time.[18] Chamberlain, Billy Cunningham, and Greer, along with all-stars Chet Walker, Lucious Jackson and Wali Jones led the team to the semifinals. This time the 76ers beat the Celtics in five games. In Game Five of that series, as the 76ers went to victory and the NBA Finals, Philadelphia fans chanted \"Boston is dead!\"—a symbol that the Celts' eight-year reign as NBA champion had ended. The Finals were almost anticlimactic, with the Sixers ousting the Warriors in six games to give them their second NBA Championship. The 1966–67 76ers were voted the best team in league history during the NBA's 35th anniversary celebration in October 1980. In the 1967–68 season, with a new home court in the form of The Spectrum to defend their championship, once again the 76ers made it back to the NBA Playoffs and in the rematch of the previous year's semifinals, the 76ers held a 3–1 series lead over the Celtics, before the Celtics staged a dramatic comeback to beat the 76ers in seven games. At the end of the season, the 76ers dealt Chamberlain to the Los Angeles Lakers for Archie Clark, Darrall Imhoff and Jerry Chambers. At the time, the trade appeared to make some sense from the 76ers' perspective. Chamberlain was making noises about jumping to the American Basketball Association, and general manager Jack Ramsay did not want to risk letting Chamberlain walk away for nothing. However Chamberlain's replacement at center, Lucious Jackson, suffered a severe injury in 1969 and was never the same player after that. The Chamberlain trade was followed by a freefall in the 76ers' performance, which Ramsay accelerated by subsequent divestiture of All Star forward Chet Walker to the Chicago Bulls. While the rapidly declining 76ers continued to contend for the next three seasons, they never got past the second round. In 1971–72, only five years after winning the title, the 76ers finished 30–52 and missed postseason play for the first time in franchise history. The bottom fell out in the 1972–73 season. Ramsay left for the expansion Buffalo Braves, but the 76ers had trouble finding a replacement; Al McGuire and Adolph Rupp turned them down. Kosloff was so desperate for a replacement that he took out an ad in The Philadelphia Inquirer. It was answered by Roy Rubin, longtime head coach at Long Island University.[19][20] For all intents and purposes, the season ended when Cunningham bolted to the ABA on the same day Rubin was introduced as head coach. This left the 76ers with a roster of Greer and little else. The 76ers lost their first 15 games of the season, and a few months later set a then-record 20-game losing streak in a single season. Their record following the 20-game losing streak was 4–58, and the team at that point had just lost 34 of 35 games. The 76ers finished the season with a 9–73 record, leading the skeptical Philadelphia press to call them the \"Nine and 73-ers\". Rubin was fired after 51 games and a 4–47 record; as it turned out, it would be his only NBA coaching job. He was succeeded by player-coach Kevin Loughery, who went 5–26 the rest of the way. The 76ers finished an NBA-record 59 games behind the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics. Only six years after tallying the most wins in NBA history, the 1972–73 squad notched the fourth-fewest wins in NBA history, and still the fewest for a full 82-game season. The 73 losses, although threatened several times, remains the all-time low-water mark for any NBA franchise. The 76ers' 0.110 winning percentage was a record worst at the time, and would remain the lowest until the 2011–12 Charlotte Bobcats finished 7–59 for a .106 winning percentage in a season shortened due to a lockout. The 76ers of 1972–73 are generally considered to be the worst team ever to take the court in NBA history. In 2007, NBA historian Kyle Wright argued that the 1992–93 Dallas Mavericks and 1997–98 Denver Nuggets, both of whom won eleven games, plus the inaugural Cleveland Cavaliers, who won 15 games, were actually poorer teams due to much weaker schedules.[21] The next year, the 76ers would hire Gene Shue as their head coach and they slowly came back. In the 1975–76 season, the 76ers acquired George McGinnis from the Indiana Pacers of the ABA (after the Knicks tried to sign him, not knowing that the 76ers owned his rights). With him, the 76ers were back in the playoffs after a five-year absence, and even though they lost to the Buffalo Braves in three games, a doctor would come along and get the team healthy enough to stay in perennial contention. During this period, one last personnel misjudgment had effects when the team used the fifth pick overall in the 1975 draft to select Darryl Dawkins directly from high school. The immensely talented and physically imposing Dawkins seldom, if ever, lived up to his great potential in part because of a perpetual adolescence. The 76ers finally came all the way back in 1976–77, in large part due to the ABA–NBA merger. The ABA's last champions, the New York Nets, were facing a burden of $5 million to the Knicks for entering the New York metropolitan area on top of the $3.2 million expansion fee for joining the NBA. So, when the 76ers offered to buy the contract of the Nets' franchise player, Julius Erving, for $3 million—roughly the cost of NBA membership—the Nets had little choice but to accept. A few months before that trade, Kosloff had sold the 76ers to Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr. on May 28, 1976.[22] Led by Erving, the 76ers began an exciting ride, beating their long-time rival from Boston in a seven-game playoff series to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. There, they defeated the Houston Rockets, led by future 76er Moses Malone, in six games to advance to the NBA Finals. In the Finals, they sprinted to a 2–0 series lead over the Bill Walton-led Portland Trail Blazers—who were coached by former 76ers' coach/general manager Jack Ramsay—only to drop the next four games in a row to give the Blazers the title. That led to the 1977–78 motto of \"We owe you one\", which would ultimately backfire when they lost in the conference finals that season to the Washington Bullets, who went on to win the NBA championship. In the next four seasons, the 76ers would fall short of the NBA Championship, even after Shue handed the coaching reins to former great Billy Cunningham. In the 1980 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, they lost 4–2. In Game Six, rookie Magic Johnson played center for the Lakers in place of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who was out because of a sprained ankle sustained in Game Five) and scored 42 points. In the 1981 Eastern Conference Finals, the 76ers opened a 3–1 series lead over the Celtics only to see Boston come back and win the series in seven games. The following season, the 76ers again faced the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, and again jumped to a 3–1 series lead only to see Boston forge a 3–3 series tie. The 76ers were given little chance of winning as they faced the Celtics in Game Seven at Boston Garden. This time, they played angry but inspired basketball, pulling away to a 120–106 victory and becoming the third NBA road team to win Game 7 after leading the series 3–1. In the game's closing moments, the Boston Garden fans began chanting \"Beat L.A., Beat L.A.\", as they realized their team would lose the playoff series to a hated opponent (Philadelphia 76ers), but nonetheless openly wished that opponent good luck in the next round against a more hated opponent (the Los Angeles Lakers).[23] The team lost the 1982 Finals in six games against the Los Angeles Lakers. Harold Katz bought the 76ers from Dixon in 1981. On his watch, the final piece of the championship puzzle was completed before the 1982–83 season when they acquired center Moses Malone from the Houston Rockets. Led by Hall of Famers Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks, and All-Stars Andrew Toney and Bobby Jones, they dominated the regular season, winning 65 games in what is still the second most winning year in franchise history. Malone was named League MVP, and when reporters asked how the playoffs would run, he answered, \"four, four, four\"—in other words, saying that the 76ers needed to win four games in each of the three rounds. Malone's accent made his boast sound like \"fo', fo', fo'.\"[24] The 76ers backed up Malone's boast. They made a mockery of the Eastern Conference playoffs, first sweeping the New York Knicks and then beating the Milwaukee Bucks in five games. The 76ers went on to win their third NBA championship (and second in Philadelphia) with a four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers, who had defeated them the season before. Malone was named the playoffs' MVP. The 76ers did not quite fulfill Malone's prediction, as their run was actually \"fo', fi', fo\" (\"four, five, four\") – a loss to the Bucks in game four of the Eastern finals being the only blemish on their playoff run. Nonetheless, their 12–1 playoff record is tied for the fewest losses in league history with the 2000–01 Lakers, who went 15–1 en route to the NBA title, coincidentally beating the 76ers in the Finals (after suffering their only defeat that postseason in Game 1), and also with the 2016–2017 Golden State Warriors, who won the title with a 16–1 playoff record. The Philadelphia-based group Pieces Of A Dream had a minor hit in 1983 with the R&B song \"Fo-Fi-Fo\", which title was prompted by Malone's quip. This also marked the last major-pro championship in Philadelphia until the Phillies won the 2008 World Series.[25] After a disappointing 1983–84 season, which ended with a five-game loss to the upstart New Jersey Nets in the first round of the playoffs, Charles Barkley arrived in Philadelphia for the 1984–85 season. For the next eight seasons, Barkley brought delight to the Philadelphia fans thanks to his humorous and sometimes controversial ways.[26] The 76ers returned to the Eastern Conference Finals in Barkley's rookie season, but lost to the Boston Celtics in five games. As it turned out, they would never again advance as far during Barkley's tenure in Philadelphia. Following the 1984–85 season, Matt Guokas replaced Billy Cunningham as head coach. Guokas led the 76ers to a 54–28 record and the second round of the 1986 playoffs, where they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks in seven games. On June 16, 1986, Katz made two of the most controversial and highly criticized personnel moves in franchise history, trading Moses Malone to Washington and the first overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft, which had been obtained from the San Diego Clippers in a 1979 trade for Joe Bryant, to the Cleveland Cavaliers. In return, the 76ers received Roy Hinson, Jeff Ruland, and Cliff Robinson, none of whom played more than three seasons with the team. Cleveland, meanwhile, turned their acquired pick into future All-Star Brad Daugherty. On the night of the 1986–87 season opener, Julius Erving announced he would retire after the season, which was subsequently filled with tributes in each arena the 76ers visited. On the court, the team suffered through an injury-plagued campaign, but still managed to make the playoffs with a 45–37 record. Their season would end at the hands of the Bucks again, this time in a best-of-five first-round series that went the distance. In 1987–88, with the team's record at 20–23, Guokas was fired and replaced by assistant coach Jim Lynam. Lynam finished the season 16–23, to bring Philadelphia's overall mark to 36–46. For the first time since the 1974–75 season, the 76ers failed to reach the playoffs. Philadelphia selected Charles Smith with its first pick (third overall) in the 1988 NBA draft, then traded his rights to the Los Angeles Clippers for their first pick (sixth overall), and Hersey Hawkins. In five seasons with the 76ers, Hawkins would average 19 points per game, and was the team's all-time leader in three-point field goals attempted and made when he was traded to the Charlotte Hornets for Dana Barros, Sidney Green and draft picks in 1993. In 1988–89, Philadelphia returned to the playoffs after a one-year absence, but was swept in the first round by the New York Knicks. In 1989–90, Barkley finished second in the league's MVP voting, as the 76ers won the Atlantic Division title with a 53–29 record. After defeating Cleveland in the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the second round. The 76ers fell to the Chicago Bulls in five games, and would do the same in 1991 after sweeping the Bucks in the first round. In the 1991–92 season, the 76ers went 35–47 and missed the playoffs for just the second time during Barkley's eight seasons in Philadelphia. On June 17, 1992, Barkley was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Jeff Hornacek, Tim Perry, and Andrew Lang, a deal that was met with harsh criticism.[27] Lynam relinquished his head coaching position to become general manager following the 1991–92 season, and hired Doug Moe to fill the vacancy. Moe's tenure lasted just 56 games, with the 76ers posting a 19–37 record. Popular former player and longtime assistant coach Fred Carter succeeded Moe as head coach in March 1993, but could only manage a 32–76 record at the helm. Following the 1993–94 season, the 76ers hired John Lucas in the dual role of head coach and general manager. The enthusiastic Lucas had been successful as a head coach for the San Antonio Spurs, and Philadelphia hoped he could breathe new life into the 76ers. It proved disastrous, as the team went 42–122 in its two seasons under Lucas. The acquisition of unproductive free agents such as Scott Williams and Charles Shackleford, players at the end of their careers such as LaSalle Thompson, Orlando Woolridge, and Scott Skiles along with stunningly unwise high draft picks such as Shawn Bradley and Sharone Wright were also factors in the team's decline. In fact, Wright would only play four seasons in the NBA while Temple product Eddie Jones—drafted 4 slots below Wright in 1994 by the L.A. Lakers—had 16 productive seasons as an NBA player. Starting with the 1990–91 season, and ending with the 1995–96 season, the 76ers had the dubious distinction of seeing their win total decrease each year. The nadir was the 1995–96 season, when they finished with an 18–64 record, the second-worst in franchise history at the time. It was also the second-worst record in the league that year, ahead of only the expansion Vancouver Grizzlies but behind the Toronto Raptors, who were also in their inaugural season. That season would turn out to be their last in The Spectrum. Katz, unpopular among fans since the 1986 trades, sold the team to Comcast Spectacor, a consortium of Philadelphia Flyers owner Ed Snider and Comcast Corporation, at the end of the 1995–96 season. Snider had been the 76ers' landlord since gaining control of the Spectrum in 1971. Pat Croce, a former trainer for the Flyers and 76ers, took over as president. Many 76ers fans call these years \"The Dark Ages\". After many years of misfortune, there was a bright spot. The team won the lottery for the top pick in the 1996 NBA draft. Questions remained, but with the first pick, the 76ers selected Allen Iverson, who was nicknamed \"the Answer\". With new ownership, Iverson in place, and the 76ers moving into the CoreStates Center, things seemed to finally be heading in a positive direction. Croce fired Lucas as both coach and general manager. Johnny Davis was named head coach, while Brad Greenberg took over as general manager. Iverson was named Rookie of the Year, but Philadelphia's overall improvement was minimal, as they finished with a 22–60 record. Changes had to be made, and after the 1996–97 season, Davis and Greenberg were both fired and the unveiling of a new 76ers team logo and jerseys marked a new era. To replace Davis, Larry Brown was hired as head coach. Known for a defense-first approach and transforming unsuccessful teams into winners by \"playing the right way\", Brown faced perhaps his toughest coaching challenge. He often clashed with Iverson, but the 76ers improved to 31 wins in 1997–98. Early in the 1997–98 season, the 76ers traded Jerry Stackhouse, who had been the third overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft, to the Detroit Pistons. In exchange, Philadelphia received Aaron McKie and Theo Ratliff, defensive standouts who would have an impact in the team's resurgence. Another key figure in the team's rise, Eric Snow, was added in a trade with the Seattle SuperSonics in January 1998. Prior to the 1998–99 season, the 76ers signed George Lynch and Matt Geiger, but a lockout delayed the start of the season, which was shortened to 50 games. During the season, Philadelphia acquired Tyrone Hill in a trade with Milwaukee. The team began its resurgence during this lockout-shortened season, finishing with a 28–22 record and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, marking the first time since 1991 the team reached the postseason. In the first round, Philadelphia upset the Orlando Magic 3–1, before being swept by the Indiana Pacers. The following season, the 76ers improved to 49–33, fifth in the Eastern Conference. Again, the 76ers won their first-round series in four games, this time defeating the Charlotte Hornets. For the second straight year, they were defeated by Indiana in the second round, this time in six games. Though the team was moving in a positive direction, Iverson and Brown continued to clash, and their relationship deteriorated to the point where it seemed certain Iverson would be traded. A rumored trade to the Los Angeles Clippers fell through, but a complicated four-team deal that would've seen Iverson sent to Detroit was agreed upon, only to see it dissolve due to salary cap problems. When it became clear Iverson was staying in Philadelphia, he and Brown worked to patch things up, and the team would reap the benefits in 2000–01. During the 2000–01 season, the 76ers got off to a hot start by winning their first ten games and were never seriously challenged in the Atlantic Division. Larry Brown coached the Eastern Conference All-Stars, and Allen Iverson was named MVP of the All-Star Game. Shortly before the All-Star break, Theo Ratliff was lost for the season with a wrist injury, one that would later prove to be devastating to his future career. Despite holding a 41–14 record and a comfortable lead atop both the Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference standings at the time of the February 22 trade deadline, management felt the team needed an established center to advance deep into the playoffs. On that day, Philadelphia acquired Dikembe Mutombo from the Atlanta Hawks in a deal that sent the injured Ratliff along with Nazr Mohammed, Toni Kukoč, and Pepe Sánchez to Atlanta (Sánchez was reacquired later in the season after the Hawks waived him). The 76ers went on to finish 56–26, good enough for their first Atlantic Division title since 1989–90 and top seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs. In the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Indiana yet again. In Game One, the 76ers wasted an 18-point lead and lost, 79–78, when Reggie Miller hit a three-pointer in the closing seconds. Philadelphia fought back and won the next three games to win the series. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the 76ers squared off against the Toronto Raptors and their superstar, Vince Carter. The teams alternated wins in the first four games, with Iverson scoring 54 points in Philadelphia's Game Two victory. A Game Five win with Iverson scoring 52 in a 121–88 rout, and a Game Six loss set up a decisive Game Seven, which the 76ers survived as Carter missed a long jump shot at the buzzer for an 88–87 victory that sent the 76ers to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Milwaukee Bucks. After the teams split the first two games of the series in Philadelphia, it was learned Iverson would miss Game Three due to various nagging injuries that had plagued him late in the season. Though most predicted a Milwaukee cakewalk, the 76ers kept the game close before falling, 80–74. Philadelphia seemed to gain momentum despite the loss, and they would win Games Four and Five. Milwaukee put any Sixer celebration plans on hold by building up a 33-point lead in the third quarter of Game Six, but the 76ers would make a furious fourth-quarter rally before falling 110–100. Struggling in the series up to that point, Iverson scored 26 points in the final quarter to finish with 46 on the night and appeared to have gotten a second wind. In Game Seven, the Bucks jumped out to a 34–25 second-quarter advantage before seldom-used reserve Raja Bell scored 10 points to spark a 23–4 run that gave Philadelphia the lead for good. Iverson scored 44 points and the 76ers pulled away in the second half, winning by a 108–91 score to put them in the NBA Finals for the first time since 1983. As had been the case in their three previous Finals appearances, their opponent would be the Los Angeles Lakers, who had run up an 11–0 record in the first three rounds of the playoffs and were expected by many to make quick work of a worn-down 76ers squad. Because of a seemingly meaningless loss to the lowly Chicago Bulls in the regular season finale with both the 76ers and the Lakers finishing with identical 56–26 records, though Los Angeles was awarded a higher seed based on tiebreakers, the NBA Finals marked the first time in the 2001 playoffs in which the 76ers had to start a series on the road. In Game 1, the Lakers jumped out to an 18–5 lead, but the 76ers stormed back to take a 15-point lead in the second half. Los Angeles rallied to force a 94–94 tie at the end of regulation before scoring the first five points of the overtime period, but the 76ers closed the game on a 13–2 run for a 107–101 triumph. Iverson hit a go-ahead three-pointer with 1:19 to go in the extra period, and followed that with a jump shot after which he infamously stepped over Tyronn Lue after making the basket. Eric Snow hit a running jump shot in the waning seconds with the shot clock expiring to clinch the stunning victory. The series would come back to Philadelphia even as Los Angeles took Game Two, 98–89. In Game Three, Shaquille O'Neal fouled out late in the fourth quarter, and the 76ers pulled to within a point with less than a minute to play after trailing by 12 earlier in the second half. Robert Horry hit a clutch three-pointer in that final minute, and the Lakers prevailed, 96–91. Los Angeles wrapped up the second of what would be three consecutive NBA titles with a 100–86 win in Game Four and a 108–96 victory in Game Five. In addition to their Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference titles, the 2000–01 76ers featured the NBA's MVP (Iverson), Coach of the Year (Brown), Defensive Player of the Year (Mutombo), and Sixth Man of the Year (Aaron McKie). The 76ers went into the 2001–02 season with high expectations, but were able to produce only a 43–39 record, sixth in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia was defeated 3–2 by the Boston Celtics. In the 2002–03 season, the 76ers sprinted to a 15–4 start, but a 10–20 swoon left them 25–24 at the All-Star break. After the break, the 76ers caught fire, winning nine in a row at one point, and 23 of their last 33 to finish at 48–34, earning the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Iverson scored 55 points in the playoff opener against the New Orleans Hornets[28] and the 76ers went on to win the series in six games. In the second round, the Detroit Pistons ended Philadelphia's playoff run in a frustrating six-game series that saw the 76ers lose twice in overtime, and once on a last-second shot in regulation. It would be nine years before the 76ers won another playoff series. On Memorial Day, 2003, Brown abruptly resigned as head coach, taking over the reins in Detroit a few days later. Brown's Pistons would win the 2004 NBA Championship over the Los Angeles Lakers, in some ways avenging his loss to them in 2001. After being turned down by Jeff Van Gundy and Eddie Jordan, the 76ers hired Randy Ayers, an assistant coach under Brown, as their new head coach. Ayers lasted only 52 games and was fired with the team's record at 21–31. Chris Ford took over, but the 76ers finished the 2003–04 season at 33–49, missing the playoffs for the first time in six years. Iverson, who was at odds with Ford throughout the interim coach's tenure, played only 48 games in a stormy, injury-plagued season. For the 2004–05 season, Philadelphia native Jim O'Brien was named head coach. Iverson was moved back to point guard and flourished, having arguably his finest season. He also impressed many with his willingness to get other players involved in the offense. During this season, Philadelphia acquired Chris Webber in a trade with the Sacramento Kings, with the hopes that the team had at long last found a consistent second scoring option to complement Iverson. Andre Iguodala, Philadelphia's first-round pick in the 2004 NBA draft, was named to the All-Rookie First Team, and the 76ers returned to the postseason with a 43–39 record. In the first round, they were defeated in five games by the defending NBA Champion Pistons, coached by Larry Brown. Though in the 2004–05 season the 76ers exceeded many on-court expectations, there was a great deal of behind-the-scenes tension between O'Brien, his players, and the front office. Shortly after the season ended, O'Brien was fired and replaced by the popular Maurice Cheeks, who played for the team from 1978 to 1989, and was the starting point guard for the 1983 NBA Champions. The coaching change did not help the team's fortunes for the 2005–06 season. A 2–10 stretch in March doomed them to missing the playoffs for the second time in three years with a 38–44 record. With the opening of the 2006–07 season, the 76ers started out hot, going 3–0 for the first time since making it to the Finals five years previously. They stumbled through the first half of the season and did not recover, finishing 35–47, good for third in the Atlantic Division, and ninth in the Eastern Conference (tied with Indiana). On December 5, 2006, disappointed with the direction the team was headed, Allen Iverson gave the 76ers management an ultimatum: find players who will help support me or trade me. This was confirmed via an in-game interview with team owner, Ed Snider.[29] On December 19, 2006, Allen Iverson, along with Ivan McFarlin, were sent to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for guard Andre Miller, forward Joe Smith, and two first-round draft picks. Then, on January 11, the 76ers' general manager Billy King announced that the 76ers and aging forward Chris Webber had agreed to a buyout of the remainder of his contract. The 76ers paid Webber $36 million over the next 1½ seasons, which is $7 million less than he would have been paid to play. After the buyout, the 76ers waived Webber, making him a free agent. Webber signed with the Detroit Pistons shortly thereafter. The moves allowed the 76ers to make Iguodala the unquestioned leader of the team, and evaluate whether they saw him as a franchise player. They finished the year 35–47. In 2007, the 76ers drafted small forward Thaddeus Young with the 12th pick. On December 4, 2007, the 76ers fired King and replaced him with Nets' general manager Ed Stefanski.[30] With Iguodala, the 76ers clinched a playoff berth with a win over the Atlanta Hawks on April 4, 2008. It was their first postseason appearance since 2005, as well as the first in the post-Iverson era. They were eliminated by the Pistons in six games, with Detroit winning the series 4–2. Even with this elimination, many fans considered this to be a successful season, considering that the 76ers were 12 games under .500 in early February and went on make the playoffs and a 40–42 record. On July 9, 2008, the 76ers signed power forward Elton Brand to a five-year, $79.795 million contract,[31] after trading Rodney Carney[32] and renouncing their rights to all their unrestricted free agents.[33] Brand had originally opted out of his contract with the Los Angeles Clippers, looking to re-sign with them.[34] But the 76ers offered him more money (he regarded their offer as the \"Philly-Max\") and a better chance at winning an NBA championship by playing in the Eastern Conference. This move has been the subject of controversy since there were rumors that he and Baron Davis had made a friendly agreement to play together for the Clippers.[35] The team later signed free agent point guard Royal Ivey of the Milwaukee Bucks,[36] Kareem Rush from the Indiana Pacers,[37] and then signed former Sixer Theo Ratliff after Jason Smith's injury. Donyell Marshall was signed on September 2, 2008, after he stated to his agent that he wanted to go back home and end his career in Philadelphia.[38] Rush, Ivey, Ratliff and Marshall were all paid the veteran's minimum salary, but they were to be contributors to a team on the rise. During the off-season, they also re-signed restricted free agents Lou Williams and Andre Iguodala for five years/$25 million[39] and six years/$80 million, respectively.[40] The 76ers started the year with a 9–14 record before firing head coach Maurice Cheeks on December 13. Assistant general manager Tony DiLeo took over, and the 76ers gradually improved. They finished the season with a 41–41 record, with a 32–27 record under DiLeo. Brand's first season with the 76ers ended early with a right shoulder injury that required surgery. Despite the loss of Brand, the 76ers still managed to fight their way into the playoffs. However, they did not find much success, as they were knocked out of the first round by the Orlando Magic; the 76ers had led 2–1 after three games, but the Magic won three straight to eliminate the 76ers from the playoffs. It was also during this season that the 76ers played one home game at their old home, the Wachovia Spectrum. The 76ers won 104–101 over the Chicago Bulls on March 13, 2009. The game was played to provide the final curtain call on the Spectrum, which was scheduled to be imploded on New Year's Eve 2009. Following the playoff loss, Tony DiLeo returned to his front office job, creating a head coaching vacancy. Former Washington Wizards coach Eddie Jordan was introduced as the 76ers' new coach on June 1, 2009.[41] In the 2009 off-season, the 76ers drafted UCLA point guard Jrue Holiday with the 17th pick. The 76ers also traded power forward Reggie Evans to the Toronto Raptors for a three-point specialist, small forward Jason Kapono, who had won back-to-back three-point shootouts in 2007 and 2008.[42] The off-season also marked the return of the 1977–97 76ers logo, along with a redesigned court and new uniforms updating the 1980s ones.[43] On December 2, 2009, the Philadelphia 76ers announced that they had signed Iverson to a one-year prorated $1.3 million non-guaranteed contract.[44] The 76ers were 5–13 at the time and had lost Williams for at least 30 games to injury.[45] Iverson made his \"re-debut\" for the 76ers against the team he was traded to, the Denver Nuggets, to a thunderous ovation from the sell-out crowd, scoring 11 points, with six assists and five rebounds.[46] The euphoria that greeted Iverson's return to the 76ers faded quickly. On February 22, Iverson announced he was leaving the 76ers indefinitely to attend to his daughter's illness, and a few weeks later the 76ers announced that Iverson would not return for the rest of the season. The 76ers finished the season with a record of 27–55, their first 50-loss season since 1998. Most cited the reason behind this as the players' inability to play within Eddie Jordan's Princeton offense, with several players unhappy with his system. Hours after the 76ers' last game at Orlando on April 14, the team fired Jordan after one season. He was the fourth coach to be fired after one season or less since Larry Brown left the team in 2003.[47] On May 20, 2010, TNT analyst Doug Collins was named head coach of the 76ers.[48] Collins played for the 76ers for his entire NBA career after being the first overall pick in the 1973 draft, and had previously coached the Chicago Bulls, Detroit Pistons, and the Washington Wizards. The 76ers had the sixth-best odds at receiving the top pick in the 2010 draft, and they managed to land the second overall pick, beating out the Warriors, Kings, Timberwolves, and Nets, who all had better odds. They used that draft pick to select Ohio State University's Evan Turner. The 76ers started the season with an uninspiring 3–13 mark, but started turning things around, to finish with a 41–41 record. They clinched a playoff berth on April 1, 2011, their third in the last four years. The 76ers faced the heavily favored Heat in the first round, and ultimately fell to them in five games. Although they lost the series, Collins was praised for turning around a lottery team in his first season, as well as winning a playoff game when many pundits predicted that the 76ers would be swept. Collins also finished second in Coach of the Year voting. On July 13, 2011, Comcast-Spectacor reached an agreement to sell the 76ers to an investment group led by Apollo Global Management co-founder Josh Harris for $280 million.[49][50] Other members of the group included David Blitzer, Art Wrubel, Jason Levien, Adam Aron, Martin Geller, David Heller, James Lassiter, Marc Leder, Michael Rubin, Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Erick Thohir.[51][52] Harris decided to retain head coach Doug Collins and president of basketball operations Rod Thorn but fired Ed Stefanski, who served as general manager since 2007. For the season, the 76ers had their best start since 2000–01 with a 20–9 record, battling for the Eastern Conference's best record and taking a firm division lead. They finished the rest of the season 15–22, giving them a 35–31 record. Attributed to their lack of offense, the 76ers lost hold of the top-three seed and division championship that they held for most of the season, by going on the losing streak. Nevertheless, they clinched their fourth playoff berth in the last five years on the penultimate play date of the season. Philadelphia earned the eighth seed in the 2012 NBA playoffs, facing the first-seeded Bulls. Philadelphia improved from their struggles in the second half of the regular season, beating Chicago 4–2 to win their first series since 2003. This was the fifth time in NBA history that an eight seed has beaten a one seed. They then faced their rival, the Boston Celtics, in the second round, and were eliminated 4–3. The 76ers again faced criticism for their lack of a true scorer, as they were not able to keep pace with the Celtics' scoring. In an effort to re-tool for the upcoming season, The 76ers selected Maurice Harkless, and Arnett Moultrie (via trade with Miami) in the 2012 NBA draft. The 76ers then used their amnesty clause on Brand, traded for Dorell Wright, signed Nick Young, Kwame Brown, and Ivey, and re-signed Spencer Hawes, while Lavoy Allen, Williams, and Jodie Meeks left through free agency. On August 9, 2012, the 76ers agreed to a four-team trade with the Los Angeles Lakers, the Magic, and the Nuggets. In the trade that sent six-time All-Star Dwight Howard to the Lakers, Philadelphia agreed to send 2011 first-round pick Nikola Vučević, 2012 first-round draft pick Harkless, and a future first-round draft pick to Orlando, as well as All-Star swingman Iguodala to Denver. In exchange, they received Jason Richardson from the Magic and All-Star center Andrew Bynum from the Los Angeles Lakers.[53] The 76ers started the 2012–13 season with high expectations with the help of Bynum and the growth of the young 76ers. Bynum's debut with the 76ers took a hit when he was sidelined for precautionary reasons, in relation to the Orthokine knee procedure he received during the off-season. At first it looked like Bynum would be out only shortly, but little success in healing and setbacks pushed Bynum's return date further and further. As a result of many setbacks, on March 19, the 76ers announced that Bynum would have season-ending surgery on both knees.[54] Bynum was not the only Sixer to suffer through injuries. On February 8, Richardson also went through a season-ending knee surgery.[55] Holiday, Thaddeus Young, Nick Young, and Ivey also had injuries that sidelined them for weeks. By the end of the season, Turner and Hawes were the only 76ers to play in every game during the season. The 76ers started the season 12–9 but stumbled through a tough stretch and could not recover. The 76ers finished the season 34–48, missing the playoffs for the first time since Collins had taken over as head coach. On April 18, Collins resigned as 76ers coach, citing his declining health and need to spend time with his grandchildren. He stayed with the team as an adviser.[56] Soon after, general manager DiLeo had \"cut ties\" with the team. On May 11, it was announced that Sam Hinkie, who had previously worked for the Houston Rockets, would replace DiLeo as general manager.[57] On July 8, it was announced that Adam Aron had stepped down as CEO and was being replaced by Scott O'Neil. Following the 2012–13 season, the 76ers, led by Hinkie, chose to shift in the direction of rebuilding the franchise. Tony Wroten, guard for the 76ers, referred to the major rebuilding culture surrounding Philadelphia as \"The Process\".[58][59] The first move of this new plan was executed during the 2013 draft, when the 76ers agreed in principle to trade All-Star Jrue Holiday and the 42nd pick in the draft, Pierre Jackson, to the New Orleans Pelicans for Nerlens Noel and the Pelicans' 2014 first-round pick. The trade was later made official on July 12.[60] The trade was seen by some[who?] as somewhat surprising, as Holiday had been the team's marquee player and was coming off a season that saw him make his first NBA All-Star Game. Additionally, Noel was recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury suffered while in college, strongly indicating that he would not be able to make an immediate impact for the 76ers as he would be inactive to start the season. The 76ers used the 11th pick in the draft to select Michael Carter-Williams as Holiday's replacement as the starting point guard. The 76ers chose Arsalan Kazemi with the 54th overall pick, making Kazemi the first Iranian chosen in the NBA draft.[61] Following the Holiday trade, many of the team's returning players were either waived or left the team in free agency, most notably Andrew Bynum; of the 15 players on the team's roster during their final game of the 2012–13 season, only six remained with the team by January 1, 2014. In their place were a number of young prospects, many coming from the NBA Development League or signing with the 76ers after playing limited roles on other teams. Further moves at the trade deadline on February 20, 2014, saw the exits of veterans Spencer Hawes, Evan Turner, and Lavoy Allen, all of whom were key rotational players. The 76ers had a 3–0 start that included wins over the two-time defending champion Miami Heat and a Chicago Bulls team with high expectations. The 76ers struggled heavily after that, at one point posting a 26-game losing streak which set a franchise record,[62] and tied the all-time NBA record for most consecutive losses in a single-season.[63] The 76ers finished the season with a 19–63 record, the third-worst in franchise history. Despite that, the 76ers did not have the worst win–loss record in the overall NBA standings: the Milwaukee Bucks finished worse with a 15–67 record. Carter-Williams led all rookies in points, rebounds, assists, and steals, joining Magic Johnson and Oscar Robertson as the only rookies to accomplish this feat.[64] He also won the player of the week award in his first week, being the second rookie after Shaquille O'Neal to accomplish that.[65] He went on to win the Rookie of the Year award, becoming the first rookie drafted 10th or later to win the award since Mark Jackson in 1987 for the New York Knicks.[64] In the 2014 NBA draft, the Sixers selected Joel Embiid with the third overall pick and traded with the Orlando Magic for Croatian prospect Dario Šarić, the twelfth pick of the draft. Neither prospect was expected to make an immediate impact for the Sixers, as Embiid was recovering from a stress fracture in the navicular bone, while Šarić would likely spend one or more years playing in the Turkish Basketball League.[66] In the second round, the Sixers selected K. J. McDaniels, Jerami Grant, Jordan McRae, and Serbian prospect Vasilije Micić. The Sixers also traded a second-round pick to re-acquire Jackson from the Pelicans.[67] In the 2014 off-season, the Sixers traded Thaddeus Young to Minnesota in the Kevin Love to Cleveland trade, and received the Heat's 2015 first-round draft pick, Luc Mbah a Moute and Alexey Shved, leaving only two players with three years of experience on the Sixers remaining. On November 29, 2014, the 76ers lost to the Dallas Mavericks 103–110 and set a franchise record for losses to start the season, as they fell to a record of 0–16.[68] After losing their next game against the San Antonio Spurs to make it 0–17, the 76ers were on the verge of tying the NBA record of 18 straight losses to start a season if they lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 3, but they broke their losing streak and won their first game of the 2014–15 season with an 85–77 victory at Minnesota.[69] A new training complex was opened in Camden, New Jersey, in September 2016. In three deals at the 2015 NBA trade deadline, the 76ers traded Carter-Williams and McDaniels for JaVale McGee, Isaiah Canaan, and three draft picks, including a protected 2015 first-round pick originally owned by the Los Angeles Lakers. The Sixers finished the season with an 18–64 record, tied with the second-worst in franchise history since 1995–96. Despite that, the Sixers did not have the worst win–loss record in the overall NBA standings: the Timberwolves fared worse with a 16–66 record and Knicks fared second with 17–65 record. On May 19, the 76ers were awarded the third overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft, where they selected Duke center Jahlil Okafor with the third overall pick. The 76ers also signed JP Tokoto with the 58th overall pick. On November 27, the 76ers lost to the Houston Rockets 116–114, giving them a 27-game losing streak dating back to the previous season, which became the longest losing streak in professional sports. During the same game, the Sixers set a franchise record of 16 three pointers made during the losing effort. On December 1, the 76ers beat the Lakers at home by a score of 103–91, but not before setting a league record 28 consecutive losses dating to the 2014–15 season. In doing so, the 76ers also managed to avoid setting a new NBA record of most losses to begin a season. They instead tied the old record of 18 losses set by the then-New Jersey Nets in the 2009–10 season.[70] On December 8, the 76ers announced that they would hire Jerry Colangelo, chairman of the board of directors for USA Basketball, as the Special Advisor to the Managing General Partner and Chairman of Basketball Operations.[71] In the first move the team made after hiring Colangelo, they traded two second-round draft picks to the Pelicans in return for point guard Ish Smith.[72] On March 1, 2016, the 76ers, at the time with a record of 8–51, missed the playoffs for the fourth straight season. The 76ers finished the season 10–72. On April 6, 2016, Sam Hinkie resigned by way of a 7,000 word letter of resignation.[73] On April 10, 2016, Bryan Colangelo, the son of Jerry Colangelo, was named president of basketball operations.[74] In the NBA Draft Lottery, the Philadelphia 76ers earned the first pick in the draft, after they had a 25% chance of earning the spot. On June 23, 2016, following the 2015–16 season, and after the 76ers were awarded the first overall pick in the 2016 draft, the team selected LSU Point Forward Ben Simmons first overall. The Sixers also selected French basketball player Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and Turkish basketball player Furkan Korkmaz with the 24th and 26th picks in the 2016 NBA draft respectively.[75] Many consider the 2016 NBA Draft a turning point for the 76ers after their three seasons of not being competitive resulted in the franchise garnering the first overall pick, the first time the team owned the first since 1996 when the 76ers selected point guard Allen Iverson first overall.[76] The Sixers subsequently traded for another number one pick in the 2017 NBA draft, choosing Markelle Fultz.[77] The 2017–18 season was the most successful season since the 2011–12 season as the team finished the regular season in third place in the Eastern Conference with a 52–30 winning record and clinched a playoff spot.[78] The season also saw the 76ers reaching a franchise-record 16-game winning streak.[79] In the First Round of the playoffs, the Sixers defeated the Heat in five games, to win their first playoff series since the 2011–12 season. Following a controversy involving fake Twitter accounts, the 76ers parted ways with general manager Bryan Colangelo on June 7, 2018.[80] The team promoted Elton Brand from executive vice president of basketball operations to fill the vacant general manager role on September 18, 2018.[81] On November 12, 2018, the 76ers traded Šarić, Robert Covington, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round draft pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton.[82] On February 6, 2019, the 76ers acquired forward Tobias Harris, as well as Boban Marjanović and Mike Scott, in a trade with the Los Angeles Clippers, sending Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, a protected 2020 first-round pick, Miami's unprotected 2021 first-round pick and Detroit's 2021 and 2023 second-round picks to the Clippers.[83] The 76ers completed the season as the third seed. In the playoffs, they beat the Brooklyn Nets in five games in the first round and faced the second-seeded Toronto Raptors in the second round. The series went to seven games, which the 76ers lost 4–3, when Kawhi Leonard made a game-winning buzzer-beater in game 7 in Toronto.[citation needed] In the off-season, Jimmy Butler left to sign with the Miami Heat in a sign and trade that brought Josh Richardson to Philadelphia. The team also signed Al Horford.[citation needed] On November 25, 2019, the 76ers made history by signing a sports betting partnership with Fox Bet, the joint venture of online gambling operator The Stars Group and broadcaster Fox Sports. While the NBA has struck a number of partnerships with betting operators following the 2018 US Supreme Court ruling that struck down the federal betting ban, the Fox Bet deal marked the first partnership between a betting operator and an individual NBA team.[84] Before the season, the Sixers were expected to be another championship contender, as they were in the past two seasons, especially with Kawhi Leonard having left the conference.[citation needed][fact or opinion?] The Sixers had one of the worst away records in the NBA, but their league-best home record, with only 2 losses, kept the team afloat in the playoff race. Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the 76ers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season.[85] The Sixers started the bubble in the sixth seed, tied with the Pacers, who had the tiebreaker. The regular season finished with the 76ers in the sixth seed, a notable decrease in position from the previous two seasons. In the first round of the playoffs, the 76ers were eliminated by the Celtics in a 4–0 sweep. Head coach Brett Brown was fired on August 24, 2020.[citation needed] On October 3, 2020, the 76ers hired Doc Rivers as their new head coach.[86] On November 2, the 76ers hired Daryl Morey to be their president of basketball operations.[87] The 76ers went 49–23 and clinched the first seed in the Eastern Conference, capturing the division title for the first time in 20 years. In the opening round, they defeated the Washington Wizards in five games but lost to the Atlanta Hawks in the Conference Semifinals in seven games.[88] Franchise player Joel Embiid, placed second in the voting for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for the 2020–21 regular season behind first-placed winner Nikola Jokić.[89] After the Game 7 loss to the Hawks in which Ben Simmons controversially passed on an open dunk to tie the game, Simmons demanded a trade and held out from participating in training camp.[90][91] The 76ers fined Simmons for conduct detrimental to the team, reportedly in excess of $19 million.[92] On February 10, 2022, the 76ers acquired James Harden and Paul Millsap from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Simmons, Andre Drummond, Seth Curry, and two first-round picks.[93] The 2021–22 season finished with a 51–31 record, led by Embiid, Harden, and second-year shooting guard Tyrese Maxey. Embiid won the scoring title averaging 30.6 points per game.[94] In a repeat of the previous season's MVP race, Embiid finished second in the 2021–22 NBA Most Valuable Player Award contest behind Nikola Jokić.[95] On June 24, the Sixers traded Danny Green and the 23rd pick of the draft who would turn out to be David Roddy for De'Anthony Melton. In a four team trade, the 76ers acquired Jalen McDaniels but had to give up perimeter defender Matisse Thybulle who got traded to the Portland Trail Blazers. The 2022–23 season was successful for the Sixers. They clinched a Playoff Spot on March 21. They finished the season 54–28 as the third seed. After sweeping the Brooklyn Nets, the Boston Celtics prevailed in 7 Games and gave the Sixers another second-round exit. Despite this, Joel Embiid was named league MVP.[citation needed] On May 16, 2023, head coach Doc Rivers was fired and replaced by Nick Nurse on June 1. The Sixers traded James Harden, P. J. Tucker and Filip Petrušev to the Los Angeles Clippers for Marcus Morris, Robert Covington, and Nicolas Batum. The Sixers started the season 29–13 as the second seed in the East, but Joel Embiid tore his Lateral Meniscus. Embiid returned on March 5. During Joel's absence, the Sixers fell to the 8th Seed and Tyrese Maxey made his first All-Star game. They finished the season as the 7th seed with a record of 47–35, qualifying for the Play-in game. The Sixers made it out of the Play-In, beating the Miami Heat to advance to the playoffs but were beaten 4–2 in the first round by the New York Knicks.[96] That offseason, Paul George signed a four-year max contract deal with the Sixers.[97] They also resigned Kyle Lowry and acquired Eric Gordon.[98][99] Tobias Harris also signed with the Pistons.[100] The Philadelphia 76ers' original logo featured a stylized red \"7\" and blue \"6\" with 13 blue stars above the \"7\" to represent the original 13 American colonies. During this period the franchise employed many uniform changes. The original uniform featured \"PHILA\" in front and the aforementioned 13 stars encircling the \"76\" on the shorts and the uniform number at the back. Monochrome red letters were emblazoned on either the blue road or white home uniform, and were written in a similar manner as the logo.[101] During the 1965–66 season, the Sixers experimented with a two-tone design. The home white uniform now had a thick red band across the abdomen, while the road uniform featured red tops and blue shorts. \"PHILA\" was positioned below the uniform number. Players disliked the design and was replaced after only one season.[101][102] The Sixers unveiled a cleaner design for the 1966–67 season, with \"PHILA\" in red block letters and trimmed in either white or blue. \"PHILA\" was also moved back above the number. The logo and stars were removed in favor of simple side stripes. Initially, the Sixers wore blue uniforms on the road, but in 1968, they changed back to red uniforms with \"PHILA\" in white with blue trim.[101][103] For the 1970–71 season, the Sixers tinkered with their red uniforms, switching the color scheme on the letters to blue with white trim. Meanwhile, the white uniform received a more radical makeover, featuring the full name \"Seventy Sixers\" in red cursive lettering with blue trim. This set lasted for only one season.[101][103][104] The 1971–72 season saw the Sixers return to wearing blue uniforms on the road. After sporting \"PHILA\" on the chest for eight seasons, the uniform now read \"Sixers\" in Art Deco style lettering, rendered in white on the road and red at home. Numbers were either white or blue with red trim. Contrasting side stripes were added and extended through the uniform, and either red or white stars were placed on each side. Prior to the 1976–77 season, the Sixers tweaked the uniform, now sporting a block \"Sixers\" wordmark and rounded numbers. The following season, the \"Sixers\" wordmark was changed to Bookman Old Style; on both iterations, \"Sixers\" became blue with red trim on the white uniform, with an additional outline on the latter.[101][105] In 1977, the Sixers logo was tweaked to include a white basketball with blue outlines and the suffix \"-ers\" in blue, completing the team nickname. The following season saw the team go back to basics with their uniforms. Starting with the 1978–79 season, the Sixers wore a cleaner uniform design reminiscent of their late 1960s outfits. Side stripes were eliminated and the team logo was emblazoned on the right leg. The road uniform color was changed back to red (with the lettering scheme similar to the 1968–70 red uniforms), and the numbers revert to a block letter style.[101][106] Before the 1991–92 season, the Sixers experimented with a more radical uniform design. The front featured a blue wave with red, white and blue stars, and \"Sixers\" in Helvetica was affixed above the blue wave. The full city name \"Philadelphia\" was also added above the team name. The numbers contained drop shadows.[101][107] After wearing the graphic-laden design for three seasons, the Sixers changed to a more basic look entering the 1994–95 season. The design contained thick blue stripes within either thin red or white stripes, and the letters were changed to a more classic rounded style. Numbers were now rendered in blue on both uniforms with either white or red trim, and the white uniform again featured \"Sixers\" in red letters with white and blue trim.[101][108] In the 1997–98 season, the Sixers drastically changed their logo and colors in an effort to appeal to the more youthful hip-hop-oriented culture. Red, white and blue were retained, but only as trim colors. Instead, the Sixers used black, silver and gold as its core colors, with the logo now featuring 76ers in gold, a single silver star within the 7, and a streaking basketball below the logo. The black road uniforms remained largely unchanged throughout this span, with the letters in white with red trim. The white home uniform, on the other hand, featured some subtle changes. While the letters were in black with red trim, the \"Sixers\" logo was initially gold, but in 2000, the color was changed as black. Also in 2000, the black background and red outline within the \"Sixers\" logo were removed. A blue alternate uniform was introduced in the same year, with the letters in white with red trim; the arm piping was removed after only one season. All three designs contained a gold star on the neckline, added the alternate \"streaking 76\" logo on the shorts, and featured the \"Sixers\"logo written in the same manner as the logo, with the silver star affixed atop the \"I\".[101][109] In 2006, the Sixers replaced the blue alternates with a red one, bringing back the \"PHILA\" logo for the first time since 1971. As with the other uniforms, the \"PHILA\" wordmark was shaped similarly to the team logo, with the silver star atop the \"I\". White numbers with black trim were placed on this uniform, along with a silver star on the neckline and blue and white striping. The next season saw some minor tweaks to the black and white uniforms, which now featured the same striping patterns as the red alternate along with the silver star.[101][109] During the 2008–09 season, while the previous logo was still in use, the 1977–97 Sixers logo was revived to coincide with the team's 60th anniversary (counting the Syracuse years). After that, the team decided to bring back a modern version of said logo, with the addition of a red square and 'Philadelphia' inside a blue rectangle below it, although the partial logo without the square, city name and rectangles was also used.[110] The white uniform featured \"Sixers\" in blue and numbers in red, both returning to a block letter style. The red uniform contained both the \"Sixers\" and the uniform number in white. In 2011, a blue alternate uniform was introduced, mirroring that of the red uniform. After 2013, the blue uniform became the primary road set. All three designs employed a more subtle striping along the arms and legs.[111][109] A new version of the classic 76ers logo was unveiled for the 2015–16 season, featuring a slight tilt to the white basketball and a roundel featuring the city name and six stars. A secondary \"Dribbling Ben Franklin\" logo was also introduced.[112] The home white, away blue and red alternate uniforms featured a mix of classic styles used in previous uniforms. The home white and away blue uniforms featured the 'PHILA' wordmark as homage to the late 1960s uniforms, while the red alternates featured the 'SIXERS' wordmark in tribute to the 1980s uniforms. Side stripes featuring seven stars on one side and six on the other pay homage to the 1970s uniforms, while the shoulder piping was a callback to the 1980s uniforms. The inscription 'PHILA TOUGH' is sewed on the bottom of all uniforms.[113] The switch to Nike in 2017 saw the Sixers make some slight tweaks to their uniform set. The blue \"Icon\" uniform and the white \"Association\" uniform now feature a red drop shadow on the lettering, and the inscription 'Brotherly Love' replaced 'PHILA TOUGH' near the manufacturer's tag.[114][115] The Sixers also released their new red \"Statement\" uniform, featuring a script \"Sixers\" wordmark, off-centered numbers and blue drop shadows.[116] Prior to the 2019–20 season the red uniforms were tweaked to feature a script \"Phila\" wordmark.[117] The team's first annual \"City\" uniform features an ornate \"Phila\" lettering, blue numbers with red drop shadows, and other elements inspired from the American Declaration of Independence in 1776.[118] Their second \"City\" uniform, inspired by the 1976 film Rocky, shows thirteen stars to represent the Thirteen Colonies. It was based on Rocky because it was from \"'76\".[119] By virtue of qualifying for the 2018 playoffs, the Sixers were also given an \"Earned\" uniform in the 2018–19 season. The Sixers' \"Earned\" uniforms were similar to the Rocky \"City\" uniforms, except that the base was white and the lettering and stars were in blue.[120] The Sixers' \"City\" uniform for the 2019–20 season paid homage to the Liberty Bell, featuring an ornate \"Philadelphia\" wordmark and red serifed numbers. The gold bell silhouette is prominently featured on the beltline.[121] The 2020–21 \"City\" uniform paid homage to the Allen Iverson era and the Boathouse Row landmark, featuring a black base with red, blue and white accents. The Boathouse Row illustration is drawn in white above \"Philadelphia\" in white with blue drop shadows. The numbers, also in white with blue drop shadows, are placed on the left chest.[122] The Sixers' \"Earned\" uniform for 2021 (after qualifying in the 2020 playoffs) featured a blue silhouette of the Liberty Bell on a white background, with white numbers placed in the middle.[123] In commemoration of the NBA's 75th anniversary, the 2021–22 \"City\" uniforms featured elements of previous uniform designs (a.k.a. \"Mixtape\"). The Sixers' edition featured a navy blue base and red lettering taken from the 1972–77 uniforms. Red, orange, green and blue blocks on each side paid tribute to the team's former home, the Spectrum, and also represented fan support for each of Philadelphia's \"Big Four\" teams (red representing the Phillies, orange representing the Flyers, green representing the Eagles, and blue representing the 76ers). The Spectrum center court logo, featuring the arena silhouette at the center, adorned the shorts, and the \"S\" from that logo was placed on the waist.[124] The 2022–23 \"City\" uniform centered around Philadelphia's Greek translation of the \"City of Brotherly Love\", which was inscribed in front of the uniform. The mostly minimalist style uniform has a white base, red text and striping, and blue trim, and was inspired by the city's love of basketball in all levels.[125] For the 2023–24 \"City\" uniform, the Sixers again went with the \"City of Brotherly Love\" theme, featuring a letter style inspired by the neon signage of the Reading Terminal Market. The navy-based uniform again incorporated the \"13 star circle\", Liberty Bell silhouette, and the \"Bicentennial 76\" insignia.[126] The \"City\" uniform for the 2024–25 season was based on the 2021–22 \"City\" uniform, albeit in white with blue numbers.[127] On February 10, 2015, Franklin the Dog was introduced as the new Philadelphia 76ers mascot to 400 fans and media at The Franklin Institute. After spending the weekend in New York City for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game as the newest NBA mascot, he then was introduced at Wells Fargo Center in his first game on February 19, 2015. Previously in the 1980s, the Philadelphia 76ers mascot was Big Shot.[128] He was then replaced with Hip Hop, a rabbit that usually, during time-outs or halftime, would do slam dunks. After the 2011 lockout, Hip Hop would not return. The rivalry between the 76ers and Boston Celtics is the earliest dated rivalry in the NBA. The two teams have the most meetings in the NBA Playoffs, playing each other in nineteen series, of which the Celtics have won twelve.[129] It is considered to be the second-greatest rivalry in the NBA, next to the Celtics–Lakers rivalry.[130] The rivalry first peaked when Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell of the Celtics played each other from 1965 to 1968. The 1966–67 Sixers, voted the best team in league history during the NBA's 35th anniversary, set a then-record by winning 68 games in the 81-game season (a record since broken by the Lakers, Bulls and Warriors) and ending Boston's eight-year title reign which led to the infamous \"Boston's Dead!\" chants. The 76ers went through a rebuilding period through the early 1970s, and came back to relevance during the 1976–77 season, in which they defeated the Celtics en route to a Finals appearance. Both teams would peak in the 1980s, with every single Eastern Conference Championship between 1980 and 1987 belonging to either the 76ers or Celtics. The Larry Bird-led Celtics won five of them, while the Julius Erving-led 76ers won the other three. The Charles Barkley-led Sixers of the later 1980s took the fight to the Celtics; neither team experienced much playoff success in the late 1980s, and both took steep nosedives in the Eastern Conference rankings throughout the 1990s. The rivalry was reborn in the 2000s. The first time, the Allen Iverson-led defending-Eastern Conference champions 76ers were defeated in the first round of the 2002 playoffs by the Paul Pierce-led Celtics 3–2. The second time, exactly ten years later, the Big Three Celtics (Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen) defeated the valiant eight seed 76ers team 4–3. In the ten years in between, the Sixers would experience limited success whereas the Celtics won a championship and contended for most of that span. In a memorable 2006 regular season meeting between the two, the 76ers defeated the Celtics 125–124 in triple overtime, with Iverson leading the way with 33 points and 10 assists. List of the last five seasons completed by the 76ers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Philadelphia 76ers seasons. Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage The 76ers' training facility and headquarters for basketball operations are located at the Philadelphia 76ers Training Complex in Camden, New Jersey. In 2014, the 76ers announced their plans to construct a new training complex,[131][132] which was officially opened on September 23, 2016.[133] The team previously practiced at the campus of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine.[134] In July 2022, the Sixers announced plans to construct a $1.3 billion, privately funded arena in Center City, Philadelphia called 76 Place. The construction of the arena is expected to be finished for the 2031–32 NBA season.[135] Roster Last transaction: December 17, 2024 The 76ers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[136] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. All of the 76ers' retired numbers are hanging on the rafters in Wells Fargo Center Notes: Notes: Notes: In September 2016, the 76ers acquired both Team Dignitas and Apex Gaming and merged them under the Dignitas brand, becoming the first North American professional sports team to own an esports team.[144]",

The Philadelphia 76ers will take on the Golden State Warriors on Thursday night for their first of five back-to-backs for the squad in January. The Sixers looked well on their way to their fifth straight win before completely melting down and allowing a 15-0 run to close out an ugly loss. The Sixers were in control for most of the night, but an offensive implosion late cost them a shot at their fifth straight win against the Kings.

Joel Embiid is out as Tyrese Maxey and Paul George will look to lead the Sixers to a win over the De’Aaron Fox, Malik Monk, Domantas Sabonis and the Sacramento Kings. The Sixers have ended 2024 on a high note. With a new year upon us, here are five Sixers things we’d like to see in 2025. The Sixers ended 2024 on a 10-3 surge and will look to keep things rolling in 2025 against a Kings club currently in turmoil. Joel Embiid likely won’t play in a back-to-back this season and so he’ll sit out Wednesday’s game against the Kings and play Thursday at the Warriors. We’re partnering with SalarySwish to help answer your Sixers salary cap questions. Kelly Oubre, Jr. signed late last offseason and Guerschon Yabusele was the last piece to the 2024-25 roster. Both players have been perfect fits on the star-driven Sixers. Guerschon Yabusele has been a bright spot for the Sixers this season, but it might not be easy for them to retain him. The Sixers put together arguably their most dominant performance of the season, beating the Blazers in all four quarters in route to a 125-103 win in Portland Joel Embiid put up 37 points in 35 minutes and the Sixers controlled the game for most of the night as they cruised to their fourth straight win over the Blazers. Can the Sixers, currently riding their first three-game win streak of the season, get their fourth straight W? The Sixers’ three-game winning streak has coincided with Tyrese Maxey’s stellar play, earning the All-Star guard POTW honors. As the NBA trade deadline approaches, the Sixers will be one of the teams at the center of it all. The Sixers should have a good chance to close out 2024 with a win and extend their streak to four. Could Lonnie Walker IV help complete the Sixers’ roster? The Philadelphia 76ers started off a West Coast road trip with a 114-111 win vs. the Utah Jazz on Saturday night. Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey combined for 64 points. It wasn’t pretty but the Sixers will take all the ugly wins they can get as they start off four games out West with a win over the lowly Jazz Saturday night. Joel Embiid, Paul George, Tyrese Maxey all expected to start for the Sixers vs. the Jazz in Utah. Joel Embiid, Paul George, Tyrese Maxey all expected to start for the Sixers vs. the Jazz in Utah The Sixers January schedule is rife with playoff opponents and some back-to-backs. Realistically, this West Coast trip is their best chance to make their move. The NBA’s fifth-oldest player still has it. A resurgent Sixers team will look to continue their recent winning ways against a Jazz club among the worst in the league. Joel Embiid likely knew this fine was coming after his Christmas Day DX chop. After a big Christmas Day performance, Joel Embiid may be on the sidelines in the Sixers’ next game against the Jazz. The Philadelphia 76ers got a glimpse of exactly the player they want Caleb Martin to be for them, all on Christmas Day against Eastern Conference rivals Boston Celtics.

For the third consecutive year, the NFL's Pro Bowl is set to feature a series of games and skills competitions, including dodgeball and flag football. In 2022, the league opted to move away from the single game and instead introduced a new format to show off player's individual skills. Regardless of how the format changes, getting selected to the Pro Bowl is still considered an honor for players. To be named to the NFL's all-star competition matters to players, teams and fans. And of course, every year there are also notable snubs as well. The NFL revealed the AFC and NFC rosters for the 2025 Pro Bowl Games on \"Good Morning Football\" on Thursday, Jan. 2.

These players are not considered Pro Bowl selections unless they get elevated to the event itself. Based on previous years, some of those alternates will almost certainly get to participate in the Pro Bowl. Some players will likely elect to opt out due to injury or other reasons. Those Pro Bowl selections set to play in the Super Bowl will automatically be replaced after the conference championship games are played. MORE: Who are the most notable Pro Bowl snubs?

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Welcome to the Thursday edition of the Pick Six newsletter! The NFL news you've been waiting for is finally here: The 2025 Pro Bowl rosters have been revealed! OK, so that's not actually that exciting, but we do have some exciting stuff in the newsletter today. Not only do we have the results of our latest MVP poll, but we also decided to rank the most important games of Week 18. And yes, we'll also be taking a look at the Pro Bowl rosters, because I know everyone is clamoring to know who made the Pro Bowl and who didn't. As always, here's your daily reminder to tell all your friends to sign up for the newsletter or you can tell people you run into at the grocery store. That also works. To get them signed up, all you have to do is click here. We've had a tight MVP race for most of the season, and if our latest least MVP poll here at CBS Sports is any indication, this thing is going to go down to the wire. To figure out who has the upper hand right now, we rounded up 16 CBSSports.com writers and editors and had them vote on who they think will win the MVP. Under the new voting rules that were implemented last year, the 50 media members who vote on the award will each get to name up to five players on their ballot, so that's exactly how we handled the voting here. Here's a look at our top five heading into Week 18, along with each player's point total. (A player got five points for a first-place vote, four points for a second-place vote and so on.) 1. Ravens QB Lamar Jackson (69 points) 2. Bills QB Josh Allen (64 points) 3. Bengals QB Joe Burrow (43 points)4. Eagles RB Saquon Barkley (36 points)T-5. Lions QB Jared Goff (8 points)T-5. Vikings QB Sam Darnold (8 points) If our poll is any indication, Jackson appears to be the frontrunner, but he's neck-and-neck with Allen. Also, there is definitely some drama here because Allen actually got MORE first-place votes than the Ravens quarterback. On our 16 ballots, Allen got eight first-place votes compared to seven for Jackson (The other one went to Saquon Barkley). A big reason Jackson is ahead of Allen in our poll because he was named on all 16 ballots while Allen was only named on 15 ballots. Jackson has come a long way in a month. Back on Dec. 5, he was only given one first-place vote and that CAME FROM ME. Apparently, I'm driving the Lamar bandwagon. Since then, he's picked up six more first-place votes, and in Week 18, he'll have a chance to sway some more people when the Ravens play the Browns. On the other hand, Josh Allen won't be playing, so Jackson will certainly have a chance to make an MVP statement on Saturday. Overall, a total of 11 players received at least one MVP vote. If you want to see a full list of every player who got a vote, then be sure to click here. Of the four guys who got the most votes in our poll, we had four separate writers make a case for each player, and you can check that out here. There are 11 games being played this weekend that will have playoff implications so Jeff Kerr decided to do us all a favor and rank them from most important to least important. Basically, this is Kerr's way of telling us which games we really need to pay attention to and what games we only kind of need to be paying attention to. Let's check out the top three games on his list: 1. Vikings (14-2) at Lions (14-2), 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC). \"This one is for everything in the NFC, perhaps the best regular-season finale the league has ever had. The winner of this game takes the NFC North and clinches home-field advantage for the NFC playoffs -- along with the lone first-round bye. The loser gets dropped to the No. 5 seed despite having 14 wins, becoming the first 13+ win wild-card team in NFL history.\" 2. Bengals (8-8) at Steelers (10-6), 8 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC). \"The stakes are pretty high for the Bengals in this one, as Cincinnati needs to win in order to keep its playoff hopes alive. Because Cincinnati plays on Saturday, the Bengals can put the pressure on the Broncos and Dolphins to win on Sunday.\" 3. Chiefs (15-1) at Broncos (9-7), 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS). \"The Broncos control all the chaos on the final day of the regular season. All the Broncos have to do is win and they will make the playoffs as the No. 7 seed, the final team into the tournament. If Denver loses, that opens the door for Miami or Cincinnati to get into the playoffs. The Chiefs will be resting their starters, so the pathway is there for Denver to make the playoff.\" As I mentioned at the top, Kerr ranked a total of 11 games and you can check out his full ranking here. The NFL season isn't quite over yet, but we've seen enough to make our All-Rookie Team. The first-rounders in this rookie class might go down as one of the best groups in NFL history. With that in mind, let's take a look at the All-Rookie Team on the offensive side of the ball: QB: Jayden Daniels, CommandersRB: Bucky Irving, BuccaneersRB: Tyrone Tracy, Jr., GiantsWR: Malik Nabers, GiantsWR: Brian Thomas Jr., JaguarsWR: Ladd McConkey, ChargersTE: Brock Bowers, RaidersOT: Roger Rosengarten, RavensOT: Joe Alt, CardinalsOG: Dominick Puni, 49ersOG: Jackson Powers-Johnson, RaidersC: Zach Frazier, Steelers The Rams landed the most players on the All-Rookie Team with four, but you don't see any of those players listed above, because they all came on defense.

There will be 88 players in Orlando for this year's Pro Bowl, and those players were revealed this morning when the NFL announced the official rosters for both the AFC and NFC. The rosters were decided with input from fans, players and coaches, with each group counting one-third toward the vote. Here are a few nuggets about this year's Pro Bowl rosters: If you want to see the full roster for each conference, then be sure to click here. One of the biggest snubs this year was Eagles left tackle Jordan Mailata. If you want to see our full list of snubs, then be sure to head here. Remember, there's no actual Pro Bowl \"game\" this year. Instead of a standard NFL game, the rebranded Pro Bowl Games will be a week-long celebration that will include multiple events. In the week leading up to the game, players will participate in multiple skills competitions (You can check those out here). The week in Orlando will conclude on Feb. 2 with a flag football game between the AFC and NFC. The two teams will once again be coached by Peyton and Eli Manning. Oh, and one thing to keep in mind is that if any team makes the Super Bowl, their players will NOT be participating in the Pro Bowl Games. With only 14 teams making the playoffs, that means the offseason will officially be starting on Monday for the 18 teams that don't make the postseason. Those teams will immediately begin to try and improve their roster for 2025. If you want to be a contender in the NFL, you have to have a good QB, so Cody Benjamin decided to take a look at the QB market for the upcoming offseason. What's going to happen? Here are three big moves that Cody is predicting: Cody made predictions for a total of seven veteran quarterbacks while also predicting where several rookie quarterbacks might land, and you can check out every player on his list by reading his full story here. It's been a busy 24 hours in the NFL, and since it's nearly impossible to keep track of everything that happened, I went ahead and put together a roundup for you. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

Coming off another incredible season on both sides of the ball, the Baltimore Ravens lead all teams with nine Pro Bowlers, followed by the Detroit Lions (seven), Minnesota Vikings (six), Philadelphia Eagles (six), Kansas City Chiefs (five) and Dallas Cowboys (five). Meanwhile, the New York Jets, Miami Dolphins, Tennessee Titans and New Orleans Saints all finished the season with no Pro Bowlers. Chiefs’ tight end Travis Kelce finished first in the fan voting, but Pro Bowl roster selections are based on fan voting, player voting and coach voting, with each holding one-third of a vote towards selection.

What is Net Neutrality? Net Neutrality policies are a national standard by which we ensure that broadband internet service is treated as an essential service. It prohibits internet service providers from blocking, throttling, or engaging in paid prioritization of lawful content. By classifying broadband service as a “telecommunications” service under Title II of the law, the FCC restores its oversight of internet service outages, national security threats in broadband networks, and consumer protection and regains key tools to promote broadband deployment. The Way Forward FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel is working to restore Net Neutrality as the national standard for broadband reliability, security, and consumer protection. The Chairwoman’s proposal would ensure that broadband services are treated as an essential resource deserving of FCC oversight under Title II authority. BROADBAND IS AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE While internet access has long been important to daily life, the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid shift of work, education, and health care online demonstrated how essential broadband internet connections are for consumers’ participation in our society and economy. But even as our society has reconfigured itself to do so much online, our institutions have fallen behind. When Net Neutrality protections are not in place, there is no expert agency ensuring that the internet is fast, open, and fair. Since the birth of the modern internet in the 1990s, the Commission had played that role. OVERSIGHT OF OUTAGES When households and businesses lose internet service, they logically expect that the FCC might be able to help the restoration or at least have information about the outage. By restoring the FCC’s Title II authority over internet service providers, the FCC bolsters its authority to require these companies to address internet outages. Without such authority, the FCC cannot require companies to even report broadband outages, cannot collect outage data, and lacks the authority to consider ways that it can help protect against and recover from internet service outages. NATIONAL STANDARD The FCC would once again prevent broadband providers from blocking, slowing down, or creating pay-to-play internet fast lanes. NATIONAL SECURITY OF BROADBAND NETWORKS In this digital age, there are digital threats. Without broadband oversight, the FCC is unable to monitor and respond to such national security issues. For example, without reclassification, the FCC is limited in its authority to direct foreign-owned companies deemed to be national security threats to discontinue any domestic or international broadband services under Sec. 214 – as they have done with telephone services. In addition, without reclassification, the FCC has limited authority to incorporate updated cybersecurity standards into network policies. CONSUMER PROTECTION Net Neutrality protections would increase the tools the FCC has available to protect consumer data and respond to evolving consumer threats. Broadband providers could not sell your location data, among other sensitive information. And the FCC will be empowered to protect consumers from other harmful practices. “In the wake of the pandemic and the generational investment in internet access, we have a window to update our policies to make sure that the internet is not only open, but fast and fair, safe and secure. I am committed to seizing this opportunity. Now is the time for our rules of the road for internet service providers to reflect the reality that internet access is a necessity for daily life. Let’s get to it.” – FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel What Is ‘Title II’ Authority Title II is the part of the Communications Act that gives the FCC clear authority to serve as a watchdog over the communications marketplace and look out for the public interest. Title II took on special importance in the Net Neutrality debate because the courts have ruled that the FCC has clear authority to enforce open internet policies if broadband internet is classified as a Title II “telecommunications” service.

                "title": "Net neutrality in the United States - Wikipedia",
                "content": "In the United States, net neutrality—the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) should make no distinctions between different kinds of content on the Internet, and to not discriminate based on such distinctions—has been an issue of contention between end-users and ISPs since the 1990s.[1][2][3] With net neutrality, ISPs may not intentionally block, slow down, or charge different rates for specific online content.[4] Without net neutrality, ISPs may prioritize certain types of traffic, meter others, or potentially block specific types of content, while charging consumers different rates for that content.[5] A core issue to net neutrality is how ISPs should be classified under the Communications Act of 1934 as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996: as either Title I \"information services\" or Title II \"common carrier services\". The classification determines the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) authority over ISPs: the FCC would have significant ability to regulate ISPs if classified as common carriers, but would have little control over them if classified as information services. Because the Communications Act has not been amended by Congress to account for ISPs, the FCC had taken the authority to designate how ISPs are classified, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in the case National Cable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services (2005), in addition to choosing what regulations to set on common carriers. The five member FCC commission changes with each new administration, and no more than three members may be of the same political party, thus the FCC's attitudes and rule-making regarding net neutrality shifts relatively frequently through the 2020's. Prior FCC decisions on net neutrality had been upheld due to the Chevron deference principle, where the courts gave preference to administrative agencies' interpretation of applicable law. The Supreme Court case Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024) overturned the Chevron deference, and as a result, the Sixth Circuit ruled in 2025 that the FCC does not have the authority to classify ISPs as Title II services. As such, there is no current federal regulations requiring net neutrality, though some states are implementing their own versions of it. The ideas underlying net neutrality have a long pedigree in telecommunications practice and regulation. Services such as telegrams and the phone network (officially, the public switched telephone network or PSTN) have been considered common carriers under U.S. law since the Mann–Elkins Act of 1910, which means that they have been akin to public utilities and expressly forbidden to give preferential treatment. The Communications Act of 1934 created the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to regulate the industry and ensure fair pricing and access.[6] Different titles of the Act covered different modes of communication, but primary focus on the debate of net neutrality has been on Titles I and II. The Act distinguished between common carriers, who were bound under Title II of the Act, and other telecommunication systems of the time, covered broadly under Title I. Within Title II, common carriers such as the phone networks were to be regulated by the FCC as to assure reasonable pricing rates and non-discriminatory practices. Systems under Title I were left to be unregulated by the FCC. In the late 1980s the Internet became legally available for commercial use, and in the early years of public use of the Internet, this was its main use – public access was limited and largely reached through dial-up modems (as was the Bulletin board system dial-up culture that preceded it). The Internet was viewed more as a commercial service than a domestic and societal system. However, by the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Internet started to become common in households and wider society. Also in the 1980s, arguments about the public interest requirements of the telecommunications industry in the U.S. arose; whether companies involved in broadcasting were best viewed as community trustees, with obligations to society and consumers, or mere market participants with obligations only to their shareholders.[7] The legal debate about net neutrality regulations of the 2000s echoes this debate. By the 1990s, some U.S. politicians began to express concern over protecting the Internet: How can government ensure that the nascent Internet will permit everyone to be able to compete with everyone else for the opportunity to provide any service to all willing customers? Next, how can we ensure that this new marketplace reaches the entire nation? And then how can we ensure that it fulfills the enormous promise of education, economic growth, and job creation? The Communications Act of 1934 was amended with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which besides other provisions, defined \"information services\" as \"the offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications\", and covered only under Title I unregulated by the FCC.[9] In the early 2000s, legal scholars such as Tim Wu and Lawrence Lessig raised the issue of neutrality in a series of academic papers addressing regulatory frameworks for packet networks. Wu is credited with introducing the term \"network neutrality\" in his 2003 paper \"Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination\".[10] Wu had found based on behaviors of broadband providers in the early 2000s that there could be potential for commercial interests to interfere with natural evolution of new innovations on the Internet, such as those using higher bandwidth like voice and video applications. Wu outlined the benefits and drawbacks of governmental regulation for net neutrality, writing \"Communications regulators over the next decade will spend increasing time on conflicts between the private interests of broadband providers and the public’s interest in a competitive innovation environment centered on the Internet.\"[11] Papers from Wu and others in the early 2000s sparked debate among academics in information technology and legal areas to device possible frameworks for net neutrality that could be applied within U.S. laws; these discussions paralleled similar concurrent ones in Europe, though due to its different governmental structure, took on different forms of implementation. Within the U.S., media and politicians learned of these regulatory suggestions, leading to the start of net neutrality principles within the government.[12][13] In the wake of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the introduction of \"information services\" under Title I prompted many cable-based Internet access providers to urge the FCC to classify their services as Title I information services, rather than as cable providers under the Act's Title III which required them to provide open access to other service provides. The FCC took in comments, and after providing its initial findings in 2002, issued \"Inquiry Concerning High-Speed Access to the Internet over Cable and Other Facilities\" in which it had determined that cable ISPs were neither a telecommunications provider (under Title II) nor a cable provider (under Title III) but were solely an information service that fell under Title I and thus could operate unregulated by the FCC.[14] Several non-cable ISPs and other industry groups sued the FCC, challenging this ruling in multiple courts. The cases were consolidated to the Ninth Circuit. In May 2003, the Ninth Circuit vacated the FCC's ruling, stating that cable ISPs had a telecommunications function and thus should be regulated under Title II. The National Cable & Telecommunications Association challenged the ruling, and while the Ninth Circuit refused to rehear the case en banc, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. The Court announced its judgment in June 2005. The 6–3 decision reversed the Ninth Circuit's ruling, deeming that the FCC had properly defined cable ISPs as an information service. The majority opinion relied on the Chevron deference, a principle that the judicial body gives deference to an executive agency's interpretation of legislation outlining its granted powers as long as that interpretation is reasonable and consistent.[15] While the ruling was unfavorable for proponents of net neutrality, Brand X established that the FCC had powers to classify Internet services subject to their interpretation, which has played a key role in how net neutrality has since played out in the United States with changing administrations.[16] The majority opinion in Brand X was authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, who has subsequently stated that he regrets the decision, in his dissent to Baldwin v. United States.[17] In February 2004, then Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell announced a set of non-discrimination principles, which he called the principles of \"Preserving Network Freedom\", based on studies from Tim Wu and Phil Weiser and other academics from the previous years. Powell recognized that it was still early to have a clear picture of what government regulation should be for net neutrality, but agreed that based on practices of broadband operators of the past few years, it was necessary to establish what rights consumers should expect from broadband service. In a speech at the Silicon Flatirons Symposium, Powell encouraged ISPs to offer users these four freedoms:[18] In early 2005, in the Madison River case, the FCC for the first time showed the willingness to enforce its network neutrality principles by opening an investigation about Madison River Communications, a local telephone carrier that was blocking Vonage's voice over IP (VoIP) service in its digital subscriber line (DSL) offering to customers. At the time, while the FCC classified cable providers under Title I as an information provider (as per the Brand X case) and were unregulated, services such as DSL were still considered under Title II as a common carrier, and were bound by non-discriminatory regulation from the FCC.[19] Nevertheless, the FCC's investigation led to a settlement between the FCC and Madison River Communications before any further litigation occurred, with Madison River agreeing to stop blocking VoIP traffic and paying a $15,000 fine.[20] While the action did not set any precedent for the FCC's stance on net neutrality, the Madison River case was an indication the agency was willing to uphold Powell's principles.[21] Shortly after the case was settled, the FCC issued a new rule in 2005 to reclassified DSL as a Title I information service and allowing them to operate unregulated by the FCC.[22][19] In 2004, the court case USTA v. FCC voided the FCC's authority to enforce rules requiring telephone operators to unbundle certain parts of their networks at regulated prices. This caused the economic collapse of many competitive local exchange carriers (CLEC).[23] In the United States, broadband services were historically regulated differently according to the technology by which they were carried. While cable Internet has always been classified by the FCC as an information service free of most regulation, DSL was regulated as a telecommunications service. In 2005, the FCC reclassified Internet access across the phone network, including DSL, as \"information service\" relaxing the common carrier regulations and unbundling requirement.[24] During the FCC's hearing, the National Cable & Telecommunications Association urged the FCC to adopt the four criteria laid out in its 2005 Internet Policy Statement as the requisite openness. This made up a voluntary set of four net neutrality principles.[25] Implementation of the principles was not mandatory; that would require an FCC rule or federal law.[26] The modified principles were as follows:[27][28] In December 2006, the AT&T/Bell South merger agreement defined net neutrality as an agreement on the part of the broadband provider: \"not to provide or to sell to Internet content, application or service providers ... any service that privileges, degrades or prioritizes any (data) packet transmitted over AT&T/BellSouth's wireline broadband Internet access service based on its source, ownership or destination.\"[29] In 2007, Comcast, the largest cable company in the US, was found to be blocking or severely delaying BitTorrent uploads on their network using a technique which involved creating 'reset' packets (TCP RST) that appeared to come from the other party.[30] An August 2007 report by TorrentFreak (based on substantial nationwide research led by chief researcher Andrew Norton) noted that ISPs had been throttling BitTorrent traffic for almost two years, since 2005, but Comcast was completely blocking it in at least some cases.[31] This was later verified by both the EFF[32] and Associated Press.[33] On March 27, 2008, Comcast and BitTorrent reached an agreement to work together on network traffic where Comcast was to adopt a protocol-neutral stance \"as soon as the end of [2008]\", and explore ways to \"more effectively manage traffic on its network at peak times.\"[34] In December 2009, Comcast reached an out-of-court settlement of a class action lawsuit for US$16 million, admitting no wrongdoing[35] and amounting to no more than US$16 per affected account.[36] In August 2008, the FCC made its first Internet network management decision.[37] It voted 3-to-2 to uphold a complaint against Comcast ruling that it had illegally inhibited users of its high-speed Internet service from using file-sharing software because it throttled the bandwidth available to certain customers for video files to ensure that other customers had adequate bandwidth.[38][39] The FCC imposed no fine, but required Comcast to end such blocking in the year 2008, ordered Comcast to disclose the details of its network management practices within 30 days, submit a compliance plan for ending the offending practices by the end of the year, and disclose to the public the details of intended future practices. Then-FCC chairman Kevin J. Martin said the order was meant to set a precedent, that Internet providers and all communications companies could not prevent customers from using their networks the way they see fit, unless there is a good reason. In an interview Martin stated that \"We are preserving the open character of the Internet\" and \"We are saying that network operators can't block people from getting access to any content and any applications.\"[40] In two rulings, in April and June 2010 respectively, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled against the FCC; the April ruling denied to grant the FCC's request for a cease-and-desist order against Comcast related to BitTorrent transfers, while the June ruling vacated the FCC's order against Comcast. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the FCC has no powers to regulate any Internet provider's network, or the management of its practices: \"[the FCC] 'has failed to tie its assertion' of regulatory authority to an actual law enacted by Congress\",[41][42] and that the FCC lacked the authority under Title I to force ISPs to keep their networks open, while employing reasonable network management practices, to all forms of legal content.[43] In wake of the rulings, the FCC stated it would continue its fight for net neutrality.[44] In February 2008, Kevin Martin, then Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said that he is \"ready, willing and able,\" to prevent broadband ISPs from unreasonably interfering with their subscribers' access to content on the internet.[45] In 2008, when the FCC auctioned off the 700 MHz block of wireless spectrum in anticipation of the DTV transition, Google promised to enter a bid of $4.6 billion, if the FCC required the winning licensee to adhere to four conditions:[46] These conditions were broadly similar to the FCC's Internet Policy Statement; FCC's applications and content were combined into a single bullet, and an extra bullet requiring wholesale access for third party providers was included. The FCC adopted only two of these four criteria for the auction, viz., open devices and open applications, and only applied these conditions to the nationwide C block portion of the band.[47] President Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 called for an investment of $7.2 billion in broadband infrastructure and included an openness stipulation.[48] Towards the end of 2009, the FCC began drafting new rules that would include a series of proposals that would prevent telecommunications, cable and wireless companies from blocking certain information on the Internet.[49] FCC Chair Julius Genachowski proposed to add two rules to the current FCC policy statement in 2005, viz., the nondiscrimination principle that ISPs must not discriminate against any content or applications, and the transparency principle, requiring that ISPs disclose all their policies to customers. He argued that wireless should be subject to the same network neutrality as wireline providers.[50] In October 2009, the FCC gave notice of proposed rule making on net neutrality.[51] Following the ruling in Comcast v. FCC in March 2010, the FCC amended these rules to account for the court's decision. The FCC voted in December 2010 to approve the FCC Open Internet Order banning cable television and telephone service providers from preventing access to competitors or certain web sites. The order established six net \"neutrality principles\" that would apply to ISPs: The 2010 orders did not reclassify ISPs under Title II common carriers, leaving them unregulated by the FCC under Title I information services as a cumulative result of past FCC orders.[52] The measure was denounced by net neutrality advocates as a capitulation to telecommunication companies such as allowing them to discriminate on transmission speed for their profit, especially on mobile devices like the iPad, while pro-business advocates complained about any regulation of the Internet at all.[53][54][55] While the 2010 Open Internet Order was generally favorable to ISPs, the issuing of the neutrality principles that would still apply to Title I information services was criticized by some ISPs. Verizon Communications challenged the order at the D.C. Circuit court in early 2011, asserting that the FCC had overstepped its authority by applying principles to Title I information services. The D.C. Circuit ruled in January 2014 to vacate the blocking and discrimination principles from the 2010 Open Internet Order while upholding other parts. The decision determined that the FCC improperly relied on Section 706 of the amended Communications Act, which gives the FCC authority to incentivize the deployment of telecommunications services to all Americans including those in rural and low-income areas. The FCC had relied on Section 706's language that they had authority to \"promulgate rules governing broadband providers’ treatment of Internet traffic\" to apply these rules to Title I information services. The Court ruled that ISPs were still specifically treated as Title I information services by the FCC, and for the FCC to be able to regulate aspects like blocking or discrimination, they would specifically have to be cataloged as telecommunication common carriers under Title II. The court agreed that FCC can regulate broadband in a general manner and may craft more specific rules that stop short of identifying service providers as common carriers.[56][57][58] As a response to the DC Circuit Court's decision, a dispute developed as to whether net neutrality could be guaranteed under existing law, or if reclassification of ISPs was needed to ensure net neutrality.[59] Wheeler stated that the FCC had the authority under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to regulate ISPs, while others, including President Obama,[60] supported reclassifying ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. Critics of Section 706 point out that the section has no clear mandate to guarantee equal access to content provided over the internet, while subsection 202(a) of the Communications Act states that common carriers cannot \"make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services.\" Advocates of net neutrality have generally supported reclassifying ISPs under Title II, while FCC leadership and ISPs have generally opposed such reclassification. The FCC stated that if they reclassified ISPs as common carriers, the commission would selectively enforce Title II, so that only sections relating to broadband would apply to ISPs.[59] On February 19, 2014, the FCC announced plans to formulate new rules to resume enforcing net neutrality while complying with the court rulings.[62] However, in the event, on April 23, 2014, the FCC reported a new draft rule that would permit broadband ISPs such as Comcast and Verizon to offer content providers, such as Netflix, Disney, or Google, willing to pay a higher price, faster connection speeds, so their customers would have preferential access, thus reversing its earlier position and (so far as opinion outside the ISP sector generally agreed) would deny net neutrality.[63][64][65][66][67] Public response was heated, pointing out FCC chairman Tom Wheeler's past as a president and CEO of two major ISP-related organizations, and the suspicion of bias towards the profit-motives of ISPs as a result. Shortly afterwards, during late April 2014, the contours of a document leaked that indicated that the FCC under Wheeler would consider promulgating rules allowing Internet service providers (ISPs) to violate net neutrality principles by making it easier for Internet users to access certain content — whose owners paid fees to the ISPs (including cable companies and wireless ISPs) — and harder to access other content,[68] thus undermining the traditional open architecture of the Internet. These plans received substantial backlash from activists, the mainstream press, and some other FCC commissioners.[69][70] In May 2014, over 100 Internet companies — including Google, Microsoft, eBay, and Facebook — signed a letter to Wheeler voicing their disagreement with his plans, saying they represented a \"grave threat to the Internet\".[71] The FCC voted 3–2 on proposed rules to introduced tiered broadband allowances on May 15, 2014.[72] Besides opening these rules to public comment prior to issuing a final ruling, the FCC asked the public on their opinion in regards to classifying ISPs as Title II common carrier telecommunication services. The public commenting period ran through July 2014,[73][74] and garnering over one million responses, the most the FCC had ever received for rulemaking.[75] The FCC proposal for a tiered Internet received heavy criticism. Opponents argued that a user accessing content over the \"fast lane\" on the Internet would find the \"slow lane\" intolerable in comparison, greatly disadvantaging any content provider who is unable to pay for \"fast lane\" access. They argued that a tiered Internet would suppress new Internet innovations by increasing the barrier to entry. Video providers Netflix[76] and Vimeo[77] in their comments filed with the FCC used the research of S.S. Krishnan and Ramesh Sitaraman that provided quantitative evidence of the impact of Internet speed on online video users.[61] Their research studied the patience level of millions of Internet video users who waited for a slow-loading video to start playing. Users with faster Internet connectivity, such as fiber-to-the-home, demonstrated less patience and abandoned their videos sooner than similar users with slower Internet connectivity.[78][79][80] Opponents of the tiered broadband rules declared September 10, 2014, to be the \"Internet slowdown\". Participating websites were purposely slowed down to show what they felt would happen if the new rules took effect. Websites that participated in the Internet slowdown included Netflix,[81] Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Vimeo and Kickstarter.[82][83][84][85] The Economist described the \"Battle for the Net [...] now casting the upcoming FCC decision as an epic clash between \"Team Internet\" (a plucky band of high-tech multi-millionaires) and \"Team Cable\" (a dastardly bunch of Big-ISP billionaires).\"[86] On November 10, 2014, President Obama stepped in, and recommended the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality.[87][88][89] Republicans presented legislation in January 2015 in the form of a U. S. Congress HR discussion draft bill that made concessions to net neutrality but prohibited the FCC from accomplishing that goal, or from enacting any further regulation affecting ISPs, though the bill failed to be enacted.[90][91] By January 2015, the FCC announced it had revised its prior rules and would be voting on a new preliminary ruling that defined ISPs as a Title II common carrier telecommunication service, with some necessary exemptions.[92][93][94][95][96] Adoption of this notion would reclassify Internet service from one of information to one of telecommunications,[97] treating it as a public good,[98][99] and ensure net neutrality, according to Wheeler.[100][101] Ahead of the FCC's vote on these new rules, social media platforms had a large role on engaging the public in the debate surrounding net neutrality. Popular websites such as Tumblr, Vimeo, and Reddit also participated in the Internet slowdown on September 10, 2014, which the organization said was the largest sustained (lasting more than a single day) online protest effort in history.[102] On January 26, 2015, popular blogging site Tumblr placed links to group Fight For The Future, a net neutrality advocacy group. The website displayed a countdown to the FCC vote on Title II on February 26, 2015. This was part of a widespread Internet campaign to sway congressional opinion and encourage users to call or submit comments to congressional representatives.[103] Net neutrality advocacy groups such as Save the Internet coalition[104] and Battle for the Net[105] responded to the 2015 FCC ruling by calling for defense of the new net neutrality rules.[104] The FCC voted 3–2 on February 25, 2015, to pass these new rules,[106][107][108][98][99] making exemptions for North Carolina and Tennessee where state laws had already established stronger net neutrality concepts, and would be willing to add exemptions for other states with similar laws.[109] In response to ISP and opponent views, Wheeler commented, \"This is no more a plan to regulate the Internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech. They both stand for the same concept.\"[110] Full disclosure of the rules were released for public comment on March 12, 2015,[111][112][113] and the final rule was published on April 13, 2015.[114][115] Following the publication of the FCC's ruling in 2015, several internet providers filed suit to challenge the FCC's ruling. The cases were combined into a single case, United States Telecom Ass'n v. FCC 825 F.3d 674 (2016), heard by a three-judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in December 2015.[116] The court issued its decision in June 2016, with the panel split 2-1 in favor of maintaining the FCC's ruling, stating that the Internet should be treated as a utility and not as a luxury. Internet providers signaled their intent to continue to challenge this ruling to the Supreme Court.[117] Several of the telecom groups petitioned the Supreme Court for writ of certiorari following the Court of Appeals ruling, ultimately falling under the case name Berninger v. Federal Communications Commission (Docket 17-489). The petition argued that the FCC did not have the power to issue the Open Internet Order, which required a re-interpretation of the Communications Act of 1934, under the Chevron deference. On November 5, 2018, seven members of the Court denied the petition, leaving in place the Court of Appeals ruling, which established that the FCC had the ability to reclassify Internet under Title II. Chief Justice John Roberts abstained due to financial conflict, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh abstained due to his previous involvement with the case history. Three Justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch had recommended accepting the petition as to order a Munsingwear vacatur, in which the Appeals Court order would have been vacated, returned to that court, and have the case rendered moot due to the more recent 2018 FCC order that reversed the Open Internet Order.[118][119] Donald Trump had been positioning himself for running for presidency as the FCC considered net neutrality and categorizing ISPs as Title II common carriers. He said in 2014, \"Obama’s attack on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media.\"[120][121] Shortly after his inauguration in January 2017, President Trump appointed Ajit Pai as the new chairman of the FCC. Pai had previously been nominated to fill one of the required Republican seats on the commission by President Obama under the recommendation of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.[122] Pai, who objected to the 2015 Open Internet Order, quickly began to roll back some of the policies that had been implemented by the FCC during the Obama administration, and halted an investigation into the use of zero-rating by U.S. wireless providers. After his appointment, Pai stated that he planned to \"modernize\" FCC policies to \"match the reality of the modern marketplace\", but was unsure over whether the FCC would continue to enforce the net neutrality rules or Title II classification of broadband services established in the 2015 Open Internet Order.[123][124] Pai stated his opposition to the current net neutrality rules as they were \"regulating against hypothetical harms\", rather than trying to correct actual anti-competitive behavior, and that there was no need for such wide-spread government intervention when there were only a few companies that may be harming consumers or innovators.[125] Pai argued that net neutrality rules also would \"prohibit a number of pro-competitive business arrangements\" and \"would reduce investments\" into extending the Internet infrastructure.[125] By April 2017, Pai had indicated that the FCC would likely propose to roll back the 2015 Open Internet Order, reverting the classification of ISPs as Title II common carriers, and instead have ISPs to \"voluntarily\" commit to net neutrality principles, with violations to be covered by the Federal Trade Commission rather than the FCC.[126][127] On April 29, 2017, a clearer understanding of the latest net neutrality compromise proposal was described.[128][129] On May 18, 2017, the FCC voted 2–1 to move forward with Pai's Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on \"Restoring Internet freedom\" rules[130] by rolling back net neutrality regulations.[131] The new rules were published for public viewing on July 17, 2017.[132] The FCC supported their rules by arguing that the classification of ISPs as Title II carriers had caused them to reduce their capital expenditures in new infrastructure, threatening the future of the nation's telecommunication systems. The FCC cited a drop of approximately $1 billion in capital spending by telecoms between 2014 and 2015, based on data from the United States Telecom Association and similar figures from industry consultant Hal Singer,[133] to demonstrate this. Analysts stated that the FCC had cherry picked this data, as about 75% of the annual changes in capital spending by telecoms between the period of 1996 to 2015 were decreases of at least $1 billion.[134][135] In her dissent to this NPRM, FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn wrote, \"I have yet to see a credible analysis that suggests that broadband provider capital expenditures have declined as a result of our 2015 Open Internet Order. ... Using the same logic that the NPRM uses, one could suggest that the FCC's classification of cable modem service as an information service in 2002 resulted in an even more precipitous drop in broadband provider investment.”[136] Ernesto Falcon, Legislative Council for the Electronic Frontier Foundation[137] claimed that no such claims of CapEx reductions have been made in official reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),[138] He said that major companies can be sued by investors who assert that they lost money because of misleading information in an SEC filing, and no such penalties apply to potentially misleading statements to Congress or the public.[138] Falcon's claim is supported by an analysis by Turner of Free Press in a report that includes 26 figures and tables, 21 of which were extracted from SEC filings and three of the remaining five came from the U.S. Census Bureau's Annual Capital Expenditures Survey.[139] The change since the Title II Order was negative for only 5 of Turner's 24 tables, and the mean and median change over the 24 tables for which it seemed reasonable to extract a typical annualized percentage change were 8.1% and 5.2%, respectively.[140] As required for any NPRM, a period for public commenting on the FCC's new proposed rules ran from May 18 to August 16, 2017. During the public commenting period, efforts were made by pro-net neutrality groups to get people to submit comments to the FCC in opposition to the new rules. John Oliver, the host of Last Week Tonight, encouraged his viewers to comment against the proposed FCC rules.[141] In early June 2017, Battle for the Net, a coalition spearheaded by Fight for the Future, Free Press Action Fund, and Demand Progress, announced a \"massive day of action\" for July 12.[142] Over 50,000 websites, including multinational corporations, participated in what Fight for the Future called \"the largest online protest in history\".[143] The FCC's open comment period on the proposed language of \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" received about 21.9 million comments, the largest influx of public comments seen by the FCC at that time;[144][145][146] previously the FCC had gotten about 500,000 comments related to new media ownership rules in 2003 and 1.4 million comments from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy in 2004.[147] As these comments were made available to the public, third-party groups began analyzing their contents, recognizing many comments that were against net neutrality shared the same language, and were considered to be duplicative. Analysis suggested that millions of these comments were fraudulent, using the same anti-net neutrality wording that had been proposed by the Center for Individual Freedom.[141][146] One of the first studies performed after the closure of the public commenting period, done on behalf of Broadband for America, which sought to repeal the Obama-era rules, found that 60% of the comments were in favor of retaining the current rules. However, the study also identified a large number of duplicate comments; if these were taken out, the unique comments favoring retaining the current rules far outweighed those seeking repeal, 1.52 million to 23,000.[147] During and after the public commenting period, analysts reviewed the public comments and observed that a significant proportion of those using boilerplate language in support of repealing the rules had used names and addresses off known spam databases, and of those who were willing and able to be contacts asserts they left no such comment for the FCC.[147] At least twenty-four people listed by the FCC as giving anti-net neutrality comments signed an open letter to the FCC in May 2017 requesting the comments they were asserted to have made to be removed from public record.[148] The FCC's system for public comments, the Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS), came under scrutiny: it uses an open application programming interface (API), along keys to that provided by the FCC, to submit comments, making it exploitable for mass-messaging.[147] In December 2017, the Pew Research Center issued its report in reviewing the comments, affirming that most of them were boilerplate messages, but representative of a mass campaign attempting to sway public policy. The Pew report did recognize that several of the names were nonsensical, such as variations of \"John Smith\", or used \"The Internet\", and in other cases, thousands of messages were received at nearly the same time, potential evidence of a bot spamming in comments.[149] Another study evaluating all the comments submitted by the process was completed at Stanford University and published in October 2018. The Stanford study forced solely on unique comments, resulting in more than 800,000 comments that were called \"semantic outliers\" in contrast to boilerplate language, and in a detailed review of a sampling of one thousand of these, found that 99.7% favored retaining the Obama-era rules; these came from a geographically- and politically-diverse set of users.[150] Shortly after this study, New York State's Attorney General Barbara Underwood, one of the critics of the FCC's process, issued a subpoena to over a dozen advocacy groups on both sides of the net neutrality debate to determine if they had a role in the massive number of fraudulent comments left at the FCC's system.[151] Other states, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, have issued similar subpoenas on the commenting period.[152] Both The New York Times and BuzzFeed had filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the FCC to gain information on the IP addresses used in the public comment period. The FCC denied the requests in December 2018 citing that releasing this information would leave the US vulnerable to a cyberattack, and Pai wrote in an attached statement that at least 500,000 of the comments were tied to Russian addresses, interfering in the process and trying to swing the public opinion in favor of keeping the Obama-era net neutrality rules.[153] A separate FOIA request was made by The New York Times as well as the website Gizmodo for records pertaining to the API key logs from the ECFS, which were granted after journalists from the works filed suit against the FCC's initial denial.[154] Data analysis led by The New York Times and Gizmodo to review the logs against those of the duplicated comments. They concluded that the duplicated comments were coming from submissions through the API assigned to CQ Roll Call, which does offer advocacy software to clients for this purpose. Gizmodo found the comments tied to the name of those that had signed the May 2017 open letter to the FCC, matching this pattern. Separately, Gizmodo found the language of the duplicated comments shares many similarities with statements made by the Center for Individual Freedom (CFIF), which had been outspoken against net neutrality of the page. Due to these investigations, CQ Roll Call, CFIF, and several other advocacy groups with access to CQ Roll Call's had been called for questioning within the New York State case against the FCC.[148] In May 2020, Judge Lorna G. Schofield of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that the FCC must provide The New York Times the IP addresses of all the comments from this commenting period. Judge Schofield stated that despite the FCC's claims of privacy issues, the request by the newspaper was valid to examine if any fraudulent activity interfered during the public commenting period towards the issue if the FCC's decision to repeal was \"vulnerable to corruption\".[155] The New York state attorney general's office reported in May 2021 that after evaluating the comments, they determined that about 18 million of the 21.9 million submitted were bogus. About 8.5 million of those comments were tied to co-registration promotions put forth by the telecom industry, promising consumers gift cards or entry into sweepstakes but then using their names and information to submit the comments without their knowledge. For this, the office had already reached settlement deals with three telecom companies for a total of $4 million in fines. Another 9.3 million of the comments considered bogus were in favor of net neutrality, according to the report, filed under false identities and many submitted by a single person.[156][157] The attorney general also obtained a total of US$650,000 from three influencer companies paid by the telecom industry that participated in the millions of fake responses.[158] Despite the ongoing analysis into fraudulent activities related to the public commenting period, and that the public comments that were deemed legitimate that weighed in favor of maintaining the 2015 Open Internet Order, the FCC announced in November 2017 that it was planning to go ahead with a final vote on December 14, 2017, to vote in the Restore Internet Freedom order and repeal the net neutrality rules.[159] FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel alleged on December 8 that the FCC was withholding evidence of fraud due to irregularities in its comment period and said the vote should be postponed until after an appropriate investigation.[160] Many organizations involved in the July 12 Day of Action planned an online protest for December 12.[161] A vote was held on December 14, 2017, with a 3–2 party-line vote approving the repeal.[162][163] On January 4, 2018, the current version of \"Restoring Internet freedom\" was made public,[164] and was officially codified in the Federal Register on February 22, 2018,[165] with the rules taking effect on June 11, 2018.[166] The FCC voted along party lines, 3–2, on December 14, 2017, to enact the Restoring Internet freedom rules and repeal the 2015 Open Internet Order.[167] Within minutes after the FCC vote on December 14, 2017, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced his intent to lead a multi-state lawsuit against the FCC to \"stop illegal rollback of net neutrality\".[168] Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson also stated his intent to sue.[168] Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia, led by New York's Schneiderman, filed a formal suit in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit against the FCC's ruling on January 16, 2018, calling it \"arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion\", and that the FCC mis-classified Internet access as a Title I service rather than Title II due to \"an erroneous and unreasonable interpretation\" of laws around communication services.[169] The initial filing was withdrawn in early February 2018 only due to the fact that the FCC's ruling had not yet been published within the Federal Register. Once the new FCC rules were published in February 2018, the states, District of Columbia, joined by the Mozilla Foundation and Vimeo, and several other state and local entities and advocacy groups, refiled the suit on February 22, 2018.[170] The cases were all consolidated under the title Mozilla v. FCC. The FCC issued its defense on October 12, 2018, requesting the Court to reject the lawsuit, as the lawsuit filed brings \"no substantial reason to second-guess the commission’s decision to eliminate rules that the agency has determined are both unlawful and unwise\".[171] Initial court hearings were held on February 1, 2019.[171] The FCC had requested a rescheduling of the hearings due to lack of resources created by the ongoing shutdown of the government,[172] but this request was denied by the D.C. District Court.[173] At the hearing before three judges, the states challenging the FCC not only discussed the issues related to net neutrality, but also charged the FCC with selectively reviewing the public comments to come to its decision, thus \"failed in its responsibility to engage in reasoned decision-making\".[174] ISPs argued the need to have an unregulated approach to providing high-quality services to their users, and that they would not be able to offer anything less than the full Internet to users given the competitive landscape.[174] The Court of Appeals issued its decision on October 1, 2019. In a multipart decision, the Court ruled that the FCC has the capability to reclassify Internet service under Title I based on the prior Brand X ruling from the Supreme Court, allowing its 2017 rule change to stand.[15] However, the opinion stated that the FCC had \"disregard of its duty\" in evaluating the impact of net neutrality on public safety, using the example of throttled communications that impacted the capabilities of first responders during the 2018 Camp Fire. The opinion also stated that the FCC had not addressed how these rules affected utility pole access or other programs like the low-income Lifeline program. The Court did rule against the FCC, vacating the rule's limitations against state-level actions to enforce net neutrality as Congress had not given the FCC any such authority via the Telecommunications Act.[175][176][177] While various parts in support of the plaintiffs requested an en banc hearing from the full Court of Appeals, the Court denied this in February 2020.[178] In January 2018, fifty United States senators endorsed legislative action under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to reverse the repeal of Title II net neutrality.[179] While the effort was pushed by Democratic Senators, they had also gained support of three Republican Senators, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and John Kennedy.[180] The motion to restore net neutrality passed in the Senate on May 16, 2018.[181][182] However, efforts for the House of Representatives to pass similar legislative action through the CRA had stalled; Democratic Representatives had attempted to gain sufficient signatures for a discharge petition to force the vote on the matter, but by June 2018, were still 46 signatures short, principally along partisan lines.[183] While the revised FCC order repealing net neutrality has become official as of June 11, 2018, the House could have taken action to reverse the decision, but even with CRA passage, the action would have to be signed into law by the President.[184] However, the Congressional term ended before the House of Representatives could act, preventing the CRA challenge. While various states have enacted versions of net neutrality laws, these mostly have been working within the established parameters set by the FCC. In the FCC's rollback, the ruling includes language that asserts states do not have authority to override the FCC decision. Legal experts believe this clause to be flawed and would allow states to still override the FCC's decision on net neutrality, as the language divests the FCC from regulating broadband carriers, and thus would disallow them from preventing states from regulating them.[185] Following the FCC's revocation of all net neutrality protections, California State Senator Scott Wiener introduced SB822, which comprehensively restored all of the protections of the 2015 Open Internet Order. The bill passed with bi-partisan support in both the State Assembly and State Senate, and on September 30, 2018, Governor Jerry Brown signed it into law. On the same day as it was signed, the US Department of Justice sued the state of California to stop the law, arguing that Congress granted the FCC the sole authority to create rules for broadband internet providers.[186] A few days later, four lobbying groups that represent the major United States terrestrial and mobile communication carriers, United States Telecom Association, CTIA, NCTA and the American Cable Association, also sued the state of California for similar reasons as the Justice Department, claiming that the state does not have authority to regulate Internet providers.[187] The state and the FCC announced on October 26, 2018, that they have reached agreement for California to hold off the enforcement of the law until pending legal action over the FCC's decision. Despite not being enforced, the bill went into effect on January 1, 2019.[188] With the October 2019 decision in Mozilla v. FCC that overturned the 2017 Order's blanket ban on state net neutrality, the U.S. government and the ISP trade groups restarted their lawsuit in August 2020 and are seeking a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of California's law until the case is concluded.[189] However, following the election of Joe Biden as president in 2021, Biden's new Department of Justice withdrew from the challenge, leaving the ISP trade groups to continue the suit.[190] Subsequently, the judge denied the preliminary injunction in a ruling on February 23, 2021, allowing the California law to go into effect, on the basis that the ISP trade groups will be unlikely to prevail in the challenge.[191] The Ninth Circuit ruled unanimously in January 2022 that California's net neutrality law may continue to be enforced and cannot be overridden by the FCC as, current as of the decision, Internet services were classified as information services.[192] The trade groups abandoned the case against the law by May 2022.[193] Democratic Senators and Representatives presented the Save the Internet Act in both Houses of Congress in early March 2019. The Act, if passed, would rescind the 2017 FCC order to repeal the 2015 Open Internet Order, codify the 2015 Open Internet Order into law, and prevent the FCC from making any similar changes baring any further change in law. Republican lawmakers indicated they felt this was too extreme and were unlikely to give support to the bill.[194][195] The bill cleared the House on a 232–190 vote on April 10, 2019, but both leaders in the Republican-controlled Senate and then-president Trump indicated they would stop the bill's passage.[196] With Joe Biden becoming president in January 2021, Ajit Pai announced his departure from the FCC in the same month. Biden named Jessica Rosenworcel, an Obama-era appointee to the FCC, as acting chairperson. Rosenworcel was a vocal proponent for net neutrality in previous FCC rulings.[197] On July 9, 2021, Biden signed Executive Order 14036,[198] \"Promoting Competition in the American Economy\", a sweeping array of initiatives across the executive branch. Among them included instructions to the FCC to restore the net neutrality rules that had been undone during the Trump administration.[199] The resignation of Pai in January 2021 left the FCC at a two-two deadlock until September 2023, when Biden-nominated Anna M. Gomez was sworn in as the Commission's fifth member. Rosenworcel stated that month that the FCC plans to re-introduce net neutrality rules.[200] While it is expected for the FCC to rule to restore net neutrality, a white paper published by telecom legal experts in 2023 warned that the rule will likely face challenges in the Supreme Court under the major questions doctrine.[201] The FCC voted 3-2 on October 19, 2023, to approve issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) seeking comments about rolling back to the 2015 rules.[202] The commenting period was closed on January 18, 2024.[203] The FCC voted in these proposed guidelines on April 25, 2024, on a 3-2 vote, returning Internet services under Title II, enforcing net neutrality. [204] Providers under the NCTA filed suit to challenge the new rule in June 2024. Under the suit, the providers questioned whether the FCC has the authority to reclassify broadband services. While this had been settled by previous cases like Brand X[205] the Chevron deference central to these cases was overturned in June 2024 by Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, leaving in question the capability of the FCC to enforce its net neutrality decision[206] The Sixth Circuit granted a temporary injunction against the new net neutrality rules in July 2024, with a hearing to determine if a permanent injunction is necessary at an August hearing. [207] On extending the stay in August 2024, the majority of the Sixth Circuit stated that due to the flip-flopping on how the FCC has classified internet services, it will be highly unlikely for the FCC to prevail using the weaker Skidmore deference. [208] The Sixth issued its final decision in January 2025, ruling that, in the absence of Chevron the FCC's decision classifying internet service providers as a telecommunication service was inconsistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1998. [209][210] With the election of Donald Trump for his second term as president starting in 2025, Rosenworcel will step down as chairperson of the FCC.[211] Trump plans to replace her with Brendan Carr, a sitting committee member, and is expected to name another Republican to fill Carr's position. Carr is a vocal opponent of net neutrality and supports aspects such as data caps, and believes that Internet service providers should be allowed to compete without regulation, differentiating their services to draw in customers.[212] Many broadband operators imposed various contractual limits on the activities of their subscribers. In the best known examples, Cox Cable disciplined users of virtual private networks (VPNs) and AT&T, as a cable operator, warned customers that using a Wi-Fi service for home networking constituted \"theft of service\" and a federal crime.[246] Comcast blocked ports of VPNs, forcing the state of Washington, for example, to contract with telecommunications providers to ensure that its employees had access to unimpeded broadband for remote work. Other broadband providers proposed to start charging service and content providers in return for higher levels of service (higher network priority, faster or more predictable), creating what is known as a tiered Internet.[247] In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. The FCC issued a Letter of Inquiry to Madison River, initiating an investigation. To avoid litigation, Madison River agreed to make a voluntary payment of fifteen thousand dollars and agreed to not block ports used for VoIP applications or otherwise prevent customers from using VoIP applications.[248] According to the consent decree, \"The Parties agree that this Consent Decree does not constitute either an adjudication on the merits or a factual or legal finding regarding any compliance or noncompliance with the requirements of the Act and the Commission’s orders and rules. The Parties agree that this Consent Decree is for settlement purposes only.\" In September 2012, a group of public interest organizations such as Free Press, Public Knowledge and the New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute filed a complaint with the FCC that AT&T was violating net neutrality rules by restricting use of Apple's video-conferencing application FaceTime on cellular networks to those who have a shared data plan on AT&T, excluding those with older, unlimited or tiered data plans.[249] The FCC response noted that \"Although this report does not attempt to engage in any legal interpretations of the Open Internet Order, we do note that the Order treats these mobile broadband networks differently from traditional fixed networks. While both fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose their management practices, mobile broadband providers have greater latitude for blocking devices and applications (as long as they do not compete with the provider's own voice or video telephony services) and discriminating in how they serve traffic, in accordance with reasonable network-management practices.\"[250] Arguments associated with net neutrality regulations came into prominence in mid-2002 with nine different bills introduced on this issue between 2006 and 2013. Industry officials say that these proposals would launch new rules and regulations for internet providers. On October 22, 2009, Sen. McCain (R-AZ) introduced the “Internet Freedom Act of 2009[251]” (S. 1836). The bill would prohibit the FCC from enacting rules that would regulate the Internet. In other words, the bill, if passed, would prevent the FCC from imposing network or “net” neutrality rules to the Internet. Specifically, the bill language states, “The FCC shall not propose, promulgate, or issue any regulations regarding the Internet or IP-enabled services. In other words, the bill, if passed, would prohibit the FCC from enacting rules that would regulate the Internet – or against net neutrality.[252] On January 5, 2011, two anti-net neutrality bills were introduced. The first bill was H.R. 96, The Internet Freedom Act,[253] introduced by Rep. Blackburn (R-TN), with more than sixty cosponsors (all of whom are Republican). H.R. 96 strikes down the FCC’s December 21 passage of its rule and order on net neutrality by asserting that regulation of the Internet is under the jurisdiction of Congress, not the FCC. The second bill, H.R. 166, The Internet Investment, Innovation, and Competition Preservation Act[254] – was introduced by Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-FL) and co-sponsored by Rep. Blackburn. The bill also seeks to prohibit the FCC from regulating the Internet or information services (i.e. imposing net neutrality rules) unless there is demonstrated market failure. On January 25, 2011, The pro-net neutrality bill – S. 74, The Internet Freedom, Broadband Promotion, and Consumer Protection Act of 2011 [255]– was introduced by Sen. Cantwell (D-WA) and co-sponsored by Sen. Franken (D-MN). The bill would codify the FCC's six net neutrality principles (which the ALA supported), outlined in a November 2009 FCC Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM), among other things. There has been extensive debate about whether net neutrality should be required by law in the United States. Debate over the issue predates the coining of the term. Advocates of net neutrality have raised concerns about the ability of broadband providers to use their last mile infrastructure to block Internet applications and content (e.g. websites, services, and protocols), and even to block out competitors.[256] While opponents claim net neutrality regulations would deter investment into improving broadband infrastructure and try to fix something that isn't broken.[257][258] In 2014 Professor Susan Crawford, a legal and technology expert at Harvard Law School suggested that municipal broadband might be a possible solution to net neutrality concerns.[259] Organizations that support net neutrality come from widely varied political backgrounds and include groups such as Consumer Reports,[260] MoveOn.org, Free Press, Consumer Federation of America, AARP, American Library Association, Public Knowledge, the Media Access Project, the Christian Coalition, TechNet,[261][262][263] the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Greenpeace, Tumblr, Kickstarter, Vimeo, Wikia, Mozilla Foundation, NEA, and others.[264][265][266][267][268][269] Prominent supporters of net neutrality include Vinton Cerf, co-inventor of the Internet Protocol; Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web; law professor Tim Wu; Netflix CEO Reed Hastings; Tumblr founder David Karp; Free Press President Craig Aaron; and Last Week Tonight host John Oliver, who presented two full-length Last Week Tonight segments about the issue.[270][271][272][273][274] Other organizations that have voiced support for Net Neutrality are Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. In December 2017 public opinion poll, 83% of voters supported keeping the rules on net neutrality, including 75% of Republican voters, 89% of Democratic voters, and 86% of independent voters.[275][276] Outside of the US, several countries have removed net neutrality protocols and have started double charging for delivering content (once to consumer and again to content providers). This equates to a toll being required for certain internet access, essentially limiting what is available to all people, in particular low income households.[277] Large, already well-established companies may not be harmed by cost increase that providers such as Comcast may levy upon them, but it may stifle small businesses and start-ups.[278] Sites such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon may not have been able to thrive absent net neutrality.[279] Barbara Stripling, the president of the American Library Association states: \"School, public and college libraries rely upon the public availability of open, affordable Internet access for school homework assignments, distance learning classes, e-government services, licensed databases, job-training videos, medical and scientific research, and many other essential services, we must ensure the same quality access to online educational content as to entertainment and other commercial offerings.\"[269] Previously existing FCC rules do not prevent telecommunications companies from charging fees to certain content providers in exchange for preferential treatment (the so-called \"fast lanes\"). Neutrality advocates Tim Wu and Lawrence Lessig have argued that the FCC does have regulatory power over the matter, following from the must-carry precedent set in the Supreme Court case Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission.[280] Net neutrality proponents argue that telecom companies seek to impose a tiered service model in order to control the pipeline and thereby remove competition, create artificial scarcity, and oblige subscribers to buy their otherwise noncompetitive services.[264] Many believe net neutrality to be primarily important for the preservation of current internet freedoms; a lack of net neutrality would allow Internet service providers, such as Comcast, to extract payment from content providers like Netflix, and these charges would ultimately be passed on to consumers.[281][282] Civil rights organizations, such as the Color of Change, the National Hispanic Media Coalition, and more[283] argue that net neutrality is also important for communities of color because it allows for them to tell their own stories and “organize for racial and social justice.\"[284] Much of the mainstream media does not showcase these minority people, so these organizations believe that it is important to open the Internet into giving these people some sort of broadcast station. By doing so, their voices can be heard, because beforehand ISPs could “block unpopular speech and prevent dissident voices from speaking freely online.\"[284] In May 2014, some websites admitted to inserting code that slowed user access to their site from known FCC IP addresses, as a protest on the FCC's position on net neutrality.[285] On his show Last Week Tonight, Oliver took on the issue of net neutrality for the first time in 2014, in the show's first season. The episode went viral with 13 million views on YouTube[286] and prompted 45,000 comments on the FCC website.[287] At the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show, former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler cited Oliver's episode as a turning point in the issue of net neutrality. “John Oliver took the ultimate arcane issue, Title II, and made it something that got people interested. And that’s good.”[288] Oliver returned to the issue of net neutrality on his May 7, 2017, episode in response to Chairman Pai's promise to get rid of the regulation. He prompted viewers to once again comment on the FCC website by buying the domain gofccyourself.com, which garnered 1.6 million contributions.[289] Some have referenced[290] the advance of Elon Musk's Starlink as something that could undercut the lobbying power of cable companies by offering internet access via satellite as opposed to traditional wired or wireless technologies. Some rural areas would have much less or no connectivity without net neutrality, making the use of farm software impracticable or impossible.[291] Individuals against net neutrality include former FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai,[292] Daniel Berninger and Jeff Pulver,[293][294] Marc Andreessen, Robert Kahn, Peter Thiel, MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte, Internet engineer and former Chief Technologist for the FCC David Farber, and Nobel Prize economist Gary Becker.[295][296][297][298][299] Nonprofit organizations opposed to net neutrality include FreedomWorks,[300] the Reason Foundation,[301] and Citizens Against Government Waste.[302][303][304] Organizations and companies that oppose net neutrality regulations include several major technology hardware companies, cable and telecommunications companies, hundreds of small internet service providers, various think tanks, several civil rights groups, and others.[257][305][306][294][293][307] Companies such as Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast are some of the biggest opponents to net neutrality. In fact, since 2005 these companies have lobbied three times as much in opposition to net neutrality as the likes of Google and Microsoft have lobbied for it.[308] The statistics show that from 2005 to 2013, anti-neutrality companies filed 427 reports to lobby against net-neutrality, compared to just 176 reports filed by those for it.[308] Opponents argue that net neutrality would benefit industry lobbyists, and not consumers due to the potential of regulatory capture with policies that protect incumbent interests.[309] Former hedge fund manager turned journalist Andy Kessler has argued, the threat of eminent domain against the telecommunication providers, instead of new legislation, is the best approach by forcing competition and better services.[310] One print ad frames the Hands Off the Internet message in pro-consumer terms. \"Net neutrality means consumers will be stuck paying more for their Internet access to cover the big online companies' share,\" the ad claims.[311] In November 2005, Edward Whitacre Jr., then chief executive officer of SBC Communications, stated \"there's going to have to be some mechanism for these [Internet upstarts] who use these pipes to pay for the portion they're using\", and that \"The Internet can't be free in that sense, because we and the cable companies have made an investment,\"[312] sparking a furious debate. SBC spokesman Michael Balmoris said that Whitacre was misinterpreted and his comments only referred to new tiered services.[313] Net neutrality laws are generally opposed by the cable television and telephone industries.[314][315] Net neutrality opponents such as IBM, Intel, Juniper, Qualcomm, and Cisco claim that net neutrality would deter investment into broadband infrastructure, saying that \"shifting to Title II means that instead of billions of broadband investment driving other sectors of the economy forward, any reduction in this spending will stifle growth across the entire economy. Title II is going to lead to a slowdown, if not a hold, in broadband build out, because if you don’t know that you can recover on your investment, you won’t make it.\"[257][316] Others argue that the regulation is \"a solution that won’t work to a problem that simply doesn’t exist\".[317] Critics of net neutrality argue that data discrimination is desirable for reasons like guaranteeing quality of service. Bob Kahn, co-inventor of the Internet Protocol, called the term net neutrality a slogan and opposes establishing it, but he admits that he is against the fragmentation of the net whenever this becomes excluding to other participants.[295] Vint Cerf, Kahn's co-founder of the Internet Protocol, explains the confusion over their positions on net neutrality, \"There’s also some argument that says, well you have to treat every packet the same. That’s not what any of us said. Or you can’t charge more for more usage. We didn’t say that either.\"[318] An alternate position was proposed in 2010 by then-FCC Commissioner Julius Genachowski, which would narrowly reclassify Internet access as a telecommunication service under Title Two of the Communications Act of 1934. It would apply only six[319] common carrier rules under the legal principle of forbearance that would sufficiently prevent unreasonable discrimination and mandate reasonable net neutrality policies under the concept of common carriage. Incumbent ISP AT&T opposed the idea, saying that common carrier regulations would \"cram today's broadband Internet access providers into an ill-fitting 20th century regulatory silo,\" while Google supported the FCC proposal: \"In particular, the Third Way will promote legal certainty and regulatory predictability to spur investment, ensure that the Commission can fulfill the tremendous promise of the National Broadband Plan, and make it possible for the Commission to protect and serve all broadband users, including through meaningful enforcement.\"[320] In October 2014, after the initial proposal was shot down, the FCC began drafting a new proposal that would take a hybrid regulatory approach to the issue. Although this alternative has not yet been circulated, it is said to propose that there be a divide between \"wholesale\" and \"retail\" transactions.[321] In order to illustrate clear rules that are grounded by law, reclassification of Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 will be involved as well as parts of Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Data being sent between content provider and ISPs will involve stricter regulations compared to transactions between ISP's and consumers, which will involve more lax parameters. Restrictions on offering a data fast lane will be enforced between content providers and ISPs to avoid unfair advantages. This hybrid proposal has become the most popular solution among the three options that FCC has reported. However, ISPs, such as AT&T who has already warned the public via tweet \"any use of Title II would be problematic\", are expected to dispute this solution.[321] The official proposal was rumored to become public by the end of 2014.[322] In 2006 Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent, said \"I most definitely do not want the Internet to become like television where there's actual censorship... however it is very difficult to actually create network neutrality laws which don't result in an absurdity, like making it so that ISPs can't drop spam or stop... attacks.\"[323] In June 2007, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) urged restraint with respect to new regulations proposed by net neutrality advocates, noting the \"broadband industry is a relatively young and evolving one,\" and given no \"significant market failure or demonstrated consumer harm from conduct by broadband providers\" such regulations \"may well have adverse effects on consumer welfare, despite the good intentions of their proponents.\"[324] The FTC conclusions were questioned in Congress in September 2007, when Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., chairman of the Senate interstate commerce, trade and tourism subcommittee, told FTC Chairwoman Deborah Platt Majoras that he feared new services as groundbreaking as Google could not get started in a system with price discrimination.[325] In 2011 Aparna Watal, a legal officer at an Internet company named Atomic Labs, has put forward three points for resisting any urge \"to react legislatively to the apparent regulatory crisis\".[326] Firstly, \"contrary to the general opinion, the Comcast decision does not uproot the Commission's authority to regulate ISPs. Section 201(b) of the Act, which was cited as an argument by the Commission but not addressed by the Court on procedural grounds, could grant the Commission authority to regulate broadband Internet services where they render \"charges, practices and regulations for, and in connection with\" common carrier services unjust and unreasonable.\"[326] Secondly, she suggests, it is \"undesirable and premature to legislatively mandate network neutrality or for the Commission to adopt a paternalistic approach on the issue ... [as] there have been few overt incidents to date, and the costs of those incidents to consumers have been limited.\"[326] She cites \"prompt media attention and public backlash\" as effective policing tools to prevent ISPs from throttling traffic. She suggests that it \"would be more prudent to consider introducing modest consumer protection rules, such as requiring ISPs to disclose their network management practices and to allow for consumers to switch ISPs inexpensively, rather than introducing network neutrality laws.\"[326] \"While by regulating broadband services the commission is not directly regulating content and applications on the Internet\", content will be affected by the reclassification. \"The different layers of the Internet work in tandem with each other such that there is no possibility of throttling or improving one layer's performance without impacting the other layers. ... To let the Commission regulate broadband pipelines connecting to the Internet and disregard that it indirectly involves regulating the data that runs through them will lead to a complex, overlapping, and fractured regulatory landscape in the years to come.\"[326] As of 2006 the debate over \"neutrality\" did not yet capture some dimensions of the topic; for example, whether voice packets should get higher priority than packets carrying email or whether emergency services, mission-critical, or life-saving applications, such as tele-medicine, should get priority over spam.[327] Cable companies have lobbied Congress for a federal preemption to ban states and municipalities from competing and thereby interfering with interstate commerce. However, there is current Supreme Court precedent for an exception to the Commerce Power of Congress for states as states going into business for their citizens.[328] In 2006 it was proposed that neither municipal wireless nor other technological solutions such as encryption, onion routing, or time-shifting DVR would be sufficient to render possible discrimination moot.[329] EPB, the municipal utility serving Chattanooga, Tennessee, petitioned the FCC to allow them to deliver internet to communities outside of the 600-square mile area that they service.[330] A similar petition was made by Wilson, North Carolina. According to FCC officials, some residents who lived just outside the service areas of the Chattanooga and Wilson utilities then had no broadband service available.[109] One of the two February 26, 2015, rulings set aside those states' restrictions on municipal broadband, although legal challenges to the FCC's authority to do so were seen as likely.[109] Individual states have taken action to generally uphold net neutrality either through proposed legislation or through by requiring state agencies to establish contracts with Internet providers that offer net neutral-services. The status as of February 26, 2018[update], of executive orders and pending action at state levels is summarized as follows:[331]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. 7-seed Notre Dame shocked 2-seed Georgia with a 23-10 victory in the Sugar Bowl to send the Fighting Irish to the national semifinals at the Orange Bowl against Penn State. The Fighting Irish used a furious rally of 17 points in 54 seconds around the halftime break to take control of the game and never looked back. The Irish and Bulldogs were held scoreless in the first quarter, marking the first CFP game without first-quarter points since 2018. After Notre Dame kicker Mitch Jeter nailed a field goal to push the score to 6-3 Irish with 39 seconds remaining in the first half, the fireworks started. RJ Oben strip-sacked Georgia quarterback Gunner Stockton, setting up a 13-yard touchdown pass by Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard to Beaux Collins the next play. Then on the opening kickoff of the third quarter, Jayden Harrison took the kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown to push the lead to 20-3. Notre Dame only put together ield goal drives outside the stretch, but the defense held long enough to escape the Superdome with a historic victory. In relief of injured Carson Beck, Stockton was strong. The sophomore from Rabun County, Georgia, threw for 234 yards and a touchdown in his first career start. However, the Bulldogs' offensive line struggled mightily, giving up nine tackles for loss and four sacks as the Fighting Irish defense feasted. Notre Dame mustered only 213 yards of offense, but it didn't matter. Leonard rushed for 80 yards to lead the Irish. CBS Sports was here with updates, highlights and analysis from the Sugar Bowl. Read on below for takeaways from Notre Dame's win over Georgia. Notre Dame controlled two sequences of the game, and Georgia couldn't retaliate Thursday afternoon in the Superdome. The 17-point onslaught in a span of only 54 seconds and eight combined plays did the damage, with Riley Leonard's touchdown pass after a Georgia fumble late in the first half and Jayden Harrison's 98-yard touchdown return. Then, with the game on the line, Marcus Freeman dug deep into his bag of tricks and frustrated the heck out of Georgia's coaching staff. With fewer than eight minutes remaining, Freeman sent his punting unit on the field, but then subbed them for the offense on fourth down. The decision resulted in Georgia jumping offsides after it replaced its special teams with the defense. That first down extended Notre Dame's drive, and the Irish nearly never relinquished the ball, controlling it for an incredible 7:36. They burned the clock, driving to midfield before punting the ball away with 1:49 remaining in the game. That's all it took for the Irish to win. Their offensive line, shorthanded all season, simply leaned on Georgia's stout defensive front and won the battle. This isn't the same Notre Dame team you've seen in previous years. They're stout up front and they have the speed to match. Georgia had an identity problem in 2024, and for the first time in six years, the season ended with a loss. The Bulldogs don't have a quarterback problem. Gunner Stockton was an absolute gamer in the face of intense pressure — both because of the venue, circumstances and because of Notre Dame's furious pass rush. The offensive line, as it has this season, struggled to open holes for running backs and were leaky against another defensive front. Meanwhile, the defense was pushed around up front and gave up too many chunk plays in big situations. That's not necessarily a killer, especially in a game in which the defense only gave up 16 points. No, the biggest issue for Georgia is at receiver. The Bulldogs' receiving corps has dropped at least 36 passes during the 2024 season, including a massive drop on a would-be touchdown by Dillon Bell in the third quarter, according to ESPN's research. That is unacceptable for any championship-chasing team, and it's a big reason why the Bulldogs trailed at halftime in seven games this season — and lost three. Help is on the way with the 2025 recruiting class. Five signees rank in the top 75 at their position, including top-10 receiver Talyn Taylor. This isn't the Notre Dame you've grown to love — or love to hate. The Fighting Irish have built a program that can beat you with speed and lean on your with power. Its defense is relentless and the offense has enough explosiveness and physicality to put games to bed. This is nothing new this season. Notre Dame has done this to practically every opponent on the schedule. The Irish may not put up big yardage, but they are opportunistic. They entered the Sugar Bowl ranked third nationally in turnover margin, and two key fumbles led to points and frustrated Georgia, which seemed poise to score early in the first quarter before running back Trevor Etienne lost the first fumble of his career. Freeman calls this team a bunch of \"misfits,\" players who are obsessed with football and doing everything they can to push themselves — and opponents — to the limit. The stat sheet wasn't full of quarterback sacks, but the Irish were in Gunner Stockton's face all afternoon. Credit the Georgia quarterback for firing passes in just enough time to avoid the sack, but he couldn't do it all day, and that led to a trio of sacks and a fumble in the first half. 7-seed Notre Dame shocked 2-seed Georgia with a 23-10 victory in the Sugar Bowl to send the Fighting Irish to the national semifinals at the Orange Bowl against Penn State. The Fighting Irish used a furious rally of 17 points in 54 seconds around the halftime break to take control of the game and never looked back. The Irish and Bulldogs were held scoreless in the first quarter, marking the first CFP game without first-quarter points since 2018. After Notre Dame kicker Mitch Jeter nailed a field goal to push the score to 6-3 Irish with 39 seconds remaining in the first half, the fireworks started. RJ Oben strip-sacked Georgia quarterback Gunner Stockton, setting up a 13-yard touchdown pass by Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard to Beaux Collins the next play. Then on the opening kickoff of the third quarter, Jayden Harrison took the kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown to push the lead to 20-3. Notre Dame only put together ield goal drives outside the stretch, but the defense held long enough to escape the Superdome with a historic victory. In relief of injured Carson Beck, Stockton was strong. The sophomore from Rabun County, Georgia, threw for 234 yards and a touchdown in his first career start. However, the Bulldogs' offensive line struggled mightily, giving up nine tackles for loss and four sacks as the Fighting Irish defense feasted. Notre Dame mustered only 213 yards of offense, but it didn't matter. Leonard rushed for 80 yards to lead the Irish. Georgia was set to get the ball back with under 8 minutes remaining but then Marcus Freeman pulled out a trick from a sleeve: he subbed the entire punting unit for the offense, and after the Bulldogs made their substitutions, quarterback Riley Leonard's snap count managed to draw an offsides penalty. The play resulted in a first down and may have put the game away for the Irish as the clock now ticks below 5 minutes remaining in regulation. Notre Dame survived a scare in the red zone thanks to its tremendous defense coming up big again. Jack Kiser was flagged for pass interference on an incomplete pass that would have been a turnover on downs, but the 15-yard penalty on fourth-and-13 kept the Georgia drive alive — and it sent Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman into a tizzy on the sideline as he ripped into the officials. Later, on fourth-and-5 at the 9, the Irish got pressure again and Gunner Stockton fired a pass over the head of his receiver in the end zone to turn the ball over on downs with 9:25 remaining. Georgia attacked the edges in the run game and had plenty of success before stalling in Georgia territory, where Mitch Jeter hit his third long field goal of the afternoon to push the Irish ahead 23-10 with 13:47 remaining. Jeter's field goal was good from 47 yards. He hit a 48-yarder earlier today. Georgia's defense stepped up with a stop on fourth down and Notre Dame followed suit. Al Golden called a blitz on fourth-and-2, leading to a chase for Gunner Stockton, who fired a pass short of the first-down markers to give the Irish the ball again with under four minutes remaining in the third quarter. Both defenses have been remarkable this afternoon, for the most part, but it's those two turnovers by the Irish D that has been the difference. Georgia's defense held strong in the trenches, stopping Riley Leonard short of a first down on fourth-and-1 near midfield. The turnover on downs with under 6 minutes remaining in the third quarter fives Georgia an opportunity to make this a one-score game again. Georgia appears to have the momentum here in the Superdome, where Bulldog fans have come to life again. Gunner Stockton is on a heater, and offensive coordinator Mike Bobo is dialing up some fantastic play calls. Georgia receivers ran free on three plays on this scoring drive, which ended with Cash Jones stumbling into the end zone for a 32-yard touchdown catch down the left sideline. The Bulldogs' receiving corps needed that play after a terrible drop by Dillon Bell, who was wide open coming across the middle of the field but dropped a perfectly-placed ball near the 20-yard line. It would have easily been a walk-in touchdown. It didn't matter in the end thanks to Bobo and Stockton hitting on all cylinders, from the coaches' box to the field at the Superdome. That drive chewed up 63 yards on only five plays. If you were wondering, Georgia receivers have dropped 36 passes this season. Notre Dame needed only 11 seconds to score 10 points in the final minute of the first half. They needed only 15 seconds to score another touchdown on a 98-yard kick return by Jayden Harrison at the start of the second half. Harrison pierced the middle, then leaked to the right sideline, dodging a would-be tackler before sprinting home for the 98-yard score to open the third quarter. Georgia fans might outnumber the Notre Dame faithful, but the Superdome is electric with Irish fans raising the decibel levels here in New Orleans. We expected a defensive battle and we've got it, but the big difference here is Notre Dame's tenacious defense forcing two turnovers. Notre Dame zoomed to a 10-0 run in the final minute of the first half thanks to a field goal and a strip-sack of Gunner Stockton, which led to Riley Leonard hitting Beaux Collins for a 13-yard touchdown pass. This game has been defined by taking advantage of opportunities. Georgia blew what could have been two touchdown drives with a fumble by Trevor Etienne deep in Notre Dame's territory (his first lost fumble ever (425 touches, per CBS Sports Research), and a sideline interference on a 67-yard catch at the 11-yard line. That penalty on walk-on Parker Jones pushed Georgia back to the 26-yard line, where the Bulldogs stalled and settled for a field goal. Notre Dame entered today ranked third nationally in turnover margin, and the Irish are again winning the turnover battle in their biggest game of the season. The quarterback run game has also frustrated Georgia. Leonard has rushed for 50 yards on six carries, picking up four first downs on those totes. He's also 10 of 15 passing for 60 yards and one touchdown. Stockton is 9 of 14 passing for 142 yards with the lost fumble. Georgia is averaging only 0.5 yards per carry thanks to three sacks for minus-32 yards by the Notre Dame defense. Notre Dame kicked a field goal and then forced a fumble on Gunner Stockton in the final minute to score 10 points in 11 seconds to grab a 13-3 at halftime. Here's how the coaches responded on the ESPN broadcast as they headed to the locker room at halftime: Kirby Smart, Georgia coach: \"We tried to be aggressive in 2-minute and probably regret it, right? Go to the half 6-3, we want to show confidence in our quarterback, let him go play, we didn't get the block we needed to get and they made a good play.\" Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman: \"It's a great way to end the half. We gotta win the turnover margin and we capitalized off it on offense but this is going to be a 60-plus minute game. You watch this Georgia team all year and you know they're not going to quit. So we've got to be in attack mode and not feel comfortable. We've got to be in attack mode as soon as we come out of the locker room.\" Georgia opted to pass in the final 33 seconds of the first half, and that proved to be a terrible decision by coach Kirby Smart. Gunner Stockton was strip-sacked by RJ Oben on the Bulldogs' first play of the drive and, Junior Tuihalamaka recovered the loose ball at the 13-yard line. Riley Leonard hit receiver Beaux Collins in the middle of the end zone on the ensuing play to give Notre Dame a 13-3 lead going into halftime. It scored 10 points in 11 seconds. Georgia has had three costly mistakes — two turnovers — and a sideline interference penalty on walk-on Parker Jones. All three cost the Bulldogs points. Mitch Jeter drilled a 48-yard field goal to give Notre Dame its first lead of the game with 38 seconds remaining in the first half. Riley Leonard was the captain of that drive, which spanned 32 yards. He scrambled a couple of times, and managed to make up some ground on a 10-yard keeper after what could have been a momentum-changing sack by the Georgia defense. Georgia linebacker CJ Allen blew up running back Aneyas Williams, allowing Small Mondon, Jr. a clear path through the backfield on a twist to sack Riley Leonard for a huge 11-yard sack that pushed the Irish back to the 40-yard line. Notre Dame didn't need long to fire back at Georgia. Riley Leonard picked up 32 yards on a keeper to push the Irish into Georgia territory, but the offense stalled on a three-yard rush and back-to-back passes that went nowhere. Mitch Jeter converted a 44-yard field kick to tie the game and cap an eight-play, 49-yard drive with 8:20 remaining in the second quarter. Boy, Georgia walk-on Parker Jones hopes he won't be a name to remember. An official streaking down the sideline on a 67-yard catch by Arian Smith bumped into Jones and was flagged for sideline interference, a 15-yarder. The Bulldogs went from the 11-yard line to the 27, where the offense stalled and settled for a 41-yard field goal. There have been several haymakers already, and success seems as if it'll be found in the margins. To wit, that pass to Smith was a beauty down the right sideline from Stockton, and Smith blew past All-American safety Xavier Watts by at least a step. It hasn't been a clean game, but each team's had its moments. The Irish forced a fumble inside their own red zone, but not before Georgia's offense found some footing to pick up 71 yards on a 13-play drive. Meanwhile, Notre Dame's offense has mostly sputtered with a pair of penalties, including an illegal forward pass by Riley Leonard. The Irish enter the second quarter with a third-and-11 and only 16 yards of offense. Both teams had a combined -21 yards after their first possession. Georgia attacked the middle of the field on back-to-back pass plays on its second possession, picking up nine yards each time on throws to tight end Dillon Bell and receiver Dominic Lovett, who ran a drag route across the field. The plays helped push Georgia into Notre Dame territory. The Bulldogs were helped once again by undisciplined play by the Irish with an offsides on second-and-8, which should have been a minimal game on a keeper by quarterback Gunner Stockton. Trevor Etienne later picked up a first down on a 7-yard gainer over the left side, and Lovett picked up eight more yards to set up third-and-1 at the 16-yard line. The Bulldogs and Irish combined for six penalties totaling 43 yards. Notre Dame's has been one of the nation's most opportunistic teams, and it continues today early. Safety Adon Shuler cracked Georgia running back Trevor Etienne with a low hit, popping the ball out to the 10-yard line, where it was recovered by the Irish. Georgia was threatening to score with a nice 13-play drive, but it ended after chewing up 71 yards. Notre Dame entered today ranked No. 3 in turnover margin. We're still scoreless here at the Caesars Superdome. Neither team looked, well, good on their first possession. The first two drives included four penalties and a combined -21 yards. Notre Dame was charged with running into the kicker on back-to-back Georgia punts; quarterback Riley Leonard was then flagged for an illegal forward pass on a scramble. Georgia finally picked up positive yardage on Its second possession with a 12-yard pass by Gunner Stockton. It's clear both defenses have the advantage early, particularly on the edges. The Bulldogs attempted to run wide several times on their first possession, but Notre Dame was quick and ready for the stops. Georgia coach Kirby Smart spoke with ESPN before kickoff. He was asked about the last two days in New Orleans — and the game being postponed due to the terrorist attack. \"Things are bigger than football out there and sometimes we get caught up in our own selves, our own moment and you lose sight of how blessed we are every day to have the opportunity we have to play football and play in a CFP quarterfinal game against a historic program,\" Smart told ESPN's Marty Smith. \"A lot of times when you have gratitude, it takes away a lot of anxiety.\" Smart was also asked about Gunner Stockton making his first start in place of injured quarterback Carson Beck. Georgia is the slight favorite (-1.5), according to the SportsLine consensus, which gives me pause. The Bulldogs enter the playoffs 1-9 against the spread as the favorite this season. There's no doubt Georgia played a more difficult schedule than Notre Dame, and the grind was noticeable with two overtime wins to end the season, but one does wonder if the Bulldogs are allowing opponents to better dictate the tempo of those games, resulting in closer-than-expected results. Gunner Stockton appears to be a gamer at quarterback, even if he's not the most talented passer, but that plays into Notre Dame's hands with one of the nation's best pass defenses. Everything points to a Notre Dame win, even with Kirby Smart's knack in preparing his teams for playoff runs. Pick: Notre Dame SU The CBS Sports' staff's complete picks are available in the article below. A crew from the Big 12 conference will officiate the Sugar Bowl playoff quarterfinal today between Georgia and Notre Dame. Security at the Sugar Bowl inside and outside the Caesars Superdome is tight ahead of the 3 p.m. CT kickoff between Georgia and Notre Dame. Police K9 officers patrolled the perimeter of the massive facility, sniffing the undercarriage of incoming busses and shuttles, searching for explosive devices. The nearby parking garage attached the the Superdome had multiple security checkpoints, including a police K9. Inside, New Orleans police, hired private security and the FBI were spotted in the bowels of the stadium, patrolling the facility inside and out. On Wednesday, police scoured the Superdome searching for explosive devices and found none. The heightened security and safety sweeps come on the heels of the vehicular terrorist attack on Bourbon Street early on New Year's Day. Fourteen people were killed and dozens more were injured. The killer was shot and killed by police officers, who exchanged fire with the suspect when he exited his truck. Two makeshift explosive devices were found inside the vehicle and two more were discovered — and safely disposed by police — elsewhere near Bourbon Street. The Sugar Bowl was postponed from New Year's Day at 7:45 p.m. CT until today (Jan. 2), with a kickoff time of 3 p.m. CT on ESPN. The Georgia and Notre Dame football teams mostly remained at their respective hotels on Canal Street on New Year's Day as police swept nearby Bourbon Street following the vehicular terrorist attack earlier in the day. Georgia was able to secure practice space at the Superdome and scheduled and impromptu walkthrough practice Thursday evening, sources told CBS Sports. Georgia players and staffers were spotted leaving in team buses just before 6 p.m. Meanwhile, Notre Dame did not leave its team hotel. The Irish conducted a team-wide meeting at 3 p.m. before braking out into separate meetings for the offense, defense and special teams. Later, the team held a \"team run\" inside their hotel, the Hilton Riverside, near the French Quarter. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Notre Dame has secured the final spot in the College Football Playoff semifinals. It did so by knocking off No. 2 Georgia in the CFP Sugar Bowl quarterfinal Thursday at New Orleans’ Caesar Superdome by a score of 23-10. With the win, Notre Dame not only secured a statement win against one of the SEC’s top programs, but also picked up its first ever win against Georgia. The Irish entered Thursday’s game 0-3 against the Bulldogs, including a loss in the 1981 Sugar Bowl. The turning point for the Irish came in the final seconds of the first half, when Notre Dame scored 10 points in a span of 11 seconds. After Mitch Jeter converted a 48-yard field goal to give Notre Dame a 6-3 lead, RJ Oben strip-sacked Georgia's Gunner Stockton. Following a Notre Dame recovery, quarterback Riley Leonard found Beaux Collins in the end zone for a 13-yard touchdown. Jayden Harrison followed that up with a 98-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. Though it gave up a wide-open third quarter touchdown, Harrison's kickoff return would be all Notre Dame needed to pull out the win. This was due in part because of a stellar performance from Notre Dame's defense in the second half, as it caused two consecutive turnovers on downs. The Irish's CFP quarterfinals win vs. No. 2 Georgia was postponed following a terrorist attack that killed 15 and injured at least 30 more early Wednesday morning in New Orleans. Notre Dame will now have a quick turnaround to prepare for their next game, as they are set to take on No. 6 Penn State in the CFP Orange Bowl semifinals at Hard Rock Stadium on Thursday, Jan. 9 at 7:30 p.m. ET. With that, follow along for a recap of updates, scores and highlights from the Sugar Bowl between the Irish and the Bulldogs: REQUIRED READING:Will Notre Dame beat Georgia in CFP?

Donovan Hinish sealed the win for Notre Dame with a sack on fourth-and-6. Notre Dame is two minutes away from advancing to the CFP Orange Bowl semifinals against No. 6 Penn State, as the Irish lead Georgia 23-10 in the fourth quarter of the Sugar Bowl. Punt coming up for the Irish on fourth-and-8 at their 50-yard line. Georgia's defense still has no answer for Riley Leonard, as the Notre Dame quarterback picks up an impressive first down with a 9-yard carry on third-and-7. After the run, Leonard now has 74 rushing yards on 12 carries on the night. Georgia elects to go for its again on fourth down, and Notre Dame's defense comes up with another stop as Lawson Luckie can't reel in the pass from Gunner Stockton. Notre Dame takes over at its own 9-yard line up 23-10 with just over nine minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Notre Dame looked to have gotten the ball back, as Gunner Stockton overthrew a fourth-and-13 pass down the middle of the field to Lawson Luckie. However, the Bulldogs' drive is extended as Jack Kiser was hit with a controversial defensive pass interference. Georgia has a first-and-10 at Notre Dame's 14-yard line, with 10:51 remaining in the fourth quarter. Another self-inflicted mistake by Notre Dame results in some points being left off the board. Mitch Jeter pushes Notre Dame's lead to 23-10 with a 47-yard field goal after Jordan Faison was hit with an illegal shift penalty on fourth-and-1. Tough blow for Notre Dame, who converted the original fourth-and-1 on a 8-yard pass by Riley Leonard to Faison. Fours up in New Orleans, as the Irish take a 20-10 lead over the Bulldogs into the fourth quarter. Notre Dame will start the fourth quarter with a second-and-4 on Georgia's 26-yard line after a 6-yard carry from Jordan Faison up the right side.

Notre Dame takes the gamble to go for it on fourth-and-1, and it comes to backfire as Riley Leonard comes up a few inches short of the first down. Georgia takes over at the 50-yard line after Notre Dame turns it over on downs. Jadarian Price breaks free along the right side for a 13-yard carry, but the run is called back after wide receiver Jaden Greathouse was called for a hold. Costly error for a Notre Dame offense that has struggled to find consistent momentum throughout the night. It's a first-and-15 at its own 36-yard line for Notre Dame coming up. Georgia gets on the board in the second half, as Cash Jones hauls in a 32-yard catch down the left sideline from Gunner Stockton. Notre Dame's defense left Jones wide open down the sideline for the score. Notre Dame's lead is trimmed to 10 points, as the Irish have a 20-10 lead with 9:36 remaining in the third quarter. Both teams' defenses continue to cause havoc, dialing up the blitz on third down, forcing both teams to trade punts on consecutive drives. Notre Dame is 1 for 6 on third downs after Riley Leonard couldn't find Mitchell Evans for the first down. Though it leads 20-3, Notre Dame's offense only has 137 total yards of offense on the night. What a play by Notre Dame! Jayden Harrison takes the opening kickoff from Georgia's Peyton Woodring from the 2-yard line to the house for a 98-yard opening kickoff touchdown return. It's now 17 points in the last 54 seconds for Notre Dame, who leads Georgia 20-3. All Irish right now in the Sugar Bowl. REQUIRED READING:Georgia's Kirby Smart on New Orleans terrorist attack: 'Things are bigger than football' Notre Dame capitalizes on the turnover, as Riley Leonard fires a dart into the end zone to Beaux Collins for the 13-yard touchdown catch.

Junior Tuihalamaka comes up with the ball to give Notre Dame an opportunity to add more points before halftime.

Riley Leonard got the Irish back into field goal range with a 10-yard gain after Georgia's Smael Mondon Jr. sacked him for an 11-yard loss. Both teams continue to struggle to find a consistent rhythm on offense, trading punts on consecutive drives. Notre Dame takes over at its 38-yard line tied 3-3 with three minutes remaining in the first half. The Irish's defense continues to struggle against Georgia's offense, as Gunner Stockton connects with Oscar Delp for a 21-yard reception on second-and-18. The big play for the Bulldogs comes right after defensive lineman Junior Tuihalamaka came around the edge to sack Stockton for a loss of 8 yards. Notre Dame is on the board with a 44-yard field goal from kicker Mitch Jeter. Big play of the eight-play drive for Notre Dame was Leonard's 32-yard carry up the middle of the field. Irish are tied with Georgia 3-3 with 8:20 remaining in the first half of the Sugar Bowl. Riley Leonard finds the gap and breaks loose for a 32-yard run down to the Georgia 29-yard line. Leonard looked to have gotten his face mask pulled down by a Georgia defender, but officials do not throw the flag. Notre Dame faces an early 3-0 deficit in the Sugar Bowl after holding Georgia to a 41-yard field goal from Peyton Woodring. Nice response by Notre Dame's defense after Georgia appeared to be close to scoring a touchdown after Gunner Stockton connected with Arian Smith for a 66-yard catch to the Notre Dame 12-yard line. However, the play was brought back 15 yards after Georgia's Parker Jones interfered with an official on the sidelines. Notre Dame can't convert its caused turnover into points, as Riley Leonard's third-down pass to Jayden Harrison is well short of the first down. The Irish are forced to punt for the second straight drive. Leonard is just 4 of 5 for 11 yards to start the game. It's even at 0-0 after the first quarter of the Sugar Bowl. Notre Dame is moving on offense and will face a third-and-11 at its 25-yard line to start the second quarter. The Irish struggled to get their offense going in the first quarter, only recording 16 total yards of offense in the 15 minutes compared to the Bulldogs' 58 yards. Notre Dame's defense comes up with its first turnover of the afternoon. The Irish stack the box and blitz Georgia's offensive line, with Adon Shuler knocking the ball out of the hands of Georgia running back Trevor Etienne. Big stop for the Notre Dame's defense as Georgia was knocking on the door. The Irish take over at their 10-yard line tied 0-0 with 2:28 remaining in the first quarter. It's a three-and-out for Notre Dame's offense, as Riley Leonard's pass on third-and-19 falls short of reaching Aneyas Williams. Notre Dame is unable to get itself out of a hole caused by an illegal forward pass penalty on first down. Notre Dame's Bryce Young gets hits with back-to-back running into the kicker penalties on Georgia punter Drew Miller. Kirby Smart and Georgia decline the second penalty, sending Riley Leonard and Notre Dame's offense out for the first time at their own 36-yard line. After an official review, Notre Dame linebacker Jack Kiser was credited for a forced fumble after blitzing Georgia quarterback Gunner Stockton at the Bulldogs' 27-yard line. Due to the reverse of the call, the Bulldogs' punt was moved back further to their end zone. It looked like a three-and-out was coming by Notre Dame's high-powered defense against Georgia's offense, but Christian Gray was flagged for defensive pass interference. The Irish had recorded two tackles for a loss of 2 yards on the drive prior to Gray's penalty, which came on a deep throw from Georgia quarterback Gunner Stockton on third-and-12. The Irish have won the coin toss and deferred the opening kickoff to the second half. Notre Dame will head out on defense to open up the 2025 Sugar Bowl.

NEW ORLEANS — Riley Leonard threw a touchdown pass and ran for 80 yards. While not flashy, his leadership propelled the Notre Dame Fighting Irish to the College Football Playoff semifinals, defeating the Georgia Bulldogs 23-10 at the Allstate Sugar Bowl inside the Caesars Superdome. Jayden Harrison returned a kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown to open up the second half. That score proved to be too much for ‘the mean machine in red and black.’ This game was played with the backdrop of a terrorist attack on Bourbon Street that killed 15 people and injured 30 more individuals. It was the first time the Sugar Bowl was postponed in its 91-year history. “We spent some time together, and I think that’s what you do in tough moments,” said Notre Dame Head Coach Marcus Freeman. “You want to spend time with family, and that’s what we are.” Sign up for our free newsletters and receive unparalleled coverage of Atlanta’s African American community in your inbox. Notably, Notre Dame had a fourth-and-short deep in his own territory when Freeman sent the punt team out before running all 11 players off the field. After seeing how Georgia lined up, Freeman sent the offense back out. Georgia raced their defense back on the field and Leonard induced the Georgia defense to jump offside as the play clock ran down. The penalty gave the Fighting Irish the first down. Georgia ultimately got the ball back with 1:49 remaining in the game. The Fighting Irish effectively took the air out of the ball, while deflating the Bulldogs’ hopes of playing for a national championship in Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. “That’s the aggressiveness in terms of our preparation that I want our program to have,” Freeman said. “That’s got to be one of our edges, that we are going to be an aggressive group and not fear making mistakes.” Meanwhile, Smart said of the play that it can’t really be ran in the SEC. “We did it in 2017 against Tennessee,” explained Smart. “We’ve carried that. We practiced that and repped that because teams try to do it, and we were told by officials you could not do that. And so we were trying to say you couldn’t do it. We got our defense out there. We were fine. I mean, I would have gone for it, if I was them.” Where do the ‘Dawgs go from here?A notable statistic: Georgia was 2-for-12 on third down in Thursday’s game. Even though backup quarterback Gunner Stockton finished with 234 passing yards and one touchdown, the he was under duress all afternoon. He was sacked four times and fumbled the ball once. “He had some tough moments out there. When it’s your backside and you can’t see it coming, it’s tough. I thought he tucked it down and ran. He got us out of a couple sacks with his feet and legs, threw the ball away. Did some good things there.As for Georgia, the senior class ends their careers with an FBS-leading 53-5 record, which is a school record. They won a pair of national championships and two SEC titles in their career. Because their standard of excellence is high, this loss stings. “That takes nothing away from these men on the stage and the seniors that are a part of this class,” Smart said during his press conference. “I mean, absolutely incredible. I just told them, what they went through this year and what they played and how they played, the resiliency, the injuries that we’ve had, and to win an SEC championship — which I have so much respect for our conference — and to win some of the comeback games they won and never quit, even in this game, never quit, that’s the attitude you’ve got to have to get better as a football program.”What’s Next?Notre Dame: The Irish resume a series with the Penn State Nittany Lions that is currently even at 9-9-1.

Skattebo can go from star to legend by leading the Sun Devils to a Peach Bowl upset of Texas. Arizona State enters the game as the largest underdog of the four College Football Playoff quarterfinal games, but Skattebo and the rest of the Sun Devils' offense looked like a juggernaut on their way to a Big 12 title. As Skattebo plays the biggest game of his career, it's important to know the most important details about him — including how to pronounce his name. Here's a guide to pronouncing Skattebo's name and a look at his background. SN's PLAYOFF HQ: Live CFP scores | Updated CFP bracket | Full CFP schedule Skattebo's last name is pronounced \"SKAT-eh-boo.\" While the end of the name looks like it should be pronounced \"boh,\" it's actually pronounced as \"boo.\" It's not the most difficult name as far as college football players go, but it's easy to get tripped up on that last syllable. Arizona State's player profile for Skattebo emphasizes that the end of the name is \"pronounced BOO.\" MORE: Ranking best NFL Draft prospects in CFP Skattebo was born in Rio Linda, Calif. and played at Rio Linda High School. Details on Skattebo's family history are limited, but his father has long lived in the Sacramento area and works in the pest control industry. The powerful running back initially stayed in-state, starting his college career at FCS Sacramento State. While his coach, Troy Taylor, was hired by Stanford after the 2022 season, Skattebo went elsewhere in the Pac-12 and latched on with a newly hired Kenny Dillingham at Arizona State. Dillingham found a way to unlock Skattebo's full potential this season, as the senior racked up more than 2,000 scrimmage yards and forced himself into the Heisman conversation even if winning it never seemed realistic. MORE: College Football Playoff picks, predictions against the spread for CFP Skattebo's freshman season at Sacramento State was cancelled, but he got on the field in 2021 and took on a major role in 2022 with more than 1,700 scrimmage yards. After transferring to Arizona State, Skattebo posted a quiet 783 yards on the ground as the top running back in a shaky Sun Devils offense. Just as he did in his second season at Sacramento State, Skattebo broke out in 2024. With 2,074 total yards and 22 touchdowns entering the College Football Playoff, the senior etched his name in Arizona State history.

We'll send your free family report and tips to find out more The lion symbol represents the ferocious nature of family members, their bravery and valor. It is one of the oldest symbols in heraldry and is considered to be one of the most desirable to have on a coat of arms. The 'bordure' edge around the shield is a mark of difference used to identify separate families that hold similar coat of arms designs. It is one that became a distinctive mark of pride over time for those families that used one. The black color (known as Sable) symbolizes constancy and the enduring nature of the family. It is a symbol of family longevity through time. The red color (known as Gules) traditionally symbolized martyrdom and the historic military strength of family members when called upon in times of war. Skattebo is a surname of Norwegian origin, possibly derived from geographic features or historical references in Norway. The name may indicate a connection to specific locations or a heritage linked to farming or land ownership, reflecting the family’s roots in Scandinavian culture. Family crests and coats of arms emerged during the Middle Ages, mostly in wider Europe. They were used as a way to identify knights and nobles on the battlefield and in tournaments. The designs were unique to each family and were passed down from generation to generation. The earliest crests were simple designs, such as a single animal or symbol, but they became more elaborate over time. Coats of arms were also developed, which included a shield with the family crest, as well as other symbols and colors that represented the family's history and achievements. The use of family crests and coats of arms spread throughout Europe and became a symbol of social status and identity. They were often displayed on clothing, armor, and flags, and were used to mark the family's property and possessions. Today, family crests and coats of arms are still used as a way to honor and celebrate family heritage. Variations of the family name Skattebo can be intriguing, reflecting linguistic shifts and cultural adaptations across different countries. In the 17th century, the name saw variations like Skatteberg in Sweden, which emerged through the phonetic blending of regional dialects. As the 18th century progressed, migration patterns led to the variation Skattaboe in the Netherlands, where the double vowel was influenced by Dutch phonetics. Meanwhile, in the early 19th century, the name evolved into Skatibo in parts of Eastern Europe, showcasing Slavic suffixes that adapted the original structure. By the late 19th century, in America, the name transformed into Skattybo, often influenced by a desire for simplicity and ease of pronunciation among English speakers. Each variation tells a story of cultural exchange, phonetic evolution, and the adaptability of family identities through time and geography. Learn how to find your family crest.

                "content": "The Ole Miss Rebels football program represents the University of Mississippi, also known as \"Ole Miss\". The Rebels compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Rebels play their home games at Vaught–Hemingway Stadium on the university's campus in Oxford, Mississippi. Founded in 1893 as the state's first football team, Ole Miss has won six Southeastern Conference titles, in 1947, 1954, 1955, 1960, 1962, and 1963. The team has been co-national champion once, with Minnesota in 1960 (the only time that Ole Miss has been acknowledged as national champion by the NCAA).[2] Ole Miss, however, has never finished a season No. 1 in the AP or Coaches' Poll.[3][4] With a record of 24–15, Ole Miss has the fourth-highest postseason winning percentage of schools with 30 or more bowl appearances. As of 2024, the team's head coach is Lane Kiffin.[5] The Ole Miss football team played its first season in 1893 and have since fielded a team every year except for 1897 (due to a yellow fever epidemic) and 1943 (due to World War II). In that first season, the team compiled a 4–1 record under head coach Alexander Bondurant. In 1899, Ole Miss became a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA). The program joined the Southern Conference in 1922 and the Southeastern Conference in 1933. The modern era of Ole Miss football began in 1947, when Harold Drew was ousted in favor of his line coach, Johnny Vaught. A former All-American at Texas Christian University (TCU), Vaught led the Ole Miss program to national prominence over the next 24 years, posting 23 winning records and making the team a fixture in the national polls. Under Vaught, Ole Miss won the 1959 Dunkel System national championship; the 1960 Football Writers Association of America, Dunkel System, and Williamson System national championships; and the 1962 Litkenhous Ratings national championship. Just 2–7 in 1946, the Rebels went 9–2 in Vaught's first season at the helm, winning the first of his six SEC titles (1947, 1954, 1955, 1960, 1962, 1963). The 1947 season also saw Ole Miss great Charlie Conerly become the first Rebel player to seriously contend for the Heisman Trophy, placing fourth in the voting. The Rebels were among the winningest programs in the country during the 1950s. From 1950 to 1959, Ole Miss posted an 80–21–5 record (.778 winning percentage), third only to Oklahoma and Miami (OH) during that decade. Vaught's 1959 squad was honored as the \"SEC Team of the Decade.\" In the 1960s, Vaught guided the Rebels to a 77–25–6 record and a .740 winning percentage, which was the ninth-best during that decade. The Rebels were ranked atop the Associated Press poll for three weeks during the 1960 season and one week during the 1961 campaign. The 1960 unit is the only team to win a national championship that is recognized by the NCAA and the college football community at large. That squad finished 10–0–1; the only blemish was a 6–6 tie against LSU. Ole Miss was presented with the Grantland Rice Trophy by the Football Writers of America after its Sugar Bowl victory, though that did not carry the same weight of the wire service voting (AP and Coaches' Poll) which selected Minnesota as the national champion.[6][7] The Rebels’ 1962 season is Ole Miss' only undefeated and untied season: 10–0.[8] They capped off the season with a victory in the Sugar Bowl, but finished No. 3 in both major polls. In 1964, Ole Miss was ranked preseason No. 1 in the Associated Press poll, but finished with a dismal 5–5–1 record at season's end. Vaught also made going to postseason play the norm rather than the exception for the Rebel football program. Ole Miss played in 15 consecutive bowl games from 1957 to 1971, a national record at the time. In all, Vaught led Ole Miss to 18 bowl games, posting a 10–8 record. For his efforts, Vaught was named SEC Coach of the Year six times (1947, 1948, 1954, 1955, 1960, 1962). Vaught coached some of the best players in Ole Miss football history. and produced 26 All-America first-teamers. He also coached four players who finished in the top five in the Heisman Trophy voting: Conerly in 1947, Charlie Flowers (5th in 1959), Jake Gibbs (3rd in 1960), and Archie Manning (4th in 1969, 3rd in 1970). Failing health forced Vaught to resign his position in 1970. He was succeeded by Billy Kinard. No Ole Miss coach has since matched Vaught's longevity or winning percentage. Billy Kinard, the first Ole Miss alumnus to head up the football program, won 10 games in 1971, fourth-most by a first-year head coach in NCAA Division I history, but was fired after going 5–5 in 1972 and starting the 1973 season 1–2. Vaught was rehired to finish out the 1973 season, then resigned once again as head coach. As of 2022, his final record of 190–61–12 still ranks him in the top 25 winningest coaches in NCAA Division I history. Kinard's tenure saw the team's first Black player, 79 years after the team started and a decade after the university admitted its first Black student. Ben Williams, a defensive tackle, recruited out of a small school in the Delta region of Mississippi, eventually claimed All-SEC honors and had a long and successful NFL career following his stint at Ole Miss. Ken Cooper, an assistant under Kinard since 1971, was named head coach on January 17, 1974, and took Ole Miss through the 1977 season. Cooper compiled a 21–23 record, and his tenure is probably best remembered for the September 1977 upset of Notre Dame, who finished the season 11–1 and AP and UPI national champion. Steve Sloan, the former All-American quarterback at Alabama under Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, posted a 20–34 record from 1978 to 1982. After stepping outside the Ole Miss family football tree the previous nine seasons, former Rebel star player Billy Brewer took over as head coach in December 1982. In his 11 seasons as head coach, Brewer led the Rebels to five winning seasons and four bowls, including Ole Miss' 1990 New Year's Day Gator Bowl appearance, which was the program's first January bowl game since 1969. He was named SEC Coach of the Year in 1986 (8–3–1 record) and 1990 (9–3 record), and in 1986, the Rebels returned to the national rankings for the first time in over a decade. He compiled a 68–55–3 record and led Ole Miss to eight Egg Bowl victories over rival Mississippi State. Brewer was dismissed just before the 1994 season after the NCAA infractions committee found him guilty of \"unethical conduct,\" Ole Miss defensive coordinator Joe Lee Dunn finished the season as interim coach. Hired on December 2, 1994, Tommy Tuberville led the 1995 Rebels to a 6–5 record and an Egg Bowl victory over Mississippi State. In 1997, Ole Miss recorded its best season in five years with an 8–4 record, a thrilling 15–14 Egg Bowl victory over Mississippi State and a Motor City Bowl win over Marshall University. The bowl appearance was the program's first since 1992, and the Rebels earned a final national ranking of No. 22 in both polls. During the 1998 season, Tuberville repeatedly said he would not leave Ole Miss. With a month to go before the team's bowl game, he told alumni, \"They'll have to take me out of here in a pine box\". Two days later, he accepted the job of head coach at SEC West rival Auburn University.[9][10][11] David Cutcliffe took over as head coach on December 2, 1998, just 29 days before the Rebels met Texas Tech in the Sanford Independence Bowl. They prevailed, 35–18, in arguably the biggest upset of the 1998 bowl season. Instilling a high-powered offensive style, Cutcliffe had four winning seasons in his first five seasons at Ole Miss, in 1999 (8–4), 2000 (7–5), 2001 (7–4) and 2002 (7–6), becoming the first Rebel mentor since Harry Mehre (1938–41) to post winning marks in his first five years. From 1997 to 2003, the Rebels played in six bowl games, tied with Arkansas for the most bowl appearances among SEC Western Division schools during that span. In 2003, Cutcliffe guided the Rebels to a 10–3 overall mark and a share of the SEC West title with eventual BCS National Champion LSU. Despite his 44–29 record, five straight winning seasons, and guiding the team to its first 10 win season in over 30 years, Cutcliffe was fired by Ole Miss's Athletic Director Pete Boone in December 2004 after the team posted a disappointing 4–7 record and a third consecutive loss to LSU. Ed Orgeron took over on December 16, 2004.[12] Named the 2004 National Recruiter of the Year by The Sporting News and Rivals.com, he compiled two of the best-ranking signing classes in 2006 and 2007. This did not lead to on-the-field success. In 2007, Ole Miss was last in the SEC in scoring offense, turnover margin, rushing offense, rushing defense, punt returns, opponent first downs, red-zone offense, opponent third-down conversions, field goal percentage, time of possession and kickoff coverage. The 2007 season was an unmitigated disaster for the Rebels. They went winless in the SEC for the first time since 1982 and ended the season at 3–9 (0–8 in SEC play). Orgeron was fired on November 24, 2007. Three days later, Houston Nutt was hired as the next head football coach, just five weeks after he defeated Ole Miss as the head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks.[13] During Nutt's first season, he guided the Ole Miss Rebels to a 9–4 record with marquee victories over the eventual BCS National Champion Florida Gators, the reigning BCS National Champion LSU Tigers, and the Texas Tech Red Raiders in the 2009 Cotton Bowl Classic. The Rebels posted their 600th win on September 27, 2008, when they defeated the Gators 31–30.[14] At season's end, the Rebels were ranked in the Top 15 in both major polls. But in the 2010 and 2011 seasons, the Rebels won a total of six games, and in the latter season, went winless in SEC play. On November 7, 2011, athletic director Pete Boone forced Nutt to resign, effective at the end of the season, citing what ESPN called the program's \"total decline\".[15] NCAA investigators later concluded that Nutt had allowed athletes to play while ineligible. In 2019, the NCAA punished Ole Miss for these violations and others committed by his successor, Hugh Freeze, by stripping the team of 33 wins over six seasons.[16] This included all four wins in 2010 and two wins in 2011, making those season the Rebels' first official winless ones in more than a century. On December 5, 2011, Hugh Freeze became the new head coach. The team went 7–6 with a victory over Pitt in the BBVA Compass Bowl. In Freeze's second year, the Rebels went 8–5 (3–5), defeating then-sixth-ranked LSU on a last-second field goal in Oxford, then beating Georgia Tech, 25–17, in the Music City Bowl. In 2014, Freeze led Ole Miss to one of its strongest seasons in four decades. The Rebels spent most of the season in the top 10, rising as high as third in October—their highest ranking at that late stage in the season in almost half a century. They ultimately finished 9–3, only the third time since Vaught's tenure that a Rebel team has won as many as nine games. This garnered them a berth in the 2014 Peach Bowl, their first major-bowl appearance since 1969. In 2015, Freeze led to the Rebels to perhaps the program's strongest season since 1962, when the team went undefeated and untied, with wins over ranked SEC West Rivals LSU and Mississippi State, and was headlined by a road victory over No. 2-ranked Alabama, their first win in Tuscaloosa since 1988 and the first time they had beaten the Tide in back-to-back seasons. The Rebels earned a trip to the 2016 Sugar Bowl, their first appearance in this bowl game since 1970, where they beat Oklahoma State 48–20. Freeze led the Rebels to their first 10-win season since 2003, and only the third since the Vaught era. On July 20, 2017, Freeze resigned after Ole Miss officials learned that he had used a university-provided cell phone to place calls to an escort service in \"a concerning pattern\" that began shortly after he took the job in 2011.[17][18][19] NCAA investigators later concluded that Freeze had cheated on 15 occasions by breaking recruiting rules and allowing students to play who had not maintained the required academic standing; they also determined that his predecessor, Nutt, had broken similar rules. University officials quickly attempted to paint Nutt as the main culprit instead of Freeze. Nutt sued for defamation, and the university settled the suit and issued a public apology.[20] This constituted one of the worst violations ever, and in 2019 the NCAA punished Ole Miss by stripping the team of 33 wins over six seasons, including seven from 2012, eight from 2014, and five from 2016. This changed Freeze's official record at Ole Miss from 39–25 over five seasons to 12–25. The NCAA also banned the team from postseason play for two years, stripped it of scholarships for four years, and placed it on three years of probation.[21] In 2019, the NCAA vacated 33 of the team's victories dating from 2010 to 2016 and levied a two-year ban on postseason play as punishment for recruiting and academic violations under both Nutt and Freeze.[22][23] Meanwhile, the team's star quarterback Shea Patterson and other players told NCAA officials that Freeze had lied to them about the charges while he recruited them.[24] They requested waivers to quickly play for other teams, and were granted them. On July 20, 2017, co-offensive coordinator Matt Luke was named interim head coach following Hugh Freeze's resignation in relation with the escort scandal.[19] In November 2017, Luke was named the permanent head coach after leading the Rebels to a 6–6 record, including a 31–28 Egg Bowl win over Mississippi State. In the 2019 Egg Bowl, Luke's recruit and future NFL wide receiver Elijah Moore performed a post-touchdown mockery of a urinating dog, costing the Rebels a penalty and ultimately losing the game by a missed extra point 20–21.[25] Luke was dismissed after the game.[26] On December 7, 2019, Ole Miss announced that it had hired Florida Atlantic head coach Lane Kiffin as their next head coach[27][28] under a four-year, $16.2 million contract.[29] The 44-year old Kiffin arrived in Oxford with a wealth of coaching experience; before serving as the Owls head coach, he served as Alabama's offensive coordinator for three years under Nick Saban, winning one national championship and three SEC championships while helping to coach Heisman Trophy winner Derrick Henry.[30] He had also served as head coach at USC, Tennessee and the NFL's Oakland Raiders.[31] In his first season at Ole Miss, Kiffin compiled a 5–5 record in an all-SEC Conference schedule, including a 26–20 win over Indiana in the Outback Bowl in Tampa, Florida. On January 2, 2021, Ole Miss signed Kiffin to a contract extension and raise.[32] In 2021, Kiffin piloted the Rebels to a 10–2 regular-season record, the best in school history, going 6–2 in conference and finishing 11th in both major polls. A 21–7 loss to Baylor in the 2022 Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, left the Rebels with a final record of 10–3, the eighth time the football team has recorded 10 wins in a season. On December 4, 2021, Ole Miss again extended Kiffin's contract and raised his pay.[33] In 2022, the Rebels compiled an 8–3 record and were ranked No. 20 in the AP poll in week 12. Running back Quinshon Judkins won C Spire Freshman of the Year. On November 29, 2022, amid rumors that Auburn was interested in hiring Kiffin, the Rebels extended his contract and increased his pay for a third time.[34] Auburn ended up hiring former Ole Miss head coach Hugh Freeze instead.[35] Ole Miss finished the 2022 season 8–5, losing five of their last six games, a showing blamed partly on Kiffin being distracted by Auburn's wooing.[36][37] In 2023, Ole Miss got off to a 3–0 start, including a 37–20 win at No. 24 Tulane, then lost 24–10 to No. 13 Alabama in Tuscaloosa. The following game against arch-rival LSU drew 66,703 people to Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, setting a new venue record; Ole Miss won, 55–49, getting revenge for LSU's 45–20 blowout the previous year and eliminating them from the College Football Playoff. The next week, they beat Arkansas 27–20, exacting revenge for another 2022 blowout. Kiffin led the team to 8–1 before losing to Georgia 17–52 in Athens. The Rebels finished the season 11–2, including a Peach Bowl win over Penn State 38–25. Ole Miss has been affiliated with the following conferences.[38]: 179 Ole Miss has been selected as national champion three times by NCAA-designated major selectors in 1959, 1960 and 1962.[39][40][41][42] But the two major wire-service polls of the time: AP Poll and Coaches' Poll, named Syracuse, Minnesota, and Southern California as the national champions in those years, respectively.[43][7] In 1960, the final Associated Press (AP) and United Press International (UPI) polls placed the Rebels second and third, respectively, behind the national champion Minnesota Golden Gophers. Students made \"AP\" and \"UPI\" dummies, hung them from the Union Building, and burned them while chanting, \"We're No. 1, to hell with AP and UPI.\"[44] The Gophers, however, subsequently lost the Rose Bowl to Washington, and Ole Miss defeated Rice, 14–6, in the Sugar Bowl, leading the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) to vote Mississippi as national champions and present them with the Grantland Rice Award.[45][46] Ole Miss has won six SEC championships. The SEC was split into two divisions from the 1992 season through the 2023 season, with Ole Miss competing in the SEC West during that time. Ole Miss has won a share of one divisional title, but has yet to make an appearance in the SEC Championship Game. † Co-champions Ole Miss has had 38 head coaches in over a century of play.[47][38]: 181 † Includes interim status Ole Miss has participated in 42 bowl games and compiled a record of 26–15 through the 2024 season.[48] The school's victory in the 2013 BBVA Compass Bowl was subsequently vacated and is not included.[49] † New Year's Six bowl game Ole Miss primarily uses four jersey options along with two pant styles and two helmet variations. They often mix and match these jerseys, helmets, and pants to create a wide range of uniform combinations. Since the 2017 season, Ole Miss has taken the field in at least ten different uniform combinations. The Rebels have traditionally used red jerseys for their primary home uniforms and blue jerseys as alternates; both have bold white numbers and white vertical shoulder stripes. The Rebels have also made extensive use of their new \"powder blues,\" a uniform combination consisting of solid white pants, a powder blue jersey with white shoulder stripes, and the powder blue helmet. This uniform combination started as an alternate uniform, but has become very popular among fans and players; since the 2020 season it has been worn as the primary home uniform. White jerseys with red numbers and stripes are typically used on the road. These jerseys are paired with either gray pants with red and blue stripes or solid white pants, though for the 2018 season were paired with white pants with red stripes as part of a \"white out\" uniform combination. A similar white road uniform with navy stripes and letters has also been used. Typically, Ole Miss uses one of two helmet designs. The Rebels’ traditional primary helmet is navy blue with a single red stripe and \"Ole Miss\" written in script on each side. The other helmet's blue is a lighter color, a shade known as \"powder blue.\" In recent years, the powder blue helmet has seen more and more use. Since its reintroduction in the 2014 season, the Rebels have worn powder blue helmets in over half their games, typically with their red or white jerseys, and have arguably become the team's primary helmet. In 2017, Ole Miss used special helmets for a military-appreciation game against Louisiana and a rivalry game against LSU. The military appreciation helmets, which have been worn multiple times since then in both navy and powder blue variations, were the same as the primary design, except the logo on each side of the helmet was filled with an American flag design.[56] The helmets worn against LSU were powder blue with jersey numbers on each side, similar to a design worn by the Rebels in the 1960s.[57] In 2022, Ole Miss debuted new alternate helmets in partnership with Realtree Outdoors, a camouflage and apparel company, for their game against Kentucky. The helmets featured a unique camouflage design, called WAV3,[58] created by Realtree's experts. This collaboration between Ole Miss Athletics and Realtree had been in development for several months prior. Realtree’s founder and CEO, Bill Jordan, is an Ole Miss alumnus who played wide receiver for the Rebels in the early 1970s and has remained closely connected to the program. The Jordan family name is prominently displayed on the indoor field at the Manning Center.[59] In 2024, Ole Miss also revealed new alternate away uniforms during a game against Wake Forest that featured a white jersey, powder blue numbers and stripes with red accents.[60] In the same season, they unveiled the second edition their WAV3 collaboration helmets with Realtree Outdoors in a game against Oklahoma.[61] The Alabama–Ole Miss football rivalry is an American college football rivalry between the Alabama Crimson Tide and Ole Miss Rebels. Both universities are founding members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), and have competed in the SEC Western Division since the 1992 season. It has been one of the conference's most lopsided rivalries. Alabama leads the series 53–10–2 (50–9–2 without NCAA vacations and forfeits). From 2004 to 2013, Alabama won every game between the two teams, including six wins by double digits. However, in 2014, No. 11 Ole Miss beat No. 3 Alabama 23–17 for the first time since 2003. Ole Miss cornerback Senquez Golson sealed the victory with an interception in the fourth quarter. The victory catapulted Ole Miss to No. 3 in the AP Poll, their highest ranking since 1964. In 2015, Ole Miss visited Alabama as double digit underdogs. The Rebels upset the No. 2 Crimson Tide 43–37 for their second ever victory in Tuscaloosa. This marked the first time Ole Miss had beaten Alabama in back to back seasons. Following the upset, Ole Miss jumped to No. 3 in the AP Poll, marking the first time that Ole Miss had been ranked in the top three in consecutive seasons since 1963–64. Ole Miss first played Arkansas in 1908, with Arkansas winning that game 33–0. They would play each other many times, though sporadically, over the next several decades, including two meetings in the Sugar Bowl in 1963 and 1970; Ole Miss won both Sugar Bowl matchups. The two teams have played each other annually since 1981. In the 1980s, Arkansas dominated the Rebels. The 1990 meeting between the two teams ended memorably. Having the ball inside the Ole Miss 20 and trailing by 4 with seconds remaining, Arkansas needed a score. The Hogs handed the ball to running back Ron Dickerson who seemed to have an open path to the endzone. At the goal line, Safety Chris Mitchell stopped Dickerson at the one yard line as time expired. In 1991, Arkansas joined the Southeastern Conference. The next year the SEC divided into two divisions. Both teams were placed in the SEC West. Ole Miss won the first conference contest in Little Rock by a score of 17–3. During the 2000s, the rivalry was reignited by a series of close games and coaching changes. The 2001 Ole Miss–Arkansas game set an NCAA record for most overtime periods played (7). Arkansas won that game 58–56 off a 2-point Rebel conversion that got stopped just short of the goal line. Since then, five FBS football games have reached seven overtime periods. In November 2007, Houston Nutt resigned as the head coach for Arkansas and was hired as Ole Miss' head coach a week later. 2008 saw the first game between Ole Miss and Arkansas after Nutt left Arkansas to coach Ole Miss. The Rebels kicked a field goal with less than 3 minutes remaining to go up 23–14, but Arkansas scored with a minute left. Arkansas was awarded with the recovery of an onside kick, but received a penalty for offensive pass interference before turning the ball over on downs. Ole Miss and Nutt won 23–21. The following season, Ole Miss won 30–17 led by running back Dexter McCluster who had over 200 all purpose yards, including a 60 yd touchdown in the 3rd quarter. In 2010, Arkansas finally beat their former coach Houston Nutt after a 38–24 game in Fayetteville. In 2015, the Rebels' 52–53 loss to Arkansas saw them fall out of first place in the SEC West and lose the division. As of 2023 Arkansas leads the series, 37–30–1 but Ole Miss has won 4 of the last 6. The Auburn–Ole Miss football rivalry, dating back to their first meeting in 1928, is one of the oldest matchups in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Both founding members of the SEC, the two teams have met annually since 1990, following their placement in the SEC West division in 1992. The rivalry gained additional intensity in 1999 when former Ole Miss head coach Tommy Tuberville controversially left to coach at Auburn. [62] More recently, the rivalry intensified with reports that current Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin was in negotiations for the vacant head coaching position at Auburn in 2022. These rumors were later confirmed true but Kiffin declined to pursue it. [63] Auburn leads the series 35–12 through the 2023 season.[64] Ole Miss first played LSU on December 3, 1894, winning 26–6 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Throughout the fifties and sixties, games between the two schools featured highly ranked squads on both sides and several matchups had conference, and at times, national title implications. Since then, the rivalry has only had one contest with significant national title implications. The 2003 loss to LSU decided the SEC Western Division Champion, and helped propel LSU to a national championship. The student bodies at both universities created a trophy for the LSU–Ole Miss rivalry in 2008, and renamed the matchup the \"Magnolia Bowl.\" Ole Miss won the first two official Magnolia Bowls in 2008 31–13 and 2009 25–23.[65] LSU won their first official Magnolia Bowl in 2010 with a last minute score, 43–36. The 2010s featured several memorable Magnolia Bowls. LSU humiliated the Rebels 52–3 at Oxford in 2010.Les Miles ordered third-string quarterback Zach Mettenberger to take a knee four times after LSU gained a first-and-goal at the Ole Miss 1-yard line with five minutes to play. The Rebels lost the 2012 Magnolia Bowl 35–41 during the last minute of the game when LSU's Jeremy Hill scored a 1 yd touchdown run. On October 19, 2013, an unranked Rebel team beat the No. 6 ranked Tigers 27–24 on a last-second 46-yard field goal. In 2014, Ole Miss entered with a No. 3 ranking. No. 24 LSU pulled the upset by beating the Rebels 10–7 on a last–minute interception thrown by Rebels' quarterback Bo Wallace. In 2015, No. 22 Ole Miss upset No. 15 LSU 38–17, which was Ole Miss's largest margin of victory over LSU since 1992. After 2015, Ole Miss would not beat LSU again until 2021, when the No. 12 Rebels won 31–17 in front of a sellout crowd on the day Ole Miss Legend Eli Manning's jersey was being retired. The following year, however, unranked LSU won convincingly 45–20 over No. 7 Ole Miss in Death Valley after the Rebels suffered a second half collapse. In 2023, in front of 66,703 fans (the largest crowd in Vaught-Hemingway Stadium history), #20 Ole Miss defeated #13 LSU 55–49 in what was the highest-scoring game in the rivalry. LSU leads the overall series over Ole Miss LSU leads 63–42–4; since the creation of the Magnolia Bowl, LSU leads the series, 9–5. The Ole Miss–Memphis football rivalry has also been a far less competitive rivalry series. The Rebels hold a 47–12–2 advantage over the Tigers in this non-conference series. The two schools have met 62 times from 1921 to 2019. Ole Miss won every game between 2005 and 2009, and the teams temporarily suspended competition from 2010 to 2013. The rivalry was resumed in 2014. Ole Miss won the game 24–3 to increase their winning streak against Memphis to six straight. In 2015, The Tigers upset No. 13 Ole Miss, 37–24. The Rebels fell 11 spots in the AP Poll to No. 24 and Memphis entered the rankings at No. 18.[66] It was the Tigers' first victory over a ranked team since defeating No. 6 Tennessee in 1996. Memphis won the most recent matchup 15–10 on August 31, 2019. As of 2020, there are no future games scheduled between the two teams.[67] The Battle for the Golden Egg (nicknamed the Egg Bowl) is the Rebels' last game of the season against in-state SEC rival Mississippi State University (MSU). The teams have played each other 114 times since 1901, and the first game officially known as \"The Battle of the Golden Egg\" was in 1927.[68] The game gets its name from the trophy awarded to the winner of the contest; the football element of the trophy is based on the much more ovoid and rounded football used in 1927 when it was designed, and resembles a large golden egg. While it is called a \"Bowl\", the game is not a postseason bowl game but a regular season SEC game. Twenty-nine Egg Bowls have been played on Thanksgiving Day.[69] Ole Miss leads the series with 64–46–6. In 2014, the game gained much more national attention due to the postseason implications the game possessed. Although both teams were considered to be Playoff contenders mid-season when the Bulldogs were #1 and the Rebels were #3, they each suffered a loss (Mississippi State had 1 loss at the time while Ole Miss had 3 losses). The postseason implications were still high, however. Mississippi State entered the game with a No. 4 ranking in College Football Playoff, and had a spot in the Playoff on the line entering the game against No. 19 Ole Miss. MSU also had a chance at making the SEC title game, where they needed a win and an Alabama loss. In an upset, Ole Miss beat the Bulldogs 31–17 and jumped from No. 19 to No. 9 in the College Football Playoff rankings. Both schools got New Year's Six bowl games, although neither would win their bowl games (Ole Miss lost 42–3 to TCU in the Peach Bowl on December 31, and later that night, Mississippi State lost 49–34 to Georgia Tech in the Orange Bowl). Ole Miss entered the 2015 Egg Bowl with a No. 18 ranking in the College Football Playoff rankings, and MSU was No. 21. The game was considered to be a play-in game for the Sugar Bowl as Florida, who had been predicted by many to get the bid, lost 27–2 to rival Florida State that same day. Ole Miss entered the game as only two point favorites but won the Egg Bowl convincingly 38–27 and led by 25 points at halftime. This was Ole Miss's first road win against Mississippi State since 2003, and the first time that the Rebels beat the Bulldogs two years in a row since 2003–04. In 2023, the 12th ranked Ole Miss Rebels shut down Mississippi State 17-7 to win Battle for the Golden Egg on Thanksgiving night. Quinshon Judkins rushed for 119 yards and a touchdown, and Jaxson Dart threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Caden Prieskorn early in the fourth quarter to give the Rebels a 10-point lead they would not relinquish. These two schools first played in 1902, with Tennessee winning 11–10. The two schools would go on to play for all but 9 times between 1927 and 1991 (1939–1941, 1943, 1952–1955, 1970–1971).[70] Ole Miss is Tennessee's 4th most played all time behind only Kentucky, Vanderbilt and Alabama. Tennessee is the 7th most played opponent for the Rebels behind Mississippi St, LSU, Vanderbilt, Alabama, Arkansas, and Tulane. Similarly to the Auburn–Tennessee rivalry, the SEC expansion in 1992 ended the yearly meetings as Tennessee and Ole Miss were placed in opposite divisions. Each team had two permanent cross division opponents from 1992 to 2005, with the Vols getting Alabama and Arkansas, while Ole Miss drew Vanderbilt and Georgia.[71] This rivalry has mostly been played in November, with only 17 of the 65 meetings between the two being played in a different month. Many times, the games have been played in Memphis, an area with significant ties to both schools. Tennessee leads the all-time series 44–20–1.[72] The two sides have played several memorable games, including the 1962 meeting where a 10–0 victory for Ole Miss, included an all-out brawl between the sides.[73] In 1969, UT fans wore buttons to the game emblazoned with the phrase \"Archie Who?\" to mock Archie Manning. Ole Miss subsequently defeated the Vols 38–0 and inspired the creation of a famous song called \"The Ballad of Archie Who.\"[74] The Manning family again ignited the rivalry when Archie's son Peyton chose to attend Tennessee over Ole Miss. In 1996, Manning faced raucous Ole Miss crowd in Memphis in his first game against the Rebels, leading the Vols to a dominant 41–3 win.[75][76] In 2021, the matchup featured the return of former Tennessee coach Lane Kiffin to Neyland Stadium. Kiffin, now the head coach of Ole Miss, had coached Tennessee for one year before infamously departing to become the head coach of USC.[77] #13 Ole Miss came out with a close win by a score of 31–26 after the game was delayed by fans throwing debris toward the Ole Miss sideline in the 4th quarter.[78] Ole Miss and Tulane have been rivals since the time that Tulane was an SEC member. Ole Miss leads the series 43–28 through the 2023 season.[79] The Rebels have dominated the rivalry in recent decades, they currently (as of 2024) hold an 11-game winning streak versus the Green Wave, dating all the way back to 1989.[79] Their next matchup is slated for 2025 in Oxford.[67] Vanderbilt and Ole Miss have played annually since 1942. When the SEC split into divisions in 1992, the Commodores and Rebels were selected as permanent cross-division rivals. Ole Miss leads the all-time series 52–40–2. The Rebels have won 16 of the last 24 games, including nine games by double digits. However, Vanderbilt has sustained the rivalry with a surprising blow-out victory over the Rebels in 2016. In 1992, to commemorate the 100th year of Ole Miss football, the Ole Miss Athletic Department put together a so-called \"Team of the Century,\" recognizing the outstanding accomplishments of 26 players.[80] The head coach for the Team of the Century was Johnny Vaught, who coached Ole Miss from 1947 to 1970 and again in 1973. Ole Miss has nine players and two coaches in the College Football Hall of Fame.[81] † Charter member ‡ Played freshman year at Ole Miss, then appointed to the U.S. Military Academy where he played for Army as a sophomore, junior and senior There have been three Ole Miss players inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[82] [citation needed][importance?] Ole Miss has one former player in the National Quarterback Club Hall of Fame.[83] [importance?] *Only includes players who have been on an NFL active roster, Practice Squad, or IR during the 2024-25 NFL season.[84][85] The team has long associated itself with the Confederacy. Since 1936,[86] the team has gone by the name Rebels, a nickname for the secessionist military force that fought against the United States during the American Civil War. In 1936, the team introduced a mascot, Colonel Reb, a cartoonish, older-aged gentleman in plantation-owner's garb whose name alludes to service in the Confederate States Army; in 1979, the team would add a student costumed as Colonel Reb to the cheerleading squad. In the 1940s, students began waving the Confederate battle flag in the football stands; the team followed suit.[87] The marching band began playing \"Dixie\" around 1948,[88] according to David Sansing, Ole Miss professor emeritus of history and author of the sesquicentennial history of the university. \"I think it really was adopted around the combination of the [university's] centennial and the Dixiecrat movement in the South,\" Sansing said. \"1948 was the centennial celebration, and that's when Ole Miss was cloaked and covered with all the memorabilia of the Confederacy.\"[89] Though the team is still called the Rebels, its embrace of Confederate symbols began to change in 1983, two decades after the school was integrated at bayonet point. That September, John Hawkins, a Black cheerleader for Ole Miss, refused to carry the battle flag onto the home stadium's football field, as was long custom.[87] To quell the outcry that followed, school Chancellor Porter L. Fortune Jr. banned the official use of the flag but said students could continue to wave it.[90] In 1997, the university banned flag poles at games, an attempt to stop the waving of Confederate flags without directly confronting fans who wanted to do so.[91] The step was taken after head coach Tommy Tuberville complained that the flag-waving had hampered his attempts to recruit top-notch Black athletes.[91] Coaches before Tuberville also expressed concerns about the difficulty of recruiting black athletes. In 2003, the school ended the use of the costumed Colonel Reb mascot at athletic events,[92] though it would sell official Colonel Reb merchandise through the end of the decade. An unofficial Colonel Reb mascot still makes appearances in The Grove, Ole Miss' tailgating area, before home games.[citation needed] In 2009, the university chancellor asked the school's marching band to stop playing \"From Dixie with Love\", an early-1980s fight song that combined elements of \"Dixie\" and the \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\". Students had customarily chanted \"The South will rise again\", a reference to the Lost Cause pseudohistory, during the song's final line.[93] In 2010, the university began to phase out the use of Colonel Reb on official merchandise such as hats and shirts; it reclassified the Colonel Reb trademark as a historical mark of the university.[94] After a polling and a February 2010 campus vote, officials announced on October 14, 2010, that students, alumni and season ticket holders at the university had picked Rebel Black Bear as their new mascot.[95][96] The bear beat out two other finalists, the Rebel Land Shark and something called the \"Hotty Toddy,\" an attempt to personify the school cheer. (The bear would be replaced in 2018, by the Landshark, a reference to a celebratory hand symbol that players began using in 2008.[97][98][99][100]) In 2016, the athletic department banned \"Dixie\" itself as well as a medley that included a \"Dixie\" theme.[88][89] Later that year, Chancellor Jeffrey Vitter asserted that the name \"Rebels\" was no longer used to refer to the Confederacy but \"is used today in a completely different and positive way: to indicate someone who bucks the status quo, an entrepreneur, a trendsetter, a leader\".[101] At the end of each spring's practices, the team plays the Grove Bowl, which pits Ole Miss players against each other. The senior defensive player who most embodies Chucky Mullins' spirit and courage receives the \"Chucky Mullins Memorial Courage Award\" and the right to wear Mullins' No. 38 jersey, which was otherwise retired in 2006. From 1992 to 2023, Ole Miss played in the West Division of the SEC and played each opponent in the division each year along with several teams from the East Division. The SEC will expand the conference to 16 teams and will eliminate its two divisions in 2024, causing a new scheduling format for the Rebels to play against the other members of the conference.[106] Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future. Notably, Alabama and Auburn are off the schedule for the first time since the SEC expanded to 12 teams in 1992, and Texas A&M is off for the first time since the Aggies joined the conference in 2012.[107] Announced schedules as of April 26, 2020.[108][109]",

                "content": "The 2024 Ole Miss Rebels football team represented the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) during the 2024 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Rebels were led by fifth-year head coach Lane Kiffin.[1][2] The team played its home games at Vaught–Hemingway Stadium in Oxford, Mississippi. Expectations were high for the Rebels going into the 2024 season as they were coming off of a 2023 season in which they won Peach Bowl, went 11–2 on the season, and finished #9. They were #6 in the preseason polls and started out 4–0 before suffering a shocking 20–17 loss at home to unranked Kentucky. The next week, they rebounded by beating South Carolina 27–3 in Columbia, however the week after that, they lost 29–26 to #13 LSU in overtime despite the Tigers never having the lead during regulation. This loss caused the Rebels to fall to 5–2 and #18, but they rebounded with a home win over Oklahoma and a road win over Arkansas (the latter of which featured a record-setting performance from Jaxson Dart in which he threw for 515 yards and 6 touchdowns in a 63–31 rout of the Razorbacks). Following those wins, they were 7–2 and returned home to face the #3 Georgia Bulldogs, who's only loss was to Alabama in Tuscaloosa. In front of a record crowd of 68,126, Ole Miss' defense dominated the game and the Rebels won 28–10, securing Lane Kiffin's first Top 5 win as Ole Miss' head coach. Fans stormed the field in celebration (although they had to be pushed back initially as they went on the field too early when 16 seconds were still on the clock) and they tore down the goalposts. This win helped Ole Miss keep their Playoff chances alive as they moved up to #11 in the College Football Playoff rankings. Additionally, Jaxson Dart became the winningest quarterback in program history. Three Rebels were selected in the 2024 NFL Draft. [3][4] Quarterbacks Running backs Wide receivers Tight ends Kicker/Punter Long snappers Offensive Lineman Defensive Lineman Linebackers Defensive backs Legend Ole Miss and the SEC announced the 2024 football schedule on December 13, 2023.[2] The 2024 Rebels schedule consists of 7 home games and 5 away games for the regular season. Ole Miss will host four SEC conference opponents Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi State (Egg Bowl) and Oklahoma at home and will travel to four SEC opponents, Arkansas (rivalry), Florida, LSU (Magnolia Bowl) and South Carolina to close out the SEC regular season on the road. The Rebels will have bye weeks that comes in week 8 and 12 (October 19 and November 16, respectively). Oklahoma is one of two new members of the SEC that will join in July 2024, the Rebels will play the Sooners for the first since the 1999 season at the 1999 Independence Bowl.[2] Ole Miss will host Oklahoma for the time in program's history.[6] With the two new teams to the SEC (Oklahoma and Texas) and the conference dropping divisions in a new scheduling format,[7] Ole Miss this season will not play notable SEC rivals for the first time in years; Alabama (1991), Auburn (1989) and Vanderbilt (1969).[8] The 2024 season's out of conference opponents represent the ACC, CUSA, SoCon and the Sun Belt conferences. The Rebels will host three of their four non–conference games which are against Furman from the SoCon, Georgia Southern from the Sun Belt, and Middle Tennessee from CUSA. The Rebels will travel to Wake Forest from the ACC.[2][6] ‡New Vaught-Hemingway Stadium attendance record [9][10] at Vaught–Hemingway Stadium • Oxford, Mississippi 2nd Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter at Vaught–Hemingway Stadium • Oxford, Mississippi 2nd Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter at Allegacy Federal Credit Union Stadium • Winston-Salem, North Carolina 2nd Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter at Vaught–Hemingway Stadium • Oxford, Mississippi 2nd Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter at Vaught–Hemingway Stadium • Oxford, Mississippi at Williams–Brice Stadium • Columbia, South Carolina at Tiger Stadium • Baton Rouge, Louisiana at Vaught–Hemingway Stadium • Oxford, Mississippi at Donald W.

                "title": "Texas Longhorn - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Texas Longhorn is an American breed of beef cattle, characterized by its long horns, which can span more than 8 ft (2.4 m) from tip to tip.[4] It derives from cattle brought from the Iberian Peninsula to the Americas by Spanish conquistadors from the time of the Second Voyage of Christopher Columbus until about 1512.[5] For hundreds of years the cattle lived a semi-feral existence on the rangelands; they have a higher tolerance of heat and drought than most European breeds.[6] It can be of any color or mix of colors. In the 21st century it is considered part of the cultural heritage of Texas.[7]: 343 The Texas Longhorn derives from cattle brought to the Americas by Spanish conquistadors from the time of the Second Voyage of Christopher Columbus until about 1512.[5] The first cattle were landed in 1493 on the Caribbean island of La Isla Española (now known as Hispaniola) to provide food for the colonists.[8]: 279 [9] Over the next two centuries, the Spaniards used the cattle in Mexico and gradually moved them north to accompany their expanding settlements. The Spaniards reached the area that became known as \"Texas\" near the end of the 17th century. Eventually, some cattle escaped or were turned loose on the open range, where they remained mostly feral for the next two centuries. Over several generations, descendants of these cattle developed to have high feed- and drought-stress tolerances and other \"hardy\" characteristics that have given Longhorns their reputation as livestock.[10][6] The Texas Longhorn stock slowly dwindled, but in 1927, the breed was saved from near extinction by enthusiasts from the United States Forest Service. They collected a small herd of stock to breed on the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge in Lawton, Oklahoma.[11] The breed also received significant attention after a Texas Longhorn named \"Bevo\" was adopted as the mascot of The University of Texas at Austin in 1917. The animal's image became commonly associated with the school's sports teams, known as the Texas Longhorns. A few years later, J. Frank Dobie and others gathered small herds to keep in Texas state parks. Oilman Sid W. Richardson helped finance the project.[12] The Longhorns were cared for largely as curiosities, but the stock's longevity, resistance to disease, and ability to thrive on marginal pastures resulted in a revival of the breed as beef stock and for their link to Texas history. In 1957, Charles Schreiner III began creating a Longhorn herd on his ranch, the Y O, in Mountain Home, Texas, as a tribute to the ranching legacy of his grandfather, Captain Charles Armand Schreiner, and the Longhorns he ran on his ranches. Schreiner purchased five heifers and one bull calf for $75 each from the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge near Lawton. In 1964, Schreiner founded the Texas Longhorn Breeders Association of America. The YO herd were the first cattle registered with the association. To draw attention to the Longhorn and its new association, in 1966, Schreiner organized a cattle drive of Longhorn steers from San Antonio, Texas to Dodge City, Kansas.[13] The drive was promoted as a centennial commemoration of the earlier Chisholm Trail drives. Schreiner arranged for local members of the Quanah sheriff's posse to stage a simulated “Indian attack” as the steers crossed the Red River at Doan's Crossing. The attack was so authentic that the steers stampeded with cowboys in close pursuit. Four hours were needed to reassemble the herd. In 1976, Texas Tech University in Lubbock persuaded Schreiner to stage a cattle trail drive to celebrate its new National Ranching Heritage Center.[14] In 1995, the Texas Legislature designated the Texas Longhorn as the state large mammal.[15] In the 21st century, Texas Longhorns from elite bloodlines can sell for $40,000 or more at auction. The record of $380,000 on March 18, 2017, was for a cow, 3S Danica, and heifer calf at side, during the Legacy XIII sale in Fort Worth, Texas.[16] Registries for the breed include: the Texas Longhorn Breeders Association of America, founded in 1964 by the Kerr County rancher Charles Schreiner III; the International Texas Longhorn Association; and the Cattlemen's Texas Longhorn Registry.[17] The online National Texas Longhorn Museum displays the diversity of horns found in the breed, stories about notable individual cattle of the breed, and a gallery of furniture made from cattle horns.[18] The Longhorn is genetically close to Iberian cattle breeds such as the De Lidia and Retinta of Spain and the Alentejana and Mertolenga of Portugal.[19] Like other Criollo cattle of the Americas and many breeds of southern Europe, it is principally of taurine (European) derivation, but has a small admixture of indicine genetic heritage; this may be a consequence of gene flow across the Strait of Gibraltar from cattle of African origin dating to before the time of the Spanish Conquest.[5] The horns are in some cases very long. In general, the horns of bulls are of moderate length, while those of steers may be much longer.[20]: 313 In 2022 the Guinness Book of Records reported the longest spread of cattle horns (on a living animal) to be: 323.7 cm (127.4 in) for a steer called Poncho Via; 265.1 cm (104.4 in) for a cow named 3S Danica; and 262.5 cm (103.3 in) for a bull named Cowboy Tuff Chex. All three were Texas Longhorns.[21] Coat color is extremely variable. In some 40% of the cattle it is some shade of red, often a light red; the only shade of red not seen is the deep colour typical of the Hereford. The finching pattern is common; when the base color is black it is called zorillo, from the Spanish word for 'skunk'.[20]: 313 Other colors include variations of black, blue, brown, cream, dun, grey, yellow or white, either with or without brindling (called gateada, from the Spanish word for 'cat'), speckling or spotting.[20]: 313 Speckled and solid-coloured animals are in roughly equal proportion.[2] The Longhorn was traditionally reared for beef.[22] In the 21st century it is considered part of the cultural heritage of Texas;[7]: 343 it is the official large mammal of the state.[15] It may be kept for conservation reasons, or bred for greater horn length.[23] It is occasionally used for steer riding.[24][25]",

                "content": "English Longhorns (also known as Longhorns) are not related to the American or Texas Longhorn whose ancestors came from Spain. They do have a long and fascinating history linked to that of the great livestock pioneer of the 1700's, Robert Bakewell of Dishley. The English Longhorn originated from the northern counties of England, it was used as a draught animal and its milk was used for butter and cheese. The creamy white horns were treasured by manufacturers of buttons, cups, cutlery and lamps. Fine slivers of clear horn were a poor mans' glass and many a household were grateful for the end product of these elegant long horns. The most usual method of cattle keeping in those early times would have been one or more animals belonging to an individual, kept on common grazing, which were served by a bull owned by the Lord of the Manor. It was all a most haphazard and unsatisfactory method. There was no possibility of an organised breeding programme being carried out. The peasant farmers had to put up with what the Lord provided. As a result, cattle were long in the leg, narrow bodied and coarse, ideally designed for the plough. Robert Bakewell (1725-1795), a man who was a revolutionary in the field of interbreeding became devoted to one aim - improving livestock to provide meat for the masses of people who went to work in towns in the Industrial Revolution. He took horned heifers and crossed them with a Westmoreland bull to create the Dishley Longhorn, now called the English Longhorn. Through this new and careful selection of cattle he improved the size and quality (specifically its quick growth and heavy hind quarters) of this breed which became widely produced throughout England and Ireland until it was surpassed by the Shorthorn in the 1800's. The breed declined rapidly for nearly 200 years and was becoming rare by the 1950's and 60's. The trend for producing cattle was increasingly cereal fed, housed cattle which pushed selection of cattle with shorter horns or polled to reduce injury. Thankfully it was rescued by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust in 1980. With the efforts of RBST and interest in extensively lean grass fed cattle it has made a dramatic comeback. In 1981 a pair of Longhorns won the much coveted 'Burke Trophy' in the Interbreed Cattle Championship of The Royal Show, and a Longhorn bull was Reserve Interbreed Beef Champion at the Royal Welsh Show in 1994. In 1999 a Longhorn took the Interbreed Native Championship in the Leicester Show and a Longhorn pair were Reserve native Interbreed at the Counties Show. English Longhorns are large lean beef cattle with an impressive sweep of horns that curve down to around the nose. These impressive horns are valued in the pedigree. The body may be any one of a wide range of brindle colours (including colours from red to grey) but they all have the characteristic white line or \"finching\" along the back and down the tail, which is passed onto their cross bred progeny. Cows range in height from 130 to 140cm and weigh 500 to 600kg. Males average 150 cm in height and 1000 kg in weight. English Longhorn is renowned for its ease of calving. Prominent hook bones, deep pins and a roomy birth canal result in almost no recorded incidence of assistance being needed at birth. Longhorns have excellent milking ability and their long and level lactation help avoid a flush of milk at calving. They rear their calves very well. A 6% butter fat is not uncommon although no-one is currently milking them commercially. They are excellent mothers and their docile nature makes them an easy breed to manage. Their breeding, longevity and relatively low body weight makes them very economical and inexpensive to feed. A number of butchers are now stocking Longhorn beef as one of their traceable, quality products. The beef has a velvet texture and tastes delicious. The Longhorn is noted for its “feed responsive milk supply”. It is well known that it is the butterfat element of the milk which gives “bloom” to suckled calves. The Longhorn was renowned for the high butterfat of its milk which, in days gone by, was used in the making of famous cheeses like Stilton and Red Leicester. The lactation is long and level which helps to avoid a flush of milk at calving when the newborn calf cannot cope. The combination of prominent hook bones with wide deep pin bones, whilst still retaining a level top line, produces a roomy birth canal at the right angle to minimise calving problems. This means that a Longhorn or Longhorn Cross Cow when put to a continental bull experiences little or no calving difficulties and thus forms a highly efficient, productive and profitable unit. She is an adaptable long-lived cow that can produce and rear big, growthy calves to any breed of bull. Longhorn cows live to an unusually old age – and keep on breeding. Their hardiness and thriftiness together with their level lactation and ease of calving ensure that they do not place themselves under undue stress. Whilst their horns may, to some, give an opposite impression Longhorns are noted for their exceptional docility. The great overall length generally associated with the Longhorn is correlated with a rapid growth rate and lean carcase. It is a well established fact that intramuscular fat or “marbling” within meat is largely responsible for succulence, tenderness and flavour – the hallmark of beef with superior eating quality. Unlike many rival breeds, which require the laying down of excessive amounts of external fat before the formation of intramuscular fat can take place, a properly finished Longhorn carcase will benefit from “marbling” without such excess external fat cover. Today’s Longhorns are clean, modern cattle, well capable of producing lean beef with superior eating qualities to suit today’s discerning market. The English Longhorn is growing in popularity and can be found in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Australia and New Zealand.

This distinctive breed of cattle played a vital role in Texas' heritage, and the state maintains a herd of traditional Texas Longhorn cattle, allowing residents and visitors to experience these graceful animals first-hand. Fort Griffin State Historic Site near Albany was named the permanent home for the herd more than 60 years ago. Since the 61st Texas Legislature officially recognized the State of Texas Longhorn Herd in 1969, it has managed to keep the cattle as historically correct as possible, and the selection of breeding animals has followed this ideal. The dynamic history of the longhorn breed represents the state's equally captivating past. Texas longhorns descended from cattle brought by Spanish explorers and settlers, and the first significant numbers of these animals likely arrived in the late 1600s. As settlements grew and more cattle arrived, the number of escaped cattle increased. It is from these animals that the Texas longhorn began its colorful history. Accounts from travelers crossing Texas in the early 1700s include stories of the presence of many wild cattle, often misidentified as native species. These animals were considered game, much like deer and buffalo, but were regarded as very wild and more difficult to hunt. Initially referred to as \"Texas cattle\" and later Texas longhorns, the animals reportedly populated a widespread area by the time Texas won its independence from Mexico in 1836--from the Red River to the Rio Grande, east to the Louisiana line and west to the upper breaks of the Brazos River. These early longhorns continued to roam Texas, almost completely wild and without the assistance of humans, until the end of the Civil War. They were often hunted for meat and hides, which likely strengthened their wild habit and instinct. After the Civil War, many longhorns were rounded up and driven up various trails from Texas to Kansas City to be placed on rail cars and shipped east to slaughter. The longhorn was an impressive animal, well adapted to its environment and requiring skilled individuals to gather, handle, and manage the herds to the shipping pens with minimal losses. This gave rise to another Texas breed--the Texas cowboy. It has been estimated that between 1867 and 1880, nearly 10 million cattle were driven north along the trails to market. This provided Texas with a large source of income in an otherwise poor post-war economy, supplied large parts of the United States and Europe with beef and hides, and helped Texas recover from the Civil War. Longhorn cattle were known to endure the drives well, and even gain weight on the long trip north if the grass was plentiful. By the early 1900s, the longhorn was regarded as a less desirable breed of cattle. Rail access improved, barbed wire closed the open range, trail drives became memories, and beef cattle were no longer being transported to faraway markets. European breeds that yielded more beef per animal became more popular, and the number of longhorns decreased. Western writer Frank Dobie recognized the decline of the longhorn in the early 1920s and felt it was important to preserve the breed that held such a significant place in Texas history. With assistance from businessman Sid Richardson and rancher Graves Peeler, Dobie helped organize a herd of typical longhorns. The animals were donated to the Texas Parks Board in 1941 as the state herd and were kept at Lake Corpus Christi State Park near Mathis. Since they were becoming more scarce, the search continued for longhorns, and in 1942 a herd was compiled and kept at Lake Brownwood State Park in Brown County. Due to challenges at these locations, the Texas Parks Board began looking for a more permanent home for the herd. Fort Griffin State Historic Site was selected as the permanent home in 1948, and the official herd has been based there ever since, with some parts of the herd at other state parks. The Official State of Texas Longhorn Herd is now managed by the Texas Historical Commission. The longhorn breed has increased in recognition and numbers in recent years, due to many desirable traits, including longevity, calving ease, resistance to disease and parasites, foraging adaptability, climate adaptability, mothering ability, leaner beef, less dependence on humans, and excellent fertility. Many of these traits may be due to the number of years the cattle survived in Texas without influence from humans, allowing the breed to form its characteristics through natural selection in the harsh Texas climate. The Official State of Texas Longhorn Herd, now numbering approximately 250 cattle, resides primarily at the Fort Griffin State Historic Site and San Angelo State Park, with a few head also residing at Copper Breaks State Park, LBJ State Park, and Palo Duro Canyon State Park. The herd is also featured at the annual Fort Griffin Fandangle, an outdoor musical based on the pioneer chronicles of West Texas, held in Albany the last two weekends in June. This longhorn herd is maintained so residents and visitors can see and experience animals similar to those that were in Texas more than a century ago. Herd managers will continue to raise the cattle from calves, in the image of the animals that are so important and integral to telling the real stories of our state's history. Much like the residents of this state, the longhorn is a true Texan with roots in many places, but forever changed and refined by its time in the Lone Star State.

While his early-season highlights certainly put him higher on the national radar, Smith has stood out since high school. Entering this season, he already stood out as one of the most talented players of any position set to debut this year. A post shared by The Sporting News (@sportingnews) Smith has met expectations so far and clearly has a bright future ahead of him. But who is he? Here's everything to know about Smith, the Ohio State true freshman pass-catcher who is the Buckeyes' 2024 breakout star. MORE: College football scores and results from every Week 5 game Growing up in South Florida, Smith made a name for himself as a member of the Chaminade-Madonna Prep varsity football team. He was named the Maxwell Award High School Player of the Year and MaxPreps Florida Player of the Year his senior season, and he also won the Nat Moore Trophy—an honor given to the top high school player in Miami-Dade, Broward and Monroe counties. In his final two seasons with the Lions, Smith caught 151 passes for 2,474 yards and 39 touchdowns while playing 28 games. In 2023, Chaminade-Madonna Prep was the nation’s No. 2-ranked team and finished the season undefeated as state champions. Oh, and Smith also ran track, qualifying for the 110- and 400-meter hurdles at states three times and capturing gold medals in both races at Florida's 1A meet his junior year. A rare talent, Smith became the first wide receiver to earn a No. 1 overall ranking in the 247Sports composite in over a decade. The last pass-catcher to do so was Dorial Green-Beckham in 2012, who eventually had a short career in the NFL. Naturally, Smith was a five-star prospect on every major recruiting service, too. Drawing comparisons to Julio Jones, Smith accumulated 40 offers and ended up visiting five schools throughout his recruiting process. Eventually, he narrowed it down to two: Miami and Ohio State. The 6-3, 215 pound wide receiver committed to be a Buckeye in 2022 but did not sign his letter of intent until the following December, giving him time to pay the Canes a visit. But he stuck with Ohio State, enrolling in February and becoming integral member of the team's offense in 2024. \"The way they care about their players on and off the field,\" Smith said. \"They're one of the best for their players. It's a family up there in Ohio. Thanksgiving, you know, they'll have their players come over and eat with them, stuff like that. So, I mean, it's definitely a brotherhood up there in Columbus for sure.\" MORE: ESPN ranks Ohio State's Jeremiah Smith top college football freshman An established threat through the air, Smith has enjoyed an impressive start to his true freshman season. Here's a look at how Smith has performed so far through his first six games. Smith started the College Football Playoff with a bang, hauling in a 37-yard touchdown pass from Will Howard before adding an 18-yard grab on the following drive.

Jocelyn Alice Wildenstein[4] was born as Jocelyne Périsset in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 5 August 1940.[5][6] Her father Armand Périsset worked in a sporting goods store and her mother Liliane Périsset was a housewife.[5] She began dating Swiss Cyril Piguet, producer of the 1964 film Un commerce tranquille, at the age of 17.[7] She later lived in Paris with Italian French filmmaker Sergio Gobbi.[8] While there, she became a skilled hunter and pilot.[1] Périsset was introduced to Alec N. Wildenstein, of the wealthy family of renowned art dealers,[9] by Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi at a shooting weekend at the Wildenstein African ranch \"Ol Jogi\" in 1977.[10][6] Périsset and Wildenstein eloped to Las Vegas on 30 April 1978[6]. They had two children together.[11] The Wildensteins' divorce in 1999[2][10] was not amicable.[12] Jocelyn walked in on her husband and a 21-year-old Russian model in her bedroom at the Wildenstein New York City home, and he threatened Jocelyn with a gun.[13][14] This resulted in a night in jail for Alec Wildenstein.[14] The presiding judge, Marilyn Diamond, received death threats in the mail during the proceedings.[15] During her divorce, the judge stipulated that she could not use any alimony payments for further cosmetic surgery.[16] Jocelyn enlisted the services of Ed Rollins[8][17] for public-relations assistance and at various times both Bernard Clair[8][18] and Kenneth Godt[19] for legal counsel. Wildenstein began dating fashion designer Lloyd Klein in 2003.[20] Wildenstein had extensive cosmetic surgeries to her face.[21] Her cat-like appearance[22] led media outlets to nickname her \"Catwoman\", \"The Lion Queen\", and \"The Bride of Wildenstein\".[23] She denied having excessive plastic surgery, citing her Swiss heritage,[22] but admitted to a multimillion dollar surgery to make her eyes more cat-like,[24] which she did with her husband.[6] According to Alec Wildenstein, \"She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way, but she wouldn't listen\".[6] Wildenstein was known for having lived her life in an extravagant manner. She once calculated her yearly telephone bill at $60,000 and food and wine costs at $547,000.[9] Wildenstein received $2.5 billion in her divorce settlement (although this amount has been rumored to be as high as $3.8 billion[25]) and $100 million each year for the following 13 years.[26] The judge stipulated that she could not use any alimony payments for further cosmetic surgery.[16] Following her divorce, Wildenstein sold the marital home in New York City to real estate developer Janna Bullock for $13 million.[27] In 2018, Wildenstein filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, claiming she had $0 in her bank account and listing various tangible assets of $16.39 million against $6.38 million in liabilities.[28] In 2020, her three apartments in Trump Tower were repossessed. Wildenstein told The Times in 2023 that she attributed her financial difficulties to problems with the trust set up following her divorce, and that in 2015, the family of Alec Wildenstein had cut her off from payments.[29] Wildenstein died from a pulmonary embolism at a hotel in Paris, on 31 December 2024, at the age of 84.[30][31]",

Wildenstein often downplayed the extent of her cosmetic procedures, claiming the \"cat eyes\" she was so infamous for were a family trait, or that different hairstyles changed the way she looked. Occasionally, though, she gave a winking tidbit to journalists who, well, needled her about her procedures. \"If you feel good with your imperfections, with your aging, then you should do nothing,\" she reportedly told photographer Zed Nelson in 2006. \"Otherwise, it's all about choosing the right doctor.\" Jocelyn Périsset (her maiden name) spent her early life in Lausanne, Switzerland. (Her birthday had proved hard to track down, as she gave reporters different dates. Klein told AFP that she died at age 79, while other outlets reported that she was 84 at the time of her death.) As a child, she spent her time swimming in lakes or skiing on nearby mountains. Her father inspired in her an early love of African mammals, she told Interview magazine in 2023. She traded Lausanne for Paris in her early 20s, dancing at discos and hobnobbing with well-to-do fellow expats, but she held onto that childhood dream of traveling to Africa. She made several trips to the continent before eventually meeting the billionaire art dealer Alec Wildenstein on a Kenyan safari in 1977. Alec told Vanity Fair in 1998 that he'd been asked to kill a lion on a neighbor's land, and his future wife tagged along. The pair married the following year, and the new Mrs. Wildenstein gained a new residence: Ol Jogi, the massive ranch her husband's family owned in Kenya — her favorite of several new international homes. Her love affair with African big cats continued shortly thereafter on a grander scale — as did her much-reported proclivity for exorbitant spending. After inheriting Ol Jogi through marriage, she installed a bulletproof enclosure for two tigers, a fitting addition to a property that reportedly included 200 buildings staffed by over 300 servants. She told Vanity Fair she and her then-husband spent about $1 million a month. For Wildenstein, a couture Chanel gown costing $350,000 was worth the price. Her most enduring project was her face. Wildenstein underwent extensive cosmetic surgery in her lifetime, starting about a year into her marriage to Alec, though she long denied it. The two first sought \"his-and-hers eye-lifts,\" as described pithily in a 1998 Vanity Fair feature, but Wildenstein went further. Throughout most of her adult life, the outer corners of Wildenstein's eyes slanted up towards her temples, resembling the felines she so admired; her skin was pulled so taut and her cheeks sat so high on her face that it was free of wrinkles well into her 70s. Wildenstein's marriage had soured by 1998 when she claimed she discovered her husband in bed with another woman. Alec was charged with menacing his wife after she said he pointed a loaded pistol as she walked in on the scene in their New York mansion, which they shared with other members of the Wildenstein family. After a contentious trial, Alec was ordered to pay Wildenstein $2.5 billion in a divorce settlement — and $100 million each year for 13 years. He later died in 2008.

Klein told People that some of their fights were brought on by Wildenstein's stress about her \"financial duress.\" Despite her massive divorce settlement in 1999, Wildenstein filed for bankruptcy in 2018. She told British newspaper The Times that she was still \"broke\" in late 2023. After years of avoiding the public eye save for her appearances at her beau's runway presentations, a decision she said she made to keep her two children, born during her marriage to Alec, out of the press, Wildenstein returned to the spotlight in her later life. Her otherworldly features, which tabloids once snarked over, were celebrated by stylish outlets like Paper and Interview, for which she posed for grand photoshoots. That she maintained her gaudy glamor (and continued unwillingness to cop to plastic surgery) amid her bankruptcy made her a campy icon of sorts, one even imitated in the front row at haute couture fashion week.

Documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock, an Oscar nominee whose most famous works skewered America’s food industry and who notably ate only at McDonald’s for a month to illustrate the dangers of a fast-food diet, has died of cancer. He was 53. Spurlock made a splash in 2004 with his groundbreaking film “Super Size Me,” and returned in 2019 with “Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!” — a sober look at an industry that processes 9 billion animals a year in America.

Sherman, one half of the prolific, award-winning pair of brothers who helped form millions of childhoods by penning classic Disney tunes, has died. He was 95.

Mays, the electrifying “Say Hey Kid” whose singular combination of talent, drive and exuberance made him one of baseball’s greatest and most beloved players, died June 18. He was 93. The center fielder, who began his professional career in the Negro Leagues in 1948, had been baseball’s oldest living Hall of Famer. He was voted into the Hall in 1979, his first year of eligibility, and in 1999 followed only Babe Ruth on The Sporting News’ list of the game’s top stars. The Giants retired his uniform number, 24, and set their AT&T Park in San Francisco on Willie Mays Plaza. Mays died two days before a game between the Giants and St. Louis Cardinals to honor the Negro Leagues at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama. Over 23 major league seasons, virtually all with the New York/San Francisco Giants but also including one in the Negro Leagues, Mays batted .301, hit 660 home runs, totaled 3,293 hits, scored more than 2,000 runs and won 12 Gold Gloves. He was Rookie of the Year in 1951, twice was named the Most Valuable Player and finished in the top 10 for the MVP 10 other times. His lightning sprint and over-the-shoulder grab of an apparent extra base hit in the 1954 World Series remains the most celebrated defensive play in baseball history. For millions in the 1950s and ’60s and after, the smiling ballplayer with the friendly, high-pitched voice was a signature athlete and showman during an era when baseball was still the signature pastime. Awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2015, Mays left his fans with countless memories. But a single feat served to capture his magic — one so untoppable it was simply called “The Catch.” Actor Donald Sutherland appears Oct. 13, 2017, at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, Calif. Sutherland, the Canadian actor whose wry, arrestingly off-kilter screen presence spanned more than half a century of films from “M.A.S.H.” to “The Hunger Games,” died June 20. He was 88. Kiefer Sutherland said on X he believed his father was one of the most important actors in the history of film: “Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that.” The tall and gaunt Sutherland, who flashed a grin that could be sweet or diabolical, was known for offbeat characters like Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's \"M.A.S.H.,\" the hippie tank commander in \"Kelly's Heroes\" and the stoned professor in \"Animal House.\" Before transitioning into a long career as a respected character actor, Sutherland epitomized the unpredictable, antiestablishment cinema of the 1970s. He never stopped working, appearing in nearly 200 films and series. Over the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down — but still eccentric — roles in Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK.\" More, recently, he starred in the “Hunger Games” films. A memoir, “Made Up, But Still True,” is due out in November. Actor Bill Cobbs, a cast member in \"Get Low,\" arrives July 27, 2010, at the premiere of the film in Beverly Hills, Calif. Cobbs, the veteran character actor who became a ubiquitous and sage screen presence as an older man, died June 25. He was 90. A Cleveland native, Cobbs acted in such films as “The Hudsucker Proxy,” “The Bodyguard” and “Night at the Museum.” He made his first big-screen appearance in a fleeting role in 1974's “The Taking of Pelham One Two Three.\" He became a lifelong actor with some 200 film and TV credits. The lion share of those came in his 50s, 60s, and 70s, as filmmakers and TV producers turned to him again and again to imbue small but pivotal parts with a wizened and worn soulfulness. Cobbs appeared on television shows including “The Sopranos,\" “The West Wing,” “Sesame Street” and “Good Times.” He was Whitney Houston's manager in “The Bodyguard” (1992), the mystical clock man of the Coen brothers' “The Hudsucker Proxy” (1994) and the doctor of John Sayles' “Sunshine State” (2002). He played the coach in “Air Bud” (1997), the security guard in “Night at the Museum” (2006) and the father on “The Gregory Hines Show.\" Cobbs rarely got the kinds of major parts that stand out and win awards. Instead, Cobbs was a familiar and memorable everyman who left an impression on audiences, regardless of screen time. He won a Daytime Emmy Award for outstanding limited performance in a daytime program for the series “Dino Dana” in 2020. Independent gubernatorial candidate Kinky Friedman speaks with the media Nov. 7, 2009, at his campaign headquarters in Austin, Texas. The singer, songwriter, satirist and novelist, who led the alt-country band Texas Jewboys, toured with Bob Dylan, sang with Willie Nelson, and dabbled in politics with campaigns for Texas governor and other statewide offices, died June 27. He was 79 and had suffered from Parkinson's disease. Often called “The Kinkster\" and sporting sideburns, a thick mustache and cowboy hat, Friedman earned a cult following and reputation as a provocateur throughout his career across musical and literary genres. In the 1970s, his satirical country band Kinky Friedman and the Texas Jewboys wrote songs with titles such as “They Ain't Makin' Jews Like Jesus Anymore” and “Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in Bed.” Friedman joined part of Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue tour in 1976. By the 1980s, Friedman was writing crime novels that often included a version of himself, and he wrote a column for Texas Monthly magazine in the 2000s. Friedman's run at politics brought his brand of irreverence to the serious world of public policy. In 2006, Friedman ran for governor as an independent in a five-way race that included incumbent Republican Rick Perry. Friedman launched his campaign against the backdrop of the Alamo. Martin Mull participates in \"The Cool Kids\" panel during the Fox Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour on Aug. 2, 2018, at The Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif. Mull, whose droll, esoteric comedy and acting made him a hip sensation in the 1970s and later a beloved guest star on sitcoms including “Roseanne” and “Arrested Development,” died June 28. He was 80. Mull, who was also a guitarist and painter, came to national fame with a recurring role on the Norman Lear-created satirical soap opera “Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,” and the starring role in its spinoff, “Fernwood Tonight.\" His first foray into show business was as a songwriter, penning the 1970 semi-hit “A Girl Named Johnny Cash” for singer Jane Morgan. He would combine music and comedy in an act that he brought to hip Hollywood clubs in the 1970s. Mull often played slightly sleazy, somewhat slimy and often smarmy characters as he did as Teri Garr's boss and Michael Keaton's foe in 1983's “Mr. Mom.” He played Colonel Mustard in the 1985 movie adaptation of the board game “Clue,” which, like many things Mull appeared in, has become a cult classic. The 1980s also brought what many thought was his best work, “A History of White People in America,” a mockumentary that first aired on Cinemax. Mull co-created the show and starred as a “60 Minutes” style investigative reporter investigating all things milquetoast and mundane. Willard was again a co-star. In the 1990s he was best known for his recurring role on several seasons on “Roseanne,” in which he played a warmer, less sleazy boss to the title character, an openly gay man whose partner was played by Willard, who died in 2020. Mull would later play private eye Gene Parmesan on “Arrested Development,” a cult-classic character on a cult-classic show, and would be nominated for an Emmy, his first, in 2016 for a guest run on “Veep.” Screenwriter Robert Towne poses at The Regency Hotel, March 7, 2006, in New York.

He saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included their signature 1981 song “Elvira.” The hit marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard’s all-genre Hot 100.

He wouldn’t want people to have hatred in their heart. He would want there to be a message of peace and love and acceptance of all people,\" Michelle said. \"I think that's what Tiger would say, absolutely.\" Bech attended high school at St. Thomas More Catholic in Lafayette.
