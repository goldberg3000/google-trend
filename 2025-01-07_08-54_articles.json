Inauguration Day occurs every four years on January 20 (or January 21 if January 20 falls on a Sunday). The inauguration ceremony takes place at the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, DC. The next presidential inauguration is scheduled to be on January 20, 2025. The vice-president-elect is sworn in first and repeats the same oath of office, in use since 1884, as senators, representatives, and other federal employees: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.\" Around noon, the president-elect recites the following oath in accordance with Article II, Section I of the U.S. Constitution: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" The inauguration is planned by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies (JCCIC). Inaugural events include the swearing-in ceremony, the inaugural address, and the pass in review. Learn more about each event from the JCCIC. For more information on the history of presidential inaugurations, explore the inaugural materials from the collections of the Library of Congress. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies makes a limited number of inauguration tickets available to the public through members of Congress. Tickets are free and allow you to watch in person on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol as the president and vice president are sworn in on January 20, 2025. Tickets will be available from your members of Congress in the weeks leading up to the inauguration. Some members may begin accepting requests for tickets before then.

                "content": "Between 73 and 79 days after the presidential election, the president-elect of the United States is inaugurated as president by taking the presidential oath of office. The inauguration takes place for each new presidential term, even if the president is continuing in office for another term. The first inauguration of George Washington took place on April 30, 1789. All subsequent public inaugurations from 1793 until 1933 were held on March 4, except in 1821, 1849, 1877, and 1917, when March 4 fell on a Sunday and the public inauguration ceremony took place on Monday, March 5. Since 1937, it has taken place at noon EST on January 20, the first day of the new term, except in 1957, 1985, and 2013, when January 20 fell on a Sunday. In those years, the presidential oath of office was administered on that day privately and then again in a public ceremony the next day, on Monday, January 21. Those inaugurations, each 28 years apart, were all coincidentally the re-inauguration of the incumbent president to a second and final term. The most recent presidential inauguration was held on January 20, 2021, when Joe Biden assumed office. Recitation of the presidential oath of office is the only component in this ceremony mandated by the United States Constitution (in Article II, Section One, Clause 8). Though it is not a constitutional requirement, the chief justice of the United States typically administers the presidential oath of office. Since 1789, the oath has been administered at 59 scheduled public inaugurations, by 15 chief justices, one associate justice, and one New York state judge. Others, in addition to the chief justice, have administered the oath of office to several of the nine vice presidents who have succeeded to the presidency upon their predecessor's death or resignation intra-term. Since the 1981 inauguration of Ronald Reagan, the ceremony has been held at the west front of the United States Capitol facing the National Mall with its iconic Washington Monument and distant Lincoln Memorial. From 1829 through 1977, most swearing-in ceremonies had taken place on a platform over the steps at the Capitol's east portico. They have also been held inside the Old Senate Chamber, the chamber of the House of Representatives, and the Capitol rotunda.[1] The most recent regularly scheduled inauguration not to take place at the Capitol was the fourth inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, which was held at the White House. Over the years, various traditions have arisen that have expanded the inauguration from a simple oath-taking ceremony to a day-long event, including parades and multiple social gatherings. The ceremony itself is carried live via the major U.S. commercial television and cable news networks; various ones also stream it live on their websites. When a president has assumed office intra-term, the inauguration ceremony has been conducted without pomp or fanfare. To facilitate a quick presidential transition under extraordinary circumstances, the new president takes the oath of office in a simple ceremony and usually addresses the nation afterward. This has happened nine times in United States history: eight times after the previous president had died while in office, and once after the previous president had resigned. The first inauguration, that of George Washington, took place on April 30, 1789. All subsequent (regular) inaugurations from 1793 until 1933, were held on March 4, the day of the year on which the federal government began operations under the U.S. Constitution in 1789. The exception to this pattern was those years in which March 4 fell on a Sunday. When it did, the public inauguration ceremony would take place on Monday, March 5. This happened on four occasions, in 1821, 1849, 1877, and 1917. Inauguration Day moved to January 20, beginning in 1937, following ratification of the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution, where it has remained since. A similar Sunday exception and move to Monday is made around this date as well (which happened in 1957, 1985, and 2013). This resulted in several anomalies. It has been alleged that in 1849, Senate President pro tempore David Rice Atchison was president for a day, although all scholars dismiss that claim.[2][3] In 1877, due to the controversy over the Compromise of 1877, Rutherford B. Hayes was sworn in secretly on March 3 before Ulysses S. Grant's term ended on March 4—raising the question if the United States had two presidents at the same time for one day.[2] In modern times, the president took the oath on a Sunday in a private ceremony and repeated it the following day with all the pomp and circumstance. In 1985 and 2013, these ceremonies were televised. Irregular inaugurations occurred on nine occasions intra-term, after the death or, in one case, resignation of a president. Inauguration Day, while not a federal holiday, is observed as a holiday by federal employees who would be working in the \"Inauguration Day Area\" and who are regularly scheduled to perform non-overtime work on Inauguration Day.[4] There is no in-lieu-of holiday for employees or students who are not regularly scheduled to work or attend school on Inauguration Day. The Inauguration Day Area consists of the District of Columbia; Montgomery and Prince George's counties in Maryland; Arlington and Fairfax counties in Virginia (the City of Fairfax is considered part of Fairfax County for this purpose), and the cities of Alexandria and Falls Church in Virginia.[4] Inauguration Day has also fallen on the same statutory day as Martin Luther King Jr. Day, another federal holiday (designated in 1986), in 1997 and 2013, and will intersect with the holiday in 2025.[5] Most presidential inaugurations since 1801 have been held in Washington D.C. at the Capitol Building. Prior inaugurations were held, first at Federal Hall in New York City (1789),[6] and then at Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1793 and 1797). Each city was, at the time, the nation's capital. The location for James Monroe's 1817 swearing in was moved to the Old Brick Capitol in Washington due to ongoing restoration work at the Capitol building following the War of 1812.[7] Three other inaugurations—Franklin D. Roosevelt's fourth (1945), Harry S. Truman's first (1945), and Gerald Ford's (1974)—were held at the White House. Presidential inaugurations (aside from intra-term ceremonies following the death or resignation of a president) have traditionally been outdoor public ceremonies.[8] In 1909, William H. Taft's inauguration was moved to the Senate Chamber due to a blizzard.[9] Then, in 1985, the public second inauguration of Ronald Reagan was held indoors in the Capitol Rotunda because of harsh weather conditions. The first inauguration of Andrew Jackson, in 1829, was the first of 35 held on the east front of the Capitol. Since the 1981 first inauguration of Ronald Reagan, they have been held on the Capitol's west front; a move designed to both cut costs and to provide more space for spectators.[10] Above the west front inaugural platform are five large United States flags. The current 50-star flag is displayed in the center.[8] On either side are earlier variations of the national flag: two are the official flag adopted by Congress after the admission to the Union of the new president's home state and two are the 13-star flag popularly known as the Betsy Ross flag.[11] Before Inauguration Day, the president-elect will name a Presidential Inaugural Committee. This committee is the legal entity responsible for fundraising for and the planning and coordination of all official events and activities surrounding the inauguration of president and vice president (other than the ceremony itself), such as the balls and parade.[12] Since 1901, the Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies has been responsible for the planning and execution of the swearing-in ceremonies.[13] Since 1953, it has also hosted a luncheon at the U.S. Capitol for the new president, vice president, and guests. Three senators and three representatives make up the committee. The Joint Task Force National Capital Region, composed of service members from all branches of the United States Armed Forces, including Reserve and National Guard components, is responsible for all military support to ceremonies and to civil authorities for the inaugural period (in 2017, January 15–24). U.S. military personnel have participated in Inauguration Day ceremonies since 1789 when members of the Continental Army, local militia units and Revolutionary War veterans escorted George Washington to his first inauguration ceremony. Their participation traditionally includes musical units, color guards, salute batteries and honor cordons. Military support to the inauguration honors the new president, who is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and recognizes civilian control of the military.[14] In addition to the public, the attendees at the inauguration generally include the vice president, members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, high-ranking military officers, former presidents and vice-presidents, living Medal of Honor recipients, and other dignitaries. The outgoing president and vice president also customarily attend the ceremony. While most outgoing presidents have appeared on the inaugural platform with their successor, six did not: The way inauguration ceremony events are communicated to the public has changed over the years with each advance in technology. Improvements in mass media technologies have allowed presidents to reach substantially greater numbers of their constituents. In 1829, Andrew Jackson spoke to approximately 10,000 people at his inauguration.[19] Most recently, in 2017, it is estimated that about 160,000 people were in the National Mall areas in the hour leading up to Donald Trump's swearing in.[20] An additional 30.6 million people in the United States watched it on television,[21] and more than 6.8 million worldwide streamed it live on Twitter.[22] Among the inauguration mass communication milestones are:[23] Inauguration procedure is governed by tradition rather than the Constitution, the only constitutionally required procedure being the presidential oath of office (which may be taken anywhere, with anyone in attendance who can legally witness an oath, and at any time prior to the actual beginning of the new president's term).[15] Traditionally, the president-elect arrives at the White House and then proceeds to the Capitol Building with the out-going president. Around or after 12 noon, the president takes the oath of office, usually administered by the chief justice of the United States, and then delivers the inaugural address. The vice president is sworn into office in the same ceremony as the president. Prior to 1937, the vice presidential oath was administered in the Senate Chamber (in keeping with the vice president's position as president of the Senate). The oath is administered to the vice president first. Immediately afterwards, the United States Marine Band will perform four \"ruffles and flourishes\", followed by \"Hail, Columbia\". Unlike the presidential oath, however, the Constitution does not specify specific words that must be spoken. Several variants of the oath have been used since 1789. The current form, which is also recited by senators, representatives, and other government officers, has been in use since 1884: I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.[24] At noon, the new presidential and vice presidential terms begin. At about that time, the president recites the constitutionally mandated oath of office: I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. According to Washington Irving's biography of George Washington, after reciting the oath at his (and the nation's) first inauguration, Washington added the words \"so help me God\".[25] However, the only contemporaneous source that fully reproduced Washington's oath completely lacks the religious codicil.[26] The first newspaper report that actually described the exact words used in an oath of office, Chester Arthur's in 1881,[27] repeated the \"query-response\" method where the words, \"so help me God\" were a personal prayer, not a part of the constitutional oath. The time of adoption of the current procedure, where both the chief justice and the president speak the oath, is unknown. The oath of office was administered to Washington in 1789 by Robert Livingston, Chancellor of New York State. Four years later, the oath was administered by Supreme Court associate justice William Cushing. Since the 1797 inauguration of John Adams, it has become customary for the new president to be sworn into office by the Chief Justice of the United States. Others have administered the oath on occasions when a new president assumed office intra-term due to the incumbent's death or resignation. William Cranch, chief judge of the U.S. Circuit Court, administered the oath of office to John Tyler in 1841 when he succeeded to the presidency upon William Henry Harrison's death, and to Millard Fillmore in 1850 when Zachary Taylor died. In 1923, upon being informed of Warren Harding's death, while visiting his family home in Plymouth Notch, Vermont, Calvin Coolidge was sworn in as president by his father, John Calvin Coolidge, Sr., a notary public.[28][29] Most recently, federal judge Sarah T. Hughes administered the oath of office to Lyndon B. Johnson aboard Air Force One after John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963. Since 1789 there have been 59 inaugural ceremonies to mark the commencement of a new four-year term of a president of the United States, and an additional nine marking the start of a partial presidential term following the intra-term death or resignation of an incumbent president. With the 2021 inauguration of Joe Biden, the oath has been taken 73 different times by 45 people. This numerical discrepancy results chiefly from two factors: a president must take the oath at the beginning of each term of office, and, because the day of inauguration has sometimes fallen on a Sunday, five presidents have taken the oath privately before the public inaugural ceremonies.[23] There is no requirement that any book, or in particular a book of sacred text, be used to administer the oath, and none is mentioned in the Constitution. By convention, incoming presidents raise their right hand and place the left on a Bible or other book while taking the oath of office. While most have, John Quincy Adams did not use a Bible when taking the oath in 1825;[30] neither did Theodore Roosevelt in 1901.[31] In 1853, Franklin Pierce affirmed the oath of office rather than swear it.[32] More recently, a Catholic missal was used for Lyndon B. Johnson's 1963 swearing in ceremony.[33][34] Bibles of historical significance have sometimes been used at inaugurations. George H. W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Dwight D. Eisenhower used the George Washington Inaugural Bible. Barack Obama placed his hand upon the Lincoln Bible for his oaths in 2009 and 2013,[35] as did Donald Trump in 2017.[36] Joe Biden placed his hand upon a large leather-bound family Bible.[37] Immediately after the presidential oath, the United States Marine Band will perform four \"ruffles and flourishes\", followed by \"Hail to the Chief\", while simultaneously, a 21-gun salute is fired using artillery pieces from the Presidential Guns Salute Battery, 3rd United States Infantry Regiment \"The Old Guard\" located in Taft Park, north of the Capitol. The actual gun salute begins with the first \"ruffle and flourish\", and \"run long\" (i.e. the salute concludes after \"Hail to the Chief\" has ended). The Marine Band, which is believed to have made its inaugural debut in 1801 for Thomas Jefferson's first inauguration, is the only musical unit to participate in all three components of the presidential inauguration: the swearing-in ceremony, the inaugural parade, and an inaugural ball. During the ceremony, the band is positioned directly below the presidential podium at the U.S. Capitol.[38] Newly sworn-in presidents usually give a speech referred to as an inaugural address. As with many inaugural customs, this one was started by George Washington in 1789. After taking his oath of office on the balcony of Federal Hall, he proceeded to the Senate chamber where he read a speech before members of Congress and other dignitaries. Every president since Washington has delivered an inaugural address. While many of the early presidents read their addresses before taking the oath, current custom dictates that the chief justice administer the oath first, followed by the president's speech.[13] William McKinley requested the change in 1897, so that he could reiterate the words of the oath at the close of his first inaugural address. William Henry Harrison delivered the longest inaugural address, at 8,445 words, in 1841. John Adams' 1797 address, which totaled 2,308 words, contained the longest sentence, at 737 words. In 1793, Washington gave the shortest inaugural address on record, just 135 words.[13] Most presidents use their inaugural address to present their vision of America and to set forth their goals for the nation. Some of the most eloquent and powerful speeches are still quoted today. In 1865, in the waning days of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln stated, \"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\" In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt avowed, \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” And in 1961, John F. Kennedy declared, \"And so my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country.\"[13] On the eight occasions where the new president succeeded to the office upon their predecessor's death intra-term, none gave an address, but each did address Congress soon thereafter.[15] When Gerald Ford became president in 1974, following the resignation of Richard Nixon, he addressed the nation after taking the oath, but he characterized his speech as \"Not an inaugural address, not a fireside chat, not a campaign speech – just a little straight talk among friends\".[39] ( Full text ) Since 1937, the ceremony has incorporated one or more prayers.[40][41] Since 1933 an associated prayer service either public or private attended by the president-elect has often taken place on the morning of the day.[42] At times a major public or broadcast prayer service takes place after the main ceremony most recently on the next day.[43] Six inaugural ceremonies since 1961 have included a reading by a poet.[44] The following poetry readings have taken place: Over the years, various inauguration traditions have arisen that have expanded the event from a simple oath-taking ceremony to a day-long one, including parades, speeches, and balls. In fact, contemporary inaugural celebrations typically span 10 days, from five days before the inauguration to five days after. On some occasions however, either due to the preferences of the new president or to other constraining circumstances, they have been scaled back. Such was the case in 1945, because of rationing in effect during World War II. More recently, in 1973, the celebrations marking Richard Nixon's second inauguration were altered because of the death of former president Lyndon B. Johnson two days after the ceremony. All pending events were cancelled so preparations for Johnson's state funeral could begin. Because of the construction work on the center steps of the East Front, Johnson's casket was taken up the Senate wing steps of the Capitol when taken into the rotunda to lie in state.[51] When it was brought out, it came out through the House wing steps of the Capitol.[51] In 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the festivities were scaled back. [citation needed] Since 1953, the president and vice president have been guests of honor at a luncheon held by the leadership of the United States Congress immediately following the inaugural ceremony. The luncheon is held in Statuary Hall and is organized by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, and attended by the leadership of both houses of Congress as well as guests of the president and vice president. By tradition, the outgoing president and vice president will not attend. In 2021, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the luncheon was replaced by a gift-giving ceremony. Following the arrival of the presidential entourage to the White House, it is customary for the president, vice-president, their respective families and leading members of the government and military to review an inaugural parade from an enclosed stand at the edge of the North Lawn, a custom begun by James Garfield in 1881. The parade, which proceeds along 1.5 miles (2.4 km) of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the stand and the Front Lawn in view of the presidential party, features both military and civilian participants from all 50 states and the District of Columbia; this parade largely evolved from the post-inaugural procession to the White House, and occurred as far back as Jefferson's second inauguration in 1805, when workers from the Washington Navy Yard, accompanied by military music, marched with the president[52] on foot as he rode on horseback from the Capitol to the White House. By the time of William Henry Harrison's inauguration in 1841, political clubs and marching societies would regularly travel to Washington for the parade. That year was also the first in which floats were part of the parade. It was at Lincoln's second inauguration, in 1865, that Native Americans and African Americans participated in the inaugural parade for the first time.[53] Women were involved for the first time in 1917.[54] In 1829, following his first inaugural parade, Andrew Jackson held a public reception at the White House, during which 20,000 people created such a crush that Jackson had to escape through a window. Nevertheless, White House receptions continued until lengthy afternoon parades created scheduling problems. Reviving the idea in 1989, President George H. W. Bush invited the public to a \"White House American Welcome\" on the day after the inaugural.[55] Grover Cleveland’s 1885 inaugural parade lasted three hours and showcased 25,000 marchers. Eighty years later, Lyndon Johnson’s parade included 52 select bands.[55] Dwight D. Eisenhower's 1953 parade included about 22,000 service men and women and 5,000 civilians, which included 50 state and organization floats costing $100,000. There were also 65 musical units, 350 horses, 3 elephants, an Alaskan dog team, and the 280-millimeter atomic cannon.[56] In 1977, Jimmy Carter became the first president to set out by foot for more than a mile on the route to the White House. The walk has become a tradition that has been matched in ceremony if not in length by the presidents who followed.[57] Twice during the 20th century, an inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue was not held. In 1945, at the height of World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt's fourth Inauguration was simple and austere with no fanfare or formal celebration following the event. There was no parade because of gas rationing and a lumber shortage.[58] In 1985, with the temperature near 7 °F (−14 °C),[59][60] all outdoor events for Ronald Reagan's second inauguration were canceled or moved indoors.[52] A tradition of an interfaith national prayer service, usually the day after the inauguration, dates back to George Washington and since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the prayer service has been held at the Washington National Cathedral.[61] This is not the same as the Inaugural Prayer, a tradition also begun by Washington, when on June 1, 1789, Methodist bishops Francis Asbury and Thomas Coke, Rev. John Dickins, the pastor of Old St. George's (America's oldest Methodist Church) and Major Thomas Morrell, one of President Washington's former aides-de-camp called upon Washington in New York City.[62] This tradition resumed in 1985 with President Reagan and continues under the auspices of a Presidential Inaugural Prayer Committee based at Old St. George's. The first Inaugural Ball was held on the night of James Madison's first inauguration in 1809. Tickets were $4 and it took place at Long's Hotel.[54] The security for the inaugural celebrations is a complex matter, involving the Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Protective Service (DHS-FPS), all five branches of the Armed Forces, the Capitol Police, the United States Park Police (USPP), and the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC). Federal law enforcement agencies also sometimes request assistance from various other state and local law-enforcement agencies throughout the United States. Beginning with George Washington, there has been a traditional association with Inauguration festivities and the production of a presidential medal. With the District of Columbia attracting thousands of attendees for inauguration, presidential medals were an inexpensive souvenir for the tourists to remember the occasion. However, the once-simple trinket turned into an official presidential election memento. In 1901, the first Inauguration Committee[63][failed verification] on Medals and Badges was established as part of the official Inauguration Committee for the re-election of President McKinley. The Committee saw official medals as a way to raise funding for the festivities. Gold medals were to be produced as gifts for the president, vice president, and committee chair; silver medals were to be created and distributed among Inauguration Committee members, and bronze medals would be for sale for public consumption. McKinley's medal was simple with his portrait on one side and writing on the other side.[64] Unlike his predecessor, when Theodore Roosevelt took his oath of office in 1905, he found the previous presidential medal unacceptable. As an art lover and admirer of the ancient Greek high-relief coins, Roosevelt wanted more than a simple medal—he wanted a work of art. To achieve this goal, the president hired Augustus Saint-Gaudens, a famous American sculptor, to design and create his inauguration medal. Saint-Gaudens' obsession with perfection resulted in a forestalled release and the medals were distributed after the actual inauguration. Nonetheless, President Roosevelt was very pleased with the result. Saint-Gaudens' design, executed by Adolph A. Weinman, was cast by Tiffany & Company and was proclaimed an artistic triumph.[65] Saint-Gaudens' practice of creating a portrait sculpture of the newly elected president is still used today in presidential medal creation. After the president sits for the sculptor, the resulting clay sketch is turned into a life mask and plaster model. Finishing touches are added and the epoxy cast that is created is used to produce the die cuts. The die cuts are then used to strike the president's portrait on each medal.[66] From 1929 through 1949, the official medal was struck by the U.S. Mint. This changed in 1953 when the Medallic Art Company was chosen to strike Walker Hancock's portrait of President Eisenhower. The official medals have been struck by private mints ever since.[65] The Smithsonian Institution and The George Washington University hold the two most complete collections of presidential medals in the United States. Gerald Ford's unscheduled inauguration also had a medal.[67] The 59 inauguration ceremonies marking the start of a new four-year presidential term of office and also the nine marking the start of a partial presidential term following the intra-term death or resignation of an incumbent president are listed in the table below.",

                "content": "In the United States, Inauguration Day is the day the person elected to be the president (or the president-elect) officially becomes president. It takes place every four years on January 20. (The day is moved to January 21 if January 20 falls on a Sunday.) Most of the events of Inauguration Day are based on tradition. The only parts of the inauguration that are written into the United States Constitution are the date and the words of the oath that the president must say to become president. From George Washington’s second inauguration in 1793 to Franklin Roosevelt’s first inauguration in 1933, Inauguration Day was March 4. That was the anniversary of the date the Constitution took effect in 1789. However, since the presidential election takes place in November, many felt that there was too much time between when a president had been voted out of office and when the new president could take over. As a result, the 20th Amendment was added to the Constitution. This amendment changed the beginning and ending dates of presidential terms. The new inauguration date became January 20. Inauguration Day begins with a worship service attended by the president-elect. The president-elect then goes to the White House to meet with the outgoing president. After that, both the president and the president-elect, along with the vice president and vice president-elect, proceed to the United States Capitol for the swearing-in ceremonies. After they are each sworn into office, the new president gives a speech that is known as the Inaugural Address. This speech usually addresses the president’s goals for the country. After the swearing-in ceremonies, the new president, vice president, and others attend an Inaugural Luncheon in the Capitol. The meal is followed by the Inaugural Parade. The parade is led by the president and vice president as they are driven to the White House. They lead a procession of ceremonial military groups, marching bands, and floats. Sometimes the president will walk at least part of the way along the route. Once the president and vice president arrive at the White House, they watch the rest of the parade.

                "content": "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 alongside with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[8] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023.[9][10] It was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable football club.[11] In 2024, Real Madrid become the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue according to the club's announcement.[12] Real Madrid are one of the most successful clubs in the sport. In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 35 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record nine FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[17] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[18][19] Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.[20][21] Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[22] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018); however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.[23] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million);[24] he became both the club's and history's all-time top goalscorer.[25][26][27][28] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham[29] and Kylian Mbappé.[30][31] Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[32] while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[33] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (55),[18] a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[34] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 and was the first and the only club to win La Decima (in 2013-14).[35] In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the sixth in eleven seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records.[36] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[37] As of July 2024,[update] Real Madrid are ranked 2nd in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall.[38][39] Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.[40] They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[41][42][43] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[7] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[44][45] Three years after its founding, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[46] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[47] In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[48] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[49] On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco.[note 2][50] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[51] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper Ya reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[52] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: Reds! Separatists!... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[53] Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's José Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while Ángel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'.\"[54] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[55] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[51] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[56] Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[57] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"cantera,\" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[58] In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel)[59] and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[60] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[58] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[61] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[62] The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[63] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name \"Yé-yé\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[64] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[65] and 1964.[63] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[66] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[67] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[68] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president. Bernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[69] In the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[70][71] Spanish sports journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. All five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[70][71] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[70][71] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club. In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[72] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[73] In November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[74] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[75] In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[76] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[77] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[78] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the pitch, the Zidanes y Pavones policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[79] The few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[80] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[81] \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[82] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[82] The 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[83] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[84] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[85] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,[86] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[87] Ramón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[88] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[89] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.[90] On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[91][92] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[93] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[94] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos.[95] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[96] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[97][98] José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[99][100] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[101][102] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[103] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe. In the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[104] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[105] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[106][107] Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[108] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[109] On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[110] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[111] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[112] By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[113] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[114] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La Décima\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la ˈðeθima]).[115] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[116] After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[117] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[118] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[119] After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[120] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[121] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[122] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[123] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012.[124] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[125] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[126][127] On 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[128] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez.[129][130][131] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to produce good results against top teams.[132] Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[133] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favour, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[134] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"La Undécima\".[135][136][127] Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[137] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[138] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[139] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[140] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[141] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[142] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[143][144] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duodécima\".[145] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[146] Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[147] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[148] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[149] In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[150][151] Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[152] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[153] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[98] On 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[154][155] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[156] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[157] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[158] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[159] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.[160] In the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million.[161] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[162] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[163] From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[164][165] Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[166] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[167] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[168][169][170] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[171] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[172] defeating pre-tournament favourites Paris Saint-Germain,[173][174] defending champions and favourites Chelsea,[175] Premier League champions and heavy favourites Manchester City,[176] all in dramatic fashion,[177] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favourites,[178] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius Júnior goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[179][180] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favoured to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[181] After a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club. Real Madrid's 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup. The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to FC Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate. In 2023, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham, who was given the number #5 jersey, previously used by Zinedine Zidane. Real also signed Arda Güler and Fran García. Meanwhile, Vinícius Júnior was given the number #7 jersey, previously used by Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo; while Rodrygo was given the number #11 jersey, previously used by Gareth Bale. Karim Benzema left the club, while Toni Kroos would later announce that he would retire from football after this season. The 2023-24 season would prove to be another highly successful season for Los Blancos. First, Real Madrid lifted the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona 4–1, taking revenge of the previous year's 3–0 defeat. Then, Real Madrid lifted the La Liga with relative ease, reaching 95 points, the second-best winning campaign by Real Madrid in La Liga history after the 2011–12 100 points season. In the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid knocked out RB Leipzig in the Round of 16, then defending champions Manchester City in penalties. In the semifinals, Real Madrid faced Bayern Munich again. The first match was a 2–2 draw, while the second match in the Bernabéu was marked by a double by Joselu in the last few minutes of the game, with Bayern Munich suffering a historic comeback after leading 1–0. Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in the final, and won 2–0, with Dani Carvajal being the man of the match and scoring with a header after a Toni Kroos corner, and Vinícius Júnior once again scoring in a UCL final. Real Madrid won their 15th Champions League without losing a single match during the campaign. Following the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, Real Madrid announced that striker Kylian Mbappé would be joining the club on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2024, concluding one of the most highly anticipated transfer sagas in modern history.[182] On 18 December 2024, Real Madrid clinched their second trophy of the season, uplifting the inaugural 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup by beating Pachuca 3-0.[183] The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[184] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[185] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[184] With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[49] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[186][57] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[184] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[184] Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[44] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 3] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[57] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[187] Real's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[188][189] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[190][191] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[192] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[193][194] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year.[195] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[196] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[197] Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[46] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[203] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[48] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[57][204] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[58] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[57] The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[205] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[205] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[206][207][208][209] The Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[210] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[211] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[212] On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground.[213] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.[214][165] The latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to nearly 85,000.[215][216] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[217][218] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[219][220] Raúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741 appearances from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times.[221] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176. Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[222][223] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[224] Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 129,690, which was for a European Cup match in 1956 against Milan. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 80,000.[225] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (36 as of 2023–24) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[226] The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fifteen times[227] and for the most semi-finals appearances (33). As of June 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[228] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game, before Bayern Munich breaks the record in 2021.[229] In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million).[230][231] The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million.[111] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[232] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million.[233] The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.[234] During most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[235] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[236][237] Real Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[238][239] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[240][241] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[242] Questioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\".[243] Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[244] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[245] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 105 victories for Madrid, 101 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws as at December 2024.[246] As early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[248][249] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[250] There is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[251] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[252][186] The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millonarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[253] Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[254] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[255] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[256] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[257] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[258] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[258][259] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.[258] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[258] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[258] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.[260] The club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.[48] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"[186] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were \"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\" – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).[261][262] The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[263] In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites).[264] By then, Real Madrid did not want to sign non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, \"Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote\" (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\").[265] Atlético's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the 2016–17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city.[266][267] In fact, the Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region). Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times has been favourable.[268] A high point came in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4–1 comeback victory in extra time.[269] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss.[270] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.[271] A further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico (the old classic),[272] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903.[273][274] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by El Clásico.[275] Athletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players,[276] have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the Lions won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005–06 to 2016–17.[272][277][278] However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.[279][262][280] Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times.[281][282] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws),[283] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings.[284][285][286] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\"). During the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium by the same method), then at the same stage in the 2013–14 edition with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate,[287] and again in 2017–18 with the Spanish club progressing 4–3;[288] both times they went on to win the competition. Another match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).[289][290][291] Their first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961–62 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in Paris.[290] At the quarter-final stage in 1995–96, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy.[290] In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1–0.[290][292] They met again in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate.[290] By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the Bianconeri in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.[293] The teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player Álvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid.[290] They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.[290][294][295] The latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017–18 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline.[296][297] Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick,[298] and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time,[299] he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.[300] It was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[301] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[79] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[302] The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[303] Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[82] By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion),[304] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million).[305] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[306] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.[307] A study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\"[308] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[309][310] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.[311] Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money,[312] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership.[313] The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[314] As of 2010, the club had 60,000 socios.[315] At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.[316][317] During the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football.[316] Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million.[316] For the 2010–11 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona;[318] furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, Forbes listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion.[319] Real Madrid was valued at €3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016–17 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million.[320] In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was £8.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona.[321][322] In 2022, Forbes listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.[323] Real Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the Goal! football movie trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream... (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.[324] Real, The Movie is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on galácticos such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase. The book White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled Legends, and a remix of the club's anthem, \"Himno del Real Madrid,\" was released as the first single from the album.[325] Real Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre. Hala Madrid is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the Madridistas Fan Club card holders.[326] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans).[6] The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches.[326] Real Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA, EA Sports FC, and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times. In 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play's liquidation in September 2009) would end up being Real Madrid: The Game, which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play's publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay. Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.

Real Madrid was officially founded in 1902, though its history can be traced back to 1897. It joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid has won 15 European Cup/Champions League titles, far more than any other team. Real Madrid has won the Copa del Rey, Spain’s main football cup competition, 20 times. Real Madrid played at several venues until club president Santiago Bernabéu spearheaded the construction of the stadium that today bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators. Real Madrid's biggest rivalry is with FC Barcelona. Matches between Barcelona and Real Madrid are known as El Clásico (“The Classic”). Real Madrid, Spanish professional football (soccer) club based in Madrid. Known for their all-white uniforms, which led to its nickname “Los Blancos,” Real Madrid is one of the world’s best-known teams. Real Madrid grew out of Football Club Sky, a team formed in Madrid in 1897. The club was officially founded in 1902 and joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid played at a variety of venues until ambitious club president Santiago Bernabéu spearheaded the construction of the stadium that bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators and was the venue for the 1982 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup final. The European Cup was first held during the 1955–56 season, with a prestigious field consisting of clubs that had won their own country’s league championship. Real Madrid was the tournament’s first winner, defeating French club Stade de Reims in the final. It continued on a run of European dominance that no team has matched since. Gifted players such as Ferenc Puskás, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Paco Gento, Hector Rial, and Miguel Muñoz helped the club win the first five European Cups in a row. The club’s play in the 1960 European Cup final against the West German team Eintracht Frankfurt—a 7–3 Real victory—is widely considered one of the finest club performances of all time. Real has won a total of 15 European Cup/Champions League titles, far more than any other team. 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2022, 2024 Real Madrid has won more Spanish top-division (La Liga) championships (36) than any other Spanish side. The club has also won the Copa del Rey, the main Spanish cup competition, 20 times and the Supercopa de España (Spanish Super Cup) 13 times. It won UEFA Cup twice, in 1985 and 1986. Real’s local competition is Atlético Madrid, but the club’s biggest rivalry is with FC Barcelona. The tension between the football clubs from Spain’s two biggest cities was amplified by a struggle between the teams in the 1950s to sign Di Stéfano, who reneged on a proposed deal with Barcelona to sign with Madrid, helping Real become a football power in the 1950s and ’60s. Matches between Barcelona and Real Madrid are known as El Clásico (“The Classic”) and are watched throughout Spain, in large part because the two sides symbolize for many the ongoing political and cultural difficulties between Castilian (Real) and Catalonian (Barcelona) Spain. From the late 1990s Real Madrid spent enormous sums on luring some of the world’s most famous foreign players to the club, where they are known as galácticos (“superstars”). Those players were often the most expensive (by transfer fee) footballers in the world and included such stars as David Beckham, Luis Figo, Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, Kaká, Cristiano Ronaldo, and James Rodriguez. Sergio Ramos and Iker Casillas are other notable players of this era. Following his departure from Paris Saint-Germain after the 2023–24 season, Kylian Mbappé joined Real Madrid.",

Once the regular-season dust settles, 14 teams will be left standing to battle it out for the Lombardi Trophy. The path to the Super Bowl will be thrilling in and of itself, as the best teams in the NFC and AFC collide. In the NFC, the Detroit Lions and Philadelphia Eagles have looked like real contenders, but the Minnesota Vikings lead a postseason pack looking to spring a surprise. Over in the AFC, the Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens — who both have MVP candidates in quarterbacks Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson — are among the favorites. However, the path to the Super Bowl goes through the Kansas City Chiefs, who could make history by being the first team in the Super Bowl era to win three straight titles. Here is everything you need to know about the 2025 Super Bowl, including the date, kickoff time, and stadium. Super Bowl:After deadly New Year's attack, NFL says Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans will be safe NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. The 2025 Super Bowl is set to be played on Sunday, Feb. 9. The 2025 Super Bowl will be played at New Orleans' Caesars Superdome. No venue has hosted more Super Bowls, with this being the eighth time the 50-year-old stadium has served as the site for the NFL's championship game. The last Super Bowl to take place at the home of the New Orleans Saints didn't exactly go off without a hitch. The lights went out on the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens early in the second half at Super Bowl 47, a problem that hopefully will not repeat this time around. The 2025 Super Bowl is scheduled to kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET. Super Bowl 59 will be broadcast by Fox. Fans looking for streaming options can check out Fubo, which is offering a free trial for new subscribers, and the Fox Sports app. Super Bowl 59 will be broadcast nationwide on Fox, live from the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. Fans can stream the game on Fubo, or via the Fox Sports app. The 2025 Super Bowl halftime show will center around Kendrick Lamar, who has been on the stage at the NFL's biggest occasion once before. The Los Angeles-based rapper joined Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and a long list of West Coast hip-hop stars on stage at SoFi Stadium at halftime in 2022. Lamar may be the one announced superstar for Super Bowl 59, but he's unlikely to do a solo set. Several recent Super Bowl halftime shows have featured a long roster of music's biggest names, and Lamar has made headlines with star-studded live shows over the past few years as part of his more traditional shows. It wouldn't be a shock if the \"Not Like Us\" rapper has several surprises in store ... just don't expect Drake to join him on stage. We occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

                "content": "Super Bowl LIX is the upcoming American football championship game of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2024 season. The game is scheduled to be played on February 9, 2025, at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.[2] The two teams playing have not been decided pending completion of the regular football season and playoff games. It will be the eighth Super Bowl played in the Superdome, and the 11th in the city of New Orleans, the most recent being Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, held in the same venue (then called Mercedes-Benz Superdome).[3] The game will be televised nationally by Fox.[4] On May 23, 2018, the league originally selected New Orleans as the site for Super Bowl LVIII, then tentatively scheduled for February 4, 2024.[3] In March 2020, the league and the NFLPA agreed to expand the regular season from 16 to 17 games starting in 2021, pushing Super Bowl LVIII to February 11, 2024, and causing a conflict with New Orleans's Mardi Gras celebrations.[5] On October 14, 2020, the league decided to move Super Bowl LVIII to another city (Las Vegas was later chosen) and awarded Super Bowl LIX to New Orleans instead, as Mardi Gras in 2025 is not until March 4, thus avoiding any conflicts.[2] The official logo was unveiled on February 12, 2024, and follows the logo template established since Super Bowl LVI, with the Roman numerals featuring imagery representing the host city/region. For this event, the Roman numerals contain artwork by local artist \"Queen\" Tahj Williams[6]—a figure in the community of Mardi Gras Indians.[7] It marks the first time the NFL collaborated with a local artist on the design of a Super Bowl emblem.[6] The design—created with beads—features Mardi Gras inspired red, green, and gold-colored fleur-de-lis patterns (a symbol long connected with New Orleans and used as the logo for the New Orleans Saints), evoking the designs of ironwork balconies common in the city's architecture (particularly in the French Quarter).[8] Super Bowl organizers said they would review security procedures in the wake of the truck attack incident on Bourbon Street January 1, 2025, that saw 15 killed and dozens injured, which forced the delay of the 2025 Sugar Bowl at the Superdome to the following day. Tourism official Walt Leger III said on New Year's Day that the priority would be on the immediate response to the attack but \"(t)here will be more deep conversations in the coming days and weeks to discuss possible enhancements for the Super Bowl.\"[9] Meanwhile, the NFL released a statement assuring that the game would be a \"safe and enjoyable\" experience.[10] On November 28, 2024, the NFL announced that Jon Batiste would perform the U.S. national anthem, Trombone Shorty and Lauren Daigle would perform \"America the Beautiful\", and Ledisi would perform \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\". Stephanie Nogueras would provide sign language for the national anthem and \"America the Beautiful\", while Otis Jones IV would sign for \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\".[11] On September 8, 2024, it was announced that rapper Kendrick Lamar will headline the halftime show.[12] Lamar previously performed at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show in 2022.[13] Super Bowl LIX is scheduled to be televised in English by Fox. It will be the second Super Bowl to be broadcast under the 11-year NFL television contract as part of the four-year rotation between CBS, Fox, NBC, and ABC/ESPN.[4][14] On October 14, 2024, it was announced that both Fox Deportes and Telemundo would air separate Spanish-language feeds of the game for the first time.[15] Fox has reported strong demand for advertising spots. The company announced it has sold all available commercial slots as of November 5, 2024. 30-second ad spots have reportedly sold for over $7 million, significantly higher than the $6.5 million average price for Super Bowl LVI. In 2022, the final ad slot was not sold until the Monday before the game, indicating a notable increase in demand for this year's event.[16] The season 3 premiere of Fox's game show The Floor will air following the game.[17] As a cross-promotion for the game, Fox series Kitchen Nightmares would begin airing special Road to Super Bowl LIX episodes in January 2025 as the first half of its ninth season, which focus on restaurants in New Orleans and feature guest appearances by NFL players and personalities.[18] Westwood One holds the national radio rights to the game.[19]",

Super Bowl LIX returns to the city located in the state of Louisiana, to host the champions of the AFC and NFC, for a game that year after year is awaited by millions of fans inside and outside the United States. The race to fight for the Vince Lombardi Trophy is still very close, as in the AFC the Buffalo Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens are tough contenders, not to mention the return of the current two-time champions, the Kansas City Chiefs. Related: The team led by Patrick Mahomes is looking for something that no other team has achieved in history, which is to win the championship for the third consecutive year. While in the NFC, the Detroit Lions are heavy favorites and are looking to appear for the first time in their history in a Super Bowl, and reduce the blacklist of teams that have never played in such a game. The game is scheduled to be played on February 9, the second Sunday of the month, as it has been for the past three seasons, and the game is scheduled to kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET (3:30 p.m. PT). The Caesars Superdome, home of the New Orleans Saints, will host the game for the eighth time, as the first three Super Bowls played in New Orleans were held at Tulane Stadium. The Superdome will be remembered as \"the blackout Super Bowl\", as in edition 47 (2013), at the beginning of the second half of the game between the Ravens and 49ers, the game had to be suspended for around 20 minutes due to an electrical failure that left half of the stadium without light. The game will be broadcast, as in recent years, on FOX, and streaming will be available on Fubo and the NFL+ app. The length of the Super Bowl is the same as all other NFL games: four 15-minute timed quarters, but it is the context of the game that makes the whole process longer, stretching up to four hours at most. AFC: Kansas City Chiefs, Buffalo Bills, Baltimore Ravens, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Chargers, Pittsburgh Steelers and Denver Broncos. NFC: Detroit Lions, Philadelphia Eagles, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Los Angeles Rams, Minnesota Vikings, Washington Commanders and Green Bay Packers. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

Dani and I decorate the Rosca de Reyes while my Tía Laura smiles.Photo by Tomí García Téllez Celebrations, Foodways Jump to the recipe Growing up in a Mexican American family, my fondest childhood memories always involve the Christmas season. During this time of year, my family and I travel to Mexico City to visit loved ones. When we are reunited, I not only feel a renewed connection but a replenishing of our culture. Throughout the years, our family matriarchs have passed down traditions and taught us, the new generations, the importance behind our Mexican customs. One holiday baking tradition we cherish is the Rosca de Reyes or “Wreath of the Kings,” a traditional sweet bread eaten every January 6 for Día de Los Reyes, Three Kings Day. Also known as Epiphany, the holiday is celebrated throughout the Christian world. According to the Bible, Three Wise Men travel from the East to Jerusalem in search of the newborn king. They meet with King Herod who instructs the Magi that once the baby is found, they should return to tell him so that he can worship him as well. But he plans to kill the baby, fearing the emergence of a new ruler. Following a star, the Wise Men travel to Bethlehem and find the baby Jesus with his mother Mary. They present Jesus with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. When I was a child, my cousins and I wrote letters to the Magi in hopes of receiving gifts too. On January 5, each of us tucked a letter in a shoe and placed them under the Christmas tree. The next morning, we rushed downstairs and were amazed to find presents near the shoes. The Three Wise Men are very important to Christians in Mexico and to the lore surrounding the rosca. In the United States, children typically wait to take pictures with Santa Claus, but my cousins lined up to take photos with the Magi. My family in Mexico would typically purchase roscas at their local bakeries, where their fresh aroma filled the street. But for the last four winters, I was stuck in Arizona, unable to visit my family in Mexico. I didn’t feel the same sentiments for the roscas in my hometown, not when the other half of my heart was so far away. Thankfully, my family and I were able to visit this year, and what a joyous reunion it was. I was feeling nostalgic for the sweet taste of the rosca and wanted to savor every moment with my family. I decided this year was going to be different: I asked my aunt, Tía Laura, if we could make a rosca together. A gentle smile crossed her face and she began laying out the ingredients, explaining the process as she went along. My niece Dani joined us. Although she is eight years old, she might have more baking experience than I do. As someone who had only baked with premade cookie dough and even failed at that, I wondered what I set myself up for. Tía Laura said we must begin by making the basa madre, or “base mother.” I’m sure a puzzled look crossed my face. She told me that the union of several ingredients brings the rising dough to double its size and that the mix is called the base mother because it’s similar to how a mother gives birth to a child. From this dough will be the birth of the rosca. Tía Laura told Dani and me to knead the dough until smooth. Masterfully, my aunt kneaded a perfect ball. My eyes followed every movement of her hands, yet my portion devolved into a sticky mess. I glanced at Dani. Her dough was looking more and more like my aunt’s. A frustrated chuckle escaped my lips as my dough broke into crumbs. “Knead the dough like how you would wash clothes by hand,” my aunt said, before realizing the generational difference between us. I had never washed clothes in that way. We stopped to laugh. My aunt took what was left of my dough and, like magic, turned it into a smooth ball. I am amazed at how effortlessly she went about the recipe and how she instructed us, her students, with such patience. After the dough had risen, we formed the rosca into an oval shape to symbolize a crown and the infinite and eternal love God has for us. We then adorned the dough with toppings. Tía Laura assured us that although candied fruits were traditional—representing the jewels of the Magis’ crowns—we could decorate the rosca with whatever we liked. The most symbolic and important step is to place tiny baby Jesus figures within the dough. In the biblical story, the Magi are warned in a dream not to return to King Herod, so they take secret routes back to their own countries. Outraged at the deception, Herod orders his men to kill all boys two years old and younger living in and near Bethlehem. Unbeknownst to Herod, the Holy Family had already fled to Egypt. The baby Jesus dolls must be discreetly concealed within the dough to represent the time Jesus hid from Herod’s persecution. Tía Laura handed us the plastic figurines. Dani’s expression lit up as she placed the dolls throughout the rosca. I reveled in the fact that I now knew where the dolls were hidden—until Dani and I lost track of how many we pushed in. Just as it should be, neither of us knew where the dolls were truly hidden. My aunt made the sign of the cross over the rosca and placed it in the oven just as our family began to enter the house. Grandmothers, uncles, cousins, and everyone in between wove around the living room to welcome each other. I stumbled my way back to the kitchen through a sea of aunts and peered into the oven at my first handmade Rosca de Reyes. It was done. Tía Laura carried it into the living room. The chaos of so many families packed into a small space evaporated at the sight of the sweet bread. As they gawked over our cake, I must admit I felt a bit proud. The traditions surrounding the cutting of the cake are the most entertaining. If you find the baby Jesus in a slice you cut, you are responsible for making tamales and hosting a party on Día de la Candelaria, also known as the Presentation of Jesus Christ, a religious holiday held every February 2, based on the biblical story of Jesus being brought to the Temple for the first time. Many consider receiving the baby Jesus figurine bad luck since they must assume hosting and cooking duties, but it is also considered good luck. I still hoped that I did not receive the responsibility of hosting a party for my large family. A family that numbers more than fifty people calls for strategic slicing. Everyone chanted my name, encouraging me to take the first slice. I hesitantly cut a small slice while my little sister called me a coward. My fingers ran through the middle of the slice as everyone watched fervently. To my relief, there was no doll, and everyone cheered. Then my cousin Tomí and Tía Vero pointed out the little white feet peeking from the edge of the rosca where I had taken a slice. The room stood divided as to whether such a thing counted or not. Hoping to distract them, I handed the slicer to the next person. Through each turn, everyone took a different approach to cutting the rosca. The most daring among us flauntingly cut large slices to miraculously receive no figurine. Others like myself cowered behind our small slices to the playful taunts of the family. My cousin Tomí begrudgingly took a slice and to his dismay found the doll. His face scrunched up as the room burst out with laughter. Tía Vero then took a slice to find not one but two baby Jesus dolls. “I’ve got twins?” she exclaimed, momentarily confused. We couldn’t contain our laughter. Toward the end of the night, my mother asked who all found the dolls. Tía Vero brought out her two and Tomí reluctantly another. Three other family members, including Dani, held up their dolls. I begrudgingly accepted defeat, removing the figurine from the edge of the rosca. Seven members now share the responsibility of making tamales and hosting the Candelaria party next month. No matter how you strategize your slice, luck finds you in the form of a white plastic doll. Whether it is bad or good luck is determined by how you accept it. My family and I love to tease each other over the technicalities of the rosca. However, no matter who finds the figurine, we all look forward to any opportunity to be together again. This is what I find most endearing about this holiday and tradition. After the Christmas season has supposedly come to a close, Latinos find more reasons to celebrate. This Día de Los Reyes is one I will treasure forever because of the new memories I made while making the rosca. Thanks to my aunt’s guidance, three generations embarked on this tradition and left with wisdom they will pass down to the next. Tía Laura encouraged us to create our own future roscas with toppings and ingredients we prefer. Aunt Cecelia once hid gummy bears since she didn’t have the plastic dolls. Her reasoning was that bears are one of God’s creatures and there was no worry in case anyone swallowed them. I also found it fitting that the colors of the gummy bears added to the symbolic nature of the Wise Men’s jewels. I can’t wait for next year to see what new twists we come up with. I am sure cooking disasters await, but I’m eager to create a rosca for every Día de Los Reyes. My aunt reiterates—whether you are making the rosca or serving yourself a slice—what is important is being with family. If you decide to partake in this tradition, will you dare to cut a large slice or will you seek the safety of a small slice? Whatever your decision is, be ready to face the jest and cheers of your family. Also remember to leave a shoe out the night before January 6 and the Three Wise Men might just leave a gift or three… ¡Feliz Día de los Reyes Magos! Ingredients For the base madre (base mother): ½ cup warm milk (microwave for 40 seconds) ¾ cup + 1 spoonful sugar ½ kilo (4 cups) + 1 spoonful flour 11 grams (2 ½ teaspoons) instant yeast 3 eggs 1 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons vanilla 1 teaspoon butter orange food flavoring 1 ½ sticks butter 1 teaspoon canola oil Plastic wrap For maiza blanca (white dough): 50 grams (½ cup) powdered sugar 50 grams (½ cup) flour 50 grams (¼ cup) vegetable shortening 1 egg yolk For assembly: Vegetable shortening Jesus figurines Toppings: 1 egg La Flor de Morelia Ate Combinado Candied Fruits 6 maraschino cherries 6 pecans Sugar Preparation Make the base mother: in a bowl, whisk together the warm milk, a spoonful of sugar, and a spoonful of flour, and the yeast until completely smooth, with no bubbles. Sit aside to rest for around 30 minutes. In the meantime, form ½ kilo (4 cups) of flour into a shape of a volcano, leaving the center empty. Beat 3 eggs in a separate bowl with a fork and then pour into the center of the flour volcano. Next, pour ¾ of a cup of sugar, salt, vanilla, and butter orange flavoring into the center. Once the bowl with yeast has risen, pour it into the center of the flour volcano as well. Using clean hands, fold over the outskirts of the flour into the center of the mixture. Begin kneading the dough into a ball shape until everything is combined. To help grasp the dough, add pinches of flour to your hands and work surface. The dough should be soft but not sticky. Add butter into the center of the dough ball and knead together. Flour your hands and surface as necessary. Lightly coat a separate bowl with canola oil. This will help prevent the dough from sticking. Place the ball of dough into the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to let the dough double in size, around 2 hours. Make the white dough: Mix powdered sugar, flour, vegetable shortening, and yolk in a bowl. Knead together into a ball and then cut the dough into 6 equal pieces. Knead each piece into a ball. Pat the dough side to side with your palms to flatten. Shape each piece into a rectangle and set aside. Prep the toppings: cut each of the candied fruits into 6 long and skinny slices. Now to assemble the cake: coat a 9-by-13” baking tray at least 1” deep with vegetable shortening. Once the base mother dough has doubled in size, remove the plastic wrap and place the dough onto your work surface. Roll the dough with your hands back and forth to form a log. Once the dough is at desired length, place it on the baking tray in the shape of an oval. Make a small hole in the center of one end of the dough with your thumb. Connect the other end by placing it inside the hole. Randomly submerge the baby Jesus dolls within the dough. Make sure they are hidden. Place the 6 white dough rectangles on top of the oval dough. Beat 1 egg and brush it on top of the rosca. Decorate with sliced fruits, cherries, and pecans on top. Sprinkle pinches of sugar. Set the tray aside to let it rest and heat the oven to 170° C (340° F). Once the dough has risen slightly, place the tray into the oven for 30 minutes. When it’s ready, a toothpick inserted in the cake should come out clean. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for around 10 minutes. Serve warm and enjoy!

It's almost January 6th, and in Mexico, that means that everyone is going crazy to celebrate the last Christmas celebration buying or preparing a Roscas de Reyes. The Christian holiday of Epiphany marks the day when the three wise men arrived in Bethlehem to meet the baby Jesus. In Mexico (and other parts of Latin America), the holiday is celebrated nationwide – regardless of religion – with Rosca de Reyes. On previous occasions we have told you about the importance of Día de Los Reyes Magos, Three Kings Day, in Mexico (read our previous blogs about this celebration here and here), a day on which Christmas traditions continue to be celebrated surrounded by our loved ones. The celebration of Día de Reyes (short for Día de Los Reyes Magos) on January 6th dates back to Catholicism in Spain, reaching Latin America in the early years of evangelization in the New World. The custom is that children write a letter to ask the Three Wise Men, Melchor, Gaspar, and Baltazar, for the toys they would like (similar to Santa Claus). On the eve of the celebration (January 5th at night), the little ones leave a shoe with a bit of grass and twigs next to the window or under the Christmas tree to feed the animals that would bring the Santos Reyes (another name for the Three Wise Men). Full of curiosity, the following day, the children get up early to find that the food has disappeared, and the shoes are now filled with toys or sweets. Another Three Kings Day custom is to gather to cut the rosca. Friends and/or family are usually invited, and each must take a turn to slice their portion of this sweet bread. Inside the bread, there are one or several small figurines (plastic representations of the Child Jesus). The person who finds it has to offer a party with tamales and atole, on February 2nd, Día de la Candelaria (Candlemas Day). Okay, yes, we know we have told you about this celebration before but, do you know the symbolism behind the Rosca de Reyes? From its shape to the knife used to slice the Rosca de Reyes, all elements have meanings that might surprise you, so delve into the meaning of the Rosca de Reyes so that you know everything about the rosca once you gather to have a piece! Origin of the Rosca de Reyes In the 17th century, the galette des rois (King's Cake) originated in France, which is the closest thing to the Rosca de Reyes that we savor today. In France, a large cake was cooked with a bean hidden in it, and whoever found it was made king or queen for the day. Some time later, this tradition arrived to Spain where it was modified, and from Spain it passed to Mexico (and Latin America) in times of the Viceroyalty. The Shape Regarding the shape of the rosca, there are different versions. On the one hand, it is said that the shape at the beginning was circular; on the other it is said that it was oval. However, it is agreed that it has a rounded shape to symbolize the love for God with no beginning or end. Also, the shape of the rosca clearly alludes to the Magi's crown, as we will see with its decorations. The Hidden Baby Jesus The plastic figurine hidden in the rosca represents Baby Jesus. It is hidden in the Rosca de Reyes because it alludes to the biblical persecution suffered by the child along with his parents by King Herod. The Knife It would seem evident that you need a knife to cut a piece of cake. However, in the case of Rosca de Reyes, the knife has a special meaning because it alludes to the danger that Baby Jesus was faced in his persecution. The Sweet Decoration One thing that makes the rosca taste so delicious is that it is decorated with dried fruits such as figs, candied fruits, cherries, and a quince paste known in Mexico as ate. In essence, the sweets that decorate the rosca have three meanings: the first is the representation of the crown jewels of the Three Wise Men; the second is that the sweets are the superficial and material elements to go through to find God; and the third is that the sweets must be of desert origin because they symbolize the passage of Joseph and Mary through the desert to keep baby Jesus safe. In addition, the rosca usually has 4 sugar crusts (which are the favorites of many!), and these represent the four cardinal points. Although filled with religious symbolism, the tradition of the Rosca de Reyes for most Mexicans consists of another gathering of family or friends where the sole purpose is to enjoy of the time spent together. Filled with lots of laughter, coffee, hot chocolate or atole, the rosca is an event that concludes (not counting February 2nd, Candlemas Day) the Christmas season with a joyful spirit. As Mexicans who grew up with this tradition, we cannot help but hope that this tradition lasts forever! 6 comments jamal this is sigma stewart Does anyone know when the bean was replaced by a baby in Mexico or who introduced the idea? joseph i also got an A+ thanks jacob thanks you got me an A+ Joyce Thomas I am so happy to learn of another Mexican custom!

                "title": "Rosca de Reyes: Mexican King's Day Bread",
                "content": "Paty aranda/Getty Images Rosca de Reyes is a sweet bread, which is a special food for Three King's Day, known as \"Día de Reyes\" in Spanish, and celebrated on January 6 in Mexico. The holiday is sometimes referred to as the Twelfth Night because it falls twelve days after Christmas, but is also known as Epiphany, and marks the day the Wise Men or Magi, Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar, are believed to have visited the Christ Child. On this day, Mexican children receive gifts from the three kings, sometimes placed in shoes that the children have left out overnight and placed hay in as a gift of food for the kings' animals. \"Rosca\" means wreath and \"Reyes\" means kings, so a direct translation of Rosca de Reyes would be \"Kings' Wreath\". The sweet bread is shaped in the form of a wreath and usually has candied fruit on top, and a figurine of a baby baked inside (now made of plastic but previously they were porcelain or tin). This special treat is often simply called \"Rosca.\" The traditions surrounding this sweet bread is similar to the custom of eating King Cake in New Orleans during Carnival season. In Mexico, it is customary for friends and family to get together on January 6 to eat Rosca, usually accompanied by hot chocolate or another warm drink such as coffee or atole. Usually, each person cuts their own slice and the one who gets a piece of Rosca with the baby figurine is expected to host a party on Día de la Candelaria (Candlemas), which is celebrated on February 2nd. On that day, the traditional food is tamales. Nowadays bakers tend to put several baby figurines in the Rosca, so the responsibility for making (or buying) the tamales can be shared among several people. The symbolism of the Rosca de Reyes speaks of the Biblical story of Mary and Joseph's flight to Egypt to protect the infant Jesus from the slaughter of the innocents. The shape of the Rosca symbolizes a crown, in this case, the crown of King Herod from whom they were trying to hide the infant Jesus. The dried fruit placed on top are jewels on the crown. The figurine in the Rosca represents baby Jesus in hiding. The person who finds the baby Jesus is symbolically his godparent and must sponsor the party when he is taken to the temple to be blessed, celebrated as Día de la Candelaria, or Candlemas, on February 2nd. If you travel to Mexico during the period after Christmas and up to around the second week of January, you will find Roscas for sale in bakeries throughout the country. There are a number of variations, but the classic Rosca is made with butter and has some orange zest in it to give it just a slight citrus flavor. The top is usually decorated with candied citrus fruit and cherries and a quince paste known in Mexico as ate (pronounced “ah-teh”). Rosca is spongy inside and just a bit sweet. The candied fruit and sweets on top give it more sweetness. Some bakeries make special versions with different types of fillings such as custard, cream, or jam, and different toppings, and you can even find some that are chocolate flavored. There are several bakeries In Mexico City that are known for producing particularly tasty Roscas. One of the most popular bakeries is El Globo, which has several locations throughout the city. For an authentic and impressive experience, head to the Centro Historico location of Pasteleria Ideal, which is a large bakery and cake shop, and before purchasing your Rosca, make a visit to the second floor where you can see a huge exhibit of display cakes which serve as a catalog for people ordering cakes for large parties and events. Another bakery with a long tradition of making Rosca is La Vasconia, which also has a restaurant section, in case you would like to sit down and have your Rosca there. If you won't be traveling in Mexico during this season, you can get your own Rosca delivered to your home by ordering online from MexGrocer, or if you're feeling ambitious, you can make your own. Remember if you host a get together for Día de Reyes, you should let each guest cut their own slice of Rosca, so whoever gets the baby figurine will have no one to blame but themselves, and you can expect a feast in February. Rosca de Reyes is very similar to what is known in the Southern United States as King Cake, and the provenance of the custom is the same, with origins in Spain, but King Cake is eaten during the Mardi Gras celebrations prior to Lent instead of during the Christmas season.

                "content": "The Seattle Seahawks are a professional American football team based in Seattle. The Seahawks compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The club entered the NFL as an expansion team in 1976 in the NFC. From 1977 to 2001, Seattle was assigned to the American Football Conference (AFC) West; the team rejoined the NFC in 2002. They have played their home games at Lumen Field in Seattle's SoDo neighborhood since 2002, having previously played home games in the Kingdome (1976–1999) and Husky Stadium (1994 and 2000–2001).[a] Seahawks fans have been referred to collectively as the \"12s\" (formerly the \"12th Man\"),[11][12][13] or the \"12th Fan\".[14][15][16][17][18] The team's fans twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event within the span of a few months, first registering 136.6 decibels during a game against the San Francisco 49ers in September 2013,[19] and later registering 137.6 dB during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints that December.[20][21] As the only NFL team based in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, the Seahawks attract support from a wide geographical area that includes parts of the U.S. states of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Utah, as well as the Canadian province of British Columbia.[22] The Seahawks have won 11 division titles and three conference championships, and are the only team to have played in both the AFC and NFC Championship Games. They have reached three Super Bowls, losing 21–10 to the Pittsburgh Steelers at Super Bowl XL, defeating the Denver Broncos 43–8 for their first championship at Super Bowl XLVIII, and losing 28–24 to the New England Patriots at Super Bowl XLIX. Players Kenny Easley, Walter Jones, Steve Hutchinson, Cortez Kennedy, and Steve Largent have been voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame primarily or wholly for their accomplishments as Seahawks. In addition, players Dave Brown, Jacob Green, Dave Krieg, Curt Warner, Jim Zorn, Matt Hasselbeck and Shaun Alexander have been inducted into the Seahawks Ring of Honor, along with head coaches Chuck Knox, and Mike Holmgren, radio announcer Pete Gross, and franchise owner Paul Allen. As per one of the agreed parts of the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, the NFL began planning to expand from 26 to 28 teams.[23] In June 1972, Seattle Professional Football Inc., a group of Seattle business and community leaders, announced their intention to acquire an NFL franchise for the city of Seattle.[24] In June 1974, the NFL gave the city an expansion franchise.[25] That December, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle announced the official signing of the franchise agreement by Lloyd W. Nordstrom, representing the Nordstrom family as majority partners for the consortium.[26] In March 1975, John Thompson, former executive director of the NFL Management Council and a former Washington Huskies executive, was hired as the general manager of the new team. The name Seattle Seahawks (\"seahawk\" is another name for osprey) was selected on June 17, 1975, after a public naming contest which drew more than 20,000 entries and over 1,700 names.[27] These include skippers, pioneers, and lumberjacks.[28] Thompson recruited and hired Jack Patera, a Minnesota Vikings assistant coach, to be the first head coach of the Seahawks; the hiring was announced on January 3, 1976. The expansion draft was held March 30–31, 1976, with Seattle and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers alternating picks for rounds selecting unprotected players from the other 26 teams in the league.[29] The Seahawks were awarded the 2nd overall pick in the 1976 draft, a pick they used on defensive tackle Steve Niehaus. The team took the field for the first time on August 1, 1976, in a pre-season game against the San Francisco 49ers in the then newly opened Kingdome. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to switch conferences twice in the post-merger era.[33] The franchise began play in 1976 in the aforementioned NFC West but switched conferences with the Buccaneers after one season and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both expansion teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once (the ones in their conference at the time) during their first two seasons. The Seahawks won both matchups against the Buccaneers in their first two seasons, the former of which was the Seahawks' first regular season victory.[34][35] In 1983, the Seahawks hired Chuck Knox as head coach. Finishing with a 9–7 record, the Seahawks made their first post-season appearance, defeating the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round, and then the Miami Dolphins, before losing in the AFC Championship to the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Raiders. The following season, the Seahawks had their best season to that point, finishing 12–4; it would remain the best win–loss record in franchise history until their 2005 season.[36] Knox won the NFL Coach of the Year Award.[37] In 1988, Ken Behring and partner Ken Hofmann purchased the team for a reported $80 million.[38][39][40] The Seahawks won their first division title in 1988, but would miss the playoffs for the following three seasons, after which Knox left the team.[41] For most of the 1990s, the Seahawks continued to struggle. They saw three consecutive losing seasons (1992–1994) under head coach Tom Flores, including a franchise worst 2–14 season in 1992. Following the 1994 season, Flores was fired from the team and Dennis Erickson was brought in as head coach.[42][43][44][45][46] In 1996, Behring and Hoffman transferred the team's operations to Anaheim, California–a widely criticized move, although the team continued to play in Seattle. The team almost relocated, and was in bankruptcy for a short period. The NFL threatened Behring with fining him $500,000 a day if he did not move the team's operations back to Seattle;[47] with this, Behring and Hoffman sold the team to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 1997 for $200 million.[48] Erickson's tenure as head coach ended after the 1998 season; the Seahawks missed the playoffs for all four of his seasons with the team, extending their \"playoff drought\" to ten consecutive seasons.[49] In 1999, Mike Holmgren was hired as head coach.[50] He would coach for 10 seasons.[51] The Seahawks won their second division title, as well as a wild card berth in the playoffs, losing to the Miami Dolphins 20–17. In 2002, the Seahawks returned to the NFC West as part of an NFL realignment plan that gave each conference four balanced divisions of four teams each. This realignment restored the AFC West to its initial post-merger roster of original AFL teams Denver, San Diego, Kansas City, and Oakland.[52] That same year, the team opened its new home stadium, Seahawks Stadium, after spending the last two seasons at Husky Stadium after the Kingdome's implosion in 2000.[53] In the 2005 season, the Seahawks had their best season in franchise history (a feat that would later be matched in 2013) with a record of 13–3,[54] which included a 42–0 rout of the Philadelphia Eagles in a Monday Night Football game.[55] The 13–3 record earned them the number one seed in the NFC.[54] They defeated the Washington Redskins in the Divisional Round and won the NFC Championship Game against the Carolina Panthers, but lost in Super Bowl XL against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The loss was controversial; NFL Films has Super Bowl XL at number 8 on its top ten list of games with controversial referee calls.[56] Referee Bill Leavy later admitted that he missed calls that altered the game.[57] Before 2005, the Seahawks had not won a playoff game since the 1984 season, a streak of 21 years (five teams had ever had a drought of twenty years at the time, with their six straight losses being tied for third-most in history). That drought was ended with a 20–10 win over the Washington Redskins in the 2005 playoffs.[58] In the 2006 season, the Seahawks finished 9–7 and won the NFC West.[59] The defeated the Dallas Cowboys 21–20 in the Wild Card Round before losing to the Chicago Bears 27–24 in the Divisional Round.[60][61] In the 2007 season, the Seahawks finished 10–6 and won the NFC West.[62] The team defeated Washington in the Wild Card Round 35–14 before losing to the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Round 42–20.[63][64] The 2008 season saw the team go 4–12 and finish third in the NFC West.[65] Holmgren departed from the team after the 2008 season, following the end of his contract.[66] Defensive backs coach Jim L. Mora was named as Holmgren's successor.[67] In 2009, the Seahawks finished 3rd in the NFC West with a 5–11 record.[68] Shortly after, Mora was fired on January 8, 2010 [69] and Pete Carroll was hired. In the 2010 NFL season, the Seahawks made history by making it into the playoffs despite having a 7–9 record.[70] They had the best record in a division full of teams with losing seasons (Seahawks 7–9, Rams 7–9, 49ers 6–10, Cardinals 5–11) and won the decisive season finale against the Rams (not only by overall record, but by division record, as both teams coming into the game had a 3–2 division record).[71] In the playoffs, the Seahawks beat the defending Super Bowl XLIV champs, the New Orleans Saints, 41–36. The Seahawks made even more history during the game with Marshawn Lynch's 67-yard run, breaking 9 tackles, to clinch the victory. After the run, the fans reacted so loudly that a small earthquake (a bit above 2 on the Richter Scale) was recorded by seismic equipment around Seattle.[72] Lynch's run would be nicknamed the \"Beast Quake\". The Seahawks lost to the Bears in their second game, 35–24.[73] The 2011 season saw the team go 7–9 once again, but they were not able to get into the postseason with a third-place finish in the NFC West.[74] The 2012 NFL season started with doubt, as the Seahawks lost their season opener against the Arizona Cardinals. The highly touted Seattle defense gave up a go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter, and rookie quarterback Russell Wilson failed to throw the game-winning touchdown after multiple attempts in the red-zone. However, Russell Wilson and the Seahawks went 4–1 in their next five games en route to an 11–5 overall record (their first winning record since 2007). Their 2012 campaign included big wins over the Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, and San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks went into the playoffs as the No. 5 seed and the only team that season to go undefeated at home. In the Wild Card Round, the Seahawks overcame a 14-point deficit to defeat the Washington Redskins.[75] This was the first time since the 1983 Divisional Round that the Seahawks won a playoff game on the road.[76] However, in the 2012 Divisional Round, overcoming a 20-point, fourth-quarter deficit would not be enough to defeat the #1 seed Atlanta Falcons. An ill-advised timeout and a defensive breakdown late in the game cost the Seahawks their season, as they lost, 30–28.[77] Quarterback Russell Wilson won the 2012 Pepsi MAX Rookie of the Year award.[78] In the 2013 NFL season, the Seahawks continued their momentum from the previous season, finishing tied with the Denver Broncos for an NFL-best regular season record of 13–3, while earning the NFC's #1 playoff seed.[79][80] Their 2013 campaign included big wins over the Carolina Panthers, New Orleans Saints, and the San Francisco 49ers.[81] Six Seahawks players were named to the Pro Bowl: Quarterback Russell Wilson, center Max Unger, running back Marshawn Lynch, cornerback Richard Sherman, free safety Earl Thomas, and strong safety Kam Chancellor.[82] However, none of them were able to play in the Pro Bowl, as the Seahawks defeated the New Orleans Saints 23–15 and the San Francisco 49ers 23–17, in the playoffs to advance to Super Bowl XLVIII against the Denver Broncos.[83][84] On February 2, 2014, the Seahawks won the franchise's only Super Bowl Championship, defeating Denver 43–8.[85] The Seahawks' defense performance in 2013 was acclaimed as one of the best in the Super Bowl era.[86] The 2014 campaign saw the team lose some key pieces, including wide receiver Golden Tate to free agency and wide receiver Sidney Rice and defensive end Chris Clemons to retirement. Percy Harvin was also let go mid-season after several underachieving weeks and clashes with the rest of the locker room.[87] Despite starting 3–3, they rallied to a 12–4 record, good enough once again for the #1 seed in the NFC Playoffs.[88][89] After dispatching the Carolina Panthers handily in the Divisional Round 31–17,[90] they faced the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game. Despite five turnovers and trailing 19–7 late in the contest, the Seahawks prevailed in overtime to reach Super Bowl XLIX against the New England Patriots,[91] but an ill-fated interception at the 1-yard line late in the championship game stymied a comeback attempt and thwarted the Seahawks' bid to be the first repeat Super Bowl champions since the Patriots had won Super Bowls XXXVIII and XXXIX.[92] The Seahawks returned to the playoffs in both 2015 and 2016, but despite winning the Wild Card game in both years they failed to win either Divisional round game on the road.[93][94][95][96] The 2017 iteration of the team missed the playoffs for the first time in six years, as injuries to their core players coupled with disappointing acquisitions of running back Eddie Lacy and kicker Blair Walsh failed them in a competitive NFC.[97] The team cut ties with most of the remaining players that had been part of their meteoric rise and turnover both their Offensive and Defensive coaching staff in 2018, and an influx of young talent helped propel the team to a 10–6 record and another playoff berth that ultimately ended in a loss in the Wild Card game to the Dallas Cowboys.[98][99] In October 2018, owner Paul Allen died after a prolonged fight with cancer.[100] In 2019, the Seahawks put up their best record since their last trip to the Super Bowl at 11–5, but they still lost 3 out of their last 4 games and lost their chance to win the NFC West.[101] A likely explanation for their sloppy finish is because many of their players were injured late in the season. After defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 17–9 in the Wild Card game,[102] they lost to the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional round, failing another attempt at a second Super Bowl.[103] The 2020 season saw the Seahawks win their first five games, a franchise-best for a start to a season.[104] Despite the Seahawks losing three of their next four games, the Seahawks finished strong, earning twelve victories for the first time since their Super Bowl season in 2014, and winning the division for the first time in four years.[105] However, despite the 12–4 record and the division title, the Seahawks' season ended the following week against the Los Angeles Rams, who never trailed in a 30–20 victory.[106] The Seahawks struggled and started the 2021 season 3–8. Russell Wilson had an injured finger missing 3 games and the Seahawks were shut out the first time in the Wilson era in Week 10 against the Green Bay Packers.[107] This was their worst first half of a season since 2009, under then-head coach Jim Mora. The Seahawks were eliminated from playoff contention on December 26 in a loss to the Chicago Bears, and they finished last in their division for the first time since 1996.[108][109] With wins over the Detroit Lions and the Arizona Cardinals they finished 7–10.[110] Following the 2021 season was an offseason of continuing change, punctuated with the trade of quarterback Russell Wilson to the team he and the Seahawks beat in Super Bowl XLVIII, the Denver Broncos, on March 6, 2022. The Broncos traded quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive end Shelby Harris, two first round picks (for that year's draft, No. 9 overall, and 2023's), two second round picks (that year's, No. 40 overall, and 2023's) and a 2022 fifth round selection to the Seahawks for Wilson and a 2022 fourth round pick. Another hallmark franchise player from the Super Bowl-winning Seahawks, former All-Pro linebacker Bobby Wagner, was also cut by the team that same day, a move that saves them $16.6 million in cap space. The Seahawks also took on $26 million in dead money by trading Wilson; ESPN Stats & Information research revealed it to be the second-most dead money a team has ever incurred, trailing the $33.8 million the Philadelphia Eagles ate in their trade of Carson Wentz the previous year.[111] In the 2022 season, the Seahawks finished with a 9–8 record and made the playoffs.[112] The team's season ended in the Wild Card round with a 41–23 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.[113] The 2023 season saw the Seahawks finish 9–8 and miss the postseason.[114] Carroll was fired from his head coaching position after the 2023 season.[115] Carroll remained with the team in an unspecified advisory role.[116] Mike Macdonald, formerly defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens, was hired as the new head coach.[117] When the Seahawks debuted in 1976, the team's logo was a stylized royal blue and forest green osprey's head based on Kwakwakaʼwakw art masks.[118] The helmet and pants were silver while the home jerseys were royal blue with white and green sleeve stripes and white numerals and names. The road jersey was white, with white, blue and green sleeve stripes and had blue numerals and names. The socks were blue and had the same green and white striping pattern seen on the blue jerseys. Black shoes were worn for the first four seasons, one of the few NFL teams that did so in the late 1970s, at a time when most teams were wearing white shoes. They would switch to white shoes in 1980.[119][120] In 1983, coinciding with the arrival of Chuck Knox as head coach, the uniforms were updated slightly. The striping on the arms now incorporated the Seahawks logo, and the TV numbers, previously located on the sleeves, moved onto the shoulders. The helmet facemasks changed from gray to blue. Also, the socks went solid blue at the top, and white on bottom.[121] In the 1985 season, the team wore 10th Anniversary patches on the left side of their pants. It had the Seahawks logo streaking through the number 10. In 1994, the year of the NFL's 75th Anniversary, the Seahawks changed the style of their numbering to something more suitable for the team; Pro Block from then until 2001. That same year, the Seahawks wore a vintage jersey for select games resembling the 1976–82 uniforms. However, the helmet facemasks remained blue. The logos also became sewn on instead of being screen-printed. In 2000, Shaun Alexander's rookie year and Cortez Kennedy's last, the Seattle Seahawks celebrated their 25th Anniversary; the logo was worn on the upper left chest of the jersey. In 2001, the Seahawks switched to the new Reebok uniform system still in their then-current uniforms after that company signed a 10-year deal to be the exclusive uniform supplier to the NFL, but it would be their last in this uniform after the season ended. Prior to this, various companies made the team's uniforms. On March 1, 2002, to coincide with the team moving to the NFC as well as the opening of Seahawks Stadium (later renamed Qwest, CenturyLink, and currently Lumen Field), both the logo and the uniforms were heavily redesigned. The Wordmark was designed by Mark Verlander and the logo was designed by NFL Properties in-house design team. The colors were modified to a lighter \"Seahawks Blue\", a darker \"Seahawks Navy\" and lime green piping. The helmets also were changed from silver to the lighter \"Seahawks Blue\" color after a fan poll was conducted. Silver would not be seen again until 2012. The logo artwork was also subtly altered, with an arched eyebrow and a forward-facing pupil suggesting a more aggressive-looking bird. At first, the team had planned to wear silver helmets at home and blue helmets on the road, but since NFL rules forbid the use of multiple helmets, the team held the fan poll to decide which color helmet would be worn. The team had usually worn all blue at home and all white on the road since 2003, but late in the 2009 season, the Seahawks wore the white jersey-blue pants combo. The blue jersey and white pants combo has been worn for only one regular-season game, the 2005 season opener at the Jacksonville Jaguars, while the white jersey and blue pants combination has not been worn regularly since late in the 2002 season, with the exception of late in the 2009 season. In 2009, the Seahawks once again wore the white jersey and blue pants combination for road games against Minnesota (November 22), St. Louis (November 29), Houston (December 13), and Green Bay (December 27). The Seahawks wore their home blue jerseys during Super Bowl XL despite being designated as the visitor, since the Pittsburgh Steelers, the designated home team, elected to wear their white jerseys. On September 27, 2009, the Seahawks wore lime green jerseys for the first time, paired with new dark navy blue pants in a game against the Chicago Bears. The jerseys matched their new sister team, the expansion Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer who wear green jerseys with blue pants. On December 6, 2009, the Seahawks wore their Seahawks blue jersey with the new dark navy blue pants for the first time, in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks broke out the same combo two weeks later against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and two weeks after that in the 2009 regular-season finale against the Tennessee Titans. In December 2009, then-coach Jim Mora announced that the new lime green jerseys were being retired because the team did not win in them, because he liked the standard blue home jerseys better, and added that the home jersey is a better match for the navy pants.[122] In the same press conference, he stated that the new navy pants \"felt better\" on players as opposed to the Seahawks blue pants. For the 2010 season, Seattle returned to the traditional all \"Seahawks Blue\" at home and all white on the road. On April 3, 2012, Nike, which took over as the official uniform supplier for the league from Reebok, unveiled new uniform and logo designs for the Seahawks for the 2012 season. The new designs incorporate a new accent color, \"Wolf Grey\", and the main colors are \"College Navy\" and \"Action Green\".[5][6] The uniforms incorporate \"feather trims\", multiple feathers on the crown of the helmet, twelve feathers printed on the neckline and down each pant leg to represent the \"12th Man\", referring to the team's fans.[123][124] The Seahawks have three different jersey colors: navy blue, white, and an alternate grey jersey. The Seahawks will have three different pants: navy blue with green feathers, gray with navy blue feathers, and white with navy blue feathers. Their new logo replaces the Seahawk blue with wolf grey. Altogether, there are nine different uniform combinations possible. The Seahawks wore their Nike home blue jerseys for the first regular-season game on September 16, 2012, against the Dallas Cowboys. The uniform Marshawn Lynch wore in that game is preserved at the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[125] On September 9, 2012, the Seahawks wore their Nike white away jerseys for the first regular-season game against the Arizona Cardinals; on October 14, 2012, with the Carolina Panthers wearing white at home, they wore their blue jerseys with gray pants (and would do so again against the Miami Dolphins seven weeks later); and on December 16, 2012, they wore their Alternate Wolf Grey jerseys for the first time against the Buffalo Bills.[126] The all-navy ensemble is the Seahawks' current primary uniform option for home games. Initially, the Seahawks paired their navy uniforms with gray pants on select road games in which the home team wore white jerseys, but on December 5, 2021, the Seahawks wore this combination at home for the first time in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. On the road, the Seahawks primarily pair their white uniforms with the navy pants (that combination was used during their Super Bowl XLVIII win), although they also pair the white uniforms with either white or gray pants on occasion. The all-gray uniforms were worn occasionally on the road, mainly against the Arizona Cardinals. In 2016, the Seahawks unveiled their NFL Color Rush uniform, an all-Action Green ensemble.[127] They first wore the uniform on December 16 against the Los Angeles Rams at home, marking the first time they wore green uniforms since 2009. The Seahawks continue to wear the Color Rush set as an alternate uniform alongside the all-gray combination. During a home matchup with the Vikings on December 3, 2019, the Seahawks wore their Color Rush green tops and regular navy pants.[128] The combination was used again on October 11, 2020, also against the Vikings, and then again on November 19, against the Arizona Cardinals. It was used once in 2021, on Thursday Night Football vs. the Rams. In July 2023, the Seahawks introduced a throwback uniform set inspired by the team's 1983–2001 design. These uniforms were worn in Week 8 against the Cleveland Browns.[129] Consequently, the gray alternate tops were retired due to NFL regulations restricting teams to two alternate jerseys.[130] Prior to 2023, the Seahawks were the only NFL team to have never worn white jerseys in a home game.[131] However, on September 24, 2023, the Seahawks wore their white jerseys at home for the first time, doing so against the Carolina Panthers. The game served as the 10th anniversary of the Seahawks' first Super Bowl victory, as the current team wore the same white jersey/navy pants combination from Super Bowl XLVIII.[132] The rivalry between the Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams came into existence in 2002 following the Seahawks' relocation to the NFC West. The first notable matchup between the two clubs occurred in the 2004 NFC Wild card round when the Rams managed to defeat the Seahawks in Seattle 27–20 and currently hold the streak for the only two wins against the Seahawks at home during the postseason. Much of the intensity waned as the Rams declined in competition throughout the 2000s and early 2010s, but several notable matchups between the two clubs would still occur. The rivalry saw new life as the Rams' Mob Squad-era teams regularly clashed with Seattle's Legion of Boom era teams, often escalating into bitter grudge matches for control of the division.[133][134] Following the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016, and subsequent playoff success (most recently with a Super Bowl victory in 2022); the rivalry has increased in intensity; especially as Seattle's Legion of Boom era teams waned in competition.[135] Due to the recent dominance by the Rams under Sean McVay and former defensive tackle Aaron Donald, Seahawks fans have recently viewed the Rams as their divisional arch rival.[136] Tensions especially ran high during the 2021 Wild Card game following a widely publicized taunt from Safety Jamal Adams during a postgame conference after a tough win over the Rams during week 16. The Rams would go onto decimate the Seahawks in the wild card game, with cornerback Jalen Ramsey and quarterback Jared Goff expressing their satisfaction to get retribution following Adams' comments and cigar gesture.[137] As of the 2023 season, the Seahawks lead the series 27–26, but the Rams have won both playoff meetings.[138] From 2011 to 2014, the Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers emerged as two of the best teams in the NFC, and developed a rivalry as a result. The 49ers head coach at the time, Jim Harbaugh, had a contentious history with Seahawks coach Pete Carroll due to Harbaugh's previous job as coach at Stanford against Carroll's USC Trojans. Harbaugh's 49ers won the first three head-to-head contests but lost Week 16 of 2012. Both teams reached the playoffs that year, however the 49ers reached Super Bowl XLVII, which they lost. In 2013, the Seahawks won in a Week 2 contest, but the 49ers would triumph in Week 14. The Seahawks would beat the 49ers in the 2013 season NFC Championship Game 23–17 in a controversial win. The Seahawks went on to win the next 10 matchups, sweeping the regular season series against the 49ers from 2014 to 2018. Since then, however, the 49ers have won the last five contests against the Seahawks, winning the 2022 season regular season series, and a playoff matchup, as well as the 2023 regular season series. As of the 2023 season, the Seahawks lead the series 30–22.[139] The Arizona Cardinals and Seahawks became divisional rivals after both were relocated to the NFC West as a result of the league's realignment in 2002. This rivalry has become one of the NFL's more bitter in recent years, as the mid-to-late 2010s often saw the Seahawks and Cardinals squaring off for NFC West supremacy. The rivalry hit its peak as the Cardinals frequently clashed with the Legion Of Boom-era Seahawks led by Russell Wilson and head coach Pete Carroll, although Seattle shares more intense rivalries with the Rams and 49ers. Seattle leads the series 27–22–1, and the two teams have yet to meet in the playoffs.[140] Since moving to the NFC, the Seahawks have faced the Green Bay Packers several times in the playoffs, developing an intense rivalry as well. Some notable moments include the clubs' first playoff meeting in 2003 in which Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck threw a game-losing pick-six in overtime after guaranteeing a game-winning drive,[141] the Fail Mary, and Russell Wilson overcoming four interceptions and a 16–0 Packers lead to lead Seattle to a 28–22 overtime win to advance to Super Bowl XLIX.[142] As of the 2023 season, the Packers lead the all-time series 15–9.[143] From the 1980s to the 2002 league realignment, the Denver Broncos were a major rival for the Seahawks.[144][145] As of the 2023 season, the Broncos lead 35–23 against the Seahawks with Seattle having won both postseason meetings.[146] Since 2002, Denver has won three of five interconference meetings, and the teams met in Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014, where the Seahawks won 43–8.[147] On March 8, 2022, the Seattle Seahawks agreed to trade Russell Wilson and a 2022 fourth-round pick to the Denver Broncos for quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive lineman Shelby Harris, two first-round picks (2022—No. 9 overall—and 2023), two second-round picks (2022—No. 40 overall—and 2023) and a 2022 fifth-round selection.[148] Russell Wilson's first game against the Seattle Seahawks as a member of the Denver Broncos was played September 12, 2022, on Monday Night Football, where the Seahawks won 17–16.[149] The Raiders and Seahawks played many times being old members of the AFC West. Seattle's move to the NFC has made the matchup occur much less frequently, playing only five times since the end of the 2002 season. The Raiders lead the all-time series 30–26.[150] During the Seahawks' first ten seasons (1976–85), the team's headquarters was in Kirkland at the southern end of the Lake Washington Shipyard (now Carillon Point), on the shores of Lake Washington.[151] The summer training camps were held across the state at Eastern Washington University in Cheney, southwest of Spokane. When the team's new headquarters across town in Kirkland was completed in 1986, the Seahawks held training camp at home for the next eleven seasons (1986–96), staying in the dormitories of the adjacent Northwest College. In 1997, Dennis Erickson's third season as head coach, the team returned to the hotter and more isolated Cheney for training camp, which continued through 2006. In 2007, training camp returned to the Seahawk's Kirkland facility because of the scheduled China Bowl (NFL) game, which was later canceled. In 2008, the Seahawks held the first three weeks of camp in Kirkland, then moved to the new 19-acre (77,000 m2) Virginia Mason Athletic Center (VMAC) on August 18 for the final week of training camp, where the team has held their training camps since. The new facility, adjacent to Lake Washington in Renton, has four full-size practice fields: three natural grass outdoors and one FieldTurf indoors.[152] As of the end of the 2023 season, the Seattle Seahawks have competed in 48 NFL seasons, dating back to their expansion year of 1976. The team has compiled a 392–366–1 (.517) regular-season record and a 17–19 (.472) record in the playoffs, for an overall record of 409–385–1 and a .515 winning percentage.[153] Seattle has reached the playoffs in 20 separate seasons, including in the 2005 season when they lost Super Bowl XL to the Pittsburgh Steelers, the 2013 season when they defeated the Denver Broncos to win Super Bowl XLVIII, and the 2014 season when they lost Super Bowl XLIX to the New England Patriots. In the 2010 season, the Seahawks became the first team in NFL history to earn a spot in the playoffs with a losing record (7–9, .438) in a full season; this was by winning the division. The Seahawks would go on to defeat the reigning Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints in the Wild Card round, becoming the first team ever to win a playoff game with a losing record. Until Week 7 of the 2016 season against the Arizona Cardinals, the Seahawks had never recorded a tied game in their history.[154] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 11 reserve, 13 practice squad (+3 exempt) The 35th Anniversary team was voted upon by users on Seahawks.com and announced in 2010.[155] Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

In 2002, the Seahawks began playing at what is now Lumen Field. Every regular season and playoff game at Lumen Field since the second week of the 2003 season has been played before a sellout crowd. Like the Kingdome before it, Lumen Field is one of the loudest stadiums in the league. The stadium's partial roof and seating decks trap and amplify the noise and reflect it back down to the field. This noise has caused problems for opposing teams, causing them to commit numerous false-start penalties. From 2002 through 2012, there have been 143 false-start penalties on visiting teams in Seattle, second only to the Minnesota Vikings.[168] The Seahawks' fans have twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event, first on September 15, 2013, registering 136.6 dB during a game against the San Francisco 49ers[19] and again on December 2, 2013, during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints, with a roar of 137.6 dB.[20][21] As of September 29, 2014, the record of 142.2 dB is held in Arrowhead Stadium by fans of the Kansas City Chiefs.[169] Prior to kickoff of each home game, the Seahawks salute their fans by raising a giant #12 flag at the south end of the stadium.[170] Current and former players, coaches, local celebrities, prominent fans including Patti Hammond, Seattle-area athletes, and former owner Paul Allen have raised the flag. Earlier, the Seahawks retired the #12 jersey on December 15, 1984, as a tribute to their fans.[157] Before their Super Bowl win, the Seahawks ran onto the field under a giant 12th Man flag. In September 1990, Texas A&M University filed, and was later granted, a trademark application for the \"12th Man\" term, based on their continual usage of the term since the 1920s. In January 2006, Texas A&M filed suit against the Seattle Seahawks to protect the trademark and in May 2006, the dispute was settled out of court. In the agreement, which expired in 2016, Texas A&M licensed the Seahawks to continue using the phrase, in exchange for a licensing fee, public acknowledgement of A&M's trademark when using the term, a restriction in usage of the term to seven states in the Northwest United States, and a prohibition from selling any \"12th Man\" merchandise.[171][172][173] Once the agreement expired, the Seahawks were allowed to continue using the number \"12\" but were no longer permitted to use the \"12th Man\" phrase.[174] In August 2015, the Seahawks decided to drop their signage of the \"12th Man\" term and shifted towards referring to their fans as the \"12s\" instead.[175] Starting in the 1998 season, Blitz has been the Seahawks' official mascot.[176] Prior to the 2014 NFL season, Blitz was given a new look and a sidekick; a secondary mascot named Boom was introduced to appeal to and interact with younger children.[177][178] In the 2003 and 2004 seasons, a hawk named Faith would fly around the stadium just before the team came out of the tunnel. However, because of her relatively small size and an inability to be trained to lead the team out of the tunnel, Faith was replaced by an augur hawk named Taima before the start of the 2005 NFL season. Taima started leading the team out of the tunnel in September 2006.[179][180] A group of female and male cheerleaders known as the Seahawks Dancers rallies the crowd from the sidelines and performs a halftime routine during home games at Lumen Field. The group was an all-female squad called the Sea Gals prior to admitting male members and re-branding ahead of the 2019 NFL season.[181][182] During the off-season, a select performing group from the Dancers travels to parades and other events, as well as with other NFL Cheerleaders on the road. Beginning in 2004, the Seahawks introduced their drum line, the Blue Thunder.[183] The group plays at every home game as well as over 100 events in the Seattle community. NFL Most Valuable Player Super Bowl MVP NFL Offensive Player of the Year NFL Defensive Player of the Year NFL Comeback Player of the Year Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year NFL Coach of the Year First-team All-Pro[b][184] NFL All-Decade Team NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team The Seahawks' flagship station is KIRO 710 kHz – KIRO-FM 97.3 MHz.[185] Games are heard on 47 stations in five western states and Canada.[186] Microsoft holds naming rights for the broadcasts for their web search engine under the moniker of the \"Bing Radio Network\". The current announcers are former Seahawks players Steve Raible (who was the team's color commentator from 1982 to 2003) and Dave Wyman.[187] The Raible-Wyman regular season pairing has been together since the final four games of 2017 but became full time starting in 2018. On local television broadcast preseason games are split between former Seahawks Paul Moyer, Sam Adkins, and Brock Huard. Pete Gross, who called the games from 1976 until just days before his death from cancer in 1992, is a member of the team's Ring of Honor. Other past announcers include Steve Thomas from 1992 to 1997, Lee Hamilton (also known as \"Hacksaw\") from 1998 to 1999, Brian Davis from 2000 to 2003, and former Seahawk Warren Moon from 2004 to 2017. Preseason games not shown on national networks were produced in-house by Seahawks Broadcasting and televised by KING-TV, channel 5 (and, in 2008, also on sister station KONG-TV since KING, an NBC affiliate, was committed to the Summer Olympics in China). Kate Scott became the announcer for Seahawks TV preseason games in 2023, replacing Curt Menefee (the host of Fox NFL Sunday) who had been the Seahawks TV voice since the 2009 preseason. KCPQ-TV, which airs most of the Seahawks' regular-season games (as the Seattle-Tacoma area's Fox affiliate), became the television partner for the team in 2012 and replaced KING-TV as broadcaster for preseason games, but KING-TV regained the partnership in 2022; simulcasts of any Seahawks games on ESPN's Monday Night Football air (as of the 2018 season) on CBS affiliate KIRO-TV.[188][189] In addition, any Saturday or Sunday afternoon games broadcast by CBS (usually—but not always—with the Seahawks hosting an AFC opponent) will air on KIRO-TV.

                "content": "Super Bowl LIX is the upcoming American football championship game of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2024 season. The game is scheduled to be played on February 9, 2025, at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.[2] The two teams playing have not been decided pending completion of the regular football season and playoff games. It will be the eighth Super Bowl played in the Superdome, and the 11th in the city of New Orleans, the most recent being Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, held in the same venue (then called Mercedes-Benz Superdome).[3] The game will be televised nationally by Fox.[4] On May 23, 2018, the league originally selected New Orleans as the site for Super Bowl LVIII, then tentatively scheduled for February 4, 2024.[3] In March 2020, the league and the NFLPA agreed to expand the regular season from 16 to 17 games starting in 2021, pushing Super Bowl LVIII to February 11, 2024, and causing a conflict with New Orleans's Mardi Gras celebrations.[5] On October 14, 2020, the league decided to move Super Bowl LVIII to another city (Las Vegas was later chosen) and awarded Super Bowl LIX to New Orleans instead, as Mardi Gras in 2025 is not until March 4, thus avoiding any conflicts.[2] The official logo was unveiled on February 12, 2024, and follows the logo template established since Super Bowl LVI, with the Roman numerals featuring imagery representing the host city/region. For this event, the Roman numerals contain artwork by local artist \"Queen\" Tahj Williams[6]—a figure in the community of Mardi Gras Indians.[7] It marks the first time the NFL collaborated with a local artist on the design of a Super Bowl emblem.[6] The design—created with beads—features Mardi Gras inspired red, green, and gold-colored fleur-de-lis patterns (a symbol long connected with New Orleans and used as the logo for the New Orleans Saints), evoking the designs of ironwork balconies common in the city's architecture (particularly in the French Quarter).[8] Super Bowl organizers said they would review security procedures in the wake of the truck attack incident on Bourbon Street January 1, 2025, that saw 15 killed and dozens injured, which forced the delay of the 2025 Sugar Bowl at the Superdome to the following day. Tourism official Walt Leger III said on New Year's Day that the priority would be on the immediate response to the attack but \"(t)here will be more deep conversations in the coming days and weeks to discuss possible enhancements for the Super Bowl.\"[9] Meanwhile, the NFL released a statement assuring that the game would be a \"safe and enjoyable\" experience.[10] On November 28, 2024, the NFL announced that Jon Batiste would perform the U.S. national anthem, Trombone Shorty and Lauren Daigle would perform \"America the Beautiful\", and Ledisi would perform \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\". Stephanie Nogueras would provide sign language for the national anthem and \"America the Beautiful\", while Otis Jones IV would sign for \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\".[11] On September 8, 2024, it was announced that rapper Kendrick Lamar will headline the halftime show.[12] Lamar previously performed at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show in 2022.[13] Super Bowl LIX is scheduled to be televised in English by Fox. It will be the second Super Bowl to be broadcast under the 11-year NFL television contract as part of the four-year rotation between CBS, Fox, NBC, and ABC/ESPN.[4][14] On October 14, 2024, it was announced that both Fox Deportes and Telemundo would air separate Spanish-language feeds of the game for the first time.[15] Fox has reported strong demand for advertising spots. The company announced it has sold all available commercial slots as of November 5, 2024. 30-second ad spots have reportedly sold for over $7 million, significantly higher than the $6.5 million average price for Super Bowl LVI. In 2022, the final ad slot was not sold until the Monday before the game, indicating a notable increase in demand for this year's event.[16] The season 3 premiere of Fox's game show The Floor will air following the game.[17] As a cross-promotion for the game, Fox series Kitchen Nightmares would begin airing special Road to Super Bowl LIX episodes in January 2025 as the first half of its ninth season, which focus on restaurants in New Orleans and feature guest appearances by NFL players and personalities.[18] Westwood One holds the national radio rights to the game.[19]",

                "content": "The NFL season is rapidly moving towards Super Bowl 59, the biggest game on the calendar — and one where new football legends are sure to be made. Once the regular-season dust settles, 14 teams will be left standing to battle it out for the Lombardi Trophy. The path to the Super Bowl will be thrilling in and of itself, as the best teams in the NFC and AFC collide. In the NFC, the Detroit Lions and Philadelphia Eagles have looked like real contenders, but the Minnesota Vikings lead a postseason pack looking to spring a surprise. Over in the AFC, the Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens — who both have MVP candidates in quarterbacks Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson — are among the favorites. However, the path to the Super Bowl goes through the Kansas City Chiefs, who could make history by being the first team in the Super Bowl era to win three straight titles. Here is everything you need to know about the 2025 Super Bowl, including the date, kickoff time, and stadium. Super Bowl:After deadly New Year's attack, NFL says Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans will be safe NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. The 2025 Super Bowl is set to be played on Sunday, Feb. 9. The 2025 Super Bowl will be played at New Orleans' Caesars Superdome. No venue has hosted more Super Bowls, with this being the eighth time the 50-year-old stadium has served as the site for the NFL's championship game. The last Super Bowl to take place at the home of the New Orleans Saints didn't exactly go off without a hitch. The lights went out on the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens early in the second half at Super Bowl 47, a problem that hopefully will not repeat this time around. The 2025 Super Bowl is scheduled to kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET. Super Bowl 59 will be broadcast by Fox. Fans looking for streaming options can check out Fubo, which is offering a free trial for new subscribers, and the Fox Sports app. Super Bowl 59 will be broadcast nationwide on Fox, live from the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. Fans can stream the game on Fubo, or via the Fox Sports app. The 2025 Super Bowl halftime show will center around Kendrick Lamar, who has been on the stage at the NFL's biggest occasion once before. The Los Angeles-based rapper joined Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and a long list of West Coast hip-hop stars on stage at SoFi Stadium at halftime in 2022. Lamar may be the one announced superstar for Super Bowl 59, but he's unlikely to do a solo set. Several recent Super Bowl halftime shows have featured a long roster of music's biggest names, and Lamar has made headlines with star-studded live shows over the past few years as part of his more traditional shows. It wouldn't be a shock if the \"Not Like Us\" rapper has several surprises in store ... just don't expect Drake to join him on stage. We occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

Super Bowl LIX returns to the city located in the state of Louisiana, to host the champions of the AFC and NFC, for a game that year after year is awaited by millions of fans inside and outside the United States. The race to fight for the Vince Lombardi Trophy is still very close, as in the AFC the Buffalo Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens are tough contenders, not to mention the return of the current two-time champions, the Kansas City Chiefs. Related: The team led by Patrick Mahomes is looking for something that no other team has achieved in history, which is to win the championship for the third consecutive year. While in the NFC, the Detroit Lions are heavy favorites and are looking to appear for the first time in their history in a Super Bowl, and reduce the blacklist of teams that have never played in such a game. The game is scheduled to be played on February 9, the second Sunday of the month, as it has been for the past three seasons, and the game is scheduled to kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET (3:30 p.m. PT). The Caesars Superdome, home of the New Orleans Saints, will host the game for the eighth time, as the first three Super Bowls played in New Orleans were held at Tulane Stadium. The Superdome will be remembered as \"the blackout Super Bowl\", as in edition 47 (2013), at the beginning of the second half of the game between the Ravens and 49ers, the game had to be suspended for around 20 minutes due to an electrical failure that left half of the stadium without light. The game will be broadcast, as in recent years, on FOX, and streaming will be available on Fubo and the NFL+ app. The length of the Super Bowl is the same as all other NFL games: four 15-minute timed quarters, but it is the context of the game that makes the whole process longer, stretching up to four hours at most. AFC: Kansas City Chiefs, Buffalo Bills, Baltimore Ravens, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Chargers, Pittsburgh Steelers and Denver Broncos. NFC: Detroit Lions, Philadelphia Eagles, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Los Angeles Rams, Minnesota Vikings, Washington Commanders and Green Bay Packers. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

                "content": "The English language has pinched words and elements from over 350 different languages, so no wonder it’s full of irregularities! And with so many different English accents, pronouncing the 26 letters of the English alphabet isn’t always as easy as A-B-C (as Michael Jackson said). If you’ve ever been confused by through and tough or struggled to hear the difference between ship and sheep, this English alphabet guide will help you. Like singing Michael Jackson’s famous pop song “ABC”, learning the English alphabet can be fun and easy with Busuu’s free online courses and learning resources! Did you know this? There are 26 letters in the English alphabet. However, until 1835, there were actually 27 letters, with the & (ampersand) making up the 27th letter of the alphabet. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet. The chart and table below introduces their position, pronunciation, name and the NATO phonetic alphabet, which you may have heard in war movies or during phone calls to clarify spelling. From beginner through to advanced, when you’re learning how to speak English there are going to be some words that stump English learners, and still stump native speakers, too (we’re looking at you, “Edinburgh” and “Worcestershire”). While your native language plays a big part in the types of words and sounds that you will have trouble with, there are a few common mistakes that you should look out for. Even though each letter in the English alphabet has a certain sound, when combined with other letters, this sound can change. Learning these variations will really help you improve your pronunciation and sound like a native speaker. Let’s take a look. Chances are you’ve already encountered this notoriously tricky consonant combination (called a digraph) and it’s range of pronunciations: Our tip: It is pronounced as a ‘g’ at the beginning of words (like \"ghost\"), and it is either silent or pronounced as ‘f’ at the end of words and syllables. The ‘th’ is certainly one of the hardest consonant sounds in the English alphabet to master. Many languages don’t have this sound, so don’t be put off if you can’t get it straight away. There are some slight variations in the way it can sound: Our tip: Practise placing your tongue behind your teeth and blow air out as you say the word. With Busuu’s expert-designed courses, you’ll get to learn, practice and pronounce all the letters, vowels and consonants in the English alphabet! The letter ‘c’ can be pronounced two distinct ways: Our tip: Normally when ‘c’ is followed by an ‘i’ or ‘e’, it takes the ‘s’ sound. The letter ‘s’ can be also be pronounced in two different ways: A short ‘i’ sound, as in “ship”, “live”, “sit”, “hit” and “fit”, can be confusing. You may want to pronounce them as long ‘i’ sounds, as in “leave”, “seat” or “feet”. Our tip: try saying the short ‘i’ sound followed by the long ‘i’ sound until you can hear the difference: “ship-sheep”, “live-leave”, “sit-seat”, “hit-heat” and “fit-feat”. When it comes to the vowel sounds, it may seem like there is no method to the madness. So let’s look at the three sounds of the letter ‘a’ that can be tricky: When it comes to the vowel sounds, it may seem like there is no method to the madness. So let’s look at the three sounds of the letter ‘a’ that can be tricky: The ‘short a’ /æ/, as in “cat”, “add”, “began”, “last”, “back”, “after” and “man” Our tip: The mouth needs to be open, and the tongue relaxed. The ‘long a’ /eɪ/, as in “play”, “make”, “name”, “say”, “came”, “change” and “face” Our tip: The sound is the same way you say the letter ‘A’ in the alphabet. The ‘unstressed a’ /ə/, as in “America”, “finally”, “surface”, “about” and “was” Our tip: Think about where the stress is in the word, instead of saying each syllable. Now you know all the English alphabet letters and their correct pronunciation, it’s time to put your knowledge to good use. Busuu can take you from English basics through to fluency. The course even includes a whole set of lessons on English pronunciation. So what are you waiting for? ©2025 Busuu Ltd Terms Privacy",

                "title": "English alphabet - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Modern English is written with a Latin-script alphabet consisting of 26 letters, with each having both uppercase and lowercase forms. The word alphabet is a compound of alpha and beta, the names of the first two letters in the Greek alphabet. Old English was first written down using the Latin alphabet during the 7th century. During the centuries that followed, various letters entered or fell out of use. By the 16th century, the present set of 26 letters had largely stabilised: There are 5 vowel letters and 19 consonant letters—as well as Y and W, which may function as either type. Written English has a large number of digraphs, such as ⟨ch⟩, ⟨ea⟩, ⟨oo⟩, ⟨sh⟩, and ⟨th⟩. Diacritics are generally not used to write native English words, which is unusual among orthographies used to write the languages of Europe. The names of the letters are commonly spelled out in compound words and initialisms (e.g., tee-shirt, deejay, emcee, okay, etc.), derived forms (e.g., exed out,[a] effing,[b] to eff and blind, aitchless,[c] etc.), and objects named after letters (e.g., en and em in printing, and wye in railroading). The spellings listed below are from the Oxford English Dictionary. Plurals of consonant names are formed by adding -s (e.g., bees, efs or effs, ems) or -es in the cases of aitches, esses, exes. Plurals of vowel names also take -es (i.e., aes, ees, ies, oes, ues), but these are rare. For a letter as a letter, the letter itself is most commonly used, generally in capitalised form, in which case the plural just takes -s or -'s (e.g. Cs or c's for cees). The names of the letters are for the most part direct descendants, via French, of the Latin (and Etruscan) names. (See Latin alphabet: Origins.) The regular phonological developments (in rough chronological order) are: The novel forms are aitch, a regular development of Medieval Latin acca; jay, a new letter presumably vocalised like neighboring kay to avoid confusion with established gee (the other name, jy, was taken from French); vee, a new letter named by analogy with the majority; double-u, a new letter, self-explanatory (the name of Latin V was ū); wye, of obscure origin but with an antecedent in Old French wi; izzard, from the Romance phrase i zed or i zeto \"and Z\" said when reciting the alphabet; and zee, an American levelling of zed by analogy with other consonants. Some groups of letters, such as pee and bee, or em and en, are easily confused in speech, especially when heard over the telephone or a radio communications link. Spelling alphabets such as the ICAO spelling alphabet, used by aircraft pilots, police and others, are designed to eliminate this potential confusion by giving each letter a name that sounds quite different from any other. The ampersand (&) has sometimes appeared at the end of the English alphabet, as in Byrhtferð's list of letters in 1011.[2] & was regarded as the 27th letter of the English alphabet, as taught to children in the US and elsewhere.[vague] An example may be seen in M. B. Moore's 1863 book The Dixie Primer, for the Little Folks.[3] Historically, the figure is a ligature for the letters Et. In English and many other languages, it is used to represent the word and, plus occasionally the Latin word et, as in the abbreviation &c (et cetera). Old and Middle English had a number of non-Latin letters that have since dropped out of use. Some of these either took the names of the equivalent runes, since there were no Latin names to adopt, or were runes themselves (thorn, wyn). The most common diacritic marks seen in English publications are the acute (é), grave (è), circumflex (â, î, or ô), tilde (ñ), umlaut and diaeresis (ü or ï—the same symbol is used for two different purposes), and cedilla (ç).[4] Diacritics used for tonal languages may be replaced with tonal numbers or omitted. Diacritic marks mainly appear in loanwords such as naïve and façade. Informal English writing tends to omit diacritics because of their absence from the keyboard, while professional copywriters and typesetters tend to include them. As such words become naturalised in English, there is a tendency to drop the diacritics, as has happened with many older borrowings from French, such as hôtel. Words that are still perceived as foreign tend to retain them; for example, the only spelling of soupçon found in English dictionaries (the OED and others) uses the diacritic. However, diacritics are likely to be retained even in naturalised words where they would otherwise be confused with a common native English word (for example, résumé rather than resume).[5] Rarely, they may even be added to a loanword for this reason (as in maté, from Spanish yerba mate but following the pattern of café, from French, to distinguish from mate). Occasionally, especially in older writing, diacritics are used to indicate the syllables of a word: cursed (verb) is pronounced with one syllable, while cursèd (adjective) is pronounced with two. For this, è is used widely in poetry, e.g., in Shakespeare's sonnets. J. R. R. Tolkien used ë, as in O wingëd crown. Similarly, while in chicken coop the letters -oo- represent a single vowel sound (a digraph), they less often represent two which may be marked with a diaresis as in zoölogist[6] and coöperation. This use of the diaeresis is rare but found in some well-known publications, such as MIT Technology Review and The New Yorker. Some publications, particularly in UK usage, have replaced the diaeresis with a hyphen such as in co-operative.[citation needed] In general, these devices are not used even where they would serve to alleviate some degree of confusion. The apostrophe (ʼ) is not usually considered part of the English alphabet nor used as a diacritic, even in loanwords. But it is used for two important purposes in written English: to mark the \"possessive\"[r] and to mark contracted words. Current standards require its use for both purposes. Therefore, apostrophes are necessary to spell many words even in isolation, unlike most punctuation marks, which are concerned with indicating sentence structure and other relationships among multiple words. In a Chronicle of Higher Education blog, Geoffrey Pullum argued that apostrophe is the 27th letter of the alphabet, arguing that it does not function as a form of punctuation.[8] Hyphens are often used in English compound words. Written compound words may be hyphenated, open or closed, so specifics are guided by stylistic policy. Some writers may use a slash in certain instances. The letter most commonly used in English is E. The least used letter is Z. The frequencies shown in the table may differ in practice according to the type of text.[9] The letters A, E, I, O, and U are considered vowel letters, since (except when silent) they represent vowels, although I and U represent consonants in words such as \"onion\" and \"quail\" respectively. The letter Y sometimes represents a consonant (as in \"young\") and sometimes a vowel (as in \"myth\"). Very rarely, W may represent a vowel (as in \"cwm\", a Welsh loanword). The consonant sounds represented by the letters W and Y in English (/w/ and /j/ as in went /wɛnt/ and yes /jɛs/) are referred to as semi-vowels (or glides) by linguists, however this is a description that applies to the sounds represented by the letters and not to the letters themselves. The remaining letters are considered consonant letters, since when not silent they generally represent consonants. The English language itself was initially written in the Anglo-Saxon futhorc runic alphabet, in use from the 5th century. This alphabet was brought to what is now England, along with the proto-form of the language itself, by Anglo-Saxon settlers. Very few examples of this form of written Old English have survived, mostly as short inscriptions or fragments. The Latin script, introduced by Christian missionaries, began to replace the Anglo-Saxon futhorc from about the 7th century, although the two continued in parallel for some time. As such, the Old English alphabet began to employ parts of the Roman alphabet in its construction.[10] Futhorc influenced the emerging English alphabet by providing it with the letters thorn (Þ þ) and wynn (Ƿ ƿ). The letter eth (Ð ð) was later devised as a modification of dee (D d), and finally yogh (Ȝ ȝ) was created by Norman scribes from the insular g in Old English and Irish, and used alongside their Carolingian g. The a-e ligature ash (Æ æ) was adopted as a letter in its own right, named after a futhorc rune æsc. In very early Old English the o-e ligature ethel (Œ œ) also appeared as a distinct letter, likewise named after a rune, œðel.[citation needed] Additionally, the v–v or u-u ligature double-u (W w) was in use. In the year 1011, a monk named Byrhtferð recorded the traditional order of the Old English alphabet.[2] He listed the 24 letters of the Latin alphabet first, including the ampersand, then 5 additional English letters, starting with the Tironian note ond (⁊), an insular symbol for and: In the orthography of Modern English, the letters thorn (þ), eth (ð), wynn (ƿ), yogh (ȝ), ash (æ), and ethel (œ) are obsolete. Latin borrowings reintroduced homographs of æ and œ into Middle English and Early Modern English, though they are largely obsolete (see \"Ligatures in recent usage\" below), and where they are used they are not considered to be separate letters (e.g., for collation purposes), but rather ligatures. Thorn and eth were both replaced by th, though thorn continued in existence for some time, its lowercase form gradually becoming graphically indistinguishable from the minuscule y in most handwriting. Y for th can still be seen in pseudo-archaisms such as \"Ye Olde Booke Shoppe\". The letters þ and ð are still used in present-day Icelandic (where they now represent two separate sounds, /θ/ and /ð/ having become phonemically-distinct – as indeed also happened in Modern English), while ð is still used in present-day Faroese (although only as a silent letter). Wynn disappeared from English around the 14th century when it was supplanted by uu, which ultimately developed into the modern w. Yogh disappeared around the 15th century and was typically replaced by gh. The letters u and j, as distinct from v and i, were introduced in the 16th century, and w assumed the status of an independent letter. The variant lowercase form long s (ſ) lasted into early modern English, and was used in non-final position up to the early 19th century. Today, the English alphabet is considered to consist of the following 26 letters: Written English has a number of digraphs,[11] but they are not considered separate letters of the alphabet: Outside of professional papers on specific subjects that traditionally use ligatures in loanwords, ligatures are seldom used in modern English. The ligatures æ and œ were until the 19th century (slightly later in American English)[citation needed] used in formal writing for certain words of Greek or Latin origin, such as encyclopædia and cœlom, although such ligatures were not used in either classical Latin or ancient Greek. These are now usually rendered as \"ae\" and \"oe\" in all types of writing,[citation needed] although in American English, a lone e has mostly supplanted both (for example, encyclopedia for encyclopaedia, and maneuver for manoeuvre). Some typefaces used to typeset English texts contain commonly used ligatures, such as for ⟨tt⟩, ⟨fi⟩, ⟨fl⟩, ⟨ffi⟩, and ⟨ffl⟩. These are not independent letters – although in traditional typesetting, each of these ligatures would have its own sort (type element) for practical reasons – but simply type design choices created to optimize the legibility of the text. There have been a number of proposals to extend or replace the basic English alphabet. These include proposals for the addition of letters to the English alphabet, such as eng or engma (Ŋ ŋ), used to replace the digraph \"ng\" and represent the voiced velar nasal sound with a single letter. Benjamin Franklin's phonetic alphabet, based on the Latin alphabet, introduced a number of new letters as part of a wider proposal to reform English orthography. Other proposals have gone further, proposing entirely new scripts for written English to replace the Latin alphabet such as the Deseret alphabet and the Shavian alphabet.",

                "content": "Associazione Calcio Milan (Italian pronunciation: [assotʃatˈtsjoːne ˈkaltʃo ˈmiːlan]), commonly referred to as Milan or AC Milan (Italian pronunciation: [a tˌtʃi mˈmiːlan]) mainly outside of Italy,[6] is an Italian professional football club based in Milan, Lombardy. Founded in 1899, the club competes in the Serie A, the top tier of Italian football. In its early history, Milan played its home games in different grounds around the city before moving to its current stadium, the San Siro, in 1926.[7] The stadium, which was built by Milan's second chairman, Piero Pirelli and has been shared with Inter Milan since 1947,[8] is the largest in Italian football, with a total capacity of 75,817.[9] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Inter, with whom they contest the Derby della Madonnina, one of the most followed derbies in football.[10] Milan has spent its entire history in Serie A with the exception of the 1980–81 and 1982–83 seasons.[11][12] Silvio Berlusconi’s 31-year tenure as Milan president was a standout period in the club's history, as they established themselves as one of Europe's most dominant and successful clubs. Milan won 29 trophies during his tenure, securing multiple Serie A and UEFA Champions League titles. During the 1991–92 season, the club notably achieved the feat of being the first team to win the Serie A title without losing a single game.[13] Milan is home to multiple Ballon d'Or winners, and three of the club's players, Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, and Frank Rijkaard, were ranked in the top three on the podium for the 1988 Ballon d'Or, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the prize.[14] Domestically, Milan has won 19 league titles,[15] 5 Coppa Italia titles and 8 Supercoppa Italiana titles.[16] In international competitions, Milan is Italy's most successful club.[nb 1][16][17][18][19] The club has won seven European Cup/Champions League titles, making them the competition's second-most successful team behind Real Madrid, and further honours include five UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record[nb 2] two Latin Cups, a joint record[nb 3] three Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup.[16] Milan is one of the wealthiest clubs in Italian and world football.[20] It was a founding member of the now-defunct G-14 group of Europe's leading football clubs as well as its replacement, the European Club Association.[21] \"Saremo una squadra di diavoli. I nostri colori saranno il rosso come il fuoco e il nero come la paura che incuteremo agli avversari.\" \"We will be a team of devils. Our colours will be red like fire and black like the fear we will invoke in our opponents.\" AC Milan was founded as Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club in 1899 by English expatriate Herbert Kilpin.[12] The club claims 16 December of that year as their foundation date,[24] but historical evidence seems to suggest that the club was actually founded a few days after, most likely on 18 December.[2] However, with the club's charter being lost, the exact date remains open to debate. In honour of its English origins, the club has retained the English spelling of the city's name, as opposed to the Italian spelling Milano, which it was forced to bear under the fascist regime. Milan won its first Italian championship in 1901, interrupting a three-year hegemony of Genoa, and a further two in succession in 1906 and 1907.[11] The club proved successful in the first decade of its existence, with several important trophies won, including, among others, the Medaglia del Re three times,[25] the Palla Dapples 23 times[26] and the FGNI tournament five times, a competition organized by the Italian Gymnastics Federation but not officially recognized by the Italian Football Federation.[27] In 1908, Milan experienced a split caused by internal disagreements over the signing of foreign players, which led to the forming of another Milan-based team, F.C. Internazionale.[28] Following these events, Milan did not manage to win a single domestic title until 1950–51,[16] with some exceptions represented by the 1915–16 Coppa Federale[29] and the 1917–18 Coppa Mauro,[30] two tournaments played during the First World War which, especially the former, received a lot of attention and proved to be highly competitive, despite them not being officially recognized by the Italian federation. The 1950s saw the club return to the top of Italian football, headed by the famous Gre-No-Li Swedish trio Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm. This was one of the club's most successful periods domestically, with the Scudetto going to Milan in 1951, 1955, 1957 and 1959.[16] This decade witnessed also the first European successes of Milan, with the 1951 and 1956 Latin Cup triumphs against Lille and Athletic Bilbao. Milan was also the first Italian club to take part to the newly born European Cup in the 1955–56 season, and reached the final two years later, when they were defeated by Real Madrid. The 1960s began with the debut of Milan's legend Gianni Rivera in 1960:[31] he would remain with the club for the rest of his career for the following 19 seasons. In 1961, Nereo Rocco was appointed as new coach of the club,[32] which under his leadership won immediately a scudetto in 1961–62, followed, in the next season, by Milan's first European Cup triumph, achieved after beating Benfica in the final.[33][34] This success was repeated in 1969, with a 4–1 win over Ajax in the final, which was followed by the Intercontinental Cup title the same year.[16] During this period Milan also won its ninth scudetto, its first Coppa Italia, with victory over Padova in the 1967 final, and two European Cup Winners' Cups in 1967–68 and 1972–73, after defeating in the last match Hamburg and Leeds United respectively.[16] Domestically, the 1970s were characterized by the pursuit of the 10th Serie A title, which grants the winner the Scudetto star. For three years in a row, in 1971, 1972 and 1973, Milan ended up second in the league, after some memorable duels with Inter and Juventus. Finally, the achievement was reached in 1979. The same year saw the retirement of Gianni Rivera and the debut of Franco Baresi, at his first full season with the club. After this success, the team went into a period of decline. The club in 1980 was involved in the Totonero scandal and as punishment was relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history.[35] The scandal was centred around a betting syndicate paying players and officials to fix the outcome of matches.[35] Milan achieved promotion back to Serie A at the first attempt, winning the 1980–81 Serie B title,[16] but were again relegated a year later as the team ended its 1981–82 campaign in third-last place. In 1983, Milan won the Serie B title for the second time in three seasons to return to Serie A,[16] where they achieved a sixth-place finish in 1983–84. On 20 February 1986, entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi (who owned Fininvest and Mediaset) acquired the club and saved it from bankruptcy after investing vast amounts of money,[11] appointing rising manager Arrigo Sacchi at the helm of the Rossoneri and signing Dutch internationals Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard.[11] The Dutch trio added an attacking impetus to the team, and complemented the club's Italian internationals Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta and Roberto Donadoni. Under Sacchi, Milan won its first Scudetto in nine years in the 1987–88 season. The following year, the club won its first European Cup in two decades, beating Romanian club Steaua București 4–0 in the final. Milan retained their title with a 1–0 win over Benfica a year later and was the last team to win back-to-back European Cups until Real Madrid's win in 2017.[36] The Milan team of 1988–1990, nicknamed the \"Immortals\" in the Italian media,[37] has been voted the best club side of all time in a global poll of experts conducted by World Soccer magazine.[38] After Sacchi left Milan in 1991, he was replaced by the club's former player Fabio Capello whose team won three consecutive Serie A titles between 1992 and 1994, a spell which included a 58-match unbeaten run in Serie A (which earned the team the label \"the Invincibles\"),[37][39][40] and back-to-back UEFA Champions League final appearances in 1993, 1994 and 1995. A year after losing 1–0 to Marseille in the 1993 Champions League final, Capello's team reached its peak in one of Milan's most memorable matches of all time, the famous 4–0 win over Barcelona in the 1994 Champions League final.[39] Capello's side went on to win the 1995–96 league title before he left to manage Real Madrid in 1996.[39] In 1998–99, after a two-year period of decline, Milan lifted its 16th championship in the club's centenary season. Milan's next period of success came under another former player, Carlo Ancelotti. After his appointment in November 2001, Ancelotti took Milan to the 2003 Champions League final, where they defeated Juventus on penalties to win the club's sixth European Cup.[41] The team then won the Scudetto in 2003–04 before reaching the 2005 Champions League final, where they were beaten by Liverpool on penalties despite leading 3–0 at half-time.[41] Two years later, the two teams met again in the 2007 Champions League final, with Milan winning 2–1 to lift the title for a seventh time.[41][42] The team then won its first FIFA Club World Cup in December 2007.[43] In 2009, after becoming Milan's second longest serving manager with 420 matches overseen,[43] Ancelotti left the club to take over as manager at Chelsea. During this period, the club was involved in the Calciopoli scandal, where five teams were accused of fixing matches by selecting favourable referees.[44] A police inquiry excluded any involvement of Milan managers;[45] the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) unilaterally decided that it had sufficient evidence to charge Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani. As a result, Milan was initially punished with a 15-point deduction and was banned from the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League. An appeal saw that penalty reduced to eight points,[46] which allowed the club to retain its Champions League participation. Following the aftermath of Calciopoli, local rivals Internazionale dominated Serie A, winning four Scudetti. However, with the help a strong squad boasting players such as Zlatan Ibrahimović, Robinho and Alexandre Pato joining many of the veterans of the club's mid-decade European successes, Milan recaptured the Scudetto in the 2010–11 Serie A season, their first since the 2003–04 season and 18th overall.[47][48] After their 18th Scudetto, the club declined in performance. Milan failed to qualify to European competitions for a few years, and the only trophy won was the 2016 Supercoppa Italiana, achieved under Vincenzo Montella's coaching after defeating Juventus in the penalty shoot-out.[citation needed] On 5 August 2016, a new preliminary agreement was signed with the Chinese investment management company Sino-Europe Sports Investment Management Changxing Co., to which Fininvest sold a 99.93% stake of Milan for about €520 million, plus the refurbishment of the club financial debt of €220 million.[49] On 13 April 2017, the deal was completed and Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux became the new direct parent company of the club.[50] In order to finalise the deal, American hedge fund Elliott Management Corporation provided Li with a loan of €303 million (€180 million to complete the payment to Fininvest and €123 million issued directly to the club).[51][52] On 10 July 2018, Li failed to keep up with his loan repayment plan, neglecting to deposit a €32 million instalment on time in order to refinance the €303 million loan debt owed to the American hedge fund. As a result, In July 2018, chairman Li Yonghong's investment vehicle Rossoneri Champion Inv. Lux. was removed as the shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Inv. Lux., the direct parent company of the club, making the investment vehicle majority controlled by Elliott Management Corporation the sole shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Inv. Lux.[53][54][55][56] On 27 November 2017, Montella was sacked due to poor results and replaced by former player Gennaro Gattuso.[57] Milan qualified for the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League group stage after finishing 6th in the 2017–18 Serie A season, but were banned by UEFA from European competition due to violations of Financial Fair Play regulations for failure to break-even.[58] Milan appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the decision was overturned on 20 July 2018.[59][60][61] In Gattuso's first full season in charge, Milan exceeded expectations and spent much of the campaign in the top 4. Despite winning their final 4 games, Milan missed out on the Champions League by one point.[62] After Milan's failure to qualify for the Champions League, Gattuso resigned as manager.[63] On 19 June 2019, Milan hired former Sampdoria manager Marco Giampaolo on a 2-year contract. On 28 June 2019, Milan was excluded from the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League for violating Financial Fair Play regulations for the years 2014–2017 and 2015–2018.[64] After four months in charge, Giampaolo was sacked after losing four of his first seven games, which was exacerbated by poor performances and a lack of supporter confidence. Stefano Pioli was hired as his replacement.[65] After the restart of the Serie A campaign due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Milan went on a 10 match unbeaten streak, winning 7 in the process including matches against Juventus, Lazio and Roma. This streak led to Milan abandoning their plans of hiring Ralf Rangnick as their new manager and sporting director, and instead extended Pioli's contract for a further 2 years.[66] Following a stellar start in the 2020–21 Serie A, which was a continuation of the second half of the previous season, Milan under Pioli in his first full season were led to a second-place finish in the league which was the highest finish for the team since the 2011–12 Serie A. This result allowed Milan to qualify for the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League for the following season, which would become their first appearance in the UEFA Champions League in seven years since their last appearance in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League. Milan secured their 19th Italian championship title on the last round of the 2021–22 season, with a club-record tally of 86 points. It was their first league title since the 2010–11 season. In the Serie A Awards, Rafael Leão was named as the league's most valuable player, Mike Maignan as the best goalkeeper, and Pioli as coach of the season.[67][68][69] On 1 June 2022, RedBird Capital Partners agreed to acquire AC Milan at $1.3 billion, meanwhile Elliott Management Corporation would keep a minority stake.[70] After five seasons with Milan, Pioli stepped down at the end of 2023–24 season and Paulo Fonseca was named as his replacement.[71] Red and black are the colours which have represented the club throughout its entire history. They were chosen by its founder Herbert Kilpin to represent the players' fiery ardor (red) and the opponents' fear to challenge the team (black). Rossoneri, the team's widely used nickname, literally means \"the red & blacks\" in Italian, in reference to the colours of the stripes on its jersey.[72] Another nickname derived from the club's colours is the Devil. An image of a red devil was used as Milan's logo at one point with a Golden Star for Sport Excellence located next to it.[73] As is customary in Italian football, the star above the logo was awarded to the club after winning 10 league titles, in 1979. The official Milan logos have always displayed the Flag of Milan, which was originally the flag of Saint Ambrose,[73] next to red and black stripes. The modern badge used today represents the club colours and the flag of the Comune di Milano, with the acronym ACM at the top and the foundation year (1899) at the bottom.[73] For what concerns the badge worn on match kits, from the origins to the mid-1940s it was simply the flag of Milan. For many decades no club logo was displayed, with the exception of the devil's logo in the early 1980s. The club badge made its definitive appearance on the match strips in the 1995–96, in a form that remained basically unchanged until present days. Since its foundation, the AC Milan home kit consisted of a red and black striped shirt, combined with white shorts and black socks; over the course of the decades, only cyclical changes dictated by the fashions of the time affected this pattern, which remained almost unchanged up to present days. In the first decade of the 20th century, the Rossoneri's first kit was a simple silk shirt characterized by thin stripes, with the badge of the city of Milan sewn at heart level. From the 1910s, the stripes were enlarged following a pattern that would remain unchanged until the late 1950s. The 1960s marked a return to the origins, with the use of thin stripes. This style would last until the 1985–86 season, with a small intermezzo from 1980 to 1982, when the stripes changed to a middle size again. A notable innovation occurred in this period. Between the 1979–80 and 1980–81 seasons, the AC Milan shirt achieved an important record by adding the surnames of the players above the number for the first time in Italian football.[74] From the 1986–87 season, under the impulse of the new club owner Silvio Berlusconi, the stripes were brought back to a middle size, and the colour of the socks was changed to white, taking the same colour of the shorts. In such a way, Berlusconi aimed at giving the players a more elegant look, as well as making the kit more distinguishably red and black when watched on the television compared to the thin striped kit, which, at a distance and on the television, could mistaken for a full red or brown shirt.[75] This style continued until 1998. Starting from the 1998–99 season, the kits started to be modified on a yearly basis in their design. Milan's away kit has always been completely white, sometimes adorned with various types of decorations, the most common of which are one vertical or horizontal red and black stripe.[76] The white away kit is considered by both the fans and the club to be a lucky strip in Champions League finals, due to the fact that Milan has won six finals out of eight in an all white strip (losing only to Ajax in 1995 and Liverpool in 2005), and only won one out of three in the home strip. The third strip, which is rarely used, changes yearly, being mostly black with red trimmings. \"I can't think of many shirts out there that are as recognisable as Milan's. – Our kits go beyond just the sphere of football.\" \"AC Milan Anthem – Milan Milan\" debuted in 1988 and was composed by Tony Renis and Massimo Guantini.[83][84] The official mascot, designed by Warner Bros., is \"Milanello\", a red devil with the AC Milan kit and a ball.[citation needed] Milan played their first matches at the Trotter pitch, located where the Milan Central railway station would later be built. It could not be defined as a stadium, as there were no dressing rooms, no stands and no other facilities. In 1903, Milan moved to the Acquabella pitch, where the stands consisted of a section of ground raised for the purpose. Milan played there until 1905. The following year the club moved to the Porta Monforte pitch, where they played until 1914. The stadium was furnished with a ticket office and wooden stands. In the following years Milan played at the Velodromo Sempione from 1914 to 1920, and at the Viale Lombardia stadium from 1920 to 1926. The latter was a modern structure, with a big main stand and which hosted several games of the Italy national football team.[85] In 1926 Milan moved to the stadium where they still play nowadays: The San Siro. The stadium,[9] officially known as Stadio Giuseppe Meazza after the former player who represented both Milan and Internazionale, has 75,923 seats. The more commonly used name, \"San Siro\", is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro was privately built by funding from Milan's president at the time, Piero Pirelli. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took 13+1⁄2 months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city in 1935, and since 1947 it has been shared with Internazionale when the other major Milanese club was accepted as joint tenant. The first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Milan lost 6–3 in a friendly match against Internazionale. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1–2 to Sampierdarenese. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations, most recently in preparation for the 1990 FIFA World Cup when its capacity was set to 85,700, all covered with a polycarbonate roof. In the summer of 2008 its capacity was reduced to 80,018, to meet the new standards set by UEFA. Based on the English model for stadiums, San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy for its fantastic atmosphere during matches, largely thanks to the closeness of the stands to the pitch. The frequent use of flares by supporters contributes to the atmosphere but the practice has occasionally caused problems. On 19 December 2005, Milan vice-president and executive director Adriano Galliani announced that the club was seriously working towards a relocation. He stated Milan's new stadium will be largely based on the Veltins-Arena – the home of Schalke 04 in Gelsenkirchen – and will follow the standards of football stadiums in the United States, Germany and Spain. As opposed to many other stadiums in Italy, Milan's new stadium would likely be used for football only, having no athletics track. On 11 December 2014, Barbara Berlusconi announced a proposal to build a property stadium of 42,000 seats in Portello, behind the new HQ of the Rossoneri, and the large square \"Piazza Gino Valle\". The new village with shopping malls and hotel is located near CityLife district and is served by the metro.[86] On 20 September 2015, however, Silvio Berlusconi called an end to his club's plans to build a new stadium in the city.[87] In 2017, new CEO Marco Fassone stated that the club may look at either staying in the San Siro or moving to a new stadium with the club hierarchy emphasising the need to increase average attendance for home games.[88] On 27 September 2023, chairman Paolo Scaroni announced the club had filed a proposal to build a new 70,000-seater stadium, alongside the club headquarters and museum in the comune of San Donato Milanese, a suburb south of Milan.[89] Milan is one of the most supported football clubs in Italy, according to research conducted by Italian newspaper La Repubblica.[90] Historically, Milan was supported by the city's working class, which granted them the nickname of casciavid [kaʃaˈʋiːt] (which in Milanese dialect means \"screwdrivers\"), used until the 1960s.[91] On the other hand, crosstown rivals Inter Milan were mainly supported by the more prosperous middle class.[91] The oldest ultras groups in all of Italian football, Fossa dei Leoni, originated in Milan.[92] Currently, the main ultras group within the support base is Brigate Rossonere.[92] Milan ultras have never had any particular political preference,[92] but the media traditionally associated them with the left wing[93] until recently, when Berlusconi's presidency somewhat altered that view.[94] According to a study from 2010, Milan is the most supported Italian team in Europe and seventh overall, with over 18.4 million fans.[95] It had the thirteenth highest average attendance of European football clubs during the 2019–20 season, behind Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Inter, Schalke 04, Tottenham Hotspur, Celtic, Atlético Madrid, West Ham United and Arsenal.[96] Milan's main rivalry is with its neighbour club, Inter Milan. Both clubs meet in the widely anticipated Derby della Madonnina twice every Serie A season. The name of the derby refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary, whose statue atop the Milan Cathedral is one of the city's main attractions. The first match was held in the final of the Chiasso Cup of 1908, a football tournament played in Canton Ticino, Switzerland, on 18 October of that year; the Rossoneri won 2–1.[97] The rivalry reached its highest point in the 1960s, when the two clubs dominated the scene both domestically and internationally. In Italy they cumulatively won five Serie A titles, while internationally they collected four European cups. On the bench it showcased the clash of two different approaches to Catenaccio by the two managers: Nereo Rocco for Milan and Helenio Herrera for Inter. On the pitch the stage was taken by some of the biggest stars the Italian Serie A could offer: players such as Gianni Rivera, Giovanni Trapattoni and José Altafini for Milan and Sandro Mazzola, Giacinto Facchetti and Luis Suárez for Inter. The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the start of the game. Flares are commonly present and contribute to the spectacle but they have occasionally led to problems, including the abandonment of the second leg of the 2004–05 Champions League quarter-final match between Milan and Inter on 12 April 2005, after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan goalkeeper Dida on the shoulder.[98] The rivalry with Juventus F.C. is a rivalry between the two most titled teams in Italy. The challenge confronts also two of the clubs with the greater basin of supporters as well as those with the greatest turnover and stock market value in the country.[99] Milan and Juventus were often fighting for the top positions of the Serie A standings. Some important periods marked by this rivalry were the early 1950s, which saw the two teams alternating each other as Serie A champions (the two clubs won seven titles in the decade), and big duels between forwards, with the Swedish Gre-No-Li on the rossoneri side and the trio formed by Giampiero Boniperti, John Hansen and Karl Aage Præst on the bianconeri side; the early 1970s, when for two consecutive seasons, 1971-72 and 1972-73, Milan lost the scudetto to Juventus by just one point; the 1990s, when the two clubs dominated the league by winning eight (consecutive) titles out of ten, lining up players that marked the history of football in their era and in the whole history; and finally in the 2000s, when, between the 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons, the two clubs contested each other the Serie A titles, both won by Juventus but then revoked due to the Calciopoli scandal. The only match played by the two teams in European competitions was the 2003 UEFA Champions League final, the first such final between two Italian clubs, won by Milan at the penalties, which granted Milan the sixth Champions League title of their history.[100] The rivalry with Genoa started at the dawn of the 20th century, when the two clubs repeatedly faced each other for the Italian championship and other important trophies of the time. It then continued in the 1981-82 Serie A season, when Genoa avoided relegation in Naples just a few minutes from the final whistle of the last game of the season condemning the Rossoneri to the second Serie B season of their history. The rivalry worsened in 1995 after Genoa fan Vincenzo Spagnolo was stabbed to death by a Milan supporter.[101] Milan also have rivalries with Fiorentina, Atalanta and Napoli. In the movie industry, among the films dedicated to the Rossoneri team is Sunday Heroes (1953), by director Mario Camerini, in which the main plot pivots around a fictional football match between the Rossoneri and a club on the brink of relegation. In the film appear, in addition to the coach Lajos Czeizler, many of the Milan players of the time, including Lorenzo Buffon, Carlo Annovazzi and the entire Gre-No-Li trio.[citation needed] Milan as a fan base and some of their most popular players appeared in several Italian comedy movies. Among them the following are worth mentioning: Eccezzziunale... veramente, Really SSSupercool: Chapter Two (whose cast includes Paolo Maldini, Gennaro Gattuso, Massimo Ambrosini, Dida, Andriy Shevchenko and Alessandro Costacurta) and Tifosi (whose cast includes Franco Baresi).[citation needed] On 16 December 1999, on the day of the centenary of the club's foundation, Milan Channel was launched. The subscription-based television channel broadcasts news, events and vintage matches of the club. It is the first Italian thematic channel entirely dedicated to a football team. On 1 July 2016, the channel took on the new name of Milan TV, renewing its graphics and logo.[citation needed] In the editorial field, Forza Milan! was the official magazine of the club for over half a century. It was founded in 1963 by journalist Gino Sansoni and published by Panini. Issued with a monthly cadence, it covered all events surrounding Milan, with interviews to its protagonists, special posters, reports of official and friendly matches. Under the direction of Gigi Vesigna it reached a monthly circulation of 130,000 copies. The last issue of the magazine was published in June 2018.[102] With a total of 32 domestic honours, Milan is one of the most successful clubs in Italy. The club won its first Serie A title in 1901 with its most recent coming in 2022. Milan's tenth scudetto win meant that it earned the right to place a star on its jersey in recognition of this. Milan is the most successful Italian club in international football with 20 major international trophies won (18 of them organised by UEFA and FIFA), and the third most successful in Europe overall after Real Madrid and Barcelona. They have won the European Cup/Champions League seven times, an Italian record and only surpassed by Real Madrid, with their most recent coming in 2007. Milan's fifth European Cup win, in 1994, meant that the club was awarded the trophy permanently and is allowed to display a multiple-winner badge on its shirt.[103] The club also holds a joint record of two wins in the Latin Cup and a joint record of three wins in the Intercontinental Cup. In 2007, Milan won the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, completing an international treble of Champions League, Super Cup and Club World Cup. Paolo Maldini holds the records for both total appearances and Serie A appearances for Milan, with 902 official games played in total and 647 in Serie A (as of 31 May 2009, not including playoff matches),[104] the latter being an all-time Serie A record.[105] Swedish forward Gunnar Nordahl scored 38 goals in the 1950–51 season, 35 of which were in Serie A, setting an Italian football and club record. He went on to become Milan's all-time top goalscorer, scoring 221 goals for the club in 268 games.[106] He is followed in second place by Andriy Shevchenko with 175 goals in 322 games, and Gianni Rivera in third place, who has scored 164 goals in 658 games. Rivera is also Milan's youngest ever goalscorer, scoring in a league match against Juventus at just 17 years. Legendary tactician Nereo Rocco, the first proponent of catenaccio in the country, was Milan's longest-serving manager, sitting on the bench for over nine years (in two spells) in the 1960s and early 1970s, winning the club's first European Cup triumphs. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who purchased the club in 1986, is Milan's longest-serving president (23 years, due to a two-year vacancy between 2004 and 2006). The first official match in which Milan participated was in the Third Federal Football Championship, the predecessor of Serie A, losing 3–0 to Torinese. Milan's largest ever victory was 13–0 against Audax Modena, in a league match at the 1914–15 season. Its heaviest defeat was recorded in the league at the 1922–23 season, beaten 0–8 by Bologna. During the 1991–92 season, the club achieved the feature of being the first team to win the Serie A title without losing a single game. Previously, only Perugia had managed to go unbeaten over an entire Serie A season (1978–79), but finished second in the table. In total, Milan's unbeaten streak lasted 58 games, starting with a 0–0 draw against Parma on 26 May 1991 and coincidentally ending with a 1–0 home loss to Parma on 21 March 1993. This is a Serie A record as well as the third-longest unbeaten run in top flight European football, coming in behind Steaua București's record of 104 unbeaten games and Celtic's 68 game unbeaten run.[13][107] Since 2007, along with Boca Juniors, Milan has won more FIFA recognised international club titles than any other club in the world with 18 titles.[108] They were overtaken by Al Ahly SC from Egypt after their 2014 CAF Confederation Cup win.[109] The sale of Kaká to Real Madrid in 2009 broke the eight-year-old world football transfer record held by Zinedine Zidane, costing the Spanish club €67 million[110] (about £56 million[111]). That record, however, lasted for less than a month, broken by Cristiano Ronaldo's £80 million transfer.[112] This record, however, is in terms of nominal British pound rates, not adjusted to inflation or the real value of the euro. Madrid bought Zidane for €77.5 million in 2001,[113][114] about £46 million at that time. Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

Here is a complete list of them.[128] Below is a list of Milan managers from 1900 until the present day.[129] On 13 April 2017 Milan became a subsidiary of Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg, which acquired 99.9% shares of AC Milan S.p.A. from Fininvest. Li Yonghong became the new chairman[nb 4] and Marco Fassone was confirmed as CEO.[130][131] Li Yonghong's investment vehicle was removed as the shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg after defaulting to Elliott Management Corporation, which lent a large sum of money to Li to finalise the acquisition.[132][133] Other partners of Elliott were Arena Investors[133] and Blue Skye, according to news reports.[134] Elliott nominated a new board of directors for both Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg and Milan, with Paolo Scaroni as the new chairman (Italian: presidente) of the board of Milan. The four previous Chinese member of the board and former CEO Marco Fassone were all dismissed.[135] According to The Football Money League published by consultants Deloitte, in the 2005–06 season, Milan was the fifth-highest earning football club in the world with an estimated revenue of €233.7 million.[136] However, it fell to twelfth in 2013–14 season. The club is also ranked as the eighth-wealthiest football club in the world by Forbes magazine as of 2014[update], making it the wealthiest in Italian football, just surpassing ninth-ranked Juventus by a narrow margin.[20] Emirates is the current main sponsor for Milan's shirt starting from the 2010–11 season and through to the 2019–20 season.[137] Previously, German car manufacturer Opel (owned by General Motors) had sponsored Milan for 12 seasons.[138] For most of those 12 years, \"Opel\" was displayed on the front of the shirt, but in the 2003–04 and the 2005–06 seasons respectively, \"Meriva\" and \"Zafira\" (two cars from the company's range) were displayed. The current shirts are supplied by Puma. Previously it was supplied by German sportswear manufacturer Adidas, whose deal was scheduled to run until 2023.[139] The deal made Adidas the official manufacturer of all kits, training equipment and replica outfits. However, an early termination of the deal was announced in October 2017,[140] effective on 30 June 2018. Prior to Adidas, the Italian sports company Lotto produced Milan's sportswear. As a consequence of the aggregate 2.5-year financial result in the reporting periods ending at 31 December 2015, 31 December 2016 and 30 June 2017 (a FFP-adjusted net loss of €146 million, €121 million in excess of the acceptable deviation in the regulation[141]: 9 ), Milan was initially banned from European competitions due to breach in UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations. However, the European ban was lifted by an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.[141] Milan was allowed to achieve the break even condition on or before 30 June 2021.[142] Note: Re-capitalization figures were obtained from item versamenti soci in conto capitale e/o copertura perdite, for 2006 to 2017 financial year Milan took part in three editions of the Superleague Formula, from 2008 to 2010. This car competition involved the participation of professional racing teams sponsored by international football teams. The Rossoneri supported the Dutch team Scuderia Playteam in the first season, then Azerti Motorsport in 2009 and the Atech Grand Prix in 2010. The team took several victories and pole positions, and finished third in the final standings of the 2008 championship with Robert Doornbos, former Minardi and Red Bull driver in the Formula 1 World Championship, as main driver.[169] In the same year, Doornbos achieved his team's first victory at the Nürburgring circuit in Germany. Giorgio Pantano drove for Milan in the 2009 season and he has also won races for the team.[170]",

They both share the same stadium, meaning home and away in this tie is played in rather familiar territory. The first game handed the advantage to Inter, but a two-goal deficit is not beyond the reach of their neighbourly rivals AC Milan. **Follow Inter vs AC Milan in the Champions League semi-final live** The history of AC Milan is a storied one, and the club owes its nomenclature to its English roots as well as a touch of historical circumstance, one very much linked to that of their rivals. Ahead of the game, I thought I’d delve into the tale behind the name of this iconic football institution. 💸🇮🇹 Inter take on their city rivals Milan at San Siro tonight, and they will do so without a ludicrously expensive sponsor on their shirt - but why?Before you ask, I'm not complaining, it makes their shirt look even more fabulous...https://t.co/9UnMXVBbTn Back in 1899, an English expatriate named Herbert Kilpin set the wheels in motion to establish a club in Milan. Originally known as Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club, this ambitious venture would lay the foundation for greatness. While the club claims December 16 as its official founding date, historical evidence points toward a more probable inception on December 13, a few days earlier. Interestingly, AC Milan’s (Associazione Calcio Milan, translated to Milan Football Association) name carries a subtle nod to its English heritage. In an era when the club faced external pressures to conform to the Italian spelling of the city, Milano, it defiantly held onto its English roots. Despite the imposition during the fascist regime, the club retained the unique spelling that harkened back to its inception. It became a symbol of defiance, a constant reminder of the enduring spirit of the team. The Derby della Madonnina: History and origin Why is Inter vs AC Milan called the Derby della Madoninna? Inter's sponsor-less jersey explained The early years saw AC Milan establish themselves as a force to be reckoned with. In the first decade of existence, the club secured several prestigious trophies, including the Medaglia del Re (King’s Medal), the Palla Dapples, and the FGNI tournament. These triumphs were testament to the team’s prowess and set the stage for a remarkable journey. However, the road to success had its bumps along the way. In 1908, internal disagreements over the signing of foreign players led to a dramatic split within the club. Out of this division emerged another Milan-based team, F.C. Internazionale Milano, giving birth to one of football’s most intense rivalries. This separation marked a challenging period for AC Milan, with an elusive domestic title remaining out of reach until the 1950–51 season. We have one mission! ❤️🖤 Un’unica missione! ❤️🖤 #RednBlack #UCL #InterMilan #SempreMilan pic.twitter.com/TIvvHpVz5Q CHAMPIONS LEAGUE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE The 1950s proved to be the start of what was to come, with five Scudetto titles and two continental trophies in that decade, although decline would be seen in the ‘80s, with a betting scandal adding a black mark to their proud name. Glory was soon to return either side of the turn of the new century. Today, AC Milan has recaptured some of its magic and after lifting the Serie A title in 2022, now aims to add Champions League glory. Its name reflects the amalgamation of cultures, an English spelling that proudly defies conformity, and an Italian soul that beats within. Through triumphs and setbacks, AC Milan has remained a testament to the power of passion, unity, and the indomitable spirit of the Beautiful Game.

We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Most people get HMPV before they turn 5. You can get HMPV again, but symptoms are usually mild after your first infection. Human metapneumovirus most often causes symptoms similar to a cold, but some people can get very sick. You’re more likely to get severely sick the first time you get HMPV, which is why young kids have a greater risk for serious illness. You get some protection (immunity) from your first infection and then are more likely to have mild, cold-like symptoms if you get another HMPV infection. Adults over 65 and people with breathing problems or a weakened immune system may also get severe symptoms. Researchers estimate that about 10% to 12% of respiratory illnesses in children are caused by HMPV. Most cases are mild, but about 5% to 16% of children will develop a lower respiratory tract infection like pneumonia. It’s not the same, but human metapneumovirus is similar to RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). It’s part of the same genus — or scientific grouping — as RSV (Pneumovirus), and can cause similar symptoms. The peak age for severe illness from HMPV is between 6 and 12 months, but RSV is more likely to cause severe illness in infants younger than 6 months. Symptoms of human metapneumovirus include: Advertisement A virus — a small germ that uses your cells to make more copies of itself — causes HMPV. It’s part of the same group of viruses that cause RSV, measles and mumps. HMPV spreads through direct contact with someone who has it or from touching things contaminated with the virus. For instance: Anyone can get HMPV, but you’re at a higher risk for severe illness if you: Sometimes HMPV causes complications. These might be serious and require you to be hospitalized. They include: Healthcare providers usually diagnose HMPV based on your symptoms and health history. They might use a soft-tipped stick (swab) to get a sample from your nose or throat. A lab tests the sample for viruses and other infections. Keep in mind that you probably won’t be tested for HMPV unless you have serious symptoms. Sometimes, your provider may also do a bronchoscopy or chest X-rays to look for changes in the airways of your lungs. There aren’t any antiviral medications that treat human metapneumovirus. Most people can manage their symptoms at home until they feel better. If you or your child are severely ill, you might need to be admitted to the hospital. There, healthcare providers can monitor your condition and help prevent you from getting sicker. They might treat you with: No. Antibiotics only treat bacteria. Since HMPV is a virus, antibiotics won’t get rid of it. Sometimes people who get pneumonia from HMPV also get a bacterial infection at the same time (secondary infection). If your provider prescribes antibiotics, it would be to treat any secondary infections. You can reduce your risk of getting HMPV and other infectious diseases by: Advertisement Mild cases of human metapneumovirus usually last a few days to a week. If you’re very sick, it’ll probably take longer to feel better. You might also have lingering symptoms, like a cough, that take longer to go away.

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages, especially among young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. Discovered in 2001, HMPV is in the Pneumoviridae family along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Broader use of molecular diagnostic testing has increased identification and awareness of HMPV as an important cause of upper and lower respiratory infection. Symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath. Clinical symptoms of HMPV infection may progress to bronchitis or pneumonia and are similar to other viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory infections. The estimated incubation period is 3 to 6 days, and the median duration of illness can vary depending upon severity but is similar to other respiratory infections caused by viruses. HMPV is most likely spread from an infected person to others through In the U.S., HMPV circulates in distinct annual seasons. HMPV circulation begins in winter and lasts until or through spring. Surveillance data from CDC's the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) shows HMPV to be most active during late winter and spring in temperate climates. HMPV, RSV, and influenza can circulate simultaneously during the respiratory virus season. Your patients can help prevent the spread of HMPV and other respiratory viruses by following these steps: Patients who have cold-like symptoms should In addition, cleaning possible contaminated surfaces (such as doorknobs and shared toys) may potentially help stop the spread of HMPV. In healthcare settings, healthcare providers should follow CDC's 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings. Since HMPV is a recently recognized respiratory virus, healthcare professionals may not routinely consider or test for HMPV. However, healthcare professionals should consider HMPV testing during winter and spring, especially when HMPV is commonly circulating. Infection with HMPV can be confirmed usually by Currently, there is no specific antiviral therapy to treat HMPV and no vaccine to prevent HMPV. Medical care is supportive.

It is a seasonal disease that usually occurs in the winter and early spring, similar to RSV and the flu. Anyone can be infected with hMPV but it is most common in children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. It spreads through close contact with an infected person and, in most cases, will go away on its own after a few days. People with hMPV usually have mild symptoms similar to a cold, but young children, older adults and those with a weakened immune system may develop a more severe illness. Most hMPV infections only last about 2-5 days and go away on their own. Treatment consists of supportive care to ease symptoms. Many times, patients with severe hMPV are very young, so they rely on a caregiver to talk to their doctor. Here are some questions to ask on their behalf.

                "content": "Human metapneumovirus (HMPV or hMPV) is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family Pneumoviridae[1] and is closely related to the Avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) subgroup C. It was isolated for the first time in 2001 in the Netherlands by using the RAP-PCR (RNA arbitrarily primed PCR) technique for identification of unknown viruses growing in cultured cells.[2] As of 2016, it was the second most common cause (after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)) of acute respiratory tract illness in otherwise-healthy children under the age of 5 in a large US outpatient clinic.[3] The peak age of hospitalization for infants with HMPV occurs between 6–12 months of age, slightly older than the peak of RSV, which is around 2–3 months. The clinical features and severity of HMPV are similar to those of RSV. HMPV is also an important cause of disease in older adults and infants. As of January 2025[update], an outbreak of HMPV is in progress in China.[4] Human metapneumovirus was first discovered in 2001 in the Netherlands by Bernadette G. van den Hoogen and her colleagues.[6][7][8][9] HMPV was first detected in the respiratory secretions of 28 young children in the Netherlands and had initially stood out from other common respiratory viruses because the testing methods van den Hoogen et al. had tried using (immunological assays using virus-specific antibodies and PCR-based methods using virus genome-specific primers) were only able to test for known respiratory viruses and, therefore, were unable to identify the novel virus.[6] It was not until researchers began applying molecular biology techniques that the genetic characteristics and portions of the genomic sequences of the virus could be identified; these techniques included the randomly primed PCR technique which obtained the limited sequence data needed to reveal a clear relationship between this new virus and the avian pneumovirus.[6] It was this close relationship to AMPV that gave rise to this new virus being named human metapneumovirus[6] to reflect both its identity as a metapneumovirus and its use of humans as a host organism. HMPV was responsible for 12% of cases of acute respiratory tract illness in otherwise-healthy children in a US outpatient clinic[3] and 15% and 8% of cases (respectively) of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in children under and over the age of 5 in the United States in 2010–2012.[10] The virus is distributed worldwide and, in temperate regions, has a seasonal distribution generally following that of RSV and influenza virus during late winter and spring.[3][11] Serologic studies have shown that by the age of five, virtually all children worldwide have been exposed to the virus.[2][12][13][14] Despite near universal infection during early life, reinfections are common in older children and adults.[3][15][13][16] Human metapneumovirus may cause mild upper respiratory tract infection (the common cold). However, premature infants,[17] immunocompromised persons,[18][19][20][21] and older adults >65 years [16][22][23] are at risk for severe disease and hospitalization. In some studies of hospitalizations and emergency room visits, HMPV is nearly as common and as severe as influenza in older adults.[16][22][23][24] HMPV is associated with more severe disease in people with asthma[25][26][27][28] and adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).[29][30][31] Numerous outbreaks of HMPV have been reported in long-term care facilities for children and adults, causing fatalities.[32][33][34][35][36] The genomic organisation of HMPV is similar to RSV; however, HMPV lacks the non-structural genes, NS1 and NS2, and the HMPV antisense RNA genome contains eight open reading frames in slightly different gene order than RSV (viz. 3’-N-P-M-F-M2-SH-G-L-5’).[37] HMPV is genetically similar to the avian metapneumoviruses A, B and in particular type C. Phylogenetic analysis of HMPV has demonstrated the existence of two main genetic lineages termed subtype A and B containing within them the subgroups A1/A2 and B1/B2 respectively. Genotyping based on sequences of the F and G genes showed that subtype B was associated with increased cough duration and increased general respiratory systems compared to HMPV-A.[38] hMPV is estimated to have a 3–6 day incubation period and is often most active during the later winter and spring seasons in temperate climates, overlapping with the RSV and influenza seasons and possibly allowing for repeated infection.[7] As of 2012[update], hMPV and its replication cycle were not well understood. Some of the principal steps of hMPV's replication cycle were studied with experiments based on the viral life cycles and reproductive measures of the rest of the Paramyxoviridae family.[39] The first step of the hMPV replication cycle is attachment to the host cell, specifically the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, using the G protein.[9][39] This G protein contains a hydrophobic region that acts as an uncleaved signal peptide and a membrane anchor to facilitate its binding; however, because recombinant viruses that lack the G protein have still been able to replicate in vitro and in vivo, it seems that attachment via the G protein is not required for rest of the replication cycle.[9] Next in the cycle is the fusion of the viral and host membranes which is likely mediated by the F protein.[9][39] Though the fusion mechanism is very similar to that of other Paramyxoviridae family members and involves conformational changes of the F protein, the mechanism for hMPV does not depend on the G protein for fusion like its family members, showing consistency with the previously mentioned idea that the G protein is not necessary for subsequent steps of the hMPV replication cycle.[9][39] Moreover, the fusion function of the F protein has been proven by its ability to bind to host cells via integrin αvβ1 using an Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) motif, which is speculated to be the trigger for membrane fusion events.[9] One main difference between hMPV and other Paramyxoviridae viruses' fusion mechanisms though is that hMPV's fusion events occur at acidic pH levels while other viruses' fusion events occur at neutral pH levels; however, more research needs to be conducted in this area to get a better understanding of what is different about the hMPV fusion mechanism and why.[39] Although its specific function is uncertain, the presence of the SH glycoprotein does not appear to have any effects on replication kinetics, cytopathic effects, or plaque formation of hMPV.[39] After fusion, the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) containing negative-sense viral RNA (vRNA) genome is released into the cytoplasm and acts as a template for mRNA and antigenomic cRNA synthesis.[9] From here, most of our knowledge about hMPV transcription is derived from what we already know about RSV and other Paramyxoviridae viruses, including that leader and trailer sequences in the genome are partially complementary and act as promoters for transcription.[9] We see that proteins N, P, and L dissociate from the vRNA and bind to each other to form the polymerase complex so that the genomic RNA can act as a matrix for viral transcription and replication in the cytoplasm.[39] The final step in the replication process of hMPV that is relatively certain is the journeying of the envelope glycoproteins (F, G, and SH) to zones of membranous accumulation via the Golgi apparatus to be exposed at the surface of infected cells.[39] This allows infected cells to merge with adjacent cells through the action of viral fusion proteins on the surface, effectively spreading the virus's genome.[39] The rest of the replication cycle following RNA and viral protein synthesis are unclear and require further research.[9] HMPV infects airway epithelial cells in the nose and lung. HMPV is thought to attach to the target cell via the glycoprotein (G) protein interactions with heparan sulfate and other glycosaminoglycans. The HMPV fusion (F) protein encodes an RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif that engages RGD-binding integrins as cellular receptors,[40][41][42][43] then mediates fusion of the cell membrane and viral envelope in a pH-independent fashion, likely within endosomes.[44][45] HMPV then induces the response of chemokines and cytokines such as IL-6, IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha, IL-2, and macrophage inflammatory proteins, which in turn leads to peribronchiolar and perivascular infiltration and inflammation.[46] The identification of HMPV has predominantly relied on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology to amplify directly from RNA extracted from respiratory specimens. Alternative more cost-effective approaches to the detection of HMPV by nucleic acid-based approaches have been employed and these include: Though hMPV was first discovered and identified in 2001, serological studies showed that hMPV, or a close relative of it, had already been circulating for at least 50 years.[6][47] From this information, it is clear that the virus had not just \"jumped\" from birds, or some other animal reservoir, to humans shortly before its discovery.[6] As of 2022[update], peak infection from hMPV in the northern hemisphere is in late winter and early spring, but it can be found globally across all continents[47] and its distribution is very complex and dynamic.[6] Researchers have found that hMPV is mostly localized and can differ significantly from community to community, allowing for the possibility of the strain in one location one year to be most similar to the strain in a different location the next year.[6] This phenomenon has actually been recorded with the virus strains in Australia in 2001; in France in 2000 and 2002; in Canada in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002; in Israel in 2002; and in the Netherlands in 2001 all being very closely related based on their F gene sequences.[6] There are at least two major genotypes of hMPV (A and B) that circulate during community outbreaks and each genotype has two of its own,[6] but as of now, it seems that no one strain is dominant over the others and none of them are known to cause varying levels of severity.[47] HMPV is most likely spread from infected individuals to others through 1. secretions from coughing and sneezing, 2. close personal contact (ex. touching, shaking hands, etc), and 3. touching objects with viruses on them then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.[7] As of 2023[update], development of a reliable antiviral therapy treatment or vaccine to prevent the spread of hMPV has yet to occur, but there does seem to be promising developments in that area.[6][7] In some vaccine trials, researchers have observed how a live recombinant human parainfluenza virus that contains the hMPV F gene can induce hMPV-specific antibodies and can protect experimental animals from hMPV.[6] Another similar study demonstrated how a chimeric bovine/human parainfluenza virus 3 expressing the hMPV F gene allows for neutralizing antibodies against both parainfluenza and hMPV.[6] These experiments have several limitations, including their small-population animal models.[6] Overall, while vaccines and antiviral therapy treatments are in the works, the biggest difficulty that researchers face as of 2006[update] is the limited data available about the development of hMPV in the natural host.[6] There are no conclusive studies as of 2003[update]; however, it is likely that transmission occurs by contact with contaminated secretions, via droplet, aerosol, or fomite vectors. Hospital-acquired infections with human metapneumovirus have been reported.[48] HMPV has been shown to circulate during fall and winter months with alternating predominance of a single subtype each year.[38] No treatment for humans is known as of 2008[update].[49] Ribavirin showed effectiveness in an animal model.[50] American pharmaceutical corporation Moderna conducted a clinical trial for a candidate modRNA vaccine against metapneumovirus.[51] As of October 2019, the vaccine candidate had passed through phase I, with reports that the vaccine is well-tolerated at all dose levels at two months, and provokes an immune response which boosts the production of neutralising antibodies.[52] Human metapneumovirus was first reported in 2001 and avian metapneumovirus in the 1970s. There are at least four lineages of human metapneumovirus—A1, A2, B1 and B2. Avian metapneumovirus has been divided into four subgroups—A, B, C and D. Bayesian estimates suggest that human metapneumovirus emerged 119–133 years ago and diverged from avian metapneumovirus around 1800.[53] The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published data showing that respiratory infections had risen significantly in the week of 16 to 22 December 2024;[54] human metapneumovirus was linked to 6.2 percent of positive respiratory illness tests and 5.4 percent of respiratory-illness hospitalizations in China, more than COVID-19, rhinovirus or adenovirus.[55] Kan Biao, head of the China CDC's National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, announced that the rate of HMPV among children ages 14 and under was on the rise in China.[56] Countries like Malaysia, Hong Kong, and India have also confirmed cases of HMPV infection. Government in countries does not take any actions as it doesn't find the virus dangerous. [57][58][59]",

                "content": "Human metapneumovirus, also known as HMPV, is a type of common respiratory virus. It belongs to a family of viruses called pneumoviridae – the same group the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) belongs to. If you have HMPV, you might have mild cold-like symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, a runny nose, or a sore throat for a few days. In rare cases, you might have more serious symptoms, especially if you have a weakened immune system or other risk factors. Anyone can get it, but it's more common in those who are very young or older. Dutch scientists discovered it over 20 years ago. But research now shows it's been the source of respiratory infections around the world for more than 50 years. Most people have human metapneumovirus (HMPV) before the age of 5. HMPV can be more serious in babies younger than 6 months, people older than 65, or those with a weakened immune system. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images) It's very common. In fact, research shows that most people are likely to have an infection at least once before age 5. You can be infected multiple times in your life. In children, human metapneumovirus makes up about 1 in 10 of all respiratory infections. Anyone can get HMPV, but some groups are more at risk. While anyone can get HMPV, those at higher risk are: Like any virus, human metapneumovirus is contagious, which means you can get it if you come in contact with someone who's been infected. It’s also seasonal. This means that in the U.S., you’re more likely to get HMPV during winter or early spring months – around the same time as flu season. The virus largely spreads when you come in close contact with an infected person. You might become exposed to the virus if you: Once human metapneumovirus enters your body, the incubation period – the time between exposure to the first signs of symptoms – is three to six days. Most HMPV symptoms are mild. They can include: These usually go away in two to five days. But they can worsen and cause serious health issues in some cases. Adults with other health issues or a compromised immune system can sometimes get a severe middle ear infection with human metapneumovirus. If your symptoms last more than two weeks or become severe, let your doctor know. A small number of people can have more serious HMPV symptoms, such as: Babies under 1 may have a hard time feeding properly. Studies show that HMPV infections make up about 5% to 10% of hospitalizations among children. Data shows that up to 16% of them may get a serious complication, like pneumonia. If you notice serious symptoms, tell your doctor or seek medical care right away. You might need to be hospitalized so that doctors can closely monitor your symptoms. Human metapneumovirus and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses with similar symptoms – a runny nose, coughing, a fever, congestion, a sore throat, and shortness of breath. They spread in similar ways too. In their most serious forms, both can lead to hospitalization. But unlike COVID-19, there isn't antiviral therapy or a vaccine to treat HMPV. HMPV is a seasonal virus, typically appearing in winter and spring, as opposed to COVID-19, which can sometimes circulate year-round due to the development of new variants. Studies have shown that incidences of HMPV increased three-fold in certain countries after the COVID-19 pandemic. When COVID-19 prevention measures were in full effect, people were less exposed to all types of respiratory illnesses. After these measures eased, respiratory illnesses like HMPV surged. Typically, your doctor will do a detailed physical exam and ask you about your personal and family medical histories. They may take swabs from your nose, mouth, or throat. They might order a lab test called a rapid antigen test or PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to check for the virus. If you, or your child, has severe symptoms, your doctor may do a bronchoscopy. In that procedure, they insert a thin tube with a camera on its tip through your throat. They use that to collect a fluid sample to check for the virus. There’s no specific treatment or cure. Since most symptoms are mild and go away on their own, you’ll just need supportive care to manage your symptoms while you get well. To help ease your symptoms in the meantime, you can: Your doctor may also prescribe a steroid like prednisone to help with inflammation. There's no vaccine to prevent HMPV. But since it spreads through close contact, there are some ways to help protect yourself and avoid infection. You can lower the risk to yourself and others by: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a virus that causes cold-like respiratory symptoms. Most people get HMPV before the age of 5, and the symptoms are typically mild. But babies under 12 months, adults over 65, and those with weakened immunity have a risk of getting a more serious illness. HMPV is part of the same virus family as RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), but they are not the same. How long are you contagious with human metapneumovirus? HMPV takes about three to six days to develop, and symptoms last about as long as other mild respiratory viruses, from two to seven days. Can you get HMPV twice? Yes, you can get it more than once, but symptoms are typically milder after your first bout with it. How do you get tested for human metapneumovirus? Unless symptoms are serious, you usually aren't tested for HMPV. If you are tested, you doctor typically gets a sample by swabbing your nose or throat. Sometimes your doctor might order a chest X-ray or bronchoscopy. How long does it take to recover from HMPV? If you don't have a serious case, it usually takes a couple of days to a week to recover from HMPV. Symptoms like coughing may last a bit longer. Call your doctor if your symptoms, or your child's, don't get better after a few days, or if a fever lasts for more than three days.

                "title": "Ben Jonson - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Benjamin Jonson (c. 11 June 1572 – 18 August [O.S. 6 August] 1637) was an English playwright and poet. Jonson's artistry exerted a lasting influence on English poetry and stage comedy. He popularised the comedy of humours; he is best known for the satirical plays Every Man in His Humour (1598), Volpone, or The Fox (c. 1606), The Alchemist (1610) and Bartholomew Fair (1614) and for his lyric and epigrammatic poetry.[1] He is regarded as \"the second most important English dramatist, after William Shakespeare, during the reign of James I.\"[2] Jonson was a classically educated, well-read and cultured man of the English Renaissance with an appetite for controversy (personal and political, artistic and intellectual) whose cultural influence was of unparalleled breadth upon the playwrights and the poets of the Jacobean era (1603–1625) and of the Caroline era (1625–1642).[3][4] Jonson was born in June 1572[5]—possibly on the 11th[2][6][7]—in or near London. In midlife, Jonson said his paternal grandfather, who \"served King Henry 8 and was a gentleman\",[7] was a member of the extended Johnston family of Annandale in the Dumfries and Galloway, a genealogy that is attested by the three spindles (rhombi) in the Jonson family coat of arms: one spindle is a diamond-shaped heraldic device used by the Johnston family. His ancestors spelt the family name with a letter \"t\" (Johnstone or Johnstoun). While the spelling had eventually changed to the more common \"Johnson\", the playwright's own particular preference became \"Jonson\".[8] Jonson's father lost his property, was imprisoned, and, as a Protestant, suffered forfeiture under Queen Mary. Becoming a clergyman upon his release, he died a month before his son's birth.[7] His widow married a master bricklayer two years later.[9][10] Jonson attended school in St Martin's Lane in London.[1] Later, a family friend paid for his studies at Westminster School, where the antiquarian, historian, topographer and officer of arms William Camden (1551–1623) was one of his masters. The pupil and master became friends, and the intellectual influence of Camden's broad-ranging scholarship upon Jonson's art and literary style remained notable, until Camden's death in 1623. At Westminster School he met the Welsh poet Hugh Holland, with whom he established an \"enduring relationship\".[11] Both of them would write preliminary poems for William Shakespeare's First Folio (1623). On leaving Westminster School in 1589, Jonson attended St John's College, Cambridge, to continue his book learning. However, because of his unwilled apprenticeship to his bricklayer stepfather, he returned after a month.[3][9] According to the churchman and historian Thomas Fuller (1608–61), Jonson at this time built a garden wall in Lincoln's Inn. After having been an apprentice bricklayer, Jonson went to the Netherlands and volunteered to soldier with the English regiments of Sir Francis Vere (1560–1609) in Flanders. England was allied with the Dutch in their fight for independence as well as the ongoing war with Spain. The Hawthornden Manuscripts (1619), of the conversations between Ben Jonson and the poet William Drummond of Hawthornden[1] (1585–1649), report that, when in Flanders, Jonson engaged, fought and killed an enemy soldier in single combat, and took for trophies the weapons of the vanquished soldier.[12] Johnson is reputed to have visited the antiquary Sir Robert Cotton at a residence of his in Chester early in the 17th century.[13] After his military activity on the Continent, Jonson returned to England and worked as an actor and as a playwright. As an actor, he was the protagonist \"Hieronimo\" (Geronimo) in the play The Spanish Tragedy (c. 1586), by Thomas Kyd (1558–94), the first revenge tragedy in English literature. By 1597, he was a working playwright employed by Philip Henslowe, the leading producer for the English public theatre; by the next year, the production of Every Man in His Humour (1598) had established Jonson's reputation as a dramatist.[14][15] Jonson described his wife to William Drummond as \"a shrew, yet honest\". The identity of Jonson's wife is obscure, though she sometimes is identified as \"Ann Lewis\", the woman who married a Benjamin Jonson in 1594, at the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr, near London Bridge.[16] The registers of St Martin-in-the-Fields record that Mary Jonson, their eldest daughter, died in November 1593, at six months of age. A decade later, in 1603, Benjamin Jonson, their eldest son, died of bubonic plague when he was seven years old, upon which Jonson wrote the elegiac \"On My First Sonne\" (1603). A second son, also named Benjamin Jonson, died in 1635.[17] During that period[clarification needed], Jonson and his wife lived separate lives for five years; Jonson enjoyed the residential hospitality of his patrons, Esme Stuart, 3rd Duke of Lennox and 7th Seigneur d'Aubigny and Sir Robert Townshend.[16] By summer 1597, Jonson had a fixed engagement in the Admiral's Men, then performing under Philip Henslowe's management at The Rose.[1] John Aubrey reports, on uncertain authority, that Jonson was not successful as an actor; whatever his skills as an actor, he was more valuable to the company as a writer.[18] By this time Jonson had begun to write original plays for the Admiral's Men; in 1598 he was mentioned by Francis Meres in his Palladis Tamia as one of \"the best for tragedy.\"[1] None of his early tragedies survive, however. An undated comedy, The Case is Altered, may be his earliest surviving play.[19] In 1597, a play which he co-wrote with Thomas Nashe, The Isle of Dogs, was suppressed after causing great offence. Arrest warrants for Jonson and Nashe were issued by Queen Elizabeth I's so-called interrogator, Richard Topcliffe. Jonson was jailed in Marshalsea Prison and charged with \"Leude and mutynous behaviour\", while Nashe managed to escape to Great Yarmouth. Two of the actors, Gabriel Spenser and Robert Shaw, were also imprisoned. A year later, Jonson was again briefly imprisoned, this time in Newgate Prison, for killing Gabriel Spenser in a duel on 22 September 1598 in Hogsden Fields[12] (today part of Hoxton). Tried on a charge of manslaughter, Jonson pleaded guilty but was released by benefit of clergy,[1] a legal ploy through which he gained leniency by reciting a brief Bible verse (the neck-verse), forfeiting his \"goods and chattels\" and being branded with the so-called Tyburn T on his left thumb.[1] While in jail Jonson converted to Catholicism, possibly through the influence of fellow-prisoner Father Thomas Wright, a Jesuit priest.[7] In 1598 Jonson produced his first great success, Every Man in His Humour, capitalising on the vogue for humorous plays which George Chapman had begun with An Humorous Day's Mirth. William Shakespeare was among the first actors to be cast. Jonson followed this in 1599 with Every Man out of His Humour, a pedantic attempt to imitate Aristophanes.[non sequitur] It is not known whether this was a success on stage, but when published it proved popular and went through several editions.[citation needed] Jonson's other work for the theatre in the last years of Elizabeth I's reign was marked by fighting and controversy. Cynthia's Revels was produced by the Children of the Chapel Royal at Blackfriars Theatre in 1600. It satirised both John Marston, who Jonson believed had accused him of lustfulness in Histriomastix, and Thomas Dekker. Jonson attacked the two poets again in Poetaster (1601). Dekker responded with Satiromastix, subtitled \"the untrussing of the humorous poet\".[1] The final scene of this play, while certainly not to be taken at face value as a portrait of Jonson, offers a caricature that is recognisable from Drummond's report – boasting about himself and condemning other poets, criticising performances of his plays and calling attention to himself in any available way.[citation needed] This \"War of the Theatres\" appears to have ended with reconciliation on all sides. Jonson collaborated with Dekker on a pageant welcoming James I to England in 1603 although Drummond reports that Jonson called Dekker a rogue. Marston dedicated The Malcontent to Jonson and the two collaborated with Chapman on Eastward Ho!, a 1605 play whose anti-Scottish sentiment briefly landed both Jonson and Chapman in jail.[20] At the beginning of the English reign of James VI and I in 1603 Jonson joined other poets and playwrights in welcoming the new king. Jonson quickly adapted himself to the additional demand for masques and entertainments introduced with the new reign and fostered by both the king and his consort[1] Anne of Denmark. In addition to his popularity on the public stage and in the royal hall, he enjoyed the patronage of aristocrats such as Elizabeth Sidney (daughter of Sir Philip Sidney) and Lady Mary Wroth. This connection with the Sidney family provided the impetus for one of Jonson's most famous lyrics, the country house poem To Penshurst. In February 1603 John Manningham reported that Jonson was living on Robert Townsend, son of Sir Roger Townshend, and \"scorns the world.\"[21] Perhaps this explains why his trouble with English authorities continued. That same year he was questioned by the Privy Council about Sejanus, a politically themed play about corruption in the Roman Empire. He was again in trouble for topical allusions in a play, now lost, in which he took part. Shortly after his release from a brief spell of imprisonment imposed to mark the authorities' displeasure at the work, in the second week of October 1605, he was present at a supper party attended by most of the Gunpowder Plot conspirators. After the plot's discovery, he appears to have avoided further imprisonment; he volunteered what he knew of the affair to the investigator Robert Cecil and the Privy Council. Father Thomas Wright, who heard Fawkes's confession, was known to Jonson from prison in 1598 and Cecil may have directed him to bring the priest before the council, as a witness.[7] At the same time, Jonson pursued a more prestigious career, writing masques for James's court. The Satyr (1603) and The Masque of Blackness (1605) are two of about two dozen masques which Jonson wrote for James or for Queen Anne, some of them performed at Apethorpe Palace when the King was in residence. The Masque of Blackness was praised by Algernon Charles Swinburne as the consummate example of this now-extinct genre, which mingled speech, dancing and spectacle. On many of these projects, he collaborated, not always peacefully, with designer Inigo Jones. For example, Jones designed the scenery for Jonson's masque Oberon, the Faery Prince performed at Whitehall on 1 January 1611 in which Prince Henry, eldest son of James I, appeared in the title role. Perhaps partly as a result of this new career, Jonson gave up writing plays for the public theatres for a decade. He later told Drummond that he had made less than two hundred pounds on all his plays together. In 1616 Jonson received a yearly pension of 100 marks (about £60), leading some to identify him as England's first Poet Laureate. This sign of royal favour may have encouraged him to publish the first volume of the folio-collected edition of his works that year.[1] Other volumes followed in 1640–41 and 1692. (See: Ben Jonson folios) On 8 July 1618 Jonson set out from Bishopsgate in London to walk to Edinburgh, arriving in Scotland's capital on 17 September. For the most part he followed the Great North Road, and was treated to lavish and enthusiastic welcomes in both towns and country houses.[22] On his arrival he lodged initially with John Stuart, a cousin of King James, in Leith, and was made an honorary burgess of Edinburgh at a dinner laid on by the city on 26 September.[22] He stayed in Scotland until late January 1619, and the best-remembered hospitality he enjoyed was that of the Scottish poet, William Drummond of Hawthornden,[1] sited on the River Esk. Drummond undertook to record as much of Jonson's conversation as he could in his diary, and thus recorded aspects of Jonson's personality that would otherwise have been less clearly seen. Jonson delivers his opinions, in Drummond's terse reporting, in an expansive and even magisterial mood. Drummond noted he was \"a great lover and praiser of himself, a contemner and scorner of others\".[1] On returning to England, he was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from Oxford University. The period between 1605 and 1620 may be viewed as Jonson's heyday. By 1616 he had produced all the plays on which his present reputation as a dramatist is based, including the tragedy Catiline (acted and printed 1611), which achieved limited success[1] and the comedies Volpone (acted 1605 and printed in 1607), Epicoene, or the Silent Woman (1609), The Alchemist (1610), Bartholomew Fair (1614) and The Devil Is an Ass (1616).[1] The Alchemist and Volpone were immediately successful. Of Epicoene, Jonson told Drummond of a satirical verse which reported that the play's subtitle was appropriate since its audience had refused to applaud the play (i.e., remained silent). Yet Epicoene, along with Bartholomew Fair and (to a lesser extent) The Devil is an Ass have in modern times achieved a certain degree of recognition. While his life during this period was apparently more settled than it had been in the 1590s, his financial security was still not assured. Jonson recounted that his father had been a prosperous Protestant landowner until the reign of \"Bloody Mary\" and had suffered imprisonment and the forfeiture of his wealth during that monarch's attempt to restore England to Catholicism. On Elizabeth's accession, he had been freed and had been able to travel to London to become a clergyman.[23][24] (All that is known of Jonson's father, who died a month before his son was born, comes from the poet's own narrative.) Jonson's elementary education was in a small church school attached to St Martin-in-the-Fields parish, and at the age of about seven he secured a place at Westminster School, then part of Westminster Abbey. Notwithstanding this emphatically Protestant grounding, Jonson maintained an interest in Catholic doctrine throughout his adult life and, at a particularly perilous time while a religious war with Spain was widely expected and persecution of Catholics was intensifying, he converted to the faith.[25][26] This took place in October 1598, while Jonson was on remand in Newgate Gaol charged with manslaughter. Jonson's biographer Ian Donaldson is among those who suggest that the conversion was instigated by Father Thomas Wright, a Jesuit priest who had resigned from the order over his acceptance of Queen Elizabeth's right to rule in England.[27][28] Wright, although placed under house arrest on the orders of Lord Burghley, was permitted to minister to the inmates of London prisons.[27] It may have been that Jonson, fearing that his trial would go against him, was seeking the unequivocal absolution that Catholicism could offer if he were sentenced to death.[26] Alternatively, he could have been looking to personal advantage from accepting conversion since Father Wright's protector, the Earl of Essex, was among those who might hope to rise to influence after the succession of a new monarch.[29] Jonson's conversion came at a weighty time in affairs of state; the royal succession, from the childless Elizabeth, had not been settled and Essex's Catholic allies were hopeful that a sympathetic ruler might attain the throne. Conviction, and certainly not expedience alone, sustained Jonson's faith during the troublesome twelve years he remained a Catholic. His stance received attention beyond the low-level intolerance to which most followers of that faith were exposed. The first draft of his play Sejanus His Fall was banned for \"popery\", and did not re-appear until some offending passages were cut.[7] In January 1606 he (with Anne, his wife) appeared before the Consistory Court in London to answer a charge of recusancy, with Jonson alone additionally accused of allowing his fame as a Catholic to \"seduce\" citizens to the cause.[30] This was a serious matter (the Gunpowder Plot was still fresh in people's minds) but he explained that his failure to take communion was only because he had not found sound theological endorsement for the practice, and by paying a fine of thirteen shillings (156 pence) he escaped the more serious penalties at the authorities' disposal. His habit was to slip outside during the sacrament, a common routine at the time—indeed it was one followed by the royal consort, Queen Anne of Denmark, herself—to show political loyalty while not offending the conscience.[31] Leading church figures, including John Overall, Dean of St Paul's, were tasked with winning Jonson back to Protestantism, but these overtures were resisted.[32] In May 1610 Henry IV of France was assassinated, purportedly in the name of the Pope; he had been a Catholic monarch respected in England for tolerance towards Protestants, and his murder seems to have been the immediate cause of Jonson's decision to rejoin the Church of England.[33][34] He did this in flamboyant style, pointedly drinking a full chalice of communion wine at the eucharist to demonstrate his renunciation of the Catholic rite, in which the priest alone drinks the wine.[35][36] The exact date of the ceremony is unknown.[34] However, his interest in Catholic belief and practice remained with him until his death.[37] Jonson's productivity began to decline in the 1620s, but he remained well-known. In that time, the Sons of Ben or the \"Tribe of Ben\", those younger poets such as Robert Herrick, Richard Lovelace, and Sir John Suckling who took their bearing in verse from Jonson, rose to prominence. However, a series of setbacks drained his strength and damaged his reputation. He resumed writing regular plays in the 1620s, but these are not considered among his best. They are of significant interest, however, for their portrayal of Charles I's England. The Staple of News, for example, offers a remarkable look at the earliest stage of English journalism. The lukewarm reception given that play was, however, nothing compared to the dismal failure of The New Inn; the cold reception given this play prompted Jonson to write a poem condemning his audience (An Ode to Himself), which in turn prompted Thomas Carew, one of the \"Tribe of Ben\", to respond in a poem that asks Jonson to recognise his own decline.[38] The principal factor in Jonson's partial eclipse was, however, the death of James and the accession of King Charles I in 1625. Jonson felt neglected by the new court. A decisive quarrel with Jones harmed his career as a writer of court masques, although he continued to entertain the court on an irregular basis. For his part, Charles displayed a certain degree of care for the great poet of his father's day: he increased Jonson's annual pension to £100 and included a tierce of wine and beer. Despite the strokes that he suffered in the 1620s, Jonson continued to write. At his death in 1637 he seems to have been working on another play, The Sad Shepherd. Though only two acts are extant, this represents a remarkable new direction for Jonson: a move into pastoral drama. During the early 1630s, he also conducted a correspondence with James Howell, who warned him about disfavour at court in the wake of his dispute with Jones. According to a contemporary letter written by Edward Thelwall of Gray's Inn, Jonson died on 18 August 1637[39] (O.S. 6 August).[40] He died in London.[6] His funeral was held the next day. It was attended by \"all or the greatest part of the nobility then in town\".[21][7] He is buried in the north aisle of the nave in Westminster Abbey, with the inscription \"O Rare Ben Johnson [sic]\" set in the slab over his grave.[1][41] John Aubrey, in a more meticulous record than usual, notes that a passer-by, John Young of Great Milton, Oxfordshire, saw the bare grave marker and on impulse paid a workman eighteen pence to make the inscription. Another theory suggests that the tribute came from William Davenant, Jonson's successor as Poet Laureate (and card-playing companion of Young), as the same phrase appears on Davenant's nearby gravestone, but essayist Leigh Hunt contends that Davenant's wording represented no more than Young's coinage, cheaply re-used.[41][42] The fact that Jonson was buried in an upright position was an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death,[43] although it has also been written that he asked for a grave exactly 18 inches square from the monarch and received an upright grave to fit in the requested space.[44][45] It has been pointed out that the inscription could be read \"Orare Ben Jonson\" (pray for Ben Jonson), possibly in an allusion to Jonson's acceptance of Catholic doctrine during his lifetime (although he had returned to the Church of England); the carving shows a distinct space between \"O\" and \"rare\".[7][46][47] A monument to Jonson was erected in about 1723 by the Earl of Oxford and is in the eastern aisle of Westminster Abbey's Poets' Corner.[48] It includes a portrait medallion and the same inscription as on the gravestone. It seems Jonson was to have had a monument erected by subscription soon after his death but the English Civil War intervened.[49] Apart from two tragedies, Sejanus and Catiline, that largely failed to impress Renaissance audiences, Jonson's work for the public theatres was in comedy. These plays vary in some respects. The minor early plays, particularly those written for boy players, present somewhat looser plots and less-developed characters than those written later, for adult companies. Already in the plays which were his salvos in the Poets' War, he displays the keen eye for absurdity and hypocrisy that marks his best-known plays; in these early efforts, however, the plot mostly takes second place to a variety of incident and comic set-pieces. They are, also, notably ill-tempered. Thomas Davies called Poetaster \"a contemptible mixture of the serio-comic, where the names of Augustus Caesar, Maecenas, Virgil, Horace, Ovid and Tibullus, are all sacrificed upon the altar of private resentment\". Another early comedy in a different vein, The Case is Altered, is markedly similar to Shakespeare's romantic comedies in its foreign setting, emphasis on genial wit and love-plot. Henslowe's diary indicates that Jonson had a hand in numerous other plays, including many in genres such as English history with which he is not otherwise associated. The comedies of his middle career, from Eastward Hoe to The Devil Is an Ass are for the most part city comedy, with a London setting, themes of trickery and money, and a distinct moral ambiguity, despite Jonson's professed aim in the Prologue to Volpone to \"mix profit with your pleasure\". His late plays or \"dotages\", particularly The Magnetic Lady and The Sad Shepherd, exhibit signs of an accommodation with the romantic tendencies of Elizabethan comedy. Within this general progression, however, Jonson's comic style remained constant and easily recognisable. He announces his programme in the prologue to the folio version of Every Man in His Humour: he promises to represent \"deeds, and language, such as men do use\". He planned to write comedies that revived the classical premises of Elizabethan dramatic theory—or rather, since all but the loosest English comedies could claim some descent from Plautus and Terence, he intended to apply those premises with rigour.[50] This commitment entailed negations: after The Case is Altered, Jonson eschewed distant locations, noble characters, romantic plots and other staples of Elizabethan comedy, focusing instead on the satiric and realistic inheritance of new comedy. He set his plays in contemporary settings, peopled them with recognisable types, and set them to actions that, if not strictly realistic, involved everyday motives such as greed and jealousy. In accordance with the temper of his age, he was often so broad in his characterisation that many of his most famous scenes border on the farcical (as William Congreve, for example, judged Epicoene). He was more diligent in adhering to the classical unities than many of his peers—although as Margaret Cavendish noted, the unity of action in the major comedies was rather compromised by Jonson's abundance of incident. To this classical model, Jonson applied the two features of his style which save his classical imitations from mere pedantry: the vividness with which he depicted the lives of his characters and the intricacy of his plots. Coleridge, for instance, claimed that The Alchemist had one of the three most perfect plots in literature. Jonson's poetry, like his drama, is informed by his classical learning. Some of his better-known poems are close translations of Greek or Roman models; all display the careful attention to form and style that often came naturally to those trained in classics in the humanist manner. Jonson largely avoided the debates about rhyme and meter that had consumed Elizabethan classicists such as Thomas Campion and Gabriel Harvey. Accepting both rhyme and stress, Jonson used them to mimic the classical qualities of simplicity, restraint and precision. \"Epigrams\" (published in the 1616 folio) is an entry in a genre that was popular among late-Elizabethan and Jacobean audiences, although Jonson was perhaps the only poet of his time to work in its full classical range. The epigrams explore various attitudes, most from the satiric stock of the day: complaints against women, courtiers and spies abound. The condemnatory poems are short and anonymous; Jonson's epigrams of praise, including a famous poem to Camden and lines to Lucy Harington, are longer and are mostly addressed to specific individuals. Although it is included among the epigrams, \"On My First Sonne\" is neither satirical nor very short; the poem, intensely personal and deeply felt, typifies a genre that would come to be called \"lyric poetry.\" It is possible that the spelling of 'son' as 'Sonne' is meant to allude to the sonnet form, with which it shares some features. A few other so-called epigrams share this quality. Jonson's poems of \"The Forest\" also appeared in the first folio. Most of the fifteen poems are addressed to Jonson's aristocratic supporters, but the most famous are his country-house poem \"To Penshurst\" and the poem \"To Celia\" (\"Come, my Celia, let us prove\") that appears also in Volpone. Underwood, published in the expanded folio of 1640, is a larger and more heterogeneous group of poems. It contains A Celebration of Charis, Jonson's most extended effort at love poetry; various religious pieces; encomiastic poems including the poem to Shakespeare and a sonnet on Mary Wroth; the Execration against Vulcan[51] and others. The 1640 volume also contains three elegies which have often been ascribed to Donne (one of them appeared in Donne's posthumous collected poems). There are many legends about Jonson's rivalry with Shakespeare. William Drummond reports that during their conversation, Jonson scoffed at two apparent absurdities in Shakespeare's plays: a nonsensical line in Julius Caesar and the setting of The Winter's Tale on the non-existent seacoast of Bohemia. Drummond also reported Jonson as saying that Shakespeare \"wanted art\" (i.e., lacked skill).[52] In \"De Shakespeare Nostrat\" in Timber, which was published posthumously and reflects his lifetime of practical experience, Jonson offers a fuller and more conciliatory comment. He recalls being told by certain actors that Shakespeare never blotted (i.e., crossed out) a line when he wrote. His own claimed response was \"Would he had blotted a thousand!\"[a] However, Jonson explains, \"Hee was (indeed) honest, and of an open, and free nature: had an excellent Phantsie; brave notions and gentle expressions: wherein hee flow'd with that facility, that sometime it was necessary he should be stopp'd\".[54] Jonson concludes that \"there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned.\" When Shakespeare died, he said, \"He was not of an age, but for all time.\"[55] Thomas Fuller relates stories of Jonson and Shakespeare engaging in debates in the Mermaid Tavern; Fuller imagines conversations in which Shakespeare would run rings around the more learned but more ponderous Jonson. That the two men knew each other personally is beyond doubt, not only because of the tone of Jonson's references to him but because Shakespeare's company produced a number of Jonson's plays, at least two of which (Every Man in His Humour and Sejanus His Fall) Shakespeare certainly acted in. However, it is now impossible to tell how much personal communication they had, and tales of their friendship cannot be substantiated.[citation needed] Jonson's most influential and revealing commentary on Shakespeare is the second of the two poems that he contributed to the prefatory verse that opens Shakespeare's First Folio. This poem, \"To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us\", did a good deal to create the traditional view of Shakespeare as a poet who, despite \"small Latine, and lesse Greeke\",[56] had a natural genius. The poem has traditionally been thought to exemplify the contrast which Jonson perceived between himself, the disciplined and erudite classicist, scornful of ignorance and sceptical of the masses, and Shakespeare, represented in the poem as a kind of natural wonder whose genius was not subject to any rules except those of the audiences for which he wrote. But the poem itself qualifies this view: Some view this elegy as a conventional exercise, but others see it as a heartfelt tribute to the \"Sweet Swan of Avon\", the \"Soul of the Age!\" It has been argued that Jonson helped to edit the First Folio, and he may have been inspired to write this poem by reading his fellow playwright's works, a number of which had been previously either unpublished or available in less satisfactory versions, in a relatively complete form.[citation needed] Jonson was a towering literary figure, and his influence was enormous for he has been described as \"One of the most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of English literature\".[57] Before the English Civil War, the \"Tribe of Ben\" touted his importance, and during the Restoration Jonson's satirical comedies and his theory and practice of \"humour characters\" (which are often misunderstood; see William Congreve's letters for clarification) was extremely influential, providing the blueprint for many Restoration comedies. John Aubrey wrote of Jonson in Brief Lives. By 1700, Jonson's status began to decline. In the Romantic era, Jonson suffered the fate of being unfairly compared and contrasted to Shakespeare, as the taste for Jonson's type of satirical comedy decreased. Jonson was at times greatly appreciated by the Romantics, but overall he was denigrated for not writing in a Shakespearean vein. In 2012, after more than two decades of research, Cambridge University Press published the first new edition of Jonson's complete works for 60 years.[58] As G. E. Bentley notes in Shakespeare and Jonson: Their Reputations in the Seventeenth Century Compared, Jonson's reputation was in some respects equal to Shakespeare's in the 17th century. After the English theatres were reopened on the Restoration of Charles II, Jonson's work, along with Shakespeare's and Fletcher's, formed the initial core of the Restoration repertory. It was not until after 1710 that Shakespeare's plays (ordinarily in heavily revised forms) were more frequently performed than those of his Renaissance contemporaries. Many critics since the 18th century have ranked Jonson below only Shakespeare among English Renaissance dramatists. Critical judgment has tended to emphasise the very qualities that Jonson himself lauds in his prefaces, in Timber, and in his scattered prefaces and dedications: the realism and propriety of his language, the bite of his satire, and the care with which he plotted his comedies. For some critics, the temptation to contrast Jonson (representing art or craft) with Shakespeare (representing nature, or untutored genius) has seemed natural; Jonson himself may be said to have initiated this interpretation in the second folio, and Samuel Butler drew the same comparison in his commonplace book later in the century. At the Restoration, this sensed difference became a kind of critical dogma. Charles de Saint-Évremond placed Jonson's comedies above all else in English drama, and Charles Gildon called Jonson the father of English comedy. John Dryden offered a more common assessment in the \"Essay of Dramatic Poesie,\" in which his Avatar Neander compares Shakespeare to Homer and Jonson to Virgil: the former represented profound creativity, the latter polished artifice. But \"artifice\" was in the 17th century almost synonymous with \"art\"; Jonson, for instance, used \"artificer\" as a synonym for \"artist\" (Discoveries, 33). For Lewis Theobald, too, Jonson \"ow[ed] all his Excellence to his Art,\" in contrast to Shakespeare, the natural genius. Nicholas Rowe, to whom may be traced the legend that Jonson owed the production of Every Man in his Humour to Shakespeare's intercession, likewise attributed Jonson's excellence to learning, which did not raise him quite to the level of genius. A consensus formed: Jonson was the first English poet to understand classical precepts with any accuracy, and he was the first to apply those precepts successfully to contemporary life. But there were also more negative spins on Jonson's learned art; for instance, in the 1750s, Edward Young casually remarked on the way in which Jonson's learning worked, like Samson's strength, to his own detriment. Earlier, Aphra Behn, writing in defence of female playwrights, had pointed to Jonson as a writer whose learning did not make him popular; unsurprisingly, she compares him unfavourably to Shakespeare. Particularly in the tragedies, with their lengthy speeches abstracted from Sallust and Cicero, Augustan critics saw a writer whose learning had swamped his aesthetic judgment. In this period, Alexander Pope is exceptional in that he noted the tendency to exaggeration in these competing critical portraits: \"It is ever the nature of Parties to be in extremes; and nothing is so probable, as that because Ben Jonson had much the most learning, it was said on the one hand that Shakespear had none at all; and because Shakespear had much the most wit and fancy, it was retorted on the other, that Jonson wanted both.\"[59] For the most part, the 18th century consensus remained committed to the division that Pope doubted; as late as the 1750s, Sarah Fielding could put a brief recapitulation of this analysis in the mouth of a \"man of sense\" encountered by David Simple. Though his stature declined during the 18th century, Jonson was still read and commented on throughout the century, generally in the kind of comparative and dismissive terms just described. Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg translated parts of Peter Whalley's edition into German in 1765. Shortly before the Romantic revolution, Edward Capell offered an almost unqualified rejection of Jonson as a dramatic poet, who (he writes) \"has very poor pretensions to the high place he holds among the English Bards, as there is no original manner to distinguish him and the tedious sameness visible in his plots indicates a defect of Genius.\"[60] The disastrous failures of productions of Volpone and Epicoene in the early 1770s no doubt bolstered a widespread sense that Jonson had at last grown too antiquated for the contemporary public; if he still attracted enthusiasts such as Earl Camden and William Gifford, he all but disappeared from the stage in the last quarter of the century. The romantic revolution in criticism brought about an overall decline in the critical estimation of Jonson. Hazlitt refers dismissively to Jonson's \"laborious caution.\" Coleridge, while more respectful, describes Jonson as psychologically superficial: \"He was a very accurately observing man; but he cared only to observe what was open to, and likely to impress, the senses.\" Coleridge placed Jonson second only to Shakespeare; other romantic critics were less approving. The early 19th century was the great age for recovering Renaissance drama. Jonson, whose reputation had survived, appears to have been less interesting to some readers than writers such as Thomas Middleton or John Heywood, who were in some senses \"discoveries\" of the 19th century. Moreover, the emphasis which the romantic writers placed on imagination, and their concomitant tendency to distrust studied art, lowered Jonson's status, if it also sharpened their awareness of the difference traditionally noted between Jonson and Shakespeare. This trend was by no means universal, however; William Gifford, Jonson's first editor of the 19th century, did a great deal to defend Jonson's reputation during this period of general decline. In the next era, Swinburne, who was more interested in Jonson than most Victorians, wrote, \"The flowers of his growing have every quality but one which belongs to the rarest and finest among flowers: they have colour, form, variety, fertility, vigour: the one thing they want is fragrance\" – by \"fragrance,\" Swinburne means spontaneity. In the 20th century, Jonson's body of work has been subject to a more varied set of analyses, broadly consistent with the interests and programmes of modern literary criticism. In an essay printed in The Sacred Wood, T. S. Eliot attempted to repudiate the charge that Jonson was an arid classicist by analysing the role of imagination in his dialogue. Eliot was appreciative of Jonson's overall conception and his \"surface\", a view consonant with the modernist reaction against Romantic criticism, which tended to denigrate playwrights who did not concentrate on representations of psychological depth. Around mid-century, a number of critics and scholars followed Eliot's lead, producing detailed studies of Jonson's verbal style. At the same time, study of Elizabethan themes and conventions, such as those by E. E. Stoll and M. C. Bradbrook, provided a more vivid sense of how Jonson's work was shaped by the expectations of his time. The proliferation of new critical perspectives after mid-century touched on Jonson inconsistently. Jonas Barish was the leading figure among critics who appreciated Jonson's artistry. On the other hand, Jonson received less attention from the new critics than did some other playwrights and his work was not of programmatic interest to psychoanalytic critics. But Jonson's career eventually made him a focal point for the revived sociopolitical criticism. Jonson's works, particularly his masques and pageants, offer significant information regarding the relations of literary production and political power, as do his contacts with and poems for aristocratic patrons; moreover, his career at the centre of London's emerging literary world has been seen as exemplifying the development of a fully commodified literary culture. In this respect he is seen as a transitional figure, an author whose skills and ambition led him to a leading role both in the declining culture of patronage and in the rising culture of mass media. Jonson has been called \"the first poet laureate\".[61] If Jonson's reputation as a playwright has traditionally been linked to Shakespeare, his reputation as a poet has, since the early 20th century, been linked to that of John Donne. In this comparison, Jonson represents the cavalier strain of poetry, emphasising grace and clarity of expression; Donne, by contrast, epitomised the metaphysical school of poetry, with its reliance on strained, baroque metaphors and often vague phrasing. Since the critics who made this comparison (Herbert Grierson for example), were to varying extents rediscovering Donne, this comparison often worked to the detriment of Jonson's reputation. In his time Jonson was at least as influential as Donne. In 1623, historian Edmund Bolton named him the best and most polished English poet. That this judgment was widely shared is indicated by the admitted influence he had on younger poets. The grounds for describing Jonson as the \"father\" of cavalier poets are clear: many of the cavalier poets described themselves as his \"sons\" or his \"tribe\". For some of this tribe, the connection was as much social as poetic; Herrick described meetings at \"the Sun, the Dog, the Triple Tunne\".[1] All of them, including those like Herrick whose accomplishments in verse are generally regarded as superior to Jonson's, took inspiration from Jonson's revival of classical forms and themes, his subtle melodies, and his disciplined use of wit. In these respects, Jonson may be regarded as among the most important figures in the prehistory of English neoclassicism. Popular Culture - His \"Queen and Huntress\" was used, in slightly amended form, by Mike Oldfield on side 4 of his multi Album set, Incantations.The lyrics can be found on his website, confirming its the same poem. The best of Jonson's lyrics have remained current since his time; periodically, they experience a brief vogue, as after the publication of Peter Whalley's edition of 1756. Jonson's poetry continues to interest scholars for the light which it sheds on English literary history, such as politics, systems of patronage and intellectual attitudes. For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: \"On My First Sonne\"; \"To Celia\"; \"To Penshurst\"; and the epitaph on Salomon Pavy, a boy player abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays. It is in Jonson's Timber, or Discoveries... that he famously quipped on the manner in which language became a measure of the speaker or writer: Language most shows a man: Speak, that I may see thee. It springs out of the most retired and inmost parts of us, and is the image of the parent of it, the mind. No glass renders a man’s form or likeness so true as his speech. Nay, it is likened to a man; and as we consider feature and composition in a man, so words in language; in the greatness, aptness, sound structure, and harmony of it. As with other English Renaissance dramatists, a portion of Ben Jonson's literary output has not survived. In addition to The Isle of Dogs (1597), the records suggest these lost plays as wholly or partially Jonson's work: Richard Crookback (1602); Hot Anger Soon Cold (1598), with Porter and Henry Chettle; Page of Plymouth (1599), with Dekker; and Robert II, King of Scots (1599), with Chettle and Dekker. Several of Jonson's masques and entertainments also are not extant: The Entertainment at Merchant Taylors (1607); The Entertainment at Salisbury House for James I (1608); and The May Lord (1613–19). Finally, there are questionable or borderline attributions. Jonson may have had a hand in Rollo, Duke of Normandy, or The Bloody Brother, a play in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. The comedy The Widow was printed in 1652 as the work of Thomas Middleton, Fletcher and Jonson, though scholars have been intensely sceptical about Jonson's presence in the play. A few attributions of anonymous plays, such as The London Prodigal, have been ventured by individual researchers, but have met with cool responses.[64] Ben Johnson features as a character in Jean Findlay's historical novel, The Queen's Lender (2022).[65]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Ben Jonson (born June 11?, 1572, London, England—died August 6, 1637, London) was an English Stuart dramatist, lyric poet, and literary critic. He is generally regarded as the second most important English dramatist, after William Shakespeare, during the reign of James I. Among his major plays are the comedies Every Man in His Humour (1598), Volpone (1605), Epicoene; or, The Silent Woman (1609), The Alchemist (1610), and Bartholomew Fair (1614). Jonson was born two months after his father died. His stepfather was a bricklayer, but by good fortune the boy was able to attend Westminster School. His formal education, however, ended early, and he at first followed his stepfather’s trade, then fought with some success with the English forces in the Netherlands. On returning to England, he became an actor and playwright, experiencing the life of a strolling player. He apparently played the leading role of Hieronimo in Thomas Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy. By 1597 he was writing plays for Philip Henslowe, the leading impresario for the public theatre. With one exception (The Case Is Altered), these early plays are known, if at all, only by their titles. Jonson apparently wrote tragedies as well as comedies in these years, but his extant writings include only two tragedies, Sejanus (1603) and Catiline (1611). The year 1598 marked an abrupt change in Jonson’s status, when Every Man in His Humour was successfully presented by the Lord Chamberlain’s theatrical company (a legend has it that Shakespeare himself recommended it to them), and his reputation was established. In this play Jonson tried to bring the spirit and manner of Latin comedy to the English popular stage by presenting the story of a young man with an eye for a girl, who has difficulty with a phlegmatic father, is dependent on a clever servant, and is ultimately successful—in fact, the standard plot of the Latin dramatist Plautus. But at the same time Jonson sought to embody in four of the main characters the four “humours” of medieval and Renaissance medicine—choler, melancholy, phlegm, and blood—which were thought to determine human physical and mental makeup. That same year Jonson killed a fellow actor in a duel, and, though he escaped capital punishment by pleading “benefit of clergy” (the ability to read from the Latin Bible), he could not escape branding. During his brief imprisonment over the affair he became a Roman Catholic. Following the success of Every Man in His Humour, the same theatrical company acted Jonson’s Every Man Out of His Humour (1599), which was even more ambitious. It was the longest play ever written for the Elizabethan public theatre, and it strove to provide an equivalent of the Greek comedy of Aristophanes; “induction,” or “prelude,” and regular between-act comment explicated the author’s views on what the drama should be. The play, however, proved a disaster, and Jonson had to look elsewhere for a theatre to present his work. The obvious place was the “private” theatres, in which only young boys acted (see children’s company). The high price of admission they charged meant a select audience, and they were willing to try strong satire and formal experiment; for them Jonson wrote Cynthia’s Revels (c. 1600) and Poetaster (1601). Even in these, however, there is the paradox of contempt for human behaviour hand in hand with a longing for human order. From 1605 to 1634 he regularly contributed masques for the courts of James I and Charles I, collaborating with the architect and designer Inigo Jones. This marked his favour with the court and led to his post as poet laureate. It appears that Jonson won royal attention by his Entertainment at Althorpe, given before James I’s queen as she journeyed down from Scotland in 1603, and in 1605 The Masque of Blackness was presented at court. The “masque” was a quasi-dramatic entertainment, primarily providing a pretense for a group of strangers to dance and sing before an audience of guests and attendants in a royal court or nobleman’s house. This elementary pattern was much elaborated during the reign of James I, when Jones provided increasingly magnificent costumes and scenic effects for masques at court. The few spoken words that the masque had demanded in Elizabethan days expanded into a “text” of a few hundred lines and a number of set songs. Thus the author became important as well as the designer: he was to provide not only the necessary words but also a special “allegorical” meaning underlying the whole entertainment. It was Jonson, in collaboration with Jones, who gave the Jacobean masque its characteristic shape and style. He did this primarily by introducing the suggestion of a “dramatic” action. It was thus the poet who provided the informing idea and dictated the fashion of the whole night’s assembly. Jonson’s early masques were clearly successful, for during the following years he was repeatedly called upon to function as poet at court. Among his masques were Hymenaei (1606), Hue and Cry After Cupid (1608), The Masque of Beauty (1608), and The Masque of Queens (1609). In his masques Jonson was fertile in inventing new motives for the arrival of the strangers. But this was not enough: he also invented the “antimasque,” which preceded the masque proper and which featured grotesques or comics who were primarily actors rather than dancers or musicians. Important though Jonson was at the court in Whitehall, it was undoubtedly Jones’s contributions that caused the most stir. That tension should arise between the two men was inevitable, and eventually friction led to a complete break: Jonson wrote the Twelfth Night masque for the court in 1625 but then had to wait five years before the court again asked for his services. In 1606 Jonson and his wife (whom he had married in 1594) were brought before the consistory court in London to explain their lack of participation in the Anglican church. He denied that his wife was guilty but admitted that his own religious opinions held him aloof from attendance. The matter was patched up through his agreement to confer with learned men, who might persuade him if they could. Apparently it took six years for him to decide to conform. For some time before this he and his wife had lived apart, Jonson taking refuge in turn with his patrons Sir Robert Townshend and Esmé Stuart, Lord Aubigny. During this period, nevertheless, he made a mark second only to Shakespeare’s in the public theatre. His comedies Volpone; or, the Foxe (1606) and The Alchemist (1610) were among the most popular and esteemed plays of the time. Each exhibited man’s folly in the pursuit of gold. Set respectively in Italy and London, they demonstrate Jonson’s enthusiasm both for the typical Renaissance setting and for his own town on Europe’s fringe. Both plays are eloquent and compact, sharp-tongued and controlled. The comedies Epicoene (1609) and Bartholomew Fair (1614) were also successful. Jonson embarked on a walking tour in 1618–19, which took him to Scotland. During the visit the city of Edinburgh made him an honorary burgess and guild brother. On his return to England he received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Oxford University, a most signal honour in his time. Jonson’s life was a life of talk as well as of writing. He engaged in “wit-combats” with Shakespeare and reigned supreme. It was a young man’s ultimate honour to be regarded as a “son of Ben.” In 1623 his personal library was destroyed by fire. By this time his services were seldom called on for the entertainment of Charles I’s court, and his last plays failed to please. In 1628 he suffered what was apparently a stroke and, as a result, was confined to his room and chair, ultimately to his bed. That same year he was made city chronologer (thus theoretically responsible for the city’s pageants), though in 1634 his salary for the post was made into a pension. Jonson died in 1637 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. The first folio edition of his works had appeared in 1616; posthumously, in a second Jonson folio (1640), appeared Timber: or, Discoveries, a series of observations on life and letters. Here Jonson held forth on the nature of poetry and drama and paid his final tribute to Shakespeare: in spite of acknowledging a belief that his great contemporary was, on occasion, “full of wind”—sufflaminandus erat—he declared that “I loved the man, and do honour his memory, on this side idolatry, as much as any.”",

                "content": "Poems & Poets Poems & Poets Ben Jonson is among the best-known writers and theorists of English Renaissance literature, second in reputation only to Shakespeare. A prolific dramatist and a man of letters highly learned in the classics, he profoundly influenced the Augustan age through his emphasis on the precepts of Horace, Aristotle, and other classical Greek and Latin thinkers. While he is now remembered primarily for his satirical comedies, he also distinguished himself as a poet, preeminent writer of masques, erudite defender of his work, and the originator of English literary criticism. Jonson’s pro­fessional reputation is often obscured by that of the man himself: bold, independent and aggressive. He fashioned for himself an image as the sole arbiter of taste, standing for erudition and the supremacy of clas­sical models against what he perceived as the general populace’s ignorant preference for the sensational. While his direct influence can be seen in each genre he undertook, his ultimate legacy is considered to be his literary craftsmanship, his strong sense of artistic form and control, and his role in bringing, as Alex­ander Pope noted, “critical learning into vogue.” Jonson was born in London shortly after the death of his father, a minister who claimed descent from the Scottish gentry. Despite a poor upbringing, he was educated at Westminster School under the renowned antiquary William Camden. He apparently left his schooling unwillingly to work with his stepfather as a bricklayer. He then served as a volunteer in the Low Countries in the Dutch war against Spain, and the sto­ry is told that he defeated a challenger in single com­bat between the opposing armies, stripping his van­quished opponent of his arms in the classical fashion. Returning to England by 1592, Jonson married Anne Lewis in 1594. Although the union was unhappy, it produced several children, all of whom Jonson out­lived. In the years following his marriage, he became an actor and also wrote numerous “get-penny” enter­tainments—financially motivated and quickly com­posed plays. He also provided respected emendations and additions to Thomas Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy (1592). By 1597 he was writing for Philip Henslowe’s theatrical company. That year, Henslowe employed Jonson to finish Thomas Nashe’s satire The Isle of Dogs (now lost), but the play was suppressed for al­leged seditious content and Jonson was jailed for a short time. In 1598 the earliest of his extant works, Every Man in His Humour, was produced by the Lord Chamberlain’s Men with William Shakespeare—who became close friends with Jonson—in the cast. That same year, Jonson fell into further trouble after killing actor Gabriel Spencer in a duel, narrowly escaping the gallows by claiming benefit of clergy (meaning he was shown leniency for proving that he was literate and educated). While incarcerated at Newgate prison, Jon­son converted to Catholicism. Shortly thereafter, writing for the Children of the Queen’s Chapel, Jonson became embroiled in a public feud with playwrights John Marston and Thomas Dekker. In Cynthia’s Revells and Poetaster (both 1601), Jonson portrayed himself as the impartial, well informed judge of art and society and wrote unflattering portraits of the two dramatists. Marston and Dekker counterat­tacked with a satiric portrayal of Jonson in the play Satiromastix; or, The Untrussing of the Humorous Poet (1602). Interestingly, scholars speculate that the dis­pute, which became known as the “War of the The­atres,” was mutually contrived in order to further the authors’ careers. In any event, Jonson later reconciled with Marston, and collaborated with him and George Chapman in writing Eastward Ho! (1605). A joke at the King’s expense in this play landed him once again, along with his coauthors, in prison. Once freed, how­ever, Jonson entered a period of good fortune and productivity. He had many friends at court, and James I valued his learning highly. His abilities thus did not go unrecognized, and he was frequently called upon to write his popular, elegant masques, such as The Mas­que of Blacknesse (1605). During this period, Jonson also produced his most successful comedies, begin­ning in 1606 with Volpone and following with The Silent Woman (1609), The Alchemist (1610), and Bar­tholomew Fayre (1614). Jonson’s remaining tragedies, Sejanus His Fall (1603) and Catiline His Conspiracy (1611), though monuments to his scholarship, were not well received due to their rigid imitation of classical tragic forms and their pedantic tone. In 1616 Jonson published his Workes, becoming the first English writer to dignify his dramas by terming them “works,” and for this perceived presumption he was soundly ridiculed. In that year Jonson assumed the responsibilities and privileges of Poet Laureate, though without formal appointment. From 1616 to 1625 he primarily wrote masques for presentation at court. He had already collaborated with poet, architect, and stage designer Inigo Jones one several court masques, and the two continued their joint efforts, establishing the reign of James I as the period of the consummate masque. For his achievements, the University of Ox­ford honored him in 1619 with a master of arts degree. Misfortune, however, marked Jonson’s later years. A fire destroyed his library in 1623, and when James I died in 1625, Jonson lost much of his influence at court, though he was named City Chronologer in 1628. Later that year, he suffered the first of several strokes which left him bedridden. Jonson produced four plays during the reign of Charles I, and was eventually grant­ed a new pension in 1634. None of these later plays was successful. The rest of his life, spent in retirement, he filled primarily with study and writing; at his death, on August 6, 1637, two unfinished plays were discov­ered among his mass of papers and manuscripts. Jon­son left a financially depleted estate, but was neverthe­less buried with honor in Westminster Abbey. Jonson’s earliest comedies, such as Every Man in His Humour, derive from Roman comedy in form and structure and are noteworthy as models of the comedy of “humours,” in which each character represents a type dominated by a particular obsession. Although Jonson was not the first to employ the comedy of humours, his use of the form in Every Man in His Humour and Every Man out of His Humour is considered exempla­ry, and such characterization continued to be a feature of his work. Of particular significance in appraisals of Jonson are the four comical satires produced between 1606 and 1614: Volpone, The Silent Woman, The Al­chemist, and Bartholomew Fayre. Each exposes some aberration of human appetite through comic exagger­ation and periodic moralisms while evincing Jonson’s interest in the variety of life and in the villain as a cunning, imaginative artist. Volpone, his most famous and most frequently staged work, is also his harshest attack on human vice, specifically targeting greed. Like The Silent Woman and The Alchemist, it mixes didac­tic intent with scenes of tightly constructed comic coun­terpoise. The last of Jonson’s great dramas is the pan­oramic Bartholomew Fayre. Softening the didacticism that characterized his earlier work, Jonson expressed the classical moralist’s views of wisdom and folly through a multiplicity of layered, interrelated plots in a colorfully portrayed and loosely structured form. All four comedies exhibit careful planning executed with classical precision, a command of low speech and col­loquial usage, and a movement toward more realistic, three-dimensional character depiction. Critics note that Jonson’s later plays, beginning with The Divell is an Asse in 1616, betray the dramatist’s diminishing artistry. These later dramas were dismissed by John Dryden, who undertook the first extensive anal­ysis of Jonson, as mere “dotages.” While generously likening him to Virgil and calling him “the most learned and judicious writer which any theatre ever had,” Dryden’s comments also signaled the start of a decline in Jonson’s reputation, for his observations included a comparison of Jonson and Shakespeare, one which nodded admiringly toward Jonson, but bowed adoring­ly before Shakespeare. This telling comparison col­ored Jonson’s reputation for more than 200 years, fueled by such 19th-century Romantic critics as Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1818), and Will­iam Hazlitt (1819), who found Jonson lacking in imag­ination, delicacy, and soul. His “greatest defect,” ac­cording to George Saintsbury, was the “want of pas­sion.” “Yet,” he conceded, “his merits are extraordi­nary.” Most 19th-century critics agreed with the assessment of John Addington Symonds that the “higher gifts of poetry, with which Shakespeare—‘nature’s child’—was so richly endowed, are almost absolutely wanting in Ben Jonson.” T.S. Eliot, writing in 1919, focused attention on Jonson’s reputation as “the most deadly kind that can be compelled upon the memory of a great poet. To be universally accepted; to be damned by the praise that quenches all desire to read the book; to be afflicted by the imputation of the virtues which excite the least pleasure; and to be read only by historians and anti­quaries—this is the most perfect conspiracy of approv­al.” With this began a reevaluation of Jonson, whose reputation benefited from modernist reaction against Romanticist sensibility, and who began to be appreciated on his own terms. English critic L.C. Knights, in 1937, considered Jonson “a very great poet”; and while Edmund Wilson, in 1948, still found none of Shakespeare’s “immense range” in Jonson, he thought him “a great man of letters” and acknowl­edged his influence on writers as diverse as Milton, Congreve, Swift, and Huxley. Recent scholarship has sought to place Jonson in the theatrical and political milieu of London, addressing his relationship with his audience and the monarchy. This focus on historical context has also produced an emphasis on the former bricklayer’s “self-fashioning” into dramatist, critic, and finally the first poet laureate. Many critics now regard him as a fore-runner in the 17th-century move­ment toward classicism, and his plays are often ad­mired for their accurate depictions of the men and women of his day, their mastery of form, and their successful blend of the serious and the comic, the top­ical, and the timeless.

                "content": "Ben Jonson 1572-1637) was an early modern playwright whose popularity rivaled that of Shakespeare or Marlowe. He spent multiple stints in prison, wrote masques in which the Queen of England and Prince of Wales performed, and was crowned England's first poet laureate. Yet for all this in 1572 he was born into relative poverty. His father died shortly before his birth, and his mother remarried a bricklayer. Luckily for the clever young boy, an unidentified friend paid for Jonson to attend Westminster School. After leaving school Jonson attempted to join his stepfather as a bricklayer, but the profession didn't take; legend has it young Ben recited Homer while building the walls of Lincoln Inn. In the 1590s Jonson served in the armed forces in the Low Countries, and in November 1594 Jonson married a woman he described as \"a shrew, yet honest.\" It's not certain when Jonson entered the theatre, but by 1597 he was an actor for the Admiral's Men. It was also in this year that his earliest surviving play, The Case is Altered, was performed by Pembroke's Company. Jonson's sharp tongue got him into no end of trouble: In summer of 1597 the satirical comedy The Isle of Dogs, which Jonson co-wrote with Thomas Nashe, was performed, and the play upset the powers that be. Jonson was arrested along with two other actors, and the play may have prompted the Privy Council's order to close the London theatres because of \"lewd matters that are handled on the stages, and by resorte and confluence of bad people.\" Jonson was released within a few months, and apparently hadn't learned his lesson. In the summer of 1604 the Children of her Majesty's Revels performed Jonson's Eastward Ho!, a collaboration with George Chapman and John Marston. Eastward Ho! was a response to John Webster's and Thomas Dekker's Northward Ho!, and a salacious one at that. The play mocked King James, the Scots, knights of the realm, and courtiers, and all three playwrights were imprisoned until October. On a less political note, Jonson was engaged in the \"War of the Theatres\", or \"Poetomachia\" between 1599 and 1602, in which Ben Jonson battled John Marston and Thomas Dekker by satirizing one another in their plays and poetry. In the early to mid 17th century Jonson really hit his stride, writing such classic plays as Volpone (1605), The Alchemist (1610), Bartholomew Fair (1614), and The Devil is an Ass (1616). Even when he didn't cast thinly veiled aspersions on political figures, Jonson specialised in depicting witty banter, confidence tricksters, and devils in disguise of all sorts. Jonson was a man who liked his luxuries. Having been raised in poverty, he appreciated good food and creature comforts. He was a portly man apt to praise the finer things in his countless poems, and sought recognition from the court of King James I. He wrote more than twenty masques for the court, including The Masque of Blackness, in which Queen Anne herself performed. In 1616 Jonson was named England's first ever Poet Laureate. Jonson was aware of his legacy to a degree unprecedented among early modern playwrights. He was the first playwright to ensure his own works were published as a formal folio, treating his plays as works of literary note rather than as frivolous stage plays. The 1616 folio divided his works into plays, poetry, masques, and entertainments. The engraving on the title page went to great pains to associate Jonson with Greek scholars of old. And perhaps that association was not unjust: Jonson was witty, intelligent, well read, and as capable a poet as he was a playwright. \"On My First Sonne\", an elegy written after the death of his seven-year-old son Benjamin, is truly heartbreaking. Jonson was a true Renaissance man. The \"Tribe of Ben\" grew up from the 1620s, a group of poets who proclaimed themselves influenced by and successors of Jonson, included Robert Herrick and Richard Lovelace. Jonson suffered a series of strokes, fell out of court favour, and died on 6 August 1637. Not a little because of his having ensured their publication, Jonson's works endure.

                "title": "Mike McCarthy - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Michael John McCarthy (born November 10, 1963) is an American professional football coach who is the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). From 2006 to 2018, he was the head coach of the Green Bay Packers. In 2011, McCarthy led the team to a win in Super Bowl XLV over his hometown team, the Pittsburgh Steelers. McCarthy was previously the offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers and New Orleans Saints. During his 17 seasons as a head coach in the NFL, McCarthy has an overall regular season record of 169–104–2.[1] He is among only five head coaches (Tom Landry, Chuck Noll, Andy Reid, and Bill Belichick) to lead one franchise to eight straight playoff appearances. McCarthy is second to Curly Lambeau in all-time wins leading the Packers.[2] McCarthy was born and raised in Pittsburgh, in the blue-collar neighborhood of Greenfield. His mother, Ellen McCarthy, was a secretary who also worked in restaurants and for the Peace & Justice Center.[3] His father, Joe McCarthy Jr., was a firefighter for the Pittsburgh Fire Bureau and an officer for the Pittsburgh Police. He also owned a bar called Joe McCarthy's Bar and Grill,[4] which Mike spent his Sundays cleaning before church.[3] McCarthy was raised as a Pittsburgh Steelers fan.[5][6] McCarthy is one of five siblings. He has three sisters, Colleen, Ellen, and Kellie, and a brother, Joseph III (d. 2015). McCarthy attended St. Rosalia primary school, where he played basketball.[3][7] He later made annual donations to the school.[3] McCarthy attended Bishop Boyle High School.[3] After high school, McCarthy initially went to Salem University (then Salem College) in West Virginia before returning home to work in his father's bar. In 1984, McCarthy attended Scottsdale Community College in Arizona, playing one season for the Fighting Artichokes football team.[8][9] He then transferred to Baker University, an NAIA school located in Baldwin City, Kansas. McCarthy was a two-time all-conference tight end.[8][10][11] In 1986 McCarthy was captain of the team, which finished the season as the national runner-up in NAIA Division II.[8] In 1987, McCarthy earned a B.S. in business administration.[12] In 1987, Duane Dirk, the defensive coordinator at Fort Hays State University in Kansas, hired McCarthy as a defensive graduate assistant (GA). Over the next two years, McCarthy focused on linebackers and defensive ends.[13] During his time as the defensive graduate assistant, McCarthy pursued a master of science degree; he graduated with a M.S. in Sports Administration in 1989.[14] After serving as a graduate assistant at Fort Hays State from 1987 to 1988, McCarthy returned home to Pittsburgh. On July 30, 1989, McCarthy contacted Mike Gottfried, the head coach at the University of Pittsburgh, looking for a coaching job, but no positions were available. McCarthy was told to mail his resume. McCarthy later showed up at Gottfried's office without an appointment to introduce himself. Two days later, one of Gottfried's assistants resigned, and McCarthy was offered a volunteer coach position without pay.[15] McCarthy later worked under coach Paul Hackett.[6] McCarthy served as a graduate assistant for three seasons before coaching wide receivers during the 1992 season. Initially, he also worked the night shift on the Pennsylvania Turnpike as a toll collector during the off-season to supplement his income.[16] McCarthy stated that he spent his time in the tollbooth reviewing the University of Pittsburgh playbook.[3] In 1993, McCarthy and Paul Hackett left Pittsburgh and were hired by the Kansas City Chiefs under head coach Marty Schottenheimer.[6] McCarthy worked two years as an offensive quality control assistant. As Head Coach of the Green Bay Packers, McCarthy hired six former quality control coaches to serve as his position coaches.[17] In 1993 and 1994, McCarthy worked with Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana.[18] In 1995, McCarthy became quarterbacks coach for the Chiefs, overseeing Rich Gannon, Elvis Grbac, and Steve Bono. McCarthy's signal callers threw 52 interceptions — the lowest in the American Football Conference (AFC) during the years from 1995 through 1998.[18] When Schottenheimer resigned from the Chiefs after the 1998 season,[19] McCarthy left Kansas City and became the Packers' quarterbacks coach. There, he worked with Hall of Famer Brett Favre.[20] In the 1999 season, while working with McCarthy, Packers quarterback Brett Favre threw for 4,091 yards, the fourth-best total of his career.[18][21] While McCarthy was quarterbacks coach, the 1999 Packers team was ranked seventh in passing and ninth in overall offense in the league.[18] In 2000, McCarthy was hired as the offensive coordinator for the New Orleans Saints.[21] That year, the Saints achieved a 10–6 regular season record,[22] then won their first playoff game in the franchise's history and finished 10th overall in offense.[23] McCarthy was selected as National Football Conference (NFC) Assistant Coach of the Year by USA Today in 2000.[23] The Saints failed to make the playoffs over the next three years. In 2002 the Saints led the NFC in scoring, with 49 touchdowns and 432 points, but slowed down at the end of the season. In 2003, the Saints scored 340 points—their eighth highest-scoring season ever. All of McCarthy's four years with the Saints rank in the team's top 10 years for offense.[18] While McCarthy was with the team, the Saints’ offense set 25 individual and 10 team records. Joe Horn caught 45 touchdowns and 437 passes for 6,289 yards.[18] During McCarthy's time with the team, running backs Ricky Williams and Deuce McCallister both had a 1,000-yard season.[18] In his first two years, running back Ricky Williams would run for 2,245 yards with 14 touchdowns.[24] McCarthy stayed with the team for five seasons through 2004.[23] In 2005, McCarthy served as offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers by coach Mike Nolan.[25] His unit had setbacks, including the trade of their most experienced quarterback, Tim Rattay.[18] Rattay was replaced by a rookie quarterback, top draft pick Alex Smith, who was injured in Week 7 of the season.[18] The 49ers finished the season ranked 30th in the NFL in points scored and dead last in yards gained.[26] Despite this, rookie running back Frank Gore would emerge to run for 608 rushing yards on 127 carries with a 4.8 Yards Per Carry (YPC)[27][28] while wide receiver Brandon Lloyd had 733 yards receiving and five touchdowns.[29][30] After Mike Sherman took the Packers to a 4–12 record in 2005,[31] the team released him on January 2, 2006, and immediately started interviewing for a replacement.[32] McCarthy was interviewed by Packers general manager Ted Thompson on January 8, 2006, and was offered the head coaching position three days later.[20] In 2006, the Packers started with a 4–8 record, but the team still managed to win their last four games after both quarterback Brett Favre and backup quarterback Aaron Rodgers sustained injuries, finishing the season 8–8, and ending with a win against their archrival, the Chicago Bears.[33][34] McCarthy guided the Packers to an 8–1 record in the first nine games of the 2007 season, tying Washington's Joe Gibbs for the best win–loss ratio to start the first 25 games of a career at 16–9 and passing Vince Lombardi, who went 15–10, for the best coaching start in Packers' history.[35] The team finished the regular season with a 13–3 record and obtained the number two seed in the NFC playoffs.[36][37] McCarthy led the Packers to the NFC Championship game, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl-winning New York Giants in overtime. After the 2007 season, McCarthy finished second in voting for The Associated Press Coach of the Year award, garnering 15 votes to Bill Belichick's 29 votes.[38] On January 19, 2008, McCarthy signed a five-year contract extension with the team, which raised his salary to $3.4 million a year.[39] The 2008 season was a tumultuous one. Aaron Rodgers, previously the backup, became the starting quarterback when Brett Favre announced his retirement in March. Favre then changed his mind and sought his previous position as the Green Bay quarterback. The organization reiterated its intent to move forward with Rodgers as the new face of the Packers, although Favre was offered the backup position behind Rodgers. Favre refused the offer, and was traded to the New York Jets in exchange for a conditional fourth-round draft pick.[40] The 2008 season started with a 5–5 record, followed by five consecutive losses. The season ended with a 31–21 victory over the Detroit Lions, bringing the Packers' regular season record to 6–10. The Packers finished third in the NFC North, ahead of only the Lions, and did not make the playoffs.[41] Under McCarthy, Aaron Rodgers threw for over 4,000 yards and posted a 93.8 passer rating.[42] Rodgers improved on his 2008 statistics in 2009, but was sacked 50 times, more than any other quarterback in the NFL. The Packers dominated teams with losing records but were swept by their rival Minnesota Vikings, led by former Packers franchise quarterback Brett Favre. The Packers lost to the previously winless Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but then came back to beat the NFC East-leading Dallas Cowboys.[43] They then went on a five-game winning streak and qualified for the playoffs with a Week 17 victory over the Arizona Cardinals, finishing with an 11–5 record.[44] This was the second playoff berth in McCarthy's tenure.[45] The Packers lost the wild-card round to the Cardinals in overtime, 51–45.[46] In 2010, the Packers had 25 players on the injured reserve list throughout the season. Running back Ryan Grant sustained an injury in week one that sidelined him for the rest of the season. McCarthy nonetheless led the Packers to a 10–6 regular season finish, never losing by more than four points and never trailing by more than 7 throughout the entire season.[47] This record earned them second place in the NFC North, behind the Chicago Bears,[48] with whom they split victories in the regular season.[49] They went into the NFC playoffs as the sixth seed.[50] The Packers defeated the number three-seeded Philadelphia Eagles by a 21–16 score in the wild-card round. They then played the number one-seeded Atlanta Falcons, beating them by a convincing margin of 48–21. The Packers then played the second-seeded Chicago Bears for the third time that season in the NFC Championship Game. They won 21–14 and advanced to Super Bowl XLV. After this game, McCarthy's team had a 3–0 postseason record on the road.[49][51] Super Bowl XLV pitted the Packers against the Pittsburgh Steelers. This was the first time these two storied franchises had played each other in the postseason.[52] Ahead of the game, confident in his team's performance, McCarthy had the team fitted for Super Bowl championship rings.[53] The Packers defeated the Steelers 31–25 to win their fourth Super Bowl and 13th NFL title overall.[54][52] The win returned the Lombardi Trophy to Green Bay for the first time since the team's 1996 season.[55] The 2011 Packers team was a record-setting one, leading the NFL in points scored and setting a franchise record for wins at 15–1 and consecutive wins.[56] McCarthy's offensive strategies facilitated Aaron Rodgers' NFL MVP season, as he threw for 4,643 yards and 45 touchdowns, throwing most often to receiver Jordy Nelson.[57][58] The Packers' season ended in the NFC Divisional Round against the New York Giants. The team had suffered a number of setbacks, including the season-ending neck injury of defensive back Nick Collins, and appeared to have suffered, rather than benefited, from the time off, dropping nine passes in this game.[57] Eli Manning of the Giants attacked the Packers’ weaker defense (ranked 19th in scoring defense) and the Packers lost 37–20.[58] In 2012, the Packers finished with an 11–5 record that ranked them first in the NFC North Division,[59] the first time the Packers had won two consecutive NFC North titles since the three they won from 2002 to 2004. McCarthy's offensive strategies led to the Packers scoring 433 points, with Aaron Rodgers passing for 4,295 yards.[60] The 2012 postseason was the 28th time the franchise had secured a playoff berth.[61] After beating the Minnesota Vikings in the first round they lost to the San Francisco 49ers in the Divisional Round by a score of 45–31. In 2013, McCarthy led the Packers to a regular season record of 8–7–1 and the NFC North title, the third consecutive division win.[62] That year, McCarthy took his team to their fifth straight playoff appearance.[63] During the summer of 2014, the village board of Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin voted to rename Potts Avenue “Mike McCarthy Way.”[64] In 2014, McCarthy guided the Packers to their fourth consecutive NFC North title with a 12–4 record.[65] The team ranked sixth in the NFL in total offense, with an average of 386 yards per game, and first in points scored, with an average of 30.4 points per game. In receiving yards, Jordy Nelson led the team with 1,519 yards. Aaron Rodgers threw for 4,381 yards and Eddie Lacy had 1,139 rushing yards.[66][67] In November 2014, McCarthy signed a contract extension through 2018.[68] With a Week 16 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, McCarthy notched his 99th win, passing Hall of Famer Vince Lombardi (98) for second on the Packers' all-time wins list, behind only Hall of Famer Curly Lambeau (212).[69][70] The Packers defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, but in the NFC Championship Game against the Seattle Seahawks, the Packers collapsed. Despite holding a 16–0 lead at halftime and a 19–7 lead in the final minutes of the fourth quarter, going on to lose the game 22–28 in overtime. McCarthy was criticized after making several questionable play calls during this loss.[71] At the start of the game, he went for two field goals at the 1 yard line, and was criticized for \"not going for it\".[72] During the last five minutes of the game, McCarthy called three run plays to Eddie Lacy with 3:52 minutes left, and the Packers punted on fourth down; critics slammed McCarthy for \"not giving Aaron Rodgers a chance\" to win the game.[73] A day after the loss, McCarthy stated that he is \"not questioning his play-calling\", as well as stating that he \"came to run the ball\".[74] Others defended McCarthy; in March 2015, at the annual owners' meetings, Bill Belichick stated that McCarthy is \"one of the best coaches I've ever gone up against.\"[75][76] Notwithstanding his rejection of the criticism of his heavily run-dependent strategy McCarthy relinquished play calling duties to long-time assistant Tom Clements in February 2015.[77] While the Packers made the playoffs for the seventh consecutive time after the 2015 season, the team struggled with a languishing running game. In December, McCarthy once again took over play calling responsibilities. After he did so, the Packers recorded a 28–7 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, running the ball for 230 yards.[78][79] The 2016 season made McCarthy the fourth head coach in the history of the NFL to take his team to eight-plus consecutive playoff appearances.[80] In the postseason, the Packers won the wild card game against the New York Giants (38–13) and then the NFC Divisional Playoff against the Dallas Cowboys (34–31) before losing on the road to the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship Game (44–21).[81] The Packers began the 2017 season with a 4–1 record, but was later hamstrung by a collarbone injury to Rodgers in Week 6 against the Minnesota Vikings. Afterwards, backup quarterback Brett Hundley made his first career start.[82] With only a backup quarterback to work with, McCarthy and the Packers failed to clinch a postseason appearance in 2017, finishing with a 7–9 record.[83] On January 2, 2018, it was announced that McCarthy had signed a one-year contract extension with the Packers.[84] On December 2, 2018, after a 20–17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, McCarthy was released after 13 seasons as head coach.[85] He finished his Packers tenure with a 125–77–2 (.618) regular-season record and a 10–8 (.556) postseason record for a combined record of 135–85–2 (.613). McCarthy led the team to nine playoff appearances and a Super Bowl victory.[1] The timing of the personnel decision caught McCarthy by surprise, as he noted in an interview with ESPN.com. McCarthy said: “Time provides the opportunity for reflection and clarity and that's where I'm at now. And it's clear to me now that both sides needed a change.”[2] After McCarthy was released as Packers head coach, he expressed plans to interview with the New York Jets and the Cleveland Browns.[86] The Arizona Cardinals expressed interest, but he declined to proceed with an interview.[87][88] McCarthy's interview with the Browns was initially scheduled for Thursday, January 3,[89] before being moved to a week later.[90] The Browns offered McCarthy the head coach position, but he declined it, because it would have required him to retain Freddie Kitchens as offensive coordinator. The Browns hired Kitchens instead.[91] McCarthy interviewed with the Jets on January 5, 2019.[92] The Jets also interviewed Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy and former Miami Dolphins coach Adam Gase.[92] The Jets proceeded to hire Gase.[93] On January 9, 2019, McCarthy announced that he intended to sit out the 2019 season and return for 2020.[94] McCarthy spent time improving his football knowledge and strategies. In collaboration with fellow coaches such as Jim Haslett, Frank Cignetti Jr. and Scott McCurley, McCarthy studied league playbooks, league trends, and analytics, with the intention of returning to the NFL. He said that his “McCarthy Project” made him “definitely a better coach.”[95] After Head Coach Jason Garrett parted ways with the Dallas Cowboys, McCarthy interviewed for the job. The interview for the vacant head coach position took place over 12 hours. McCarthy interviewed with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, executive vice president Stephen Jones, and chief sales and marketing officer Jerry Jones Jr. On January 7, 2020, McCarthy was announced as the Cowboys' new head coach.[96][97][98][99] McCarthy, who spent his season off watching game film and learning about analytics with fellow coaches, told Jones during the interview that he watched every play of the 2019 season. During his introductory press conference to announce his hiring, McCarthy said: “I need to confess: I told Jerry I watched every play of the 2019 season. I wanted the job. You do what you gotta do right?”[99] McCarthy is the Cowboys' ninth head coach since the organization was founded in 1960. On September 13, 2020, McCarthy lost his Cowboys head coaching debut against the Los Angeles Rams on the road by a score of 20–17.[100] In the next game, McCarthy received his first win as the Cowboys' head coach in a narrow 40–39 comeback victory over the Atlanta Falcons.[101] The Cowboys finished the 2020 season with a 6–10 record, placing third in the NFC East.[102] After losing starting quarterback Dak Prescott to a dislocated ankle in a Week 5 37–34 victory over the New York Giants, the Cowboys still remained in playoff contention in a weak division for most of the season. However, the team struggled defensively, allowing 473 points, which was the Cowboys' worst-ever defensive showing.[103] After the season, the Cowboys fired defensive coordinator Mike Nolan and defensive line coach Jim Tomsula.[104] McCarthy was fined $50,000 by the NFL on July 1, 2021, for violating practice rules during organized team activities.[105] As a result of the fine, McCarthy said in a statement the majority of the seven to nine plays the NFL discussed with him involved younger players.[106] From July through September 2021, McCarthy and the Cowboys were featured on the HBO sports documentary Hard Knocks. The experience, which McCarthy called “a good one,” involved a large camera crew filming the entirety of Cowboys training camp.[107][108] For the 2021 season, McCarthy guided the team to a 12–5 record and an NFC East division title, including sweeping the entire NFC East for the first time since 1998.[109] After a Week 9 30–16 loss to the Denver Broncos, McCarthy displayed a can of Anti-Monkey Butt powder in a presentation to the team. He informed the Cowboys that although the prior week's loss had been a \"Red Ass Week,\" McCarthy was confident his team would stage a comeback.[110][111] McCarthy missed the Week 13 27–17 road victory over the New Orleans Saints after testing positive for COVID-19 and was placed in COVID protocols for 10 days.[112] The Cowboys were upset at home 23–17 by the San Francisco 49ers in the playoffs in the wild-card round. The game ended with the clock running out on the Cowboys following a quarterback draw as they attempted to spike the ball to stop the clock to permit a final pass play. McCarthy was particularly criticized for his decision to use a quarterback draw with 14 seconds left in the fourth quarter, instead of going for two or more passes from further out.[113] McCarthy defended his decision, explaining that he was hoping to get another, easier play in after coming closer to the end zone and that he thought that 14 seconds was sufficient to allow his team to do this.[114] Before the 2022 season, McCarthy was fined $100,000 by the NFL for violating offseason practice rules.[115] McCarthy canceled a preseason practice instead holding a team bonding golf event.[116] For the 2022 season, McCarthy led the Cowboys to a 12–5 record, tying the 2021 season record and placing second in the NFC East.[117][118] During the 19–3 season-opening loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, quarterback Dak Prescott suffered a thumb fracture that required surgery and absence from the team until Week 7.[119][120] McCarthy replaced him with backup quarterback Cooper Rush who went 4–1 over the next five games.[120][121] McCarthy dealt with other injuries from key players including safety Jayron Kearse and left tackle Tyron Smith.[122] Before a Week 9 game against the Packers, McCarthy got emotional about a return to Green Bay. He also said he was looking forward to seeing Aaron Rodgers.[123] McCarthy led the Cowboys to a 31–14 road victory in the Wild Card Round against the Buccaneers, which according to Tom Brady would be the last game of his career.[124][125] In the Divisional Round against the San Francisco 49ers, the Cowboys lost on the road by a score of 19–12.[126] In January 2023, McCarthy announced that the Cowboys would be parting ways with offensive coordinator Kellen Moore.[127] He also parted ways with six other coaches.[128] In February 2023, team owner Jerry Jones stated that McCarthy would call plays during the following season.[129] McCarthy hired new coaching staff, including assistant offensive line coach Ramon Chinyoung and offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer.[130][131] In mid-January 2024, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said that he would retain McCarthy as head coach, saying the team is \"very close and capable of achieving our ultimate goals.\" In 2007, McCarthy was voted the Motorola NFL Coach of the Year[132] after twice receiving Coach of the Week awards.[133][134] He was also named the NFL Alumni's Coach of the Year by a group of former players.[135] In 2008, McCarthy received the distinguished service award at the Lee Remmel sports awards banquet in Green Bay.[136] McCarthy was selected as National Football Conference (NFC) Assistant Coach of the Year by USA Today in 2000.[23] In 1995, McCarthy and his high school sweetheart, Christine, amicably divorced. On March 15, 2008, McCarthy married Jessica Kress. They have five children between them; two sons from Jessica's previous marriage, a daughter from McCarthy's previous marriage[137] and two daughters together.[138][139][140] McCarthy and his wife Jessica have a history of giving back to communities and people in need. The couple were involved with the Seven Loaves Project in Rwanda.[141] They founded the McCarthy Family Foundation, a charitable nonprofit. The McCarthy Family Foundation has donated frequently to the American Family Children's Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. McCarthy hosts an annual golf tournament to benefit the hospital, and his foundation's fundraising was integral for the building of the hospital's Surgical Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.[142] The Foundation has donated to the MVP Foundation which brings together combat veterans and former professional athletes as they transition to a new life off the field.[143] The foundation has also donated $100,000 (which the Green Bay Packers matched) to the Green Bay Police Foundation. The funds were used to purchase protective equipment for police officers in the area. The money was also spent on outreach programs intended to build community relations, and on bias prevention training for the officers.[15] On February 26, 2019, McCarthy was accused of berating three high school basketball referees after his stepson's playoff game. McCarthy went on a \"verbal tirade\" while following the officials to their locker room. McCarthy apologized to the school's athletic department the next day.[144] McCarthy is a culinary enthusiast and has a history of supporting local restaurants and chefs throughout his coaching career.[145] In 2013, McCarthy partnered with Curly's Pub at Lambeau Field (now 1919 Kitchen & Tap) to create the \"Mac Attack\" burger, which is a 1/2-pound beef patty, topped with pepperoni, pepper jack cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, onion, jalapeños, mayo, spicy mustard and French fries.[146][147] Ten percent of the proceeds from all the sales of McCarthy's burger went to his philanthropic organization, the McCarthy Family Foundation. He has discussed his food preferences in interviews, including his appetite for breakfast foods, diner-style cuisine, and Aiello's Pittsburgh-style pizza.[148] # denotes interim head coach",

                "content": "DallasCowboys.com Staff Writer ARLINGTON, Texas – The fifth year of the Mike McCarthy era in Dallas came to a close on Sunday afternoon with a 23-19 loss to the Washington Commanders, as the Cowboys ended the season with a 7-10 record. Now, the organization has a decision to make: Do they resign head coach Mike McCarthy? While McCarthy's contract expires on January 14, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones did not provide an answer to that question in his postgame press conference, but McCarthy made it clear that he wants to be back. \"Absolutely. I have a lot invested here, and the Cowboys have a lot invested in me,\" McCarthy said when asked if his first preference was to remain head coach in Dallas. \"And then there's a personal side to all these decisions. So, they all point in the right direction.\" Those discussions are a two-way street, and McCarthy has not met with Jones but will have those conversations in the near future. \"No, we have meetings tomorrow morning with the players, but we'll get together here in the near future.\" McCarthy said when asked if he'd spoken to Jones about his future. McCarthy made his case to be retained in his postgame press conference and is confident in his ability to continue his tradition of being a winning head coach despite struggles this season. \"I don't like to talk about myself that way, but I'll just be clear: I'm a winner. I know how to win. I've won a championship. I won a championship in this building,\" McCarthy said. \"And that's who I am. We'll see where it goes.\" In his five seasons thus far, McCarthy posted a 49-35 record with the Cowboys. His 59%-win percentage ranks fourth amongst all Cowboys head coaches in the team's history, trailing Barry Switzer, Wade Phillips and Tom Landry. Through 18 years as an NFL head coach, McCarthy is 185-123-2, making him the 12th winningest head coach in NFL history. \"I have a lot of confidence in myself as a head coach,\" McCarthy said. \"I think like anything, body of work, statistics, I think it's more about the program, the details of what needs to be done, how can we get better.\" McCarthy built the Cowboys program into one that won 12 games in three straight seasons, and still believes in the foundation that he's set in Dallas. \"I'm a builder. I believe in building programs, I believe in developing young players,\" McCarthy said. \"At the end of the day, it is about winning, and you have to have those components in place to get this thing where it needs to be, and I think we have a very good foundation there.\" With plenty of questions and speculations looming over his future in the coming week, McCarthy believes that with him at the helm, the program he's built with the Cowboys can continue to grow. \"I'm definitely in a position with Jerry [Jones] to move the program forward, there's no question about that in my mind,\" McCarthy said. \"That's why these conversations need to happen in the near future.\" Yesterday's game was much like the season itself, writes @spags52, a promising effort ruined by a disappointing and frustrating finish. The Dallas Cowboys now know each of their opponents for the 2025 regular season, and there are some intriguing challenges ahead. The Cowboys will select 12th in the upcoming 2025 NFL draft following a 7-10 season, the highest selection the team has had since they took Micah Parsons with the 12th pick in the 2021 NFL draft. Whether or not the Cowboys move on from the head coach, this season has shown us all year, including Sunday's loss to Washington, how much change is needed. With the 2024 season in the books, the Cowboys' owner and general manager had plenty to say about the future — Jerry Jones holding court at AT&T Stadium. Plays that might be forgotten include a number of plays in which the Cowboys fell short inside the 20-yard line. With Trey Lance getting the start at quarterback, the Cowboys managed only one touchdown in six trips to the red zone, eventually falling to the Commanders, 23-19, in another fourth-quarter thriller. As @spags52 writes in his Friday column, no matter how difficult it may be, the show must go on one last time in this 2024 season. Here's a final look at Sunday's preview with the Commanders and Cowboys at AT&T Stadium. In the final \"Here We Goooo\" of the 2024 season, we look at how special teams plays, a reignited pass rush, and more can help the Cowboys cap off their year with a victory at home. Cowboys guard Tyler Smith earned his second straight Pro Bowl nomination in 2024, becoming the third guard in NFL history to make two Pro Bowls before turning 24 years old.

                "title": "Snow blower - Wikipedia",
                "content": "A snow blower or snowblower or snow thrower is a machine for removing snow from an area where it is problematic, such as a driveway, sidewalk, roadway, railroad track, ice rink, or runway. The commonly used term \"snow blower\" is a misnomer, as the snow is moved using an auger or impeller instead of being blown (by air). It can use either electric power (line power or battery), or a gasoline or diesel engine to throw snow to another location or into a truck to be hauled away. This is in contrast with the action of snow plows, which push snow to the front or side. Typically, the snow is discharged to one side, but most snow throwers have a movable chute that can direct snow across the full 180 degrees of motion in front of the appliance. Snow blowers range from the very small, capable of removing only a few inches (a few more cm) of light snow in an 18 to 20 in (457 to 508 mm) path, to the very large, mounted onto heavy-duty winter service vehicles and capable of moving 20-foot (6.10 m) wide, or wider, swaths of heavy snow up to 6 feet (1.83 m) deep. Snow blowers can generally be divided into two classes: single-stage and two-stage. On a single-stage snow blower, the auger (the paddle mechanism visible from the front) pulls snow into the machine and directs it out of a discharge chute. The auger contacts the ground, making single-stage snow blowers unsuitable for use on unpaved surfaces. On a two-stage snow blower, the auger pulls snow into the machine and feeds it into a high-speed impeller, which in turn directs it out of a discharge chute. Two-stage snow blowers can generally handle deeper snow depths than single-stage ones, and because their augers don't touch the ground, they can be used on unpaved surfaces. Depending on the design, snowblowers can be pressed into service throwing other things, such as water.[1] Robert Carr Harris of Maple Green, New Brunswick patented a \"Railway Screw Snow Excavator\" in 1870.[2] In 1923, Robert E. Cole patented a snowplow that operated by using cutters and a fan to blow snow from a surface.[3] Various other innovations also occurred.[4] However, it is Arthur Sicard [fr] (1876–1946) who is generally credited as the inventor of the first practical snow blower. In 1925 Sicard completed his first prototype, based on a concept he described in 1894.[5] He founded Sicard Industries in Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec and by 1927 his vehicles were in use removing snow from the roadways of the town of Outremont, now a borough of Montreal. His company is now a division of SMI-Snowblast, Inc. of Watertown, New York.[6] The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that each year there are approximately 5,740 snowblower related injuries in the United States which require medical attention.[7] One problem with the design of the snow blower is that snow can build up in the auger, jamming it and stalling the motor. This is complicated by the fact that the auger could deform before applying enough resistance to the motor to turn it off. If the jam is cleared by hand, it is possible for the auger to return to its natural shape suddenly and with great force, possibly injuring the operator. Snow blowers are a leading cause of traumatic hand and finger amputations.[8] The correct procedure is to turn off the engine, disengage the clutch and then clear the jam with a broom handle or other long object.[8] In an effort to improve safety, many manufacturers now include a plastic tool to be used to clear jams, often mounted directly to the snow blower. Most modern machines mitigate this problem by including a dead man's switch to prevent the mechanism from rotating when the operator is not at the controls; these may be mandatory in some jurisdictions. Jet engines and other gas turbines are used for large scale propelling and melting of snow over rails and roads. These blowers first were used in Russia and Canada in the 1960s, and were later introduced into the U.S. by the Boston Transportation Authority. The jet engine both melts and blows the snow, clearing the tracks faster than other methods. While offering considerably greater power in a relatively lightweight machine, this method is much more expensive than traditional snow removing methods. In Russia, the high cost is partially offset by utilizing retired military jet engines, such as the Klimov VK-1.[9][10][11]",

                "title": "Doug Pederson - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Douglas Irvin Pederson (born January 31, 1968) is an American professional football coach and former quarterback who was the head coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL). He spent most of his 13-season career as a backup to Brett Favre on the Green Bay Packers, where he was a member of the team that won Super Bowl XXXI. Pederson was also a backup to Dan Marino on the Miami Dolphins and a starter for the Philadelphia Eagles and Cleveland Browns until retiring in 2004. Pederson began his coaching career under Andy Reid, serving as an assistant for the Eagles from 2009 to 2012. After Reid became the head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2013, Pederson followed him to serve as the Chiefs' offensive coordinator. Pederson returned to the Eagles as their head coach in 2016, a position he held for five seasons. His most successful season with the Eagles was in 2017 when he won Super Bowl LII, the franchise's first Super Bowl title.[1] Pederson became the head coach of the Jaguars in 2022 and led them to their first division title and playoff victory since 2017 the same season. Pederson was born in Bellingham, Washington, in 1968. He was raised in nearby Ferndale, Washington, and attended Ferndale High School, and was an All-State selection in football, basketball, and baseball. His quarterback coach at Ferndale was Ray Ramsay.[2] After high school he graduated from Northeast Louisiana University, where he was quarterback from 1987 through 1990.[3] He still holds multiple passing records at the school.[4] Pederson originally signed as a rookie free agent by the Miami Dolphins on May 1, 1991,[5] out of Northeast Louisiana University (now University of Louisiana at Monroe) in Monroe, Louisiana.[6] He was waived on August 17, 1991, before the start of the regular season.[7] After spending the 1991 season as a free agent, the New York/New Jersey Knights of the World League of American Football (WLAF) drafted him in the fifth round for the first pool of draft-eligible players on February 4, 1992. The second pool, which was drafted from on February 20, consisted of players allocated by NFL teams to the league.[8] He was the backup quarterback to Reggie Slack with the Knights from March to May 1992.[9] After the WLAF season finished, he was re-signed by the Dolphins on June 2, 1992.[10] Pederson spent 1992 training camp with the Dolphins, before being released during final roster cuts again. He was subsequently re-signed to the team's practice squad, where he practiced on the scout team until he was waived on October 8, 1992.[11] He was re-signed by the Dolphins after the season on March 3, 1993.[12] After his third training camp with the Dolphins, he was waived again on August 31, 1993.[13] For the second consecutive season, Pederson was re-signed to the team's practice squad, on September 1, 1993.[14] Dan Marino, the Dolphins' starting quarterback since 1983, ruptured his Achilles' tendon in a week 6 game against the Cleveland Browns on October 10, 1993, forcing backup Scott Mitchell to replace him. Pederson replaced Marino on the active roster, and served as Mitchell's backup for the next four games. Pederson made his NFL debut on October 24, 1993, in a week 8 game against the Indianapolis Colts.[15] He helped head coach Don Shula win his NFL-record 325th victory as a coach when Mitchell suffered a separated shoulder in a week 11 game against the Philadelphia Eagles on November 14, 1993.[16] In that record breaking game for Coach Shula, Pederson entered in the third quarter of the game and went 3 for 6 for 34 yards while converting several crucial third downs.[17][18] Pederson was able to steer the Dolphins to the win. Pederson also served as the backup to recently acquired Steve DeBerg for the three games Mitchell missed with injury. He briefly entered a week 14 game against the New York Giants while DeBerg was receiving stitches on his face.[19] Mitchell returned as the Dolphins' starter after week 15, and Pederson was released in favor of backup DeBerg and third-string quarterback Hugh Millen on December 16, 1993.[20] Pederson re-signed with the Dolphins on April 16, 1994, after the season ended.[21] He spent the entire 1994 season on the Dolphins' active roster as the third-string quarterback behind Marino and Bernie Kosar. On February 15, 1995, Pederson was selected by the Carolina Panthers in the twenty-second round of the NFL Expansion Draft,[22] after being placed on the Dolphins' available players list on January 19,[23] but was released on May 24, 1995.[24] He returned to the World League after his release, playing with Rhein Fire. Pederson re-signed with the Dolphins again in June 1995.[25] After competing with Dan McGwire throughout training camp, Pederson was waived on August 22, 1995.[26] Marino suffered a knee injury during a week 6 game,[27] so Pederson was re-signed on October 10 to serve as the third quarterback behind Kosar and McGwire for the next two games.[28] He was released again after Marino returned for week 9 on October 24.[29] Pederson worked out for the Green Bay Packers following week 10 in 1995, due to a season-ending injury suffered by backup Ty Detmer and a minor injury sustained by starter Brett Favre. Third-string quarterback T. J. Rubley was forced to play in week 10 and threw a game-ending interception after calling an audible, going against head coach Mike Holmgren's playcall. The Packers signed Bob Gagliano to serve as the third-stringer quarterback for weeks 11 and 12.[30] Pederson replaced Gagliano as the third-string quarterback when he signed with the Packers on November 22, 1995.[31] The Packers claimed Jim McMahon off waivers from the Browns to serve as Favre's backup ahead of Pederson and Rubley on November 29, 1995.[32] Rubley was waived on December 13, leaving McMahon and Pederson as Favre's backups.[33] Favre did not miss any games, so Pederson did not see any game action for the Packers in 1995. Pederson served as the third quarterback behind Favre and McMahon in 1996, playing in one game but recorded no statistics. He received a Super Bowl ring following the Packers' win over the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI.[34] He re-signed with the Packers with a two-year contract on February 20, 1997.[35] Pederson was again the third quarterback throughout 1997, backing up Favre and Steve Bono. Pederson beat out Rick Mirer for the backup job to Favre, as well as the primary placekick holder job, in 1998. In a week 5 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, Pederson replaced Favre in the last five minutes of a blowout game, and threw two touchdowns in his place. However, Pederson suffered a broken jaw that knocked him out for the team's next four games.[36][37] Pederson signed a three-year, $4.5 million contract with the Philadelphia Eagles on February 18, 1999, to become the team's starting quarterback under new head coach Andy Reid, who was Pederson's quarterbacks coach in Green Bay from 1997 to 1998.[38] The Eagles drafted Donovan McNabb with the second overall pick in the 1999 NFL draft in April 1999, and Reid said Pederson would remain the starter until McNabb was ready to play.[39] In his nine starts for the Eagles, Pederson had a 2–7 record, a 51.6% completion rate, 1,168 passing yards, six touchdowns, and nine interceptions. In his first career start, a week 1 game against the Arizona Cardinals, Pederson threw two touchdowns in the first quarter to help give the Eagles a 21–0 lead. The Cardinals came back, however, and won the game on a field goal as time expired, 25–24. Pederson went 12-for-25 for 91 yards and two touchdowns in the game.[40] McNabb replaced Pederson, who suffered a bruised throwing shoulder, after one half in a week 2 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in which Pederson went 12-of-19 for 100 yards and an interception.[41] Pederson started a week 3 shutout loss (26–0) to the Buffalo Bills, going 14-of-26 for 137 yards and two lost fumbles, before being replaced by McNabb again in the fourth quarter.[42] In a week 4 loss to the New York Giants, Pederson went 6-for-15 for 75 yards and two interceptions before being replaced by McNabb after halftime.[43] Pederson's first NFL win came in week 5 in a game against the Dallas Cowboys. He played the entire game, going 11-of-29 for 145 yards, one touchdown, and one interception.[44] Pederson played the entirety of the next three games, posting a 1–2 record while throwing three touchdowns and three interceptions. In his final start as an Eagle, Pederson was benched at halftime of a week 9 game against the Carolina Panthers after going 3-of-9 for 28 yards and being down 23–0. He did not see game action at quarterback again until a week 14 game against the Cowboys in which McNabb suffered an injury in the fourth quarter. Pederson went 8-for-12 for 108 yards and a touchdown in the loss, and Koy Detmer received the start ahead of him in week 15 with McNabb still injured. After spending the next season's training camp with the team, the Eagles released Pederson on August 28, 2000.[45] Pederson considered retirement after being released by the Eagles, but instead signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland Browns on September 2, 2000.[46] The Browns' backup, Ty Detmer, suffered a season-ending injury, and the Browns needed a backup quarterback to starter Tim Couch. This was the second time in Pederson's career that he was signed to replace an injured Ty Detmer. Pederson started as the third quarterback behind Couch and Spergon Wynn, until Couch suffered a season-ending injury in week 7. Pederson started the next six games, posting a 1–5 record.[47] In a week 13 game against the Baltimore Ravens, he was knocked out of the game with bruised ribs and replaced with Wynn. Wynn started the next week against the Jacksonville Jaguars, but he suffered a season-ending injury and Pederson replaced him.[48] Pederson returned for the final two games of the season, losing both, including a 35–24 loss to his former team, the Eagles, and a 24–0 shutout loss to the Tennessee Titans. Pederson was released after the season on February 22, 2001.[29] The Packers re-signed Pederson to a one-year contract on March 13, 2001, to replace backup Matt Hasselbeck, who was traded to the Seattle Seahawks.[49] Pederson was the primary backup to Favre for the entire 2001 season, and was the primary placekick holder in every game. He was re-signed to a one-year, $650,000 contract with the Packers on April 2, 2002. Pederson again was the backup quarterback and primary holder in all 16 games in 2002. In a week 7 game against the Washington Redskins, Favre suffered a sprained knee and Pederson took most of the snaps in the second half, going 9-for-15 for 78 yards to help win the game 30–9.[50] Pederson also played in games against the Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, and New York Jets.[51] He re-signed with the Packers to a one-year, $750,000 contract on April 29, 2003.[52] For the third consecutive season, Pederson backed up Favre in all 16 games and held placekicks. He completed both of his passes during the regular season for a total of 16 yards. The Packers re-signed Pederson to a one-year contract on April 28, 2004.[53] Tim Couch was signed to compete for the backup quarterback job, but lost out to Pederson and was released on September 5, 2004.[54] In a week 3 game against the Indianapolis Colts, Pederson replaced Favre in a blowout loss and went 4-of-6 for 34 yards and an interception.[55] The next week, a week 4 game against the New York Giants, Favre sustained a concussion in the third quarter, and Pederson replaced him at quarterback. Pederson went 7-of-17 for 86 yards and an interception in the loss before he suffered a hit to his side in the third quarter that resulted in a cracked bone in his back, a torn muscle in his side, and a broken rib.[56][57] He stayed in the game up until the last snap, when he was replaced by third-string quarterback Craig Nall. Pederson was placed on injured reserve on October 7, ending his season.[58] He retired in March 2005 to become a head coach at Calvary Baptist Academy.[59] After his retirement, Pederson was hired as head coach of Calvary Baptist Academy, a private Christian high school in Shreveport, Louisiana.[59] Calvary was going into its second year as a program when Pederson signed on in March 2005. Pederson was the head coach at Calvary for four years, and held a 33–7 record in the regular season and an 8–3 record in the post-season. The Cavaliers were in the state playoffs all four years with Pederson as head coach. In his first season in 2005, the Cavaliers went 5–6 and lost in the first round of the state playoffs.[60] In 2007, he led the Cavaliers to the semi-finals and to their first district title. On January 29, 2009, Pederson was hired as the offensive quality control coach for the Philadelphia Eagles, reuniting him with his former head coach, Andy Reid.[61] He was promoted to quarterbacks coach on February 8, 2011, replacing James Urban, who was promoted to assistant offensive coordinator.[62] On January 11, 2013, Pederson followed Andy Reid to the Kansas City Chiefs to serve as offensive coordinator.[63] Following a 1–5 start in 2015, Andy Reid gave Pederson play calling duties, the Chiefs proceeded to win their last 10 games, which made Pederson a head coaching candidate for 2016.[64] On January 18, 2016, Pederson was hired as head coach of the Eagles replacing Chip Kelly.[65] Despite having Sam Bradford on the roster as the starting quarterback, the Eagles drafted Carson Wentz with the second overall pick in 2016.[66] Right before the 2016 season began, Bradford was traded to the Minnesota Vikings and Wentz was named the starting quarterback as a rookie.[67] Pederson and Wentz won their first three NFL games together, but finished the season 7–9, missing the playoffs.[68][69] Pederson's second season was much more successful as he led the Eagles to a 13–3 record, winning them the NFC East division championship and allotting them home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.[70] Wentz, who was having a career year and was considered a front runner for league MVP,[71][72] tore his ACL in Week 14, leaving backup Nick Foles with the starting job for the remainder of the year.[73] Despite becoming major playoff underdogs due to the loss of Wentz, Foles filled in admirably as the starter, allowing Philadelphia to make it to Super Bowl LII, their first Super Bowl appearance since the 2004 season.[74] Eventual Super Bowl MVP Foles led the team in a 41–33 win over the New England Patriots, giving them their first Lombardi Trophy in franchise history and their first league championship since 1960.[75][76] On May 3, 2018, it was reported the Philadelphia Eagles picked up Pederson's fifth-year option, allowing him to coach the team through 2020.[77] Later on that summer, it was reported that Pederson signed a contract extension through the 2022 NFL season.[78] Pederson's third season was not as successful as his previous one. The Eagles struggled with many injuries to their secondary and wide receivers. After starting 4–6 in their first 10 games the Eagles proceeded to win 5 of their last 6 games including upset victories over the Los Angeles Rams and Houston Texans. After winning their last game against the Washington Redskins and the Minnesota Vikings losing to the Chicago Bears, the Eagles made it back to the playoffs with a 9–7 record as the sixth seed.[79][80] The Eagles went on to upset third-seeded Chicago in a defensive showdown, 16–15.[81] During the final ten seconds of the game, Pederson called a timeout before Bears placekicker Cody Parkey could score the game-winning field goal, negating his successful attempt. Parkey missed on his subsequent kick in a play that became known as the Double Doink, securing Philadelphia's victory.[82] However, after a promising start to their Divisional Round game in New Orleans, the Eagles fell to the New Orleans Saints, 20–14.[83] This was Pederson's first career postseason loss as a head coach. The following season, the Eagles had multiple injuries for the second straight year. After starting 5–7 in the first 12 games, the Eagles managed to win their last 4 games and finished with a 9–7 record for the second consecutive year and their second NFC East division title in three years.[84] They subsequently lost to the Seattle Seahawks 17–9 in the Wild Card Round.[85] On August 2, 2020, Pederson tested positive for COVID-19 during training camp. He planned to communicate with the team virtually during his quarantine, and he relinquished day-to-day head coaching duties to assistant head coach Duce Staley in the interim.[86] Pederson returned to the team on August 12.[87] In the 2020 season, the Eagles had their third straight year of injuries, mainly on the offensive line. The Eagles reached a record 14 different offensive line combinations during the season. Pederson faced controversy during the Eagles' final game against the Washington Football Team when he pulled quarterback Jalen Hurts out for backup Nate Sudfeld in the third quarter while facing a three-point deficit. Philadelphia subsequently lost 20–14 to finish with a division-worst 4–11–1 record. Although Pederson said the decision was to give Sudfeld the opportunity to play, he was accused of deliberately losing the game to increase the Eagles' draft position.[88][89][90] While it was initially reported on January 2 that Pederson would return to the Eagles for the next season, on January 11, 2021, it was reported that Pederson and the Eagles organization were parting ways. Pederson finished his tenure in Philadelphia with a 42–37–1 (.531) regular season record, 4–2 (.667) playoff record and a 46–39–1 (.541) career record.[91] After reports that Pederson had discussions with the Seahawks about their open offensive coordinator position,[92] it was reported that Pederson would choose to take a year off from coaching in the 2021 season.[93] During the 2021 season, Pederson made visits to practices with the Colts and Bears and he was a contributor to The 33rd Team.[94] On February 4, 2022, Pederson was hired as head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars.[95] His first win with the Jaguars in Week 2 in a 24–0 defeat of the Indianapolis Colts.[96] In Week 4, Pederson returned to Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia for a game against his former team, the Philadelphia Eagles, who were the only remaining undefeated team that season. Despite the Jaguars getting an early 14–0 lead, the Eagles came back and won the game 29–21.[97] After the game, Pederson did a jersey/jacket swap with Eagles center Jason Kelce.[98] Despite starting the season 3–7, the Jaguars would come out of their bye-week winning six of their last seven games, finishing 9–8 and winning the division for the first time since 2017.[99] The Jaguars became the third team since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger to draft first overall then win their division in the following season, after the 2004 San Diego Chargers and 2008 Miami Dolphins.[100] In the Wild Card Round against the Los Angeles Chargers, the Jaguars committed five turnovers in the first half and found themselves down 27–0 in the second quarter, but they managed to rally and win 31–30 off a field goal by Riley Patterson in the final seconds.[101] The 27-point comeback was the third largest in NFL playoff history, and the largest in franchise history. The Jaguars also became the first team in NFL playoff history to win a playoff game with an in-game turnover margin of −5.[102] The Jaguars saw their season end in the next round with a 27–20 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round.[103] Before Jacksonville's December 4 appearance on Monday Night Football, their record was 8–3. The Jaguars eventually had a late-season collapse and lost four straight games. Following a loss to the Tennessee Titans in Week 18, the Jaguars fell to a final schedule of 9–8 and missed the playoffs and the chance to win the AFC South, finishing second behind the Houston Texans.[104] The Jaguars lost their first four games in 2024 and never got back on track. An embarrassing 52–6 loss to the Detroit Lions in Week 11 fueled public speculation that Pederson's job was in immediate jeopardy.[105] He continued to coach the Jaguars for the rest of the season, but was fired the morning after the team's final game, capping a 4–13 season that fell well short of expectations.[106] Pederson was born in Bellingham, Washington. A devout Christian,[107] Pederson and his wife Jeannie have three sons, including Josh, also a professional football player.[108] During his time with the Eagles, Pederson lived in Moorestown, New Jersey.[109][110] Three of Pederson's coaching assistants have become head coaches in the NFL, NCAA or USFL: # denotes interim head coach # denotes interim head coach",

                "content": "By Ignacio Cairola January 04, 2025 09:57AM EDT January 04, 2025 09:57AM EDT By Ignacio Cairola The Jacksonville Jaguars‘ 2024 NFL season was a complete frustration for fans and analysts who expected a good campaign from the team led by young star Trevor Lawrence. None of the expectations were met, and head coach Doug Pederson is thinking in his future. In early December 2024, Pederson had already said that the Jaguars’ season was disappointing and not what he and his players expected, in what was a major admission about the current state of the Jacksonville in the NFL. However, the 56-year-old head coach this time chose to go deeper in his statements. A 4-12 record plagued by poor results and mediocre performances is not something that comes close to being outstanding. Serious injuries suffered by Jaguars players throughout the season, such as the concussion of quarterback Lawrence, add to the list of unfortunate situations. In short, this combination led to Pederson’s in-depth analysis of the conditions for working on a team. As indicated by NFL insider Michael DiRocco on ESPN, Pederson said that the 2024 season was the most difficult he has had in his coaching career and also acknowledged that it could be his last. The shocking admission from the Super Bowl LII winner means that the game between the Jaguars and the Indianapolis Colts could be the last time he will be seen leading the Jags. Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Doug Pederson looks on during the game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Houston Texans on December 1, 2024 at EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville, Fl. According to DiRocco, Pederson gave a retrospective analysis of his career, anticipating a possible scenario outside of the Jaguars in his future. “If this is the last one, then I can look back and go, ‘Hey, it was a great run. You had a chance to do a lot of great things. You had a chance to win a Super Bowl. You’ve coached some great players. You played in this league for a long time’. see also Trevor Lawrence's net worth: How much money does the Jacksonville Jaguars QB have? It’s time for Jacksonville to turn the page after a poor season. Over the course of the season, the Jaguars suffered nine one-touchdown losses and did not beat a team with a winning record. They scored fewer than 18 points eight times and ranked last in the NFL in pass defense. Pederson’s attitude is understandable after a demoralizing ride. This is Pederson’s third season at the helm of the Jaguars, a campaign that will conclude when Jacksonville visits Indianapolis on Sunday afternoon in Week 18 at Lucas Oil Stadium. After the game, it will be interesting to see what happens with the 56-year-old head coach’s future. Ignacio Cairola is a bilingual sports journalist and writer fluent in English and Spanish.

                "title": "Jaguars fire Doug Pederson as head coach after three seasons; Jacksonville retains GM Trent Baalke - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Jacksonville Jaguars are back to square one at the head-coaching position as the club has fired Doug Pederson after three seasons with the organization, the team announced Monday. In the statement announcing the coaching change, Jaguars owner Shad Khan also relayed the team is retaining general manager Trent Baalke. \"I had the difficult task this morning of informing Doug Pederson of my intention to hire a new head coach to lead the Jacksonville Jaguars,\" Khan said in a statement released Monday morning. \"Doug is an accomplished football man who will undoubtedly enjoy another chapter in his impressive NFL career, and I will be rooting for Doug and his wife Jeannie when that occasion arrives. \"As much as Doug and I both wish his experience here in Jacksonville would have ended better, I have an obligation first and foremost to serve the best interests of our team and especially our fans, who faithfully support our team and are overdue to be rewarded. In that spirit, the time to summon new leadership is now.\" Meanwhile, Baalke retains his position after being promoted to GM in 2021. The 60-year-old has been with the organization since 2020 when he was initially hired as the director of player personnel. As Khan noted in his statement, Baalke will collaborate with ownership in their latest head coaching search. \"I strongly believe it is possible next season to restore the winning environment we had here not long ago,\" Khan continued. \"I will collaborate with General Manager Trent Baalke and others, within and close to our organization, to hire a leader who shares my ambition and is ready to seize the extraordinary opportunity we will offer in Jacksonville.\" Pederson was hired by Jacksonville in February of 2022 and tasked with getting the franchise back on track following the brief/failed tenure of Urban Meyer. It looked like Pederson would do just that out of the gate, leading the Jaguars to a 9-8 record and an AFC South title in Year 1. During that playoff run, Jacksonville erased a 27-point deficit to the Los Angeles Chargers to advance to the divisional round, where they'd fall to the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs. That success led to a high level of optimism heading into 2023, especially after the team jumped out to an 8-3 record after Week 12 of that season. It was at this juncture, however, that we can point to the start of Pederson's demise. The Jaguars would go on to lose five of their remaining six games that season to fall out of the playoffs entirely. Despite the collapse, Pederson retained his job heading into 2024 after an offseason of unprecedented investment by ownership. The Jaguars signed quarterback Trevor Lawrence to a five-year, $275 million contract, which had him tied with Joe Burrow as the highest-paid player in NFL history at the time of signing. Meanwhile, the club also signed Josh Hines-Allen to a five-year, $141.25 million extension as part of the organization's spending spree. Those extensions, along with an array of other signings, led Khan to dub this 2024 squad \"the best team assembled by the Jacksonville Jaguars ever.\" Khan followed that claim up with the mandate of \"winning now,\" which did not come to fruition. The Jaguars started the 2024 campaign 0-4 and won just two of their first 11 games before entering the Week 12 bye. In Week 13, Lawrence then suffered a concussion, which (along with a left shoulder injury) ultimately led to him being placed on injured reserve. The Jaguars finished the season 4-13. Pederson, who won a Super Bowl as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles in 2017, ends his tenure with the Jaguars with a 22-29 regular season record and a 1-1 playoff record. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "title": "Jaguars fire head coach Doug Pederson after three seasons",
                "content": "Digital Content Editor Once the savior of Duval County, Doug Pederson is now the latest head coach to go by the wayside in northeast Florida. The Jacksonville Jaguars have fired Pederson, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported on Monday, following a 4-13 season that fell seismically short of owner Shad Khan's expectations. Khan announced the news later Monday, adding that general manager Trent Baalke will be retained. \"I had the difficult task this morning of informing Doug Pederson of my intention to hire a new head coach to lead the Jacksonville Jaguars,\" Khan said. \"Doug is an accomplished football man who will undoubtedly enjoy another chapter in his impressive NFL career, and I will be rooting for Doug and his wife Jeannie when that occasion arrives. As much as Doug and I both wish his experience here in Jacksonville would have ended better, I have an obligation first and foremost to serve the best interests of our team and especially our fans, who faithfully support our team and are overdue to be rewarded. In that spirit, the time to summon new leadership is now. \"I strongly believe it is possible next season to restore the winning environment we had here not long ago. I will collaborate with General Manager Trent Baalke and others, within and close to our organization, to hire a leader who shares my ambition and is ready to seize the extraordinary opportunity we will offer in Jacksonville.\" Though Pederson's tenure lasted three full seasons, Monday's firing was a move anticipated for nearly two months. The ousting of Pederson was expected by many to come after an embarrassing Week 11 loss to the Detroit Lions, with Rapoport reporting on Nov. 16 that a defeat back then could signal another regime change for the Jags. Jacksonville was obliterated by the Detroit Lions on on Nov. 17, 52-6, the 46-point margin of defeat standing as the most in club history. Pederson stayed put, though, and as underwhelming as his final campaign was, he still led the club to more wins than each of the previous two seasons prior to his arrival. He ends his Jaguars tenure with a 22-29 record, having posted 9-8 marks in each of his first two seasons with an AFC South title and playoff win in 2022. Since 2012 when Khan became owner of the Jaguars, the franchise has gone through five head coaches, including Pederson, and reached the playoffs just twice. Pederson arrived just a few years after guiding the Philadelphia Eagles to their first and only Super Bowl victory. In Jacksonville, Pederson took on a rescue mission after the franchise had stumbled through a disastrous 3-14 2021 season in which Urban Meyer lasted less than a full year as head coach. Jacksonville rallied down the stretch in 2022 to make the playoffs and beat the Los Angeles Chargers in the Wild Card Round, and Trevor Lawrence made the Pro Bowl, seeming to have righted his trajectory after a lost rookie season. While Pederson's Jaguars had identical 9-8 marks in each of his first two seasons, they were polar opposites. The Jaguars collapsed in 2023, losing five of their final six to miss the postseason. In this past offseason, Khan tabbed the '23 season an \"organizational failure\" and minced no words in making it known he expected to win now with a roster he believed to be the best under his ownership. Lawrence, however, dealt with multiple injuries in 2024 and struggled with his play after signing a massive extension this offseason. Upon Pederson's arrival, the Jaguars went heavy in free agency with the signings of wide receivers Christian Kirk and Zay Jones, tight end Evan Engram, offensive lineman Brandon Scherff and linebacker Foye Oluokun. They've had varying levels of success, but it's hardly appeared to be the nucleus of a serious Super Bowl contender. The emergence of rookie wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr. stands as the brightest takeaway from the '24 campaign, but it won't be Pederson who shepherds his burgeoning career. The 2024 season was a struggle from the start, which saw the Jaguars open 0-4. The Jaguars suffered massive blowouts against the Bills and Lions, but for the most part have been handed agonizing defeats of the one-possession variety. The job security of Pederson, 56, has been a hot topic for months now, and what comes next for the veteran head coach remains to be seen. For the Jaguars, though, it's a familiar situation of starting all over again. Khan, during a virtual press conference on Monday, detailed what he believes the Jaguars are missing and what he'd like to see their new head coach bring to the table. \"Right now, we are the most predictable team on both sides of the ball. And football, you know, to win, deception is a big part of it,\" Khan said. \"Unpredictability. If you know exactly what we're going to do on offense and defense, you better have the 22 best players to help us win a football game. So, being unpredictable is, I think, is modern football and we have to be able to show that on the field.\" The Indianapolis Colts have fired defensive coordinator Gus Bradley following three seasons with the team. The Bears have requested permission from the Cowboys to interview McCarthy for their vacant head coaching position, NFL Network's Jane Slater reported. Raiders HC Antonio Pierce told reporters on Monday that he hasn't \"heard anything different\" regarding his job status in Las Vegas following the end of the regular season. Following just one season with the Patriots, Jerod Mayo, the heir apparent to Bill Belichick, was fired on Sunday. Owner Robert Kraft explained his decision on Monday. Packers receiver Christian Watson is believed to have suffered a torn ACL during Green Bay's Week 18 loss to the Chicago Bears, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported. The Seattle Seahawks fired OC Ryan Grubb after one season, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported Monday.

A minor upswing to close the season couldn't save Lou Anarumo's job. The Cincinnati Bengals fired the defensive coordinator on Monday, per NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport. Few will give these Broncos, led by rookie quarterback Bo Nix, a chance at upsetting a Bills squad making its sixth consecutive playoff appearance. Don't tell Sean Payton his upstart club has not shot. Despite finishing with one of the worst records in the NFL in 2024, the Giants are keeping their head coach and general manager as Brian Daboll and Joe Schoen will return to New York in 2025, co-owner John Mara announced Monday morning. Carolina quarterback Bryce Young diced up the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, throwing three touchdown passes with a 123.5 passer rating, both career highs, in a 44-38 road win. Afterward, owner David Tepper declared the Panthers might just have their QB.",

                "title": "Rum - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Rum is a liquor made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses or sugarcane juice. The distillate, a clear liquid, is often aged in barrels of oak. Rum originated in the Caribbean in the 17th century, but today it is produced in nearly every major sugar-producing region of the world. Rums are produced in various grades. Light rums are commonly used in cocktails, whereas \"golden\" and \"dark\" rums were typically consumed straight or neat, iced (\"on the rocks\"), or used for cooking, but are now commonly consumed with mixers. Premium rums are made to be consumed either straight or iced. Rum plays a part in the culture of most islands of the West Indies as well as the Maritime provinces and Newfoundland, in Canada. It has associations with the Royal Navy (where it was mixed with water or beer to make grog) and piracy (where it was consumed as bumbo).[citation needed] Rum has served as a medium of economic exchange, used to help fund enterprises such as slavery via triangular trade, organized crime, and military insurgencies such as the American Revolution and the Australian Rum Rebellion. The origin of the word \"rum\" is unclear. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that it is related to \"rumbullion\", a beverage made from boiling sugar cane stalks,[1] or possibly \"rumbustion,\" which was a slang word for \"uproar\" or \"tumult\";[2][3] a noisy uncontrollable exuberance,[1] though the origin of those words and the nature of the relationship are unclear.[4][5][2] Both words surfaced in English about the same time as rum did (1651 for \"rumbullion\", and before 1654 \"rum\").[4] There have been various other theories: Regardless of the original source, the name was already in common use by 1654, when the General Court of Connecticut ordered the confiscations of \"whatsoever Barbados liquors, commonly called rum, kill the devil and the like\".[8] A short time later in May 1657, the General Court of Massachusetts also decided to make illegal the sale of strong liquor \"whether knowne by the name of rumme, strong water, wine, brandy, etc\".[6] In current usage, the name used for a rum is often based on its place of origin. For rums from places mostly in Latin America where Spanish is spoken, the word ron is used. A ron añejo (\"aged rum\") is a premium spirit. Rhum is the term that typically distinguishes rum made from fresh sugar cane juice from rum made from molasses in French-speaking locales like Martinique.[9] A rhum vieux (\"old rum\") is an aged French rum that meets several other requirements. Some of the many other names for rum are Nelson's blood, kill-devil, demon water, pirate's drink, navy neater, and Barbados water.[10] A version of rum from Newfoundland is referred to by the name screech, while some low-grade West Indies rums are called tafia.[11] Many historians now believe that rum-making found its way to the Caribbean islands along with sugarcane and its cultivation methods from Brazil.[19] The traditional history of modern-style rum tells of its invention in the Caribbean, in the 17th century, by slaves on sugarcane plantations, who discovered that molasses, a by-product of the sugar refining process, could be fermented into alcohol, and then distilled. The earliest record, in a 1651 document from Barbados, mentions the island of Nevis in particular:[20] \"The chief fuddling they make in the island is Rumbullion, alias Kill-Divil, and this is made of sugar canes distilled, a hot, hellish, and terrible liquor.\" By the late 17th century rum had replaced French brandy as the exchange alcohol of choice in the triangle trade. Canoemen and guards on the African side of the trade, who had previously been paid in brandy, were now paid in rum.[19] After the development of rum in the Caribbean, the drink's popularity spread to Colonial North America. To support the demand for the drink, the first rum distillery in the Thirteen Colonies was set up in 1664 on Staten Island. Boston, Massachusetts, had a distillery three years later.[21] The manufacture of rum became early colonial New England's largest and most prosperous industry.[22] New England became a distilling center due to the technical, metalworking and cooperage skills and abundant lumber; the rum produced there was lighter, more like whiskey. Much of the rum was exported, and distillers in Newport of Rhode Island even made an extra strong rum specifically to be used as a slave currency.[19] Rhode Island rum even joined gold as an accepted currency in Europe for a period of time.[23] While New England triumphed in price and consistency, Europeans still viewed the best rums as coming from the Caribbean.[19] Estimates of rum consumption in the American colonies before the American Revolutionary War had every man, woman, or child drinking an average of 3 imperial gallons (14 L) of rum each year.[24] In the 18th century, ever increasing demands for sugar, molasses, rum, and slaves led to a feedback loop that intensified the triangular trade.[25] When France banned the production of rum in their New World possessions to end the domestic competition with brandy, New England distillers were then able to undercut producers in the British West Indies by buying cut-rate molasses from French sugar plantations. The outcry from the British rum industry led to the Molasses Act 1733, which levied a prohibitive tax on molasses imported into the Thirteen Colonies from foreign countries or colonies. Rum at this time accounted for approximately 80% of New England's exports, and paying the duty would have put the distilleries out of business: as a result, both compliance with and enforcement of the act were minimal.[19] Strict enforcement of the Molasses Act's successor, the Sugar Act 1764, may have helped cause the American Revolution.[24] In the slave trade, rum was also used as a medium of exchange. For example, the slave Venture Smith (whose history was later published) had been purchased in Africa, for four gallons of rum plus a piece of calico. In \"The Doctor's Secret Journal\", an account of the happenings at Fort Michilimackinac in northern Michigan from 1769 to 1772 by Daniel Morison, a surgeon's mate, noted that there was not much for the men to do and drinking rum was very popular.[26] In fact, Ensign Robert Johnstone, one of the officers, \"thought proper to turn trader by selling (the) common rum to the soldiers & all others by whom he might gain a penny in this clandestine Manner.\" To conceal this theft, \"he was observed to have filled up several Barrels of common rum with boiling water to make up the Leakage.\"[26]: 26 Ensign Johnstone had no trouble selling this diluted rum. The popularity of rum continued after the American Revolution; George Washington insisting on a barrel of Barbados rum at his 1789 inauguration.[27] Rum started to play an important role in the political system; candidates attempted to influence the outcome of an election through their generosity with rum. The people would attend the hustings to see which candidate appeared more generous. The candidate was expected to drink with the people to show he was independent and truly a republican.[28][29] Eventually, the restrictions on sugar imports from the British West Indies, combined with the development of American whiskeys, led to a decline in the drink's popularity in North America. Rum's association with piracy began with English privateers' trading in the valuable commodity. Some of the privateers became pirates and buccaneers, with a continuing fondness for rum; the association between the two was only strengthened by literary works such as Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island.[30] The association of rum with the Royal Navy began in 1655 when a Royal Navy fleet captured the island of Jamaica. With the availability of domestically produced rum, the British changed the daily ration of liquor given to seamen from French brandy to rum.[31] Navy rum was originally a blend mixed from rums produced in the West Indies. It was initially supplied at a strength of 100 degrees (UK) proof, 57% alcohol by volume (ABV), as that was the only strength that could be tested (by the gunpowder test) before the invention of the hydrometer.[32] The term \"Navy strength\" is used in modern Britain to specify spirits bottled at 57% ABV.[32] In 1866 the Navy fixed the issued strength at 95.5 proof (defined as \"4.5 under-Proof\", equal to 54.6% ABV).[33] While the ration was originally given neat or mixed with lime juice, the practice of watering down the rum began around 1740. To help minimize the effect of the alcohol on his sailors, Admiral Edward Vernon had the rum ration watered, producing a mixture that became known as grog. Many believe the term was coined in honour of the grogram cloak Admiral Vernon wore in rough weather.[34] The Royal Navy continued to give its sailors a daily rum ration, known as a \"tot\", until the practice was abolished on 31 July 1970.[35] Today, a tot (totty) of rum is still issued on special occasions, using an order to \"splice the mainbrace\", which may only be given by a member of the royal family or, on certain occasions, the admiralty board in the UK, with similar restrictions in other Commonwealth navies.[36] Recently, such occasions have included royal marriages or birthdays, or special anniversaries. In the days of daily rum rations, the order to \"splice the mainbrace\" meant double rations would be issued. A legend involving naval rum and Horatio Nelson says that following his victory and death at the Battle of Trafalgar, Nelson's body was preserved in a cask of rum to allow transportation back to England. Upon arrival, however, the cask was opened and found to be empty of rum. The [pickled] body was removed and, upon inspection, it was discovered that the sailors had drilled a hole in the bottom of the cask and drunk all the rum, hence the term \"Nelson's blood\" being used to describe rum. It also serves as the basis for the term tapping the admiral being used to describe surreptitiously sucking liquor from a cask through a straw. The details of the story are disputed, as many historians claim the cask contained French brandy, whilst others claim instead the term originated from a toast to Admiral Nelson.[37] Variations of the story, involving different notable corpses, have been in circulation for many years. The official record states merely that the body was placed in \"refined spirits\" and does not go into further detail.[38] The Royal New Zealand Navy was the last naval force to give sailors a free daily tot of rum. The Royal Canadian Navy still gives a rum ration on special occasions; the rum is usually provided out of the commanding officer's fund and is 150 proof (75%). The order to \"splice the mainbrace\" (i.e. take rum) can be given by the King as commander-in-chief, as occurred on 29 June 2010, when previous monarch Queen Elizabeth II gave the order to the Royal Canadian Navy as part of the celebration of their 100th anniversary. Rum became an important trade good in the early period of the colony of New South Wales. The value of rum was based upon the lack of coinage among the population of the colony, and due to the drink's ability to allow its consumer to temporarily forget about the lack of creature comforts available in the new colony. The value of rum was such that convict settlers could be induced to work the lands owned by officers of the New South Wales Corps. Due to rum's popularity among the settlers, the colony gained a reputation for drunkenness, though their alcohol consumption was less than levels commonly consumed in England at the time.[39] Australia was so far away from Britain that the penal colony, established in 1788, faced severe food shortages, compounded by poor conditions for growing crops and the shortage of livestock. Eventually, it was realized that it might be cheaper for India, instead of Britain, to supply the settlement of Sydney. By 1817, two out of every three ships which left Sydney went to Java or India, and cargoes from Bengal fed and equipped the colony. Casks of Bengal Rum (which was reputed to be stronger than Jamaican Rum, and not so sweet) were brought back in the depths of nearly every ship from India. The cargoes were floated ashore clandestinely before the ships docked, by the Royal Marines regiment which controlled the sales. It was against the direct orders of the governors, who had ordered the searching of every docking ship. British merchants in India grew wealthy by sending ships to Sydney \"laden half with rice and half with bad spirits\".[40] Rum was intimately involved in the only military takeover of an Australian government, known as the Rum Rebellion. When William Bligh became governor of the colony, he attempted to remedy the perceived problem of drunkenness by outlawing the use of rum as a medium of exchange. In response to Bligh's attempt to regulate the use of rum, in 1808, the New South Wales Corps marched with fixed bayonets to Government House and placed Bligh under arrest. The mutineers continued to control the colony until the arrival of Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1810.[41] In India, rum was not traditionally produced as the production processes used to make jaggery from sugarcane do not produce molasses as a by-product. Rum was not produced in India commercially until the introduction of cane sugar production processes which did. The production of spirits along with the core commodity of sugar allowed for these plantations to have high economic returns. Production expanded rapidly to meet both domestic and export markets (however exports to Great Britain were restricted by protectionist policies). Rum production continued after the end of the colonial era. Today, most spirits produced in India labeled as whisky, vodka, and gin are made with a neutral rum derived base. Old Monk is the primary brand of dark rum consumed in contemporary India.[42] Commercial rum production was introduced into Taiwan along with commercial sugar production during the Japanese colonial period. Rum production continued under the Republic of China, however, it was neglected by Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation which held the national liquor monopoly.[43] The industry diversified after privatization and the de-monopolization of the Taiwanese alcoholic beverage industry.[44] Dividing rum into meaningful groupings is complicated because no single standard exists for what constitutes rum. Instead, rum is defined by the varying rules and laws of the nations producing the spirit. The differences in definitions include issues such as spirit proof, minimum ageing, and even naming standards. Mexico requires rum be aged a minimum of eight months; the Dominican Republic, Panama and Venezuela require two years. Naming standards also vary. Argentina defines rums as white, gold, light, and extra light. Grenada and Barbados use the terms white, overproof, and matured, while the United States defines rum, rum liqueur, and flavored rum.[45] In Australia, rum is divided into dark or red rum (underproof known as UP, overproof known as OP, and triple distilled) and white rum. Despite these differences in standards and nomenclature, the following divisions are provided to help show the wide variety of rums produced. Within the Caribbean, each island or production area has a unique style. For the most part, these styles can be grouped by the language traditionally spoken. Due to the overwhelming influence of Puerto Rican rum, most rum consumed in the United States is produced in the \"Spanish-speaking\" style. Cachaça is a spirit similar to rum that is produced in Brazil. Cachaca also comes from sugar cane. Some countries, including the United States, classify cachaça as a type of rum. Seco, from Panama, is also a spirit similar to rum, which is triple distilled, similar to some vodka. Mexico produces a number of brands of light and dark rum, as well as other less-expensive flavored and unflavored sugarcane-based liquors, such as aguardiente de caña and charanda. Aguardiente is also the name for unaged distilled cane spirit in some, primarily Spanish-speaking countries since their definition of rum includes at least two years of ageing in wood. A spirit known as aguardiente, distilled from molasses and often infused with anise, with additional sugarcane juice added after distillation, is produced in Central America and northern South America.[49] In West Africa, and particularly in Liberia, 'cane juice' (also known as Liberian rum[50] or simply CJ within Liberia itself[51]) is a cheap, strong spirit distilled from sugarcane, which can be as strong as 43% ABV (86 proof).[52] A refined cane spirit has also been produced in South Africa since the 1950s, simply known as cane or \"spook\". Within Europe, in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, a similar spirit made from sugar beet is known as Tuzemak. In Germany, a cheap substitute for genuine dark rum is called Rum-Verschnitt (literally: blended or \"cut\" rum). This drink is made of genuine dark rum (often high-ester rum from Jamaica), rectified spirit, and water. Very often, caramel coloring is used, too. The relative amount of genuine rum it contains can be quite low since the legal minimum is only 5%. In Austria, a similar rum called Inländerrum or domestic rum is available. However, Austrian Inländerrum is always a spiced rum, such as the brand Stroh; German Rum-Verschnitt, in contrast, is never spiced or flavored. The grades and variations used to describe rum depend on the location where rum was produced. Despite these variations, the following terms are frequently used to describe various types of rum: Unlike some other spirits, rum has no defined production methods. Instead, rum production is based on traditional styles that vary between locations and distillers. Sugarcane is traditionally collected by sugarcane machete[55] cutters who cut the cane near to the ground, where the largest concentration of sugars is found, before lopping off the green tips. A good cutter can cut three tons of cane per day on average, but this is a small fraction of what a machine can cut. Therefore mechanised harvesting is now utilized. Sugarcane comprises around 63% to 73% water, 12% to 16% soluble sugar, 2% to 3% non-sugars, and 11% to 16% fiber.[56] To extract the water and sugar juice, the harvested cane is cleaned, sliced into small lengths, and milled (pressed). Most rum is produced from molasses, which is made from sugarcane. A rum's quality is dependent on the quality and variety of the sugar cane that was used to create it. The sugar cane's quality depends on the soil type and climate that it was grown in. Within the Caribbean, much of this molasses is from Brazil.[27] A notable exception is the French-speaking islands, where sugarcane juice is the preferred base ingredient.[1] In Brazil itself, the distilled alcoholic drink derived from cane juice is distinguished from rum and called cachaça.[57] Yeast and water are added to the base ingredient to start the fermentation process.[58] While some rum producers allow wild yeasts to perform the fermentation, most use specific strains of yeast to help provide a consistent taste and predictable fermentation time.[59] Dunder, the yeast-rich foam from previous fermentations, is the traditional yeast source in Jamaica.[60] \"The yeast employed will determine the final taste and aroma profile,\" says Jamaican master blender Joy Spence.[1] Distillers that make lighter rums, such as Bacardi, prefer to use faster-working yeasts.[1] The use of slower-working yeasts causes more esters to accumulate during fermentation, allowing for a fuller-tasting rum.[59] Fermentation products like 2-ethyl-3-methyl butyric acid and esters like ethyl butyrate and ethyl hexanoate give rise to the sweetness and fruitiness of rum.[61] The fermented product is then distilled. As with all other aspects of rum production, no standard method is used for distillation. While some producers work in batches using pot stills, most rum production is done using column still distillation.[59] Pot still output contains more congeners than the output from column stills, so produces fuller-tasting rums.[1] Many countries require rum to be aged for at least one year.[62] This ageing is commonly performed in used bourbon casks,[59] but may also be performed in other types of wooden casks or stainless-steel tanks. The ageing process determines the colour of the rum. When aged in oak casks, it becomes dark, whereas rum aged in stainless steel tanks remains virtually colourless. Due to the tropical climate common to most rum-producing areas, rum matures at a much faster rate than is typical for whisky or brandy (i.e. achieving a similar level of maturity takes considerably less time). An indication of this higher rate is the angels' share, or the amount of product lost to evaporation. While products aged in France or Scotland see about a 2% loss each year, tropical rum producers may see as much as 10%.[59] After ageing, rum is normally blended to ensure a consistent flavour, the final step in the rum-making process.[63] During blending, light rums may be filtered to remove any colour gained during ageing. For dark rums, caramel may be added for colour. There have been attempts to match the molecular composition of aged rum in significantly shorter time spans with artificial ageing using heat and light.[64] Besides rum punches, cocktails such as the Cuba libre and daiquiri have stories of their invention in the Caribbean. Tiki bars in the U.S. helped expand rum's horizons with inventions such as the mai tai, the long island iced tea,[65] the Jungle Bird from Malaysia[66] and the zombie. Other cocktails containing rum include the piña colada, a drink made popular in America by Rupert Holmes' song \"Escape\",[67] the mojito, and a precursor of the classic Spanish sangria known as sangaree.[68] Cold-weather drinks made with rum include the rum toddy and hot buttered rum.[69] A number of local specialties also use rum, including Bermuda's Dark 'n' Stormy (Gosling's Black Seal rum with ginger beer), the Painkiller from the British Virgin Islands, and a New Orleans cocktail known as the Hurricane. Jagertee is a mixture of rum and black tea popular in colder parts of Central Europe and served on special occasions in the British Army, where it is called Gunfire. Ti' Punch, French Creole for \"petit punch\", is a traditional drink in parts of the French West Indies. Rum may also be used as a base in the manufacture of liqueurs and syrups, such as falernum and most notably, Mamajuana. Rum is used in a number of cooked dishes as a flavoring agent in items such as rum balls or rum cakes. It is commonly used to macerate fruit used in fruitcakes and is also used in marinades for some Caribbean dishes. Rum is also used in the preparation of rumtopf, bananas Foster, and some hard sauces. Rum is sometimes mixed into ice cream, often with raisins (creating a flavor called rum raisin), and in baking, it is occasionally used in Joe Froggers, a type of cookie from New England.",
