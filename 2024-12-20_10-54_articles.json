                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Denver Broncos (9-5) are 30 minutes away from their first playoff appearance since the 2015 season when they won Super Bowl 50 in Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning's swan song. If they can hold on to their 21-13 halftime lead in Los Angeles against the Chargers (8-6), the Broncos will end their eight-season postseason drought, which is the longest playoff dry spell in NFL history following a team's Super Bowl victory. Both teams entered Week 16 tied atop the NFL, along with the Philadelphia Eagles, for the league's best scoring defense, allowing 17.6 points per game. Denver's offense, however, didn't have any issue moving the ball against the host Chargers' No. 1 scoring defense in the first two quarters, scoring touchdowns on each of their first three drives. The first concluded with a 3-yard rushing touchdown by fifth-round rookie running back Audric Estime; the next two were a 1-yard touchdown pass from first-round rookie quarterback Bo Nix to fullback Michael Burton, and another touchdown pass, a 6-yard strike, from Nix to seventh-round rookie wide receiver Devaughn Vele. The Broncos converted each of their first three third downs, needing 2 yards, 9 yards and 11 yards to move the chains each time. Nix opened the game with completions on 15 of his first 21 passes for 155 yards and two touchdowns. Fifty-three of those yards came on a short receiver screen toward the left sideline to Marvin Mims Jr. that led the Broncos offense down to a first-and-goal at the 6. Two plays later, Denver was in the end zone for the third time with Nix's scoring strike to Vele. Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert put together a mostly efficient half passing, throwing for 140 yards on 12 of 15 passing, but Los Angeles' offense struggled to move the chains on third down, converting on just three of its six third-down opportunities. Los Angeles reached as far as the Broncos' 26 just before halftime, but Herbert tossed an interception to Denver fifth-round rookie cornerback Kris Abrams-Draine while attempting to target wide receiver Joshua Palmer over the middle. The Chargers scored their sole touchdown of the half on a 1-yard rushing score by running back Gus Edwards on their second drive of the game. They ended the half with a 57-yard field goal off the first fair-catch kick since 1976 from Cameron Dicker after the Broncos committed a fair catch interference penalty on a punt with no time left on the clock to trim their deficit to one possession. Will the Broncos pull away in the second half after opening the third quarter with the football? Or will the Chargers pull off a miraculous comeback? Stay tuned to our live blog below to find out. In case you're wondering... It's not every day that you see one of these. Because the half ended on a fair catch, and because there was a personal-foul penalty on the catch, the Chargers got the opportunity to kick a free field goal and Cameron Dicker nailed it to make this a one-score game at the half. Really, really poor clock management from the Broncos made that possible. Well there that goes! Kris Abrams-Draine just made a terrific play on a Herbert pass up the seam and came away with an interception. Just cut right in front of the receiver and snatched it out of the air. Only Herbert's third pick of the season. Justin Herbert (12-14 for 141 yards) has been just as effective as Bo Nix (14-19, 158 yards, 2 TD) on a per-dropback basis so far. The difference here is Gus Edwards has 18 yards on his 8 carries and the Broncos' backs are averaging over 5 yards per carry, so Denver's drives have sustained in a way L.A.'s haven't. That sack by Bosa was enough to get L.A. its first stop of the night. Nix's third-down pass for Vele was tapped up into the air. No defenders in the area or else it might've had a chance to get picked. Now Herbert can cut this to a one-score lead before the half and make it a very different game. With 4:13 left in the second quarter, the Broncos finally had their first negative play of the night. Joey Bosa dropped Bo Nix for a sack. The Chargers go three-and-out this time, and now Denver has a chance to make it a three-score game. Also, Gus Edwards is getting looked at by trainers. Wheels might be starting to come off for the Chargers here. Two pretty egregious missed calls in favor of the Broncos so far, with the personal foul on their opening drive and the missed illegal man downfield on that last touchdown. Stop me if you've heard this before: The Broncos easily marched right down the field and scored a touchdown. 6 plays, 70 yards, 2:28, zero negative plays, and Devaughn Vele with the score this time. It looked like we were on our way to a fourth consecutive touchdown drive, but the Broncos stuffed Gus Edwards behind the line of scrimmage on a third-and-1 opportunity and Jim Harbaugh decided to send the field goal team out there. The way this Broncos offense looks so far, that might be a pretty big mistake. The Chargers need all the points they can get if they want to keep pace. (And you shouldn't really be kicking on fourth-and-3 from the 19 in the first place.) Once again, Denver got whatever it wanted on a relatively easy touchdown drive. Bo Nix threw two incomplete passes but every other play gained positive yards. The touchdown came on a play-action bootleg concept with FB Michael Burton sneaking out into the flat. Extremely easy stuff. Significantly more effective second drive for the Chargers. They marched right down the field just as efficiently as Denver did on its first possession. Justin Herbert is now 4 of 4 for 43 yards, with the big plays on the drive being completions to Josh Palmer and Scott Matlock, plus a 19-yard run by Kimani Vidal before Gus Edwards punched it into the end zone from the 1-yard line. The Chargers are incredibly banged up in the secondary and could now be without yet another safety. The Amazon broadcast reported that Maye has an ankle injury and headed to the X-ray room. Quick, efficient work for the Broncos on that first possession. They gained positive yards on every snap. 10 plays, 72 yards, 5:56 off the clock and Estime's first career touchdown from 3 yards out. The Broncos have not been very good at running the ball this season (23rd in the NFL in yards per carry), but are finding plenty of success on the ground on their first drive. The Chargers have yielded 4.7 yards per carry to opponents, so this early success makes some sense. Not a particularly inspiring opening drive for L.A. There was not much room for Gus Edwards on either first or second down, and then a flip to Derius Davis on third down went nowhere. Broncos will have a chance to take an early lead here. L.A. down a pair of defensive backs, plus TE Will Dissly. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

                "content": "WE ARE BACK IN SOFI FOR THE SECOND HALF OF ACTION!!!! So this is it. It's been almost 50 years since we have seen a Fair Catch Kick, but Cameron Dicker makes history and closes the gap to 8 points before the halftime break. Herbert and the Chargres looked like they might put some points on the board before the half but his pass to the end zone was picked by Kris Abrams-Draine. The Chargers would get a chance to put points on the board in one of the strangest plays you probably haven't seen before in your life before tonight. After Marvin Mims took a WR screen 55 yards down the left sideline, the Broncos would be set up Nix with a chance to find Devaughn Vele this TD pass as Denver started the game scoring TDs on their first three drives. Nix and the Broncos would ease back down the field again and score another TD on their second drive. This time the Broncos opened up the passing game a bit and it was the fullback Michael Burton who made the short catch for a TD. The Chargers answered back after going three and out on their opening drive. Herbert marched his guys down the field and Gus Edwards punched in the TD. He's got 18 yards and Kimani Vidal leads LA with 22 on two rushes. The Chargers came out grounding and pounding. They ran the ball 7 times on their 10 play opening drive and the first TD was punched in by Audric Estime. The Broncos have 89 yards rushing by comittee. Estime leads all five rushers with 30 yards. WE ARE HEADING TO THE HALFTIME BREAK WITH THE BRONCOS UP 21-13. The Chargers line up for a free kick to end the half. That means LA got a field goal chance on what looked more like a kickoff return.

These two teams are in playoff position because of their defenses. Unfortunately the Chargers defense has been getting exposed over the last few weeks as they play tougher and tougher opponents as the weeks go on. The Broncos are trending in the right direction and I think they are the better team. They are more complete. They have more ways to hurt you and they have gotten better since they lost to the Chargers earlier in the year, where LA has gotten worse. I think the Broncos win in a low scoring, defense struggle. AFC Standings heading into Week 16 Taking a look at the AFC standings, we see the Kansas City Chiefs at the top of the conference with a record of 13-1. They have clinched the AFC West for the ninth straight year. That means that these two teams playing tonight will have to settle for a Wild Card spot. The Broncos and the Ravens are currently tied at 9-5 but the Broncos lost to the Ravens earlier this season so Baltimore would get the top Wild Card spot if the season ended today. The Chargers currently have the third and final Wild Card spot, and are trying to fend off the 6-8 Dolphins, 6-8 Bengals and the 6-8 Colts. The Broncos are in the playoffs with a win today, while the Chargers can get into the playoffs with a win and a some help this weekend. If they win and the Dolphins and Colts lose, they are in. For the Chargers portion of the star watch, we highlight a star that hasn’t really been playing like a star this season. Herbert teamed up with new coach Jim Harbaugh who is know as a QB coaching savant. While his numbers haven’t been great, he also hasn’t made a whole lot of mistakes. He has 16 TDs and just 2 INTs while throwing for 2,959 yards. Modest, but clean numbers for a QB who saw a lot of his top weapons depart in the offseason. The other thing that Herbert has done this season is stay pretty healthy. In previous seasons he has battled injury after injury and despite playing and fighting through pain that has affected his play and his numbers. Last year he played just 13 games and passed for under 4,000 yards for the first time in his career. That looks like it will happen again this year, but if the Charger can make the playoffs, we know that he can turn it on at any point and with a defense like LA’s that could be trouble for teams in the postseason. Jim Harbaugh’s first year in LA has had it’s peaks and valleys but one thing has remained a constant for most of the year. The Chargers defense. They didn’t give up more than 20 points in their first 10 games of the season and in that time they went 7-3. Aside from their win over the Chargers, they really hadn’t beat a good, over .500 team. They have had a tough stretch of games over the last month, and have gone 1-3 in their last four games beating the Falcons but losing against the Ravens, Chiefs and then the Bucs last week. They are in great position to get a playoff spot, but the way they are playing should concern Jim Harbaugh and the Chargers fans. After a disastrous season last year, the Broncos and Sean Payton got rid of Russell Wilson and drafted rookie QB Bo Nix to be their face of the future. Expectations were realistic, and no one really though this team would be in this position already. Denver lost their first two games as Bo Nix looked like a rookie QB who wasn’t quite ready for the speed of the game. They would win five of their next six games, only losing to this Chargers team during that stretch and Nix looked like he was starting to find his groove. A couple of tough games against the Chiefs and Ravens gave them a bit of a reality dose but they would bounce back and win their next four games against the Falcons, Raiders, Browns and Colts to find themself in the drivers seat for a playoff spot in the AFC. The Chargers locked horns with another team in the chase for the playoffs, but only one team showed up and played like a playoff team. It wasn’t the Chargers. LA actually led in the first half, after the defense picked off Baker Mayfield and Justin Herbert connected with Quinton Johnston on the second of his two TD passes, but the LA offense would shut down after that. Baker and the Bucs switch on in the second half and scored 27 unanswered points to win 40-17. Herbert ended the game 21/33 with 195 yards and 2 TDs with 1 INT, but it wasn’t enough for the Chargers who are still waiting for their offense to turn on before they face a do or die situation in the playoffs, or before that. The defense is the star of the show for the Broncos, but in this part of the preview we would be remiss if we did highlight Bo Nix in the star watch section. Nix put himself in contention and is a real candidate for the rookie of the year after a fantastic stretch in which he had stretch of games in which he threw 16 TDs and just two INTs. It was a rough start to the season, as the rookie threw zero TDs and four picks in the first two weeks of the season, but Sean Payton took the first year QB under wing and has turned him into a fantastic quarterback that is leading his team to the playoffs in his first year. Nix has 2,972 yards, 20 TDs and 11 INTs, and while his passing stats are impressive it’s his legs that many teams don’t account for. He has 327 yards rushing and 4 TDs and has shown he can change the game by scrambling and stretching a defense out. He may or may not win ROTY, but he will be more than happy getting his team to the playoffs in his first year. The Broncos came off of their Week 14 BYE and looked a little sluggish in the first half of their game against the Colts. They went down 10-0 early in the second quarter and rookie Bo Nix was far from perfect, throwing three interceptions, but like they have done so often this year, the Denver defense bailed them out. They turned the Colts over five times, and none of those turnovers were bigger than the pick six that Nick Bonitto took to the house on a disastrous trick play for Indianapolis. Denver scored 21 points in the fourth quarter and won the game 31-13 to improve to 9-5. Hello everyone and welcome to Los Angeles where the Chargers are in good position to get a Wild Card but they can be in much better shape with a win tonight. While they might be in playoff position they have hit a bit of a rut, losing three of their last four games and their one time top rated defense is no longer looking as dominant as it did a month and a half ago. The Broncos on the other hand have bounced back from a two game losing skid to the Chiefs and the Ravens with a four game losing streak including a big win over the Colts last week. These two teams will most likely be in the post season no matter the outcome of this game, but Broncos and Chargers will be hoping to get the best possible Wild Card seed, and that starts with tonight’s big divisional match up. A couple AFC West currently occupying two of the three Wild Card spots in the conference go toe-to-toe tonight and the winner will most likely be guaranteed a place in the postseason. It’s the Denver Broncos taking on the Los Angeles Chargers in a Thrusday night divisional match up with massive implications and AS English will be with you all night providing live coverage, stats, highlights and analysis of tonight’s game from Sofi Stadium.",

Heading into a divisional clash on \"Thursday Night Football\" in Week 16, Denver and Los Angeles each own an AFC wild-card spot. Despite both teams currently trailing the Chiefs in the AFC West, they've still managed to put together strong seasons after significant offseason additions; Denver is finding success while starting a rookie quarterback, and Los Angeles is also trending toward the playoffs after bringing in Jim Harbaugh as head coach. The Broncos enter Week 16 with a 9-5 record behind Bo Nix (2,972 passing yards, 20 touchdowns, 11 interceptions), and they're currently the conference's No. 6 seed with the regular season dwindling down. Denver hasn't made the postseason since its Super Bowl victory in 2015, so these are exciting times for Sean Payton's squad, which also owns the league's eighth-ranked total defense (315.3 yards allowed per game) entering Week 16. MORE NFL WEEK 16: As for the Chargers, Justin Herbert (2,959 passing yards, 16 touchdowns, two interceptions) has been having one of his top statistical seasons in the NFL so far in 2024. Behind its star quarterback, a strong run game, and standout rookie wide receiver Ladd McConkey, Los Angeles' offense has consistently done enough to keep the team in games all season. However, the Chargers come into this Thursday matchup having lost three of their past four games, including a 40-17 loss to the Buccaneers last week. With the Broncos trending in the other direction, riding a four-game win streak, this matchup could be critical for Los Angeles to hang onto its current No. 7 seed in the AFC playoff bracket. The winner of this \"Thursday Night Football\" matchup will help solidify their status as one of the AFC's 2024 postseason squads, while the loser could see their hopes begin to slip away. As the Broncos go for double-digit wins, the Chargers are looking to end a recent cold spell.

                "content": "Digital Media Contributor The Broncos will travel to Los Angeles to take on the Chargers at SoFi Stadium on Thursday, Dec. 19, 2024 at 6:15 p.m. MT. The Broncos will travel to Los Angeles for a prime-time matchup with a divisional rival in Week 16. Denver will look to clinch its first playoff berth since 2015 as the team looks to extend its four-game win streak. The \"Thursday Night Football\" matchup will feature two of the league's top defenses, as the Broncos and Chargers are both tied with the Eagles for the fewest points allowed per game in 2024 (17.6). Los Angeles and Denver are also both in the top two in red-zone touchdown percentage allowed. Denver leads the league with 49 sacks this season, and the Broncos could look to add to this tally on Thursday as they aim to pressure quarterback Justin Herbert. Outside linebacker Nik Bonitto — whose 11.5 sacks are tied for the third most in the league — should look for another strong performance this week. In Week 15, Bonitto became just the second defender in franchise history to record defensive touchdowns in back-to-back games. Cornerback Pat Surtain II could also aim for another strong performance on Thursday after recording his fourth interception of the year in Week 15, matching his career-high for interceptions in a single season. Surtain is allowing the fewest yards per target (4.9) in the NFL among cornerbacks with at least 40 targets, and he should look to continue this lockdown coverage on Thursday. Denver's offense, which found a rhythm late in the game vs. the Colts, should aim for a fast start on Thursday. Quarterback Bo Nix — who threw a pair of fourth-quarter touchdown passes to help seal the victory — could look to playmakers such as wide receiver Courtland Sutton, who leads the Broncos with 66 receptions, 878 receiving yards and six touchdown receptions this season. Wide receiver Marvin Mims Jr. — who was named the AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for a career-best performance in Week 15 — could look to continue to build momentum in the punt-return game on Thursday. The Broncos have ruled out cornerback Riley Moss (knee) and running back Jaleel McLaughlin (quad). Defensive lineman John-Franklin-Myers (foot), defensive tackle D.J. Jones (finger) and cornerback Pat Surtain II (ankle) were not assigned game statuses, indicating they will be available to play in Thursday's game. For Los Angeles, tight end Will Dissly (shoulder) and cornerback Cam Hart (concussion) have been ruled out. Tight end Hayden Hurst (hip), guard Zion Johnson, linebacker Denzel Perryman (groin) and defensive lineman Otito Ogbonnia (pelvis) were listed as questionable, while defensive back Elijah Molden (knee) was listed as doubtful.

Here are five questions — it is a big game, after all — that will decide if the Broncos can come away from \"Thursday Night Football\" with a 10th win and a spot in the postseason. Defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers and defensive tackle D.J. Jones improved to estimated full participants and were not assigned game statuses.

                "content": "Superman is an upcoming American superhero film based on DC Comics featuring the eponymous character. Produced by DC Studios and to be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it will be the first film in the DC Universe (DCU) and a reboot of the Superman film series. The film is written and directed by James Gunn and stars David Corenswet as Clark Kent / Superman, alongside Rachel Brosnahan, Nicholas Hoult, Edi Gathegi, Anthony Carrigan, Nathan Fillion, Isabela Merced, Skyler Gisondo, Sara Sampaio, María Gabriela de Faría, Wendell Pierce, Alan Tudyk, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and Neva Howell. In the film, Superman's journey to reconcile his alien heritage with his human family is explored. Development on a sequel to the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) film Man of Steel (2013) began by October 2014, with Henry Cavill set to reprise his role as Superman. Plans changed after the troubled production of Justice League (2017) and the Man of Steel sequel was no longer moving forward by May 2020. Gunn began work on a new Superman film around August 2022. In October, he became co-CEO of DC Studios with producer Peter Safran and they began work on a new DC Universe. Gunn was revealed to be writing the film in December. The title Superman: Legacy was announced the next month, Gunn was confirmed to be directing in March 2023, and Corenswet and Brosnahan were cast that June. The subtitle was dropped by the end of February 2024, when filming began in Norway. Production primarily took place at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, with location filming around Georgia and Ohio. Filming wrapped in July. The film takes inspiration from the comic book All-Star Superman (2005–2008) by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely, among others. Superman is scheduled to be released theatrically in the United States on July 11, 2025. It is set to be the first film of the DCU's Chapter One: Gods and Monsters. The film explores Clark Kent / Superman's journey to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage with his adoptive human family in Smallville, Kansas.[1] Also appearing in the film are Terence Rosemore as Luthor's henchman Otis;[26] Beck Bennett as Steve Lombard, a Daily Planet reporter;[27] Mikaela Hoover as Cat Grant, a Daily Planet columnist; Christopher McDonald as Ron Troupe, a Daily Planet reporter;[28] and Frank Grillo as A.R.G.U.S. leader Rick Flag Sr., reprising his role from the animated DCU series Creature Commandos (2024).[29][30] Gunn's brother Sean is expected to appear as the businessman Maxwell Lord,[31][32] as is Milly Alcock as Superman's cousin Kara Zor-El / Supergirl.[33][34] Sean Gunn said they ignored past depictions of Lord when creating their version, including Peter Facinelli's portrayal in the Arrowverse series Supergirl (2015–2021) and Pedro Pascal's in the DCEU film Wonder Woman 1984 (2020).[35] ABC News correspondent Will Reeve, the son of former Superman actor Christopher Reeve, is set to make a cameo appearance in the film as a news reporter.[36] Clark's superpowered dog Krypto, who Gunn described as a \"not-so-good-good-boy\",[37] and the robot Kelex will also appear in the film.[10] Warner Bros. Pictures was planning in 2012 for the film Man of Steel (2013), based on the DC Comics character Superman, to start a shared universe,[38] which became known as the \"DC Extended Universe\" (DCEU).[39][40] They announced a full slate of DC films in October 2014,[41] prioritizing Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) as the second DCEU film after Man of Steel failed to meet the studio's financial expectations.[42] Despite this, they said an undated sequel to Man of Steel was in development with Henry Cavill set to reprise his role as Clark Kent / Superman.[41] Man of Steel director Zack Snyder said they had been considering the imprisoned Kryptonians from the first film and the character Brainiac as antagonists for the sequel before work began on Batman v Superman.[42] A Man of Steel sequel was in active development as a top priority for the studio in August 2016,[43] which Cavill's manager Dany Garcia confirmed the following month.[44] Amy Adams, who portrayed Lois Lane in Man of Steel, said in November that the studio was working on the screenplay.[45] Matthew Vaughn was Warner Bros.' top choice to direct the film and had preliminary conversations about it by March 2017.[46] Vaughn and comic book writer Mark Millar had previously pitched a new Superman trilogy prior to the development of Man of Steel, in which the destruction of the planet Krypton would not occur until after Superman had already grown-up on the planet.[47] After the troubled production of the DCEU film Justice League (2017), Warner Bros. re-thought its approach to DC projects.[48] By the end of 2017, a Man of Steel sequel was not coming \"anytime soon, if at all\". Justice League producer Charles Roven said story ideas had been discussed but there was no script.[49] Before the release of Mission: Impossible – Fallout in July 2018, director Christopher McQuarrie and co-star Cavill pitched their take on a new Superman film, but Warner Bros. did not pursue the idea.[50] Later in 2018, the studio asked James Gunn to write and direct a Superman film, but he was uncertain if he wanted to take on the character.[51][52] He did not have a clear vision for such a film, especially since Superman was a well-known character unlike the Guardians of the Galaxy who he had adapted for Marvel Studios in the film Guardians of the Galaxy (2014).[53] Gunn chose to make The Suicide Squad (2021) instead.[51][52] In September, negotiations for Cavill to reprise his role for a cameo appearance in Shazam! (2019) ended due to contract issues,[54] as well as a scheduling conflict with Cavill's Fallout commitments.[54][55] The actor was reported to be parting ways with the studio, with no plans for him to reprise his role in future projects,[54] but Cavill said in November 2019 that he had not given up on the character and still wanted to do the role justice.[55] At that time, Warner Bros. was unsure which direction to take the character and was talking to \"high-profile talent\" about the property, including J. J. Abrams—whose company Bad Robot signed an overall deal with Warner Bros.' parent company WarnerMedia—and Michael B. Jordan, who pitched himself as a Black version of the character.[56] By May 2020, Warner Bros. was no longer developing a Man of Steel sequel, but Cavill was in talks to appear in a different future DC film.[57][58] In February 2021, Ta-Nehisi Coates was revealed to be writing a new Superman film that Abrams was producing.[59] The film was expected to feature a Black actor portraying Superman, with the potential for Jordan to take on the role.[60] In April 2022, Discovery, Inc. and WarnerMedia merged to become Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), led by president and CEO David Zaslav. The new company was expected to restructure DC Entertainment and Zaslav began searching for an equivalent to Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige to lead the new subsidiary. Zaslav and WBD felt DC lacked a \"coherent creative and brand strategy\" and were underusing Superman.[61] James Gunn was hired around late August to work on a Superman film that was not a sequel to Man of Steel and would be standalone from the DCEU.[62][63] Zaslav spent time with Gunn while he was writing the script.[64] In October, Cavill made a cameo appearance in the post-credits scene of the DCEU film Black Adam (2022) and Warner Bros. was reportedly pursuing a Cavill-led Man of Steel sequel once again. Roven was producing and the studio was searching for writers. They wanted McQuarrie to direct, but he was unlikely to be available due to his commitments to Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning (2023) and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning (2025). Abrams's and Coates's film was still in development. Cavill's role in Black Adam was approved by Warner Bros. film chiefs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy when they were approached directly by Black Adam star Dwayne Johnson. Johnson began promoting the idea of a Black Adam vs. Superman film co-starring Cavill.[65] The latter had signed a one-off deal for Black Adam and only received a verbal agreement that he would continue playing the character in the DCEU.[66][67] Cavill publicly announced that he would return as Superman for future projects,[67][68] and said his Black Adam cameo was a \"very small taste\" of future plans.[68] He said Superman would be \"enormously joyful\" moving forward.[69] Steven Knight wrote a script treatment for the sequel around that time,[70] which reportedly included Brainiac as the antagonist,[67] but Warner Bros. executives were not thrilled with his take.[70] James Gunn and The Suicide Squad producer Peter Safran were announced as the co-chairs and co-CEOs of the newly formed DC Studios at the end of October 2022.[71] A week after starting their new roles, the pair had begun developing an eight-to-ten-year plan for a new DC Universe (DCU) that would be a \"soft reboot\" of the DCEU.[72][73][74] In mid-November, Gunn was publicly revealed to be writing a new DC film.[75] Andy Muschietti, director of the DCEU film The Flash (2023), expressed interest in directing a Superman project with a similar tone to Richard Donner's Superman (1978).[76] In early November, Cavill expressed interest in a future project that explored Superman's \"capacity to give and to love\" the people of Earth and to inspire others,[77] and said he was looking forward to meeting with Gunn to discuss future opportunities.[78] Work on the Man of Steel sequel stalled later that month while Gunn and Safran were developing their plans.[79] In December 2022, Gunn said Superman was a big priority, if not the biggest, for DC Studios,[80] before publicly announcing that he was writing a new Superman film that would focus on a younger version of the character and would therefore not star Cavill. There was potential for Gunn to also direct the film.[2] It would not be an origin story for Superman,[81] and would focus on him as a young reporter interacting with key characters, such as Lois Lane.[6] Gunn and Safran met with Cavill to explain their decision and discuss potentially working with him for a different role in the future.[2][6] On January 31, 2023, Gunn and Safran unveiled the first projects from their DCU slate, which begins with Chapter One: Gods and Monsters. Their Superman film was the first film in that chapter and was officially titled Superman: Legacy. It was given a release date of July 11, 2025. Safran wanted Gunn to direct the film.[82] Gunn said the film would take specific inspiration from the comic book All-Star Superman (2005–2008) by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely,[4] and the next day that comic appeared on Amazon's list of best-selling comic books.[83] The film was also inspired by the animated Superman short films from Fleischer Studios (1941–1943),[84] and by these comic books: the Superman: Birthright (2003–04) limited series by Mark Waid, Leinil Francis Yu, and Gerry Alanguilan; the 2008 \"Brainiac\" story arc from Action Comics by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank; the crossover event Superman: Ending Battle (2002) by Johns, Joe Casey, Joe Kelly, and Mark Schultz;[85] the Superman for All Seasons (1998) limited series by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale;[86] the Elseworlds limited series Kingdom Come (1996) by Waid and Alex Ross; Morrison's Action Comics run; and the story \"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\" (1986) by Alan Moore and Curt Swan.[84] Tom King, a comic book writer working on the DCU, stated in March 2023 that Gunn was also directing the film,[87] which Gunn confirmed later that month.[88] At that time, Safran was confirmed to be producing the film.[1] Gunn was hesitant to direct the film, despite encouragement from Safran and others, until he realized how focusing on Superman's heritage with his aristocratic Kryptonian parents and adoptive farmer parents from Smallville, Kansas, would inform the characterization. Gunn felt emotionally connected to this aspect of the film because of his late father, whose birthday was shared with the film's intended release date.[1] Gunn said in April that the film's tone would differ from his Guardians of the Galaxy films,[89] and he suggested that Superman's dog Krypto could appear.[89][90][91] Production design, costume design, and the casting process began in April 2023.[92][53] Beth Mickle and Judianna Makovsky returned in their respective roles as production designer and costume designer from The Suicide Squad and Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023).[93][94] Filming was set to begin in January 2024.[53] Gunn was looking for an actor to play Superman who possessed the character's humanity, kindness, and compassion, and was \"somebody who you want to give a hug\".[95] He said the character Jimmy Olsen would appear,[96] and that he was not looking to make the film a comedy. He hoped Legacy would be different from previous Superman films while still respecting what came before.[53] Gunn turned in the first draft of the script at the end of April and the production was not expected to be impacted by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike when it began in early May.[97] Audition tapes for the main roles of Superman, Lois Lane, and Lex Luthor were submitted by early May 2023. Gunn began watching them later that month,[99] while he was storyboarding the film.[100] David Corenswet was a top contender for Superman and was set to do a screen test at the end of the month or in early June. Other actors in consideration included Jacob Elordi, Tom Brittney, and Andrew Richardson.[9][99] Elordi declined to read for the role, feeling that it would be \"too much\" and \"too dark\" for him.[101] Emma Mackey, Rachel Brosnahan, Samara Weaving, and Phoebe Dynevor had tested for Lane;[9][99] Dynevor was one of the final contenders for that role.[102] Nicholas Hoult, the runner-up to play Batman in The Batman (2022),[9] was eyed for Luthor but chose to pursue the role of Superman.[103] Gunn was considering A-list actors with whom he had previously worked for Luthor, and discussed the role with a Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 actor that was reported to be Bradley Cooper.[9][104][105] Black actors were also being considered.[106] Testing took place using the label \"Apex\", a reference to a comic version of Luthor called Apex Luthor.[99][106] Other comic book superheroes were expected to already be established in the film's setting,[9] with casting underway for a Black actor to play Michael Holt / Mister Terrific and for an Asian or Latina actress to portray a character labeled \"Blitz\".[107][108] Pierson Fodé, who appeared in an episode of Supergirl (2015–2021), and Jack Quaid, who voiced Superman in the animated series My Adventures with Superman (2023–present), both submitted a self-tape for Superman.[109][110] In-person screen tests took place at the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California, with Gunn and Safran in mid-June 2023. The actors tested in makeup and costume as Kent and Lane in the following pairs: Hoult and Brosnahan, Brittney and Dynevor, and Corenswet and Mackey.[111][103] The Kent contenders then tested in costume as Superman against Mackey.[103] One of Cavill's original DCEU Superman suits, which was in poor condition, was used for the tests. Gunn said Brittney \"messed it up\" and then it was \"torn to shreds\" by Corenswet, who was too tall.[112] Gunn edited the tests together to be played for a deciding committee that included Zaslav,[103] and the casting of Corenswet as Superman and Brosnahan as Lane was announced on June 27.[3] Casting for other roles was set to follow, including for members of the superhero team the Authority who were expected to be introduced in Superman: Legacy ahead of their own film.[113][103] Brothers Alexander and Bill Skarsgård were on the shortlist for Luthor. It was unclear if Hoult would return to try for Luthor again.[103] On July 11, two years before the film's scheduled release date,[114] the casting of Isabela Merced, Edi Gathegi, and Nathan Fillion respectively as the superheroes Hawkgirl, Mister Terrific, and Guy Gardner / Green Lantern was announced.[14] Merced tested as Barbara Gordon / Batgirl for the unreleased DCEU film Batgirl,[115] while Fillion starred in several of Gunn's earlier films including as Cory Pitzner / T.D.K. in The Suicide Squad.[14] Anthony Carrigan, who expressed interest in playing Luthor, was cast as the superhero Rex Mason / Metamorpho the next day.[15][116] Gunn chose some of these actors some time earlier but had been waiting until Superman and Lane were cast before negotiating further actor deals, leaving little time to complete negotiations before the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14.[15][117] In response to concerns that other superheroes would take away from the story of Superman and Lane, Gunn said those two characters remained the film's focus and the other actors were being cast for multiple DCU projects.[114] When the WGA strike ended in September 2023, Superman: Legacy was expected to begin filming in early-to-mid 2024.[118] Jason Momoa, who portrayed Aquaman in the DCEU, was reported the following month to have discussed portraying the character Lobo in either Superman: Legacy or a solo film.[119] The SAG-AFTRA strike ended on November 9, and filming was clarified to be beginning in March 2024.[120][121] Gunn said the film would still make its July 2025 release date.[122] María Gabriela de Faría was revealed to be cast as Angela Spica / The Engineer, one of the film's antagonists and a member of the Authority, in mid-November.[20] Singer Madison Beer said she submitted a self-tape and unsuccessfully auditioned for an undisclosed role, as did O'Shea Jackson Jr.[123][124] Hoult was in talks to portray Luthor prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike, and negotiations for the role were continuing in November,[125][126] when Sara Sampaio and Skyler Gisondo were revealed to have been respectively cast as Luthor's assistant Eve Teschmacher and Jimmy Olsen.[19][18] Gunn said Gisondo, Sampaio, and de Faría had been cast prior to the strike,[127] and the roles of Mister Terrific and Teschmacher were particularly difficult to cast and required many auditions.[128] Journalist Jeff Sneider noted speculation that the character Sam Lane would appear and indicated that Michael Rooker was linked to the role,[105] but Gunn denied that Rooker would play the character.[129] In December 2023, Gunn's brother Sean was cast as Maxwell Lord for future DCU projects, after Pedro Pascal played the role in the DCEU film Wonder Woman 1984 (2020). The character was expected to be referenced in Superman: Legacy but it was unknown if he would appear in the film.[32] James Gunn confirmed that Hoult had finalized a deal to portray Luthor,[8] and Miriam Shor entered negotiations for an undisclosed role after appearing in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.[31] The Hollywood Reporter also said the cast included Sean Gunn and Pom Klementieff, who starred in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, before James Gunn stated that Klementiff was not involved in the film and Shor had not been cast.[31][130][131] He added that the film's script had been mostly completed prior to the writers' strike.[132] Gunn said in January 2024 that work on the sets, prosthetics, and visual effects models were underway, the costumes were being completed, and most of the actors had been cast,[133] while Brosnahan said the film was being made with a lot of love for the source material, as many cast and crew members had grown up watching Superman films and reading the comics.[7] At the end of the month, Milly Alcock was cast as Superman's cousin Kara Zor-El / Supergirl. The character was reported to be making her debut in Superman: Legacy ahead of starring in her own DCU film, Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (2026).[33][134][135] Alcock had performed auditions and screen tests in costume on the Superman: Legacy set in Atlanta, Georgia, earlier in January.[135][136] Pre-production work in Ohio began in early February 2024.[137] Later that month, Bassem Youssef said he had been cast in the film—reportedly as Rumaan Harjadi, the leader of a fictional Middle Eastern country—but his character had been removed from the script. He believed this was potentially due to comments he made in October 2023 criticizing the Israeli government during the Israel–Hamas war. Gunn disputed this, explaining that he had discussed a role with Youssef prior to the WGA strike but the actor had not been formally offered the part, and the character was removed from the final script after the strike ended and before Youssef's comments were made.[138][139][140] Also in mid-February, the Ohio Department of Development announced that Superman: Legacy would be partially filmed in Cleveland and Cincinnati, Ohio, and had been awarded over $11 million through the state's tax credit program,[137][141] based on a $37 million spend in the state out of the film's reported total budget of $363.8 million;[142] Gunn disputed the accuracy of this budget, which would have made the film one of the most expensive superhero films ever made.[143] A table read with the cast was held on February 22, and Gunn revealed that Terence Rosemore was portraying Luthor's henchman Otis after having small roles in some of Gunn's prior films.[26] Zaslav said filming would begin the following week,[144] when Gunn announced that he had shortened the film's title to Superman by the time he had completed the final draft of the script.[145] Gunn explained that the reason for dropping Legacy from the title was because the film was about looking forward rather than looking back, adding that having Legacy as a subtitle was \"too looking back\".[146] Principal photography began on February 29, 2024, which is the canonical birthday of Superman,[145] in the Adventdalen valley in Svalbard, Norway. Filming took place there for one week to shoot scenes featuring the Fortress of Solitude. Gunn chose Svalbard for its natural beauty, landscapes, and similarities to the Arctic.[147][148] Filming occurred under the working title Genesis.[137][149] Henry Braham returned as cinematographer from the later two Guardians of the Galaxy films, The Suicide Squad, and The Flash.[150] Cinematographer Henry Braham shot the entire film using IMAX certified Red Digital Cinema cameras.[151][152] Filming was delayed from an initial January 2024 start by the SAG-AFTRA strike,[121] and was expected to last around four months.[153] At the start of March, Wendell Pierce was cast as Perry White.[21] Filming at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, had begun by March 8 and was expected to last until August 2.[149][154] Filming was set to take place in Cleveland and Cincinnati, Ohio, for 37 days between April 1 and August 23.[137][141] Filming was also expected to take place in Macon, Georgia.[155] Later in April, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Neva Howell were cast as Jonathan and Martha Kent.[24][25] In early June, Beck Bennett, Mikaela Hoover, and newcomer Christopher McDonald were cast as the Daily Planet employees Steve Lombard,[27][156] Cat Grant, and Ron Troupe. Hoover previously appeared in several of Gunn's films.[28] Characters from the animated DCU series Creature Commandos (2024) were expected to appear in the film by mid-June, and it was the intention of Gunn and Safran that the same actors would portray characters across animation and live-action in the DCU;[157][158] set photos revealed that Frank Grillo was reprising his voice role as Rick Flag Sr. from that series.[29] The production moved to Northeast Ohio on June 14, when filming took place at the Headlands Beach State Park in Mentor, Ohio.[159] Six weeks of filming took place throughout Cleveland,[160] beginning in downtown Cleveland on June 24.[161] Filming locations included Ontario Street, the Cleveland Greyhound Station, Public Square, the Detroit–Superior Bridge, PNC Plaza, Progressive Field, and Cleveland Arcade. Exterior shots of the Huntington Bank Building, Key Tower, and the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument were filmed in Public Square.[162][163] The exterior of the Leader Building stood in for the headquarters of the Daily Planet,[164] and Key Tower was used as the headquarters for Stagg Enterprises.[165] Filming in Cleveland was completed on July 16, when Gunn said there were a couple weeks left of shooting.[163][160] The production was then set to move to Cincinnati by July 18, to take place at the Cincinnati Museum Center in the Union Terminal and in a portion of the Lytle Tunnel.[166] Filming wrapped on July 30.[167] In August 2024, Sean Gunn confirmed his casting as Maxwell Lord.[35] The following month, Alan Tudyk was revealed to have a role after previously voicing the character Doctor Phosphorus in Creature Commandos,[23] and Waid confirmed that Krypto was appearing in the film.[168] Gunn officially confirmed Krypto's role in October and explained that the character's portrayal in the film was inspired by his dog Ozu, who was adopted soon after Gunn began writing Superman. He said Ozu was at first \"problematic to say the least... I remember thinking, 'Gosh, how difficult would life be if Ozu had superpowers?' – and thus Krypto came into the script and changed the shape of the story\".[37] By December 2024, Gunn had begun test screening the film,[169] while a day and a half of individual pick-up shots were scheduled to take place in Los Angeles shortly after, which Gunn said was to \"enhance the film\".[170] Craig Alpert, Jason Ballantine, and William Hoy are co-editing the film, after they respectively worked on Blue Beetle, The Flash, and The Batman.[171] Much of the visual effects team from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was set to return to work with Gunn for Superman,[172] including Stéphane Ceretti, who returns as the visual effects supervisor from that film, Guardians of the Galaxy, and The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022).[173] In December 2023, Gunn said most of the film's score and major themes had been written, but the composer had not been announced because their deal for the film had not yet been finalized.[174] In February 2024, he announced that John Murphy was composing the film's score, after previously doing so for The Suicide Squad, The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.[175] In December 2024, James Gunn confirmed that John Williams's Superman theme from Richard Donner's 1978 film would be included in John Murphy's score while \"creating something new\". Gunn also confirmed the film would not have as many licensed songs as his previous superhero projects.[176] Gunn marked the beginning of filming in February 2024 by posting a picture of Superman's shield,[145] which commentators noted for its visual similarity to the character's costume in the Kingdom Come comic book, albeit with the classic yellow and red color scheme.[177][178] Safran promoted the film on-stage during Warner Bros.' CinemaCon presentation that April, with Gunn, Corenswet, and Brosnahan appearing via video messages.[179] The panel unveiled a full look at the film's Superman emblem and Gunn said he planned to attend the following year's event in-person with the cast to initiate the \"Summer of Superman\" in the lead-up to the film's release.[180] Gunn released a first-look image of Corenswet in costume in early May, which depicts Superman suiting up while an alien-looking threat attacks in the background. Commentary on the image focused on the return of red briefs which were not included in the Man of Steel design. Elements of the costume were also compared to the design used in the New 52 comics by Jim Lee, while the character's pose and the attack in the background led to speculation about Superman's characterization in the film and what threats he may face.[181][98][182] A display inspired by the film's Fortress of Solitude was included at Warner Bros.' Licensing Expo booth in Las Vegas later in May.[183] Gunn released the first image of Krypto, alongside Corenswet's Superman, in October 2024 in honor of \"Adopt a Shelter Dog\" month.[37] A motion poster was released on December 16, 2024, featuring a slowed-down rendition of John Williams's \"Superman March\" theme from Superman (1978). Jordan Moreau at Variety described the poster as an homage to Christopher Reeve's portrayal of Superman from that film and noted the music remixed Williams's score to be quieter and \"more thoughtful\". The film's teaser trailer was also shown at a press screening that day ahead of a public release on December 19.[184] On the 18th, Gunn posted a video with a link to the trailer's countdown, and a 30-second teaser trailer for the full trailer which played on the film's tagline, \"look up\".[185] The teaser trailer was released the following day.[10] Superman is scheduled to be released theatrically by Warner Bros. Pictures internationally on July 9, 2025,[186] and in the United States on July 11, 2025,[145] in IMAX.[187] It will be the first film in the DCU's Chapter One: Gods and Monsters.[82]",

                "title": "Superman 2025: New Trailer Reveals Changed DC Universe",
                "content": "The first teaser trailer for Superman, which hits theaters on July 11, 2025, gave fans a glimpse at how the movie starring David Corsenswet and Rachel Brosnahan will change the DC Universe. Up in the sky! Look! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's the new Superman trailer! Fans got their first look at Superman—coming to theaters July 11, 2025—and as the film's writer and director James Gunn has promised before, the comic book-based movie is helping launch a new take on the DC Universe. The trailer starts off with David Corsenswet as Superman, sporting a costume reminiscent of the character's look from the New 52 comics, with the addition of Superman's iconic red trunks. And while he appears to be in dire straits, he's quickly aided by Superman's favorite good boy, his dog Krypto. Set to an electric guitar-version of John Williams' epic Superman theme from the 1978 film, the teaser also gives glimpses of Superman's alter ego Clark Kent, Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane—a journalist and Clark's love interest—and Nicholas Hoult as the villainous Lex Luthor. Plus, a slew of other DC characters make appearances, including Green Lantern Gardner (Nathan Fillion), Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi), Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced), Metamorpho (Anthony Carrigan) and Jimmy Olsen (Skylar Gisondo). Viewers also get to see a tender moment between Clark and his father Jonathan (Pruitt Taylor Vince), better known as Pa Kent, who along with Martha Kent (Neva Howell) raised Clark on their family farm after he crash-landed there as baby Kal-El from the planet Krypton. In addition to the cavalcade of characters, fans were treated to views of Clark's workplace, The Daily Planet, Superman's arctic home base, the Fortress of Solitude and the romance brewing between Lois and Clark. And while we'll still have to wait half a year to see how it all plays out on screen, according to Gunn—who was named co-CEO of DC Studios in October 2022—Superman marks \"the true beginning of the DCU.\" \"Storytelling is always king,\" he explained in a video posted to X, formerly Twitter, in Jan. 2023. \"It's all that matters to us. I want to be true to those stories. I want to be true to you guys and really give you something different than you've ever seen before.\" As for Corenswet, taking on the iconic role of Superman—which has been played on the big screen by the likes of Christopher Reeve, Brandon Routh and most recently Henry Cavill—has been life-changing. In fact, playing the Man of Steel has been \"the best thing ever,\" he told Variety in an interview published Dec. 19. Although he still has trouble watching himself on screen. \"I just disassociate,\" Corenswet explained. \"It's not me up there. It's Superman. It's Clark Kent. What's cool is seeing all your friends up there.\" But of course, playing the DC Super Hero did have one advantage: the chance to really transform his body for the role. \"Getting to bulk up for Superman, I was really looking for an excuse to throw on some weight,\" he said on the Manly Things (Sort Of) podcast in September. \"I thought 210 [pounds] was going to make me happy, but I got up to 238.\" The Twisters actor joked, \"I put on one of those crewneck sweatshirts—like an XL or XXL—and I was like, 'This is amazing.' I didn't fit into any of my pants.\" For a look at other stars who transformed for their roles, keep reading. Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer Was eating, as his onscreen wife Emily Blunt joked \"like, an almond every day,\" a bit nutty? Sure. But the Irish star really wanted to nail atomic bomb scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer's appearance. \"Oppenheimer had a very distinct physicality and silhouette, which I wanted to get right,\" he explained to The New York Times. \"I had to lose quite a bit of weight, and we worked with the costume and tailoring; he was very slim, almost emaciated, existed on martinis and cigarettes.\" The actress lost almost 40 pounds to play the iconic jazz singer in the 2021 film, which earned her an Oscar nomination. To transform the actress into her role of real life Appalachian grandmother Mamaw Vance in the 2020 film, makeup and special effects artist Matthew Mungle pulled Close's 2011 head cast from Albert Nobbs and sculpted her a new set of false ears and a false nose, according to Variety. The actress received an Oscar nomination for her role. At the 2004 Academy Awards, the gorgeous A-lister was honored with a Best Actress win for her chilling portrayal of real-life serial killer Aileen Wuornos. The British actor packed on more than 40 pounds for his Oscar-nominated performance as a beer-bellied con artist in 2013's American Hustle. He put on the same amount to play former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney in the 2018 movie Vice, which also earned him an Oscar nomination. The star dropped 70 pounds for the 2019 movie Ford v Ferrari, in which he plays slender race car driver Ken Miles. For the 2011 film The Fighter, which earned him his first Oscar, he lost about 30 pounds while gaining muscle. The actor lost 52 pounds to play the deeply disturbed Arthur Fleck, the man who would become Batman's adversary. It took three hours (and an infamously large prosthetic nose) for makeup artists to render the Best Actress winner completely unrecognizable for the 2002 drama. The actor shed 35 pounds and shaved his head to play an HIV-stricken attorney suing his former firm for wrongful termination. Hanks took home Best Actor at the 1994 Oscars, and made a similar transformation for his Oscar-nominated performance in 2000's Cast Away. The actress, who famously gained a reported 17 pounds to play the title role in Bridget Jones's Diary, did not have to change her physique to transform into Judy Garland for the 2019 film Judy, for which she won her first Oscar. You can thank the makeup and costume department for her transformation. \"Renée was extremely emotionally and artistically involved in Judy, the movie's costume designer, Jany Temime, who also worked on the Harry Potter films, told Vulture. \"It was her film. I think she really got into Judy's skin.\" Zellweger told the outlet, \"Jany fit the costumes to Judy's posture. So the dresses didn't fit me unless I stood like I was supposed to stand. The zipper wouldn't go up.\" Quite a departure from Robbie's sultry character in The Wolf of Wall Street, several prosthetics, braces and wigs helped the Best Actress nominee bring the disgraced figure skater's career-ending scandal to life in the 2017 flick. The Academy recognized McConaughey's extreme commitment to playing an HIV/AIDS stricken electrician with a Best Actor win during the 2014 ceremony. The late actor received a posthumous Oscar in 2008 for his chilling and mesmerizing performance as The Joker in the second film in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. His look as the iconic villain differed greatly from those previously seen on past actors onscreen. \"What would it be if this guy slept in his makeup, this psychopath?\" makeup artist John Caglione Jr. told IGN. \"If he didn't spruce up his makeup for two or three weeks? He never changes his clothes It's those kinds of organic details that really helped.\" He continued, \"You think of a clown's makeup and for the most part, they're pretty detailed with sharp lines. But this had to be the opposite of that.\" The two-time Oscar winner dramatically altered her appearance to play real-life transgender man Brandon Teena in the 1999 drama, and then again in Clint Eastwood's 2004 Best Picture winner. In order to play British prime minister Winston Churchill, the 2018 Best Actor nominee spent upwards of four hours in the makeup chair every day and wore a \"Victorian corset\" style bodysuit. Before taking home Best Actress at the 2011 Oscars, the petite actress shed 20 pounds and trained up to 16 hours a day for her role as a mentally ill ballerina. Ever the chameleon, the 2014 Best Supporting Actor winner prepared to play a HIV-positive transgender woman by losing 40 pounds and only staying in character on set. \"I had done similar things with weight, but this was different,\" Leto told E! News in 2013. \"I think the role demanded that commitment…It was about how does that effect how I walk, how I talked, who I am, how I feel. You know, you feel very fragile and delicate and unsafe.\" The Best Actress winner gained 15 pounds of muscle to play a mother who escapes years of captivity with her 5-year-old son (Jacob Tremblay) in the 2015 film. Larson said she even limited her exposure to the outside world, restricted nutrients like Vitamin D and tailored her eating habits to better grasp what her character experienced. At the 2012 Academy Awards, the typically fresh-faced starlet was honored with a Best Actress nomination for her performance in the thriller. Mara went as far as to pierce multiple body parts, bleach her eyebrows and chop her hair to transform into Lisbeth Salander.

                "content": "Superman DC and Warner Bros. dropped the first trailer for Superman this morning and it’s great. James Gunn appears to be taking the DC Universe in a solid new direction with the first film under the new DCU banner. David Corenswet looks the part as both the muscled man of steel and the bumbling Clark Kent in his ill-fitting suit and thick-rimmed glasses. As much of a Henry Cavill fan as I am, I think Corenswet fills Superman’s big red boots nicely, even if the suit is a bit more controversial. Here’s the trailer: First, let’s talk about what works in this trailer: There are two things I’m not a big fan of in the trailer. One has me worried, the other I just plain don’t like. I’m worried about the sheer number of characters, and in particular super-characters, that we’re introduced to in this teaser. I’m not sure we should have a big ensemble in the first DC reboot, which I would hope focuses more neatly on Superman and Lex Luthor. But we have Guy Gardner here, some kind of Kaiju, Hawkgirl and more, and that’s without seeing Supergirl. More worrisome is the cinematography. There are moments when it looks great, and others when it looks far, far too saturated and fake, which was a problem with the filming and special effects throughout the DCEU film run. I know we live in an era of CGI, but I was hoping for a film that felt a bit more old-school. I’m glad that the movie looks bright—the dark days are behind us—but the color-grading and special effects just feel like too much. And while I’m not against slow-motion (the moment where he saves the girl seems like a great use of the technique), I’d be lying if I denied having some PTSD from the Snyder films. Snyder’s use of slow-motion is bordering on pornographic. The film opens on July 11th and we’re sure to see more trailers before then that give us a better sense of what this movie is about and how it will look. I’m genuinely looking forward to this. Outside of The Batman and Joker I haven’t really been excited about a DC film in a very, very long time. Fans need a win. Warner Bros. and DC need it even more.

                "title": "Why are Amazon workers on strike – and what does it mean for Christmas deliveries? | Amazon | The Guardian",
                "content": "Amazon Labor Union – comprising 10,000 workers across the US – is striking over the company’s refusal to negotiate With Christmas less than a week away, thousands of Amazon warehouse workers across the countries are on strike after the company refused to start contract negotiations with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Though it’s been well over two years since the first Amazon warehouse union was formed in New York City, and workers at several other warehouses across the country have started to unionize, the company has refused to recognize and negotiate a contract with the union. The Teamsters gave Amazon a 15 December deadline to come to the bargaining table, which the company refused to acknowledge. Here’s what you need to know about the Amazon warehouse strike. Amazon employs more than 1.5 million people around the world. The Amazon Labor Union (ALU) has gained about 10,000 workers across 10 facilities in the US over the last two years. In June, the ALU voted to affiliate with the Teamsters, which has 1.3 million union members across the country. The Teamsters said that seven of the 10 facilities with unions are on strike. The warehouses include one in the borough of Queens in New York, one in Atlanta, three in southern California, one in San Francisco and a seventh in a Chicago suburb. The Teamsters said that Amazon Teamsters at other facilities “are prepared to join them”. The union says the strike is the largest against Amazon in the company’s history. It’s unclear how the strike will affect operations. Amazon has hundreds of thousands of employees still working at delivery hubs and facilities that aren’t unionized. The company said it does not anticipate the strike affecting its operations heading into Christmas. But the Teamsters president, Sean O’Brien, said in a statement on Thursday morning that if Amazon customers have package delays, “you can blame Amazon’s insatiable greed”. “We gave Amazon a clear deadline to come to the table and do right by our members. They ignored it,” he said. “These greedy executives had every chance to show decency and respect for the people who make their obscene profits possible. Instead, they’ve pushed workers to the limit and now they’re paying the price. The strike is on them.” The Teamsters said its local unions will also put up picket lines at hundreds of other non-unionized Amazon fulfillment centers across the country. The Teamsters has not specified how long the strike will last, meaning it could go on past Christmas and into the new year. Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Though thousands of its employees have voted to unionize, the company has staunchly opposed efforts to increase union membership and has refused to recognize some employees as Amazon workers. The union wants Amazon to negotiate a contract with its members, who are demanding better wages, job security and benefits. Amazon warehouse workers and delivery drivers have long reported conditions that can be taxing on workers. A report from a US Senate committee, led by the Democratic senator Bernie Sanders, released this week accused Amazon of putting workers under heavy quotas that risk their safety. The committee said that Amazon warehouses recorded 30% more injuries at its warehouses over the industry average. Amazon has said that the report is “fundamentally flawed”. Some Amazon Teamster members are delivery drivers who work for third-party companies, called “delivery service partners”, who drive vans with Amazon logos but are technically not employed by the company. Earlier this year, two regional directors with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued initial complaints that said Amazon is technically a joint employer of the drivers, even if they are hired by third parties. The hearing over an NLRB complaint in southern California is scheduled for March. In September, Amazon filed its own complaint challenging the structure of the NLRB, arguing that it is unconstitutional because board members cannot be removed by the president. Though the company, along with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which filed a similar suit, argued in front of a panel of judges from the US court of appeals for the fifth circuit in November, the court has yet to issue a ruling. That’s all to say that Amazon’s resistance to recognizing the union is still tied up in court, and the company maintains that many of the unionized members are not its employees and that the union harasses and intimidates employees. “For more than a year now, the Teamsters have continued to intentionally mislead the public – claiming that they represent ‘thousands of Amazon employees and drivers’. They don’t, and this is another attempt to push a false narrative,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.",

                "content": "One of America's most powerful labour unions is staging a protest against Amazon, aiming to put pressure on the tech giant as it rushes out packages in the final run-up to Christmas. The Teamsters union said Amazon delivery drivers at seven facilities in the US had walked off the job on Thursday, after the company refused to negotiate with the union about a labour contract. Teamsters members were demonstrating at \"hundreds\" of other Amazon locations, according to the union, which described it as the \"largest strike\" in US history involving the firm. The company, which employs roughly 800,000 people in its US delivery network, said its services would not be disrupted. \"What you see here are almost entirely outsiders — not Amazon employees or partners — and the suggestion otherwise is just another lie from the Teamsters,\" Amazon said in a statement. It was not clear how many people were participating in Thursday's action, which was joined by members of the United Services Union (ver.di) in Germany. In the US, the Teamsters union said thousands of Amazon workers were involved. Overall, the group claims to represent \"nearly 10,000\" Amazon workers, after signing up thousands of people at about 10 locations across the country, many of them in the last few months. The organisation has demanded recognition from Amazon, accusing the company of illegally ignoring its duty to negotiate collectively over pay and working conditions. \"They've pushed workers to the limit and now they're paying the price. This strike is on them,\" said the union's general president, Sean O'Brien. \"If your package is delayed during the holidays, you can blame Amazon's insatiable greed.\" The Teamsters is a storied US union, with more than one million members overall. It is known for winning robust contracts for members at firms such as delivery giant UPS. Most of the Teamsters' Amazon campaigns have involved drivers technically employed by third-party delivery firms that work with the tech giant. Amazon denies that it is on the hook as an employer in those cases, a question that is currently the subject of legal dispute. Labour officials have preliminarily sided with the union on the issue in at least one instance. Amazon employees at a major warehouse in Staten Island in New York have also agreed to affiliate with the Teamsters. Their warehouse holds the distinction as the only Amazon location in the US where a union victory has been formally ratified by labour officials. But it has seen little progress when it comes to contract negotiations since the 2022 vote. It was not among the locations listed to go on strike on Thursday. Amazon, one of the largest employers in the US, has long faced criticism of its working conditions and been the target of activists hoping to make inroads among its workers. Its fierce opposition to unionisation efforts has also been called into question. But it is not the only business facing pressure over its refusal to come to the table about a contract years after the start of unionisation efforts. At Starbucks, where the first coffee shop voted to unionise in 2021, workers also recently authorised a labour strike, accusing the company of dragging its feet on negotiations. Train managers at Avanti will now walk out on New Year's Eve and 2 January, as well as every Sunday from 12 January to 25 May. Health Minister Mike Nesbitt confirmed that a pay rise of 5.5% would match offers given to healthcare workers in England and Wales. Unions agree to suspend walk-outs by Transport for Greater Manchester staff on Sunday and Monday. Strike dates have not yet been set by the NASUWT, INTO and UTU unions after the ballot of members. A union says about 60 workers could lose £2,000 each per year under council plans. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

                "content": "WASHINGTON D.C., DC — Neil Cavuto, a business journalist who hosts a weekday afternoon show on Fox News Channel and has been with the network since its inception in 1996, is leaving after Thursday's show, Fox said. A workhorse at the network, Cavuto also hosts programs at Fox's sister, the Fox Business Network, and is not considered one of the stable of opinion hosts. “Neil Cavuto's illustrious career has been a master class in journalism and we're extremely proud of his incredible 28-year run with Fox News Media,” the network said. “His programs have defined business news and set the standard for the entire industry. We wish him a heartfelt farewell and all the best on his next chapter.” Unlike many at Fox, he has not interviewed President-elect Donald Trump since 2017 and sometimes has angered him. One time came when Cavuto said on his show that Trump had “decisively lost” his debate with Democrat Kamala Harris. Cavuto remarked this summer that when the stock market goes up, Trump says it is because of investors looking forward to him being back in power, but when it's down, he blames the Democrats. On social media Thursday, Trump used all-caps to say Cavuto's departure is “GOOD NEWS FOR AMERICA.” He said it “should have happened a long time ago.” While Cavuto's exit removes a Trump irritant from Fox, that fact had nothing to do with it, said a person at the network with knowledge of the discussions but spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about contracts. Cavuto's contract was coming to an end and while he was offered an extension, he decided to leave, the person said. With the television news business hurting financially, some major personalities have reportedly been asked to take pay cuts. Some, like the “Today” show's Hoda Kotb, decided to leave instead. Cavuto, 66, has stayed on the job despite a number of health issues through the years. He has multiple sclerosis, underwent heart surgery and had bouts of long COVID. There's no immediate word on who will replace Cavuto at 4 p.m. Eastern on Fox's schedule, a coveted slot before the network's most popular show, “The Five.” ___ David Bauder writes about media for the AP.

                "title": "Doula - Wikipedia",
                "content": "A doula (/ˈduːlə/; from Ancient Greek δούλα 'female slave'; Greek pronunciation: [ˈðula]) is a non-medical professional who provides guidance for the service of others and who supports another person (the doula's client) through a significant health-related experience, such as childbirth, miscarriage, induced abortion or stillbirth, as well as non-reproductive experiences such as dying.[1][2][3][4] A doula might also provide support to the client's partner, family, and friends.[5][6] The doula's goal and role is to help the client feel safe and comfortable, complementing the role of the healthcare professionals who provide the client's medical care. Unlike a physician, midwife, or nurse, a doula cannot administer medication or other medical treatment or give medical advice.[7][2] An individual might need to complete training to work as a doula, although training and certification processes vary throughout the world.[7][3][4][8] Some doulas work as volunteers; others are paid for their services by their client, medical institutions, or other private and public organizations. Doulas receive varying amounts of training, and their professionalism also varies.[4][9] The contributions of doulas during reproductive experiences and end-of-life care have been studied and have been shown to benefit their clients.[4][10][11][12] For example, a birth doula providing support during childbirth might increase likelihood of vaginal birth (rather than Caesarean section), decrease the need for pain medication during labor, and improve the perception of the birthing experience.[13][14] The benefits of a doula providing other types of support have been less well studied, but might improve a client's experience with medical care or help an individual cope with health transitions.[15][16][4][17] The concept of having a companion providing support to the birthing woman dates back to prehistoric times, evidenced by archeological findings of stone carvings and statues and anthropological studies.[18] However, the contemporary role of \"doula\" first emerged from the grassroots natural birth movement in the United States in the 1960s when women began desiring unmedicated, low-intervention births and began to have friends and others with formal or practical knowledge about childbirth provide them with support during pregnancy.[19] The term doula was first used in a 1969 anthropological study conducted by Dana Raphael, a protégée of Margaret Mead, with whom she co-founded the Human Lactation Center in Westport, Connecticut, in the 1970s.[20] Raphael suggested it was a widespread practice that a female of the same species be part of childbirth, and in human societies this was traditionally a role occupied by a family member or friend whose presence contributed to successful long-term breastfeeding.[20] Raphael derived the term from modern Greek (δούλα, doúla (Greek pronunciation: [ˈðula]), \"slave\"[21]), as told to her by an elderly Greek woman,[22] Eleni Rassias,[23] and described it as coming from \"Aristotle's time,\" an Ancient Greek word δούλα meaning \"female slave.\"[24] Two physician-researchers, Marshall Klaus and John Kennell, who conducted clinical trials on the medical outcomes of doula-attended births, adopted the term to refer to a person providing labor support.[7] In 1992, Doulas of North America (later DONA International) was co-founded by Klaus, Kennell, Phyllis Klaus, Penny Simkin, and Annie Kennedy, becoming the first organization to train and certify doulas.[25][26] The organization with the backing of the research of Klaus and Kennell helped lend credibility and professionalize doulas.[27] Due to the lobbying efforts of DONA International, the term doula was accepted into the American Heritage Dictionary and Oxford Dictionary in 2003, followed by Merriam Webster Dictionary in 2004.[26] Alternative names to this role include \"childbirth assistant\" and \"monitrice,\" but they did not catch on as \"doula\" had.[19] In 2008, activists in New York City began the Doula Project, to expand the role of the doula to other reproductive experiences beyond birth, grounded in reproductive justice framework.[28][29] The participants began working as abortion doulas and coined the term \"full-spectrum doula\" who support all pregnancy experiences and outcomes such as pregnancy termination, miscarriage and fetal loss.[28][30] Full spectrum doula groups can be found in major cities in the United States.[31] In 2019, Black maternal health advocate and Parents writer Christine Michel Carter interviewed Vice President Kamala Harris about the popularity of doulas in the Black community.[32] As a senator, in 2019 Harris reintroduced the Maternal Care Access and Reducing Emergencies (CARE) Act which aimed to address the maternal mortality disparity faced by women of color by training providers on recognizing implicit racial bias and its impact on care. Harris stated: \"We need to speak the uncomfortable truth that women—and especially Black women—are too often not listened to or taken seriously by the health care system, and therefore they are denied the dignity that they deserve. And we need to speak this truth because today, the United States is 1 of only 13 countries in the world where the rate of maternal mortality is worse than it was 25 years ago. That risk is even higher for Black women, who are three to four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related causes. These numbers are simply outrageous.\" A doula focused on birth is also known as a birth companion, nonclinical birth worker, birth coach, or post-birth supporter, by providing continuous care before, during, or after in the form of information, advocacy, physical support, and emotional support.[2][14][8][10] A birth doula is also called a labor doula. A birth doula might accompany a pregnant woman during labor and birth in place of or in addition to a partner, family member, or friend. Unlike these other birth companions, a doula has formal training in labor support.[2][14] The kinds of support provided during childbirth might include physical assistance and comfort (massage, maintaining a supporting posture, or providing water), emotional support (providing company, encouragement or simply talking in a soothing tone of voice), acting as an advocate during childbirth (supporting the birthing woman's right to make decisions about their own body and baby to the medical team) and informational support (provide information about the birthing process and non-medication based forms of pain relief, and facilitating communication between their client and health providers).[14][5] Most doula-client relationships begin a few months before the baby is due. Before the labor, the doula and the family can develop a relationship where the pregnant woman and their support person (e.g. the other parent) feel comfortable asking questions, expressing their fears and concerns, and discussing birth preferences.[24] Continuous support during labor provided by doulas has been associated with improved outcomes for both birthing women and babies, including shorter delivery, fewer cesarean sections and complications, the use of fewer medications and fetal extraction tools, less time in neonatal intensive care units, positive psychological benefits, more satisfying birth experiences, and increased breastfeeding.[11][5] Cross-country research on the effects of doulas on childbirth and postnatal care is complicated by the variety of settings, cultures, and medical systems of individual countries and the characteristics of patients. These benefits appear to be contingent on the doula providing continuous rather than intermittent assistance and knowing the specific social and cultural setting within which their services are provided.[33] Doula care can help reduce health disparities of those with the greatest need including those with less education, lower incomes, less preparation for childbirth and those lacking social support.[34][35][36][37] Research also supports the effectiveness of female friends or relatives, after minimal training, as a low-cost alternative to professional doulas.[11][38] In March 2014, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) put out a Consensus Statement titled \"Safe Prevention of Primary Cesarean Delivery\" in which it said, \"Increasing [a woman's] access to non-medical interventions during labor, such as continuous labor support, also has been shown to reduce cesarean birth rates.\"[39] As more research has become available on the positive benefits of trained labor support provided by someone not employed by the hospital, in 2017 ACOG officially announced the need for all birthing individuals to have access to continuous labor support outside hospital staff, and said, \"Evidence suggests that, in addition to regular nursing care, continuous one-to-one emotional support provided by support personnel, such as a doula, is associated with improved outcomes.\"[40][41] The official committee opinion put out by ACOG also offers other recommendations that allow birthing women more choice and access to more supportive care. Doulas could be utilized to help achieve many of these recommendations as they move towards better collaboration.[42] In 2017 the United Kingdom's Royal College of Midwives published a position statement on doulas, which supports the choice of the individual to hire a doula for their birth as long as the doula does not provide medical care.[43] A 2018 study examined women's perceptions of doulas in several different countries, including Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Malawi, Sweden, Nepal, Russia, Canada, and the United States of America and found that having continuous support from a companion such as a doula was highly appreciated by most women.[10] However, perceptions may vary from country to country due to cultural factors, such as an emphasis on modesty and privacy, which might affect what kind of support a woman prefers.[10] A 2018 study examining news media discourse in China noted that Chinese doulas needed to register with official departments or organizations and are closely linked with midwifery. The doula profession was introduced in 1996 to mainland China and demand of their services increased since then, with women citing dissatisfaction with medical care. After China's implementation of the Second-Child Policy, doula care was strongly linked to doula support in regard to family planning.[44] Tensions between doctors, nurses, and doulas have sometimes been described as a \"turf battle,\"[45] though it is also recognized that doulas and nurses can occupy complementary roles that provide opportunities for mutual learning and assistance.[46] Some hospitals have created internal doula training programs to reduce conflict between doulas and medical staff.[45][47] There is no law requiring doulas to become certified, however, certification can benefit professional doulas by providing structured education prior to entry into the field, access to a mentor, opportunities for networking, and client confidence.[48] In North America, training generally takes the form of a two- to the three-day seminar, and some experience with childbirth.[49] Trainees might have hands-on practice with various techniques used during childbirth, including maternal positions and movements, relaxation and breathing exercises and other measures that could be used for comfort. Certification can occur through organizations at various levels (local, national, or international) and some require positive evaluations from medical professionals. Certification may also require, in addition to attending a training course, time spent working or learning about maternity care and childbirth classes, and possibly a written exam.[17] Some doulas train through distance education.[46] There is a movement to encourage certification and provide documentation of it on consumer websites such as DoulaMatch where an individual can find certified doulas, childbirth educators, yoga instructors, and other birth-related professionals.[46] Doulas not trained by a formal organization can be controversial within medical settings due to a lack of formal medical education when a discussion regarding medical interventions in labor versus pursuing natural childbirth without an epidural or cesarean section arises.[45] Major doula organizations that offer certification programs include Birth Arts International, Birth Works, Birthing from Within, Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (CAPPA), DONA International, Hypnobirthing, International Childbirth Education Association (ICEA), and ProDoula.[50] Because of the lack of standardization, doula organizations provide different courses with varying requirements and anyone can refer to themselves as a doula.[51] Doulamatch.net, an online referral page for doulas, has offered a list of items that students should look for as they begin looking for training. Amy Gilliland, a researcher on doula care and culture, also lists some qualities a training program should have.[52] Some theorists have stated that it might take college-level work or more in-depth online education in order to provide some of the communication skills that might be necessary.[53] In 2010, a survey of professional Canadian doulas found that the common motivations for doula work include \"desire to support women in childbirth, personal interest, and a wish to share their own positive birth experience with others\" but did not see the work as a means to create steady income.[54] Doulas of color also found motivation in providing care for their racial, ethnic and cultural communities so as to provide culturally competent care.[55] Volunteer doulas often saw doula work as a way to \"help others, to establish a practice as an employed doula, and to have a route into nursing or midwifery.\"[56] From 2021 to present, Canada has specifically focused research on the cultural significance of indigenous practices in doula work.[57][58][59] A 2004 study of North American doulas identified challenges to doula work such as lack of support from clinicians, balancing doula work with family and other work obligations, and being on call.[60] Volunteer doulas also found challenges in individuals' poor understanding of the doula's role, lack of clear boundaries, and complex socio-economic issues.[56] Additionally, doulas often are challenged with the task to navigate their role in medicalized (hospital) births.[61] Due to the social hierarchy and privilege that medical professionals have in medical settings doulas are often subordinate to doctors and physicians. Doulas have to negotiate the power dynamics between the patient and medical provider, while also establishing their legitimacy and role in the process of childbirth.[62] They, therefore, have to be cognizant of the medical environment in which their client chooses to give birth in order to effectively advocate for their client's needs.[63] An antepartum doula provides help and support to someone who has been put on bed rest or is experiencing a high-risk pregnancy. Emotional, physical and practical support can be provided by an antepartum doula in this circumstance.[64] Postpartum doulas provide educational support and practical support in the home in the first weeks and months after childbirth or after adding an infant to the family. The same doula often provides both birth and postpartum services.[2] Their services include a mixture of emotional support and practical help, such as infant care, breastfeeding support, information, advocacy and referral, partner support, sibling care, and household organization/work as the family adjusts to the addition of a new baby.[65] There is some evidence that postpartum doula support can increase breastfeeding and decrease postpartum depression.[5][66] Other workers overlap in some of these services, such as maternity nurses, health visitors, newborn care specialists, lactation consultants, and, historically, monthly nurses. Full-spectrum doulas extend the role of a birth attendant and provide support for all reproductive experiences which connect the role to the larger reproductive justice movement.[3] This can include support for abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, queer family planning, adoption, and fertility as well as extending services to women, men, transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.[3][67][68] Abortion doulas focus on providing support to clients having an induced abortion. They provide emotional, physical, and informational support virtually or in person.[3][15] Full-spectrum doulas often identify as activists as well as service providers and emphasize the human rights of their clients in the hopes of ending social stereotypes.[3] Abortion doulas provide care before, during, and after an abortion, with support varying by person and their informational, emotional, physical, and practical needs. Doulas work in a variety of situations, including community collectives and as solo practitioners, and provide abortion support as a service in their full-spectrum practice. There are no certifications specifically for abortion doulas that are administered nationally or through individual states.[69] In the United States following the landmark decision, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, doulas expect to be contacted more frequently about abortion support as access becomes more limited. They are taking precautions to retain online anonymity to better protect patients and themselves and navigate the threat of legal action.[69] A gender doula provides care before, during, and after the gender transition process for transgender and non-binary individuals.[70] Gender doulas may also serve as patient advocates for their clients against medical practitioners who may misgender or undermine the gender identity of the client. End-of-life or death doulas care for critically ill adults in geriatric care,[17] and during death.[71] While some doulas work independently or on a volunteer basis, others might work in association with a health care service, such as a palliative care service. The roles of an end-of-life doula include not only physical tasks, such as assisting with posture or making the bed comfortable but also emotional and psychological tasks, such as providing guidance and support. In the United States, doulas can be found in hospital, community-based programs as well as private practice or doula agencies. They might also be reimbursed by insurance companies or out-of-pocket by clients.[72][73][74] Since insurance companies typically do not cover the cost of hiring a doula, they are more popular among middle- and upper-class parents than amongst parents with lower incomes.[45][75] Since doula care has the potential to lower maternity costs and reduce health disparities, there is a push for coverage through Medicaid reimbursement programs. As of 2022, four states, Oregon, Minnesota, Virginia and Wisconsin, have implemented reimbursement programs.[34][76] In 2019, New York State launched a doula pilot program for Medicaid reimbursement in Erie and Kings Counties.[77] In that same year, New York State passed a bill to certify doulas to lend legitimacy to the profession and to pave the way for Medicaid reimbursement from the federal government, becoming the first state to do so. Doulas in New York, however, expressed concern about the bill, having not been involved with the bill's writing, citing that state certification would make doulas more beholden to the formal medical system, be a hit to business if certification programs are not approved by the state, and might prevent community doulas from working with low-income individuals.[78][79] In the UK, the National Health Service and promotion of midwifery for low-risk pregnancies provide a continuity of care unavailable to North American pregnant women, but still are seeing an upswing in doulas. This pattern has been suggested to result from the lack of midwives available and a move to provide doulas to individuals at greater risk for poor outcomes.[56] A 2019 study reviewed perceptions of labor companionship across mostly high income countries and found barriers that prevent the universal implementation of doula care. These challenges are due to a multitude of factors dealing with perception (for example, providers not understanding the benefits or roles and other medical aspects being seen as more important) and logistics (chiefly, gaps in policy, difficulty of integration, and lack of training).[80] Community-based doulas work with underserved communities of which they are often members to provide a sense of cultural humility that fosters trust and strengthens relationships between the doula and their client. The services provided are often low cost, and expand in the amount of support offered compared to traditional doulas and consider physical, social spiritual and emotional needs. Services include an increased amount of home visits, preparation for the birthing experience, education, guidance navigating health care systems, language support, screening for mental health, and food security needs.[81] Additionally, community-based doula models provide insight in the creation of policies that will support those families and underserved communities.[81] These doulas also actively engage policy makers by recommendations on certification and Medicaid coverage, integration into medical care, and participating on advisory boards.[82] Since the 1980s, women incarcerated in the US has increased nearly 800 percent, of which an estimated 12,000 pregnant women are incarcerated annually. Pregnant prisoners are allowed to be shackled in more than 20 states and are forced to return to jail within 24 hours without their infants.[83] The environmental factors of the penal system are shown to increase the risks associated with poor perinatal outcomes and have long-term health risks for the women and their children.[84] The implementation of prison doulas rose out of the movement to end shackling for pregnant and laboring women from the prison abolition, human rights, reproductive justice, and birth justice movements in the early 2000s.[84][85] Prison doula organizations work with those incarcerated to provide prenatal care, childbirth education, birth attendance, and breast feeding support. By providing doula services to jails, prisons, recovery centers, and county hospitals, doulas work to improve birth experiences and bonding as well as to challenge the dehumanizing penal environment.[85] In studies of women who received doula services while incarcerated, the women reported increased happiness around their pregnancy; greater feelings of empowerment; a sense of normalcy around birth; and support during separation from their infant.[84][86] While well-received, prison doula support is not widespread in the United States and most programs are local due to the lack of an established federal standard of medical care for pregnant incarcerated individuals.[83] In 2018, Washington was the first state to provide access to midwifery and doula services for incarcerated women for prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care. However, the bill does not establish means of funding the services, and does not establish guidelines for care.[87]",

                "content": "This is an accepted version of this page Ethan Samuel Slater (born June 2, 1992) is an American actor and singer. He is best known for his role as SpongeBob SquarePants in the musical of the same name, for which he received a Tony Award nomination and won a Drama Desk Award in 2018. He had his first major film role as Boq in the musical film Wicked (2024). Ethan Samuel Slater was born on June 2, 1992, in Washington, D.C. He is the third child of Jay Slater, an employee at the Food and Drug Administration.[1][2] He is Jewish and was raised Conservative, attending Ohr Kodesh in Silver Spring.[3] After attending Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School, his family moved to Silver Spring, Maryland.[4][5][6] Slater's mother died when he was seven, which he describes as a \"really big, formative thing in my life. She had left this huge imprint on me, even though I had so few memories.\"[7] Slater graduated from Georgetown Day School in Washington, DC, and studied drama at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. During his time in college, he auditioned to apprentice at a Shakespeare workshop, which then got him an audition in front of director Tina Landau.[8] Slater graduated from Vassar with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Drama in 2014.[9] Slater's first theater appearance was at the New York Musical Theatre Festival in July 2015, in which he starred as Luis in the musical Claudio Quest, directed by John Tartaglia,[10] earning a nomination for the festival's award in the category for Best Individual Performance.[11] Between September 30 and October 24, 2015, he starred in Please excuse my dear aunt Sally in the One Year Lease Theater Company.[12] In December 2015 he joined the Delaware Theatre Company in Wilmington, acting in Barry Levinson's play Diner, directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall.[13] During the same period he appeared in several short films, including Lightning Bugs in a Jar and Evol. In 2016 Slater was cast in the lead role SpongeBob SquarePants in Kyle Jarrow's musical of the same name directed by Tina Landau at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago.[14] The musical achieved success and was praised by theater critics, bringing the production to Broadway at the Palace Theatre in New York between 2017 and 2018.[15][16] For his performance, Slater earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical in 2018, winning in the respective category at the Drama Desk Award and Outer Critics Circle Award. He is also awarded the Theatre World Award for Best Performance in a Broadway Debut in 2018.[17][18] Between 2018 and 2019 he appeared in a few episodes of television series, including Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Murphy Brown, Instinct and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. On March 4, 2019, Slater was cast by director Bartlett Sher in the theatrical special of Camelot at the Lincoln Center Theater in New York.[19] Between 2021 and 2022 he starred in the musical Assassins with the direction of John Doyle at the Lynn F. Angelson Theater in New York, playing Lee Harvey Oswald.[20] His performance earned him a Lucille Lortel Awards nomination for Best Performance.[21] From March to April 2022, Slater originated the role of Max Weinbaum in the play Good Night, Oscar at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago.[22] From 2023 to 2024, he played the Historian, Prince Herbert, and other roles in the Broadway revival of Spamalot at the St. James Theatre.[23][24][25] He played Boq in the two-part film adaptation of the musical Wicked, directed by Jon M. Chu.[26][27] Slater began dating clinical psychologist Dr. Lilly Jay,[28] his high school sweetheart, in 2012.[29][30] They married in 2018, and their son was born in 2022.[31] The couple separated in 2023 and Slater subsequently filed for divorce. The same year, Slater began a relationship with singer Ariana Grande, whom he met on the set of Wicked. In September 2024, it was reported that his divorce from Jay had been finalized.[32][33]",

                "content": "Manage your account Ethan Slater's ex-wife Lilly Jay has reflected on their split in an essay, revealing that she never thought she would get divorced. Slater and Jay's marriage crashed earlier this year, with the Broadway actor moving on to date his \"Wicked\" costar Ariana Grande, who also separated from her ex-husband, Dalton Gomez. Grande and Slater's relationship was widely deemed controversial due to its timing and the public backlash they received afterward. Lilly Jay, a clinical psychologist in perinatal mental health and child development, penned an essay for The Cut published on December 18. In the write-up, she narrated the difficulties she faced following the fallout of her and Slater's marriage and her life as a mom to their two-year-old son. Jay began by stating that no one gets married thinking they would get divorced or boards a plane expecting it to crash. She continued, \"But I really never thought I would get divorced. Especially not just after giving birth to my first child and especially not in the shadow of my husband’s new relationship with a celebrity.\" The mother of one expressed that she was in a season of shock and mourning over a year after her marriage's fallout became public. She wrote, \"I deeply miss the life of invisibility I created for myself as a psychologist specializing in women’s mental health.\" Slater's ex-wife shared more details about how caring for her son was helping her deal with the difficulties. She explained, \"Motherhood, I have learned, fills your time but not your mind. In the countless hours I spend rocking my son to sleep, pushing his stroller, marveling at his sweaty little hands grasping a crayon, I work diligently on my private project of accepting the sudden public downfall of my marriage.\" Jay continued, \"This, I tell myself, is nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to hide. Slowly but surely, I have come to believe that in the absence of the life I planned with my high-school sweetheart, a lifetime of sweetness is waiting for me and my child.\" Jay also wrote about how she and Slater were co-parenting their son, noting that their parenthood remained the same though their partnership had changed. She wrote, \"Both of us fiercely love our son 100 percent of the time, regardless of how our parenting time is divided.\" However, Jay admitted that she was still struggling with the aftermath of her and Slater's public divorce. She noted, \"Days with my son are sunny. Days when I can't escape the promotion of a movie associated with the darkest days of my life are darker.\" The therapist also revealed that her public divorce impacted her career, writing, \"I can't say for sure how much my career has been impacted by what's out there online. But there have been hints along the way, like the job offer that dissolved without explanation after yet another tabloid news cycle or the patient who's scheduled for a first appointment but seemingly vanishes.\" Slater filed for divorce from Jay in July 2023, a month before their son's one-year birthday. The news of the divorce filing came after reports that Ariana Grande had ended her relationship with her ex-husband, Dalton Gomez. Not long after filing for divorce, Slater and Grande started dating, with reports of their romance earning them severe backlash on social media. There were speculations that Slater cheated on Jay with Grande, though he and the singer have since debunked that narrative. Jay and Slater finalized their divorce settlement on September 12, but details of the document remained undisclosed. Slater broke his silence on his controversial relationship with Grande during an interview with GQ in October. He acknowledged that it was difficult to have things about his private life become a topic of public discussion. The actor also said, \"It's really hard to see people who don't know anything about what's happening commenting on it and speculating, and then getting things wrong about the people you love.\" However, Slater gushed about Grande, saying it was a \"beautiful thing\" to fall in love with her on set, before adding that he was proud of her and her work on \"Wicked.\" Grande also spoke about the speculations about her and Slater's relationship in a chat with Vanity Fair in September, expressing her disappointment that many people believed the worst version of events.",

                "content": "When news first broke that pop star Ariana Grande and her Wicked costar Ethan Slater were an item in July 2023, Slater’s estranged wife Lilly Jay described the relationship with a few choice words. Grande “isn’t a girl’s girl,” Jay told Page Six. “My family is just collateral damage.” The former couple has one son together. Now, more than a year of Wicked-mania later, Jay, a clinical psychologist, has published a lengthy essay for The Cut about what happened when her personal life became tabloid fodder. Jay and Slater attend the Tony Awards in June 2018. Jay writes that Slater was her “high-school sweetheart,” and for years, she avoided social media. As Slater began to work as an actor, the divergence between their chosen careers grew stark. “It was a tenuous balance—my profession, which requires privacy, and his, which is measured in applause—but it worked well while life was unfolding according to our plans,” she writes. Ahead of filming for Wicked, Jay moved to London with Slater and their then two-month-old son. “Consumed by the magic and mundanity of new motherhood, I didn’t understand the growing distance between us.” Jay wrote that she and Slater have worked out a co-parenting relationship, but the promotional cycle for Wicked wore on her. “While our partnership has changed, our parenthood has not. Both of us fiercely love our son 100 percent of the time, regardless of how our parenting time is divided,” she said. “As for me, days with my son are sunny. Days when I can’t escape the promotion of a movie associated with the saddest days of my life are darker.” Wicked: Part One opened in theaters on November 22, earning $114 million in its opening weekend, but the promotional tour is ongoing. On Monday, Universal Pictures announced that the sequel would officially be titled Wicked: For Good, and is set to be released in November 2025. As for Slater and Grande, their relationship is still going strong. Earlier this week, Grande took to Instagram to respond with a heart emoji to a black-and-white photo Slater shared from a photo shoot with UK-based Schön Magazine. In another comment, she added that Slater is “the Buster Keaton of today!” Representatives for Slater and Grande did not immediately respond to Vanity Fair.

Nebraska plays its home games at the Bob Devaney Sports Center and has sold out every home match since 2001.[2] The team has been coached by John Cook since 2000. The program was founded in 1975 and is one of the most decorated in women's volleyball, with more wins than any other program and five national championships.[3] Nebraska has been ranked in every weekly poll since the introduction of the AVCA National Poll in 1982 and has spent more weeks ranked number one than any other program. The Cornhuskers' 102 All-Americans are the most in the country.[4][5] Nebraska regularly leads the NCAA in average attendance and has participated in several of the highest-attended women's volleyball games ever played.[6] On August 30, 2023, Nebraska and Omaha played at Memorial Stadium in front of 92,003 people, the highest-attended women's sporting event in the world.[7][8] Until the 1972 passing of Title IX, Nebraska's volleyball program existed for four years as an \"extramural\" sport operating as a part of the school's physical education department.[9] Pat Sullivan was hired in 1974, and she led the program's first season of varsity competition. Though the school offered its first scholarships for female student-athletes to members of this team, which went 25–10–1 and placed sixth in the AIAW's Region VI tournament, the university recognizes 1975 as its inaugural season due to \"a lack of records [from 1974] and tradition.\"[10] Sullivan compiled an 83–21 record over two official seasons, including an AIAW regional final appearance in 1975 and NU's first Big Eight championship in 1976.[11] Sullivan would later go on to coach volleyball at George Washington University for nine seasons, as well as be a professor there.[12][13] Terry Pettit was hired as Nebraska's second head coach in 1977.[14] Pettit, an Indiana native, was an English teacher and volleyball coach at Louisburg College in North Carolina[15] when a fellow coach found out about Nebraska's open job and directed Pettit to apply.[16] From 1977 to 1999, he led the Cornhuskers to a record of 694–148, winning twenty-one conference championships and the 1995 national championship.[17] In his twenty-three years as head coach,[18] Pettit built the program into a national power. Under his guidance, Nebraska appeared in eighteen consecutive NCAA tournaments, including six national semifinals, two national runner-up finishes, and NU's first national title. Pettit's teams won a conference championship in all but two seasons during his tenure. His list of honors includes induction into the AVCA Hall of Fame in 2009, USA Volleyball All-Time Great Coach Award, and several national and regional coach of the year awards from various publications.[19][20] Under Pettit, Nebraska became one of the first schools to offer scholarships to female athletes. In 1978, Terri Kanouse and Shandi Pettine were the first players to receive full scholarships for volleyball, and just three years later, the university allowed Pettit to offer up to twelve scholarships.[21] Pettit coached thirty-six AVCA All-Americans at Nebraska, the highest number of any school in that time span.[17] Pettit's only national championship as a head coach came in 1995.[15] After dropping an early-season match to Stanford, NU swept twenty-two consecutive opponents and won thirty-one straight matches. Nebraska defeated Texas 3–1 to win the title, and AVCA National Player of the Year Allison Weston was among three Huskers named first-team All-Americans. Before the 1999 season, Pettit hired former assistant John Cook as associate head coach. Following Nebraska's loss in the national semifinals, Pettit retired and Cook became head coach. In 2020, Pettit was inducted into the Nebraska Athletics Hall of Fame.[22] Cook succeeded the retiring Pettit before the 2000 season after a seven-year stint as head coach at Wisconsin. He was Pettit's assistant coach from 1989 to 1991.[18] In twenty years at Nebraska, Cook has guided the Huskers to four national championships, five other national semifinal appearances and an NCAA tournament berth in each season. Cook was named National Coach of the Year in 2000 and 2005, Central Region Coach of the Year four times, and conference coach of the year six times. He was awarded the USA Volleyball All-Time Great Coach Award in 2008, and was inducted into the AVCA Hall of Fame in 2017. Under Cook, Greichaly Cepero, Christina Houghtelling, and Sarah Pavan won AVCA National Player of the Year, and Pavan won the Honda-Broderick Cup in 2007 as the Collegiate Female Athlete of the Year. In his first year as NU's head coach, Cook guided the Huskers to their second national championship. After starting the season outside the national top ten, Nebraska went 20–0 in Big 12 play and defeated Cook's former team, Wisconsin, in a five-set national title match to cap a 34–0 season and become the second undefeated team in NCAA volleyball history.[23] Sophomore setter Greichaly Cepero was named National Player of the Year and won the Honda Sports Award as the best female athlete in collegiate sports.[5] Nebraska finished the 2001 and 2002 seasons 20–0 in conference play, but lost late in the tournament to Stanford and Hawaii, ending both seasons 31–2. Nebraska's seventy-seven game Big 12 winning streak ended with a loss at Kansas State in 2003 as the Cornhuskers failed to make it out of a regional. Nebraska earned the number one overall seed in the 2004 NCAA tournament, which began an NCAA-record eighty-eight consecutive weeks the Cornhuskers were ranked atop the AVCA weekly poll. The Huskers fell to two-time defending champion USC but freshman Sarah Pavan was named AVCA National Freshman of the Year. Pavan became one of the most decorated players in volleyball history, including four First-Team All-American honors and the 2006 National Player of the Year award. Nebraska was again the top seed in the 2005 NCAA Tournament and swept through the first five rounds, but was upset by Washington in the national title match.[24] Nebraska lost only once in the 2006 regular season as its streak at the top of the rankings continued. The Cornhuskers were the top seed in the NCAA Tournament for the third consecutive year and returned to the national title match after a five-set win over Minnesota.[25] Nebraska dropped the first set to Stanford but won the next three to win the school's third championship in front of a then-NCAA volleyball-record crowd of 17,209.[26] Nebraska swept twenty-four of its thirty-three opponents and lost just fourteen sets all season and became the first team to win the championship while hosting the finals since UCLA in 1991.[5] Pavan won numerous awards after the season and sophomore Jordan Larson was named a first-team All American.[27][28] Nebraska's season opener in 2007 marked the program's 1,000th game, a sweep of Tennessee in the AVCA Showcase.[29] The Cornhuskers' eighty-eight week streak at number one came to an end in October, but NU won its fourth straight Big 12 title. After surviving an upset bid by unseeded Michigan State in the NCAA Tournament, Nebraska fell to California in the regional final.[30] Pavan joined Texas softball pitcher Cat Osterman as the only repeat Big 12 Female Athlete of the Year and Nebraska placed a then-record five players on All-America teams.[31] Nebraska won its fifth consecutive Big 12 title in 2008[32] and advanced through the first three rounds of the NCAA Tournament to face Washington.[33] After losing the first two sets, Nebraska came back to tie the match, and used a nine-point run to win set five.[34] Nebraska met undefeated Penn State in the national semifinal and again fell behind 2–0. The Huskers rallied to deal the Nittany Lions their first two set losses of the season, snapping their NCAA-record 111 consecutive set wins, but lost the match in five sets.[35] Nebraska's NCAA-record ninety-game home winning streak came to an end at the beginning of the 2009 season.[36] In the 2009 NCAA Tournament Texas became the first team to beat NU three times in one season after ending the Huskers' five-year stretch atop the Big 12.[37] In 2010, the University of Nebraska announced it would be ending its fifteen-year relationship with the Big 12 and joining the Big Ten. The Cornhuskers won the Big 12 in 2010, departing with an all-time conference record of 278–22. Move to the Big Ten The University of Nebraska joined the Big Ten Conference in 2011. This meant for the first time NU would regularly play longtime rival Penn State along with other nationally relevant programs including Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois. The Huskers won the Big Ten in their first year of competition but failed to make a regional semifinal for the first time since 1993.[38] Nebraska did not win another Big Ten title until 2016 and failed to make the national semifinals in six straight seasons, the longest stretch for the program in over thirty years. Nebraska's drought ended in 2015 when the Cornhuskers swept former Big 12 rival Texas to win the program's fourth national championship in front of an NCAA-record crowd in Omaha. Mikaela Foecke had nineteen kills in the title game and became the third freshman named the NCAA tournament's Most Outstanding Player. The Cornhuskers spent much of the following season ranked number one in the country and won the program's first conference title since 2011.[39] In the 2016 NCAA Tournament, Nebraska fought off two match points to defeat Penn State in the regional semifinals[40] but fell to Texas in the national semifinals.[41] Nebraska's 2017 season opened with consecutive losses to Florida and Oregon, but the Cornhuskers finished the regular season with just two more losses, ultimately sharing the Big Ten title with Penn State. NU defeated the top-seeded Nittany Lions in five sets to advance to the national title match, defeating Florida 3–1 to win the school's fifth national title in front of a then-record crowd of 18,516.[42] Outside hitter Mikaela Foecke was again named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, making her one of four players to win the honor more than once. NU made a program-record fourth straight trip to the national semifinals in 2018 but fell to Stanford in a five-set national title match. After a pair of regional final losses in 2019 and 2020 (though the 2020 Tournament was held in the spring of 2021), NU defeated No. 2 Texas and No. 3 Pittsburgh in the 2021 Tournament to reach the school's tenth national title match; Nebraska's five-set loss to Wisconsin set a new NCAA volleyball attendance record.[43] Following the season, freshman libero Lexi Rodriguez became the second Cornhusker and first libero to win AVCA National Freshman of the Year. On August 30, 2023, Nebraska hosted \"Volleyball Day in Nebraska\" at Memorial Stadium, with a temporary court on the football playing field. The event featured an exhibition between two of the state's three Division II schools, Nebraska–Kearney and Wayne State, followed by a regular-season match between the Cornhuskers and Omaha. The event was declared a sellout on April 27, three days after tickets went on sale. The official attendance for Nebraska's 3–0 victory was 92,003, the highest ever for a women's sporting event in the United States. It also set an all-time attendance record for a sporting event in Memorial Stadium history.[44][7] Assistant coaching history NU compiled an all-time record of 511–36 at the 4,030-seat Nebraska Coliseum, losing just three home matches in thirty-three seasons of conference play. In 1991, the Cornhuskers played home games at the Bob Devaney Sports Center while the Coliseum was being renovated specifically to host volleyball matches. NU has hosted at least one NCAA Tournament match every year since 1984, including a 52–4 postseason record at the Coliseum. Nebraska established an NCAA record with their 88th consecutive home win in 2009,[45] a streak that ended at ninety when UCLA defeated NU in front of an NCAA regular season-record crowd of 13,870.[46] In 2008, the AVCA's Kathy DeBoer described the Coliseum as \"the epicenter of volleyball fandom\".[47] The Coliseum was one of few collegiate arenas designed specifically for volleyball. It is noted for its classical architecture and intimate atmosphere. At the Coliseum, the Huskers began an NCAA record for most consecutive sellouts in a women's sport, a streak that continues at the Devaney Center.[48] The Coliseum was the subject of a CBS Sports documentary in 2011.[49] Nebraska's volleyball program moved to the Bob Devaney Sports Center in 2013, which was vacated when Pinnacle Bank Arena was built for NU's basketball teams. The Devaney Center's capacity was decreased from 13,596 to 7,907 with luxury suites on the south side of the court.[50] The capacity was modestly increased to 8,309 prior to the 2023 season.[51] Despite the increase in capacity from the Coliseum, the Huskers' sellout streak still continues and stands at 339, the longest in any NCAA women's sport.[52] Nebraska has led the country in attendance every year since moving to the Devaney Center,[a] averaging over 8,000 fans per game each season.[53] The move to the Devaney Center has made Nebraska's volleyball program profitable each year, a rarity in women's college athletics.[54] With no financial support from tax dollars, tuition, or student fees, the team is entirely self-sufficient.[55] Nebraska has played in eleven of the twelve highest-attended matches in NCAA volleyball history.[b][56] National Player of the Year National Freshman of the Year National Coach of the Year Nebraska has had 54 total players account for 106 AVCA All-American selections, including 52 First-Team AVCA All-American selections.[57][58] First team Second team Third team Team[59][60] Individual The Nebraska Cornhuskers women's beach volleyball team began play in the spring of 2013 as the school's twenty-second intercollegiate sport. In 2016, the NCAA began sponsoring a beach volleyball tournament (previously the sport was run by the AVCA), but Nebraska did not attempt to qualify. Increasing popularity of the sport in the Midwest has resulted in a significant uptick in participation; Nebraska is now one of four Division 1 competitors in the Midwest (alongside Eastern Illinois, Lindenwood and Missouri State). Several universities at lower levels have also formed programs, including one of the Nebraska State Colleges, Wayne State.[61] Still, events in the Midwest are scarce and NU generally plays the bulk of its season during a spring break trip to California and Hawaii. John Cook, previously coach for both volleyball programs, has said the school views beach volleyball primarily as a training and recruiting tool for its indoor team, with the rosters usually fully overlapping. Championship-winning success from the indoor program has not translated to the beach volleyball scene— the team has a 3-52 record all-time against ranked opponents. Jaylen Reyes took over as Head Beach Coach for the 2023 season.[62] Beach volleyball competes as an independent, making it one of only three programs at Nebraska not affiliated with the Big Ten. On March 9, 2016, Nebraska hosted Missouri Baptist at the erstwhile Hawks Championship Center. The match, closed to the public due to space limitations, was the first collegiate beach volleyball match held in the state of Nebraska. The Cornhuskers swept the Spartans 5–0. A rematch the next season yielded identical results. Another 23 matches have been held at the athletic complex.[63] Additionally, in February 2024, Nebraska hosted a triangular at its campus recreational courts.[64] In 2007, prior to official AVCA/NCAA competitions, Jordan Larson and Sarah Pavan defeated student-athletes from seven other schools to win the Collegiate Beach Volleyball Championship, an invitational tournament featuring two players per school.[65]",

                "content": "Jeff Probst dubbed this winner one of the 'best overall players' to ever take on 'Survivor' ©2024 CBS Broadcasting, Inc. Warning: Survivor season 47 spoilers ahead! The tribe has spoken: Rachel LaMont was crowned the winner of Survivor season 47 and its $1 million dollar prize. After consistently finding herself at the bottom and being labeled a big threat by multiple players early on in the game, the graphic designer from Southfield, Mich., used a combination of strategic social play, immunity challenge wins and good old-fashioned eavesdropping to make it to the final three. It also didn’t hurt that Rachel found a hidden immunity idol in her French fries. During the final episode, which aired on Dec. 18, she owed her game to the jury (and former tribe mates) and dismissed fellow player Sam Phalen’s remark that her entire strategy relied on luck. “I obviously had luck in the game, but I do think that getting the clue in the burger was the luckiest thing that happened to me,” Rachel told Entertainment Weekly after the final episode aired. “I think that I have reasoning and evidence to back up that basically everything else that happened to me was not luck.\" Here’s everything to know about Survivor 47 winner Rachel LaMont and the important moments she said the long-running competition show didn't air. ©2024 CBS Broadcasting, Inc. Rachel works as a user interface designer in Southfield, Mich., a suburb just outside of Detroit. She told The Oakland Press in September 2024 that she used her skills in creating digital experiences to influence her game strategy on Survivor. \"When you use an app, you don’t think about every button you press,\" Rachel said. \"That’s how I want to play Survivor. I want to integrate myself into the game so that people won’t notice me until it’s too late.\" ©2024 CBS Broadcasting, Inc. After an intense fire-making showdown between Sam and Teeny Chirichillo, the remaining three players of Survivor season 47 were Sam, Rachel and Sue Smey. Each tribe member pleaded their case to the jury, and Rachel won the title of Sole Survivor with seven of the eight votes. The only jury member who didn’t vote for Rachel was Kyle Ostwald, who wrote Sam’s name down on the parchment. Rachel later told EW that his vote was the one she was “the least sure about.\" ©2024 CBS Broadcasting, Inc. Rachel won four individual immunity challenges throughout the season — a history-making Survivor record that only four other women have claimed: Kelly Wiglesworth, Jenna Morasca, Kim Spradlin and Chrissy Hofbeck. Winning the final immunity challenge ensured Rachel’s spot in the final three. A deleted scene from the finale showed that she was very much aware of the potential record — and she was gunning for it. “I want that record of four immunity wins,” Rachel said in the deleted clip. “I feel like this immunity challenge coming up is my final push. It's the final one where if I win this, I think I can maybe win it all.” Robert Voets/CBS Season 47 wasn’t the first time Rachel stepped foot on that beach in Fiji. She was an alternate for the previous season, meaning she made it through the casting process but wasn’t chosen to play. The graphic designer told EW that the only advantage of being a backup player is understanding how the pre-game works. “There's so much waiting and it's kind of awkward,” Rachel said. “It's like sitting in a library for a week straight where you can't talk and you're just staring at each other.” Though she doesn’t think it gave her much of a leg-up during the actual competition, she did say that her short-lived experience on season 46 helped with her mentality going into season 47. Rachel said, “It felt freer and lighter and more like, I really want this. I don't need this, I want it. And it was just kind of a mentality switch that I think only happened with the fact that I got so close.\" The eventual winner continued, “I was the backup quarterback at the Super Bowl, and then I got to play the next year. And I think that something about that gave me a little bit more confidence and a little bit more of a mentality shift that let me just have fun with it.” Robert Voets/CBS via Getty With only 90 minutes per episode, there’s not enough time to cover all the relationship dynamics between players. Rachel told EW that, surprisingly, one of her closest alliances, with Caroline Vidmar, didn’t make the cut. “She was by far my number one from almost the night Sierra was voted out after Tribal,” the season 47 winner said. “And I was very shocked that I don't think there was a single one-on-one conversation with Caroline and I that entire stretch ... We were very clearly working together.” Caroline was voted off during the Dec. 4 episode as a part of Sam, Genevieve Mushaluk and Andy Rueda’s iconic Operation: the Italy ruse. ©2024 CBS Broadcasting, Inc. In a Dec. 19 interview with EW, host Jeff Probst gave the season 47 winner some very high praise. “I think Rachel will go down as one of the best overall players to ever compete on Survivor,” he said. “She made the most of every opportunity, and when in trouble, always found a way out. Her dominant challenge performance speaks for itself, and her final argument to the jury about why she deserved their vote was very well-crafted with just the right amount of confidence and humility.” Rachel LaMont/ Instagram Rachel told CBS Chicago that only her husband knew how far she got on the show. The graphic designer kept it a secret from the rest of her family and friends and held watch parties at her house so she could witness all their reactions to her big moves. \"For me to not just get on but to get them watching my journey and to know ultimately that I win, it was the best gift I could ever have,\" Rachel said. Though she hasn’t revealed what she’ll do next — or what she’ll do with her $1 million dollar check — Rachel did make an account on Cameo. Her profile says she offers birthday wishes as well as pep talks and advice.",

                "content": "Robert Wood Johnson IV (born April 12, 1947) is an American businessman who is co-owner of the New York Jets and was formerly the United States ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2017 to 2021. He is a great-grandson of Robert Wood Johnson I, and an heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune. In 2000 he purchased the New York Jets football team for $635 million, the highest price for a New York professional sports team at that time, and is currently the Jets co-owner alongside his brother, Christopher Johnson. During his tenure as owner, Johnson was also part of the NFL search committee for a new commissioner. A longtime Republican Party donor, Johnson was a supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, and was appointed by Trump to the post of United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Events during his tenure included Britain's exit from the EU and the relocation of the United States embassy in London. His brother Christopher took over Jets operations during his post. Upon his return in 2021, Johnson resumed his role as chairman. In 2023, he pursued Aaron Rodgers, with the Jets finalizing a trade with the Green Bay Packers in April. In 2022, Johnson made a £2 billion bid for Chelsea F.C. but withdrew from the bidding process later that month. Johnson was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the son of Betty Johnson (née Wold; 1921–2020)[1] and Robert Wood Johnson III, and the great-grandson of Robert Wood Johnson I, who founded the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical company,[2][3] along with his brothers James Wood Johnson and Edward Mead Johnson.[4] Robert Wood Johnson IV grew up with four siblings: Keith Johnson, Billy Johnson, Elizabeth \"Libet\" Johnson, and Christopher Wold Johnson, in northern New Jersey, and attended the Millbrook School. He graduated from the University of Arizona.[5][6] He worked for J&J for a single summer.[7] Johnson was the chairman and chief executive of The Johnson Company, Inc., a private investment firm.[8] In 2006, a Senate subcommittee produced a 370-page report that said that some prominent figures, including Johnson, purchased capital gain losses as a way to reduce their own income tax bills. Johnson settled with the IRS in 2006, agreeing to pay the owed taxes plus interest.[9] Johnson was the committee president of the Pre-Commissioning Unit for the San Antonio-class ship USS New York (LPD-21).[10] In January 2000, Woody Johnson purchased the New York Jets for $635 million, making it the third-highest price ever paid for a professional sports team at the time, and the highest for a New York professional sports team.[11] As of September 2019, Forbes valued the team at $3.2 billion.[12] Following his acquisition of the Jets, Johnson moved the team to the newly constructed Meadowlands Stadium, sharing it as an equal partner with the New York Giants. The stadium, later named MetLife Stadium, officially opened on April 10, 2010.[13] In 2017, upon being appointed the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Johnson's brother, Christopher Johnson, assumed the roles of CEO and acting owner of the Jets.[14] Woody Johnson resumed his position as chairman in 2021 after returning to the United States, with Christopher Johnson becoming vice-chairman.[15][16] In January 2023, Johnson expressed the need for a strong quarterback to complement the Jets' robust defense, describing it as the \"missing piece\" in the team's lineup.[17] Subsequently, Johnson pursued four-time MVP Aaron Rodgers, stating to ESPN the importance of securing the best possible quarterback to lead the team.[18][19] The Jets also hired Nathaniel Hackett as offensive coordinator, given his strong rapport with Rodgers.[20] On April 24, 2023, it was reported that the Jets were finalizing a trade deal with the Green Bay Packers for Rodgers.[21] In March 2022, Johnson made a £2 billion bid to purchase London football club Chelsea F.C. from sanctioned billionaire Roman Abramovich.[22][23] Johnson, who became a fan of the team during his ambassadorship in London, was considered to have an advantage over other bidders like Saudi Media Group due to his familiarity with London and experience in sports management.[24][25] However, by March 25, it was reported that Johnson was no longer in contention to buy Chelsea F.C.[26] Johnson also helped the league select a successor to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.[27][28] Johnson is a billionaire.[29][7] As a fourth-generation descendant of one of the founders of the Johnson & Johnson company, he is one of the heirs of the Johnson family fortune.[7][a] In a 2017 financial disclosure form, Johnson listed his net worth at $4.2 billion, with most of his wealth tied to his ownership of the Jets and its stadium; he also reported owning at least 1.56 million J&J shares (a stake then valued at more than $50 million).[30] As of April 2024, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index placed his net worth at an estimated $9.92 billion.[7] By the year 2000, Johnson had given more than $1 million to various Republican candidates and committees. Between 1997 and 1998, he donated $130,000 to the Republican Party, along with donating $22,583 to George W. Bush's 1998 gubernatorial re-election campaign of Texas. He was later a major New York fundraiser for Bush's 2000 presidential campaign.[31] In May 2008, he orchestrated a fundraiser in New York City that brought in $7 million in a single evening for John McCain's presidential campaign, by far the largest amount collected up to that point by a campaign that had been struggling to raise money. Johnson also provided significant funding to 2008 Republican National Convention host committee; from a $10 million shortfall, Johnson contributed personally and solicited friends to assist in covering the convention deficit.[32] In 2011, Johnson endorsed former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries.[33] In September 2013, Johnson hosted a fundraiser for the Republican National Committee (RNC) at his home in New York City.[34] By 2016, Johnson had known Donald Trump for about 30 years, with the two men having social connections.[35] Nevertheless, in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Johnson initially endorsed Jeb Bush over Trump.[35] In June 2015, Johnson was named the national finance chairman for Bush's campaign.[36] On several occasions, Trump singled out Johnson in a speech attacking Bush for accepting \"special interest\" money from donors.[35][37] In May 2016, after Trump became the presumptive nominee, Johnson endorsed Trump for president.[38][35][2] He met with Trump at Trump Tower and was named one of the RNC's six finance vice chairmen, responsible for an effort to raise $1 billion on behalf of Trump's campaign.[35][37] Johnson had by August 2019 donated $1.5 million to Donald Trump's presidential campaigns and inaugural committee.[39] In February 2020, Johnson gave $575,000 to a fundraising committee for Trump's 2020 re-election campaign, and $355,000 to the RNC.[40] In May 2020, he gave $1 million to America First Action, Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC.[40] On January 8, 2021, Johnson released a statement condemning the 2021 United States Capitol attack.[41] In 2023, Johnson gave at least $1 million to a super PAC backing Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.[42][43] He stood behind Trump at an election-night rally during the 2024 South Carolina primary.[44] On January 19, 2017, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he planned to nominate Johnson to become United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom.[45][46] On June 22, 2017, Trump nominated Johnson for the position.[47][48][49] Prior to becoming ambassador, he had no diplomatic experience.[2] Following a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee,[50] Johnson was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 3, 2017,[51] by voice vote.[48] He was sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence on August 21, 2017, in the Oval Office. Johnson presented his credentials to Queen Elizabeth II on November 8, 2017.[52][53] In 2018, Johnson oversaw the relocation of the United States Embassy in London from Grosvenor Square, where it had been since 1938, to a new location in Nine Elms.[54] During Johnson's tenure, Britain withdrew from the EU. Johnson advocated for a bilateral US-UK trade deal post-Brexit, in line with President Trump's hopes during that time.[55] Johnson had a private dinner with Queen Elizabeth II at Winfield House on March 14, 2019, just two days after British Parliament rejected Theresa May's Brexit plan.[56] In June 2019, he further stated that a post-Brexit deal between the US and the UK would cover \"all things that are traded\", including the National Health Service and agricultural sector.[57] In January 2020, Johnson stated that the US was never interested in the NHS, but reiterated American interest in a free-trade deal with the UK.[58] Johnson advocated for closer agricultural trade between the US and UK, and the deregulation of US food exports to Britain.[59] In March 2019, Johnson wrote an article in the Daily Telegraph saying that chlorinated chicken was a \"public safety no-brainer\" and that health fears over hormone-fed beef were \"myths\".[60] This came after he urged the UK to open up to the US agriculture market after the British exit from the European Union and ignore the \"smear campaign\" of those with \"their own protectionist agenda\".[61] Johnson was criticized by several British agriculture standard boards, such as the Red Tractor Assurance whose CEO, Jim Moseley stated the UK's food standards were \"now under threat from ... the United States food lobby\".[62][61] Minette Batters, president of the UK National Farmers Union, agreed with Johnson's claims that chlorine-rinsed chicken was safe for consumption, but stated that factors such as animal welfare and environmental protection also had to be considered.[63] Batters commented that accepting US agricultural products produced in ways that would be illegal in the UK would \"put British producers out of business\". The US National Farmers Union maintained that US methods of meat production were \"safe\", describing criticism as \"fear-mongering\".[60] Johnson advised the UK government to ban Huawei from being used in the nation's 5G networks after departing Prime Minister Theresa May approved the company in early 2019.[64] Johnson said that Huawei could represent an economic and security risk, comparing it to \"letting a kleptomaniac move into your house.\"[65] In 2020, after Britain decided to ban Huawei from its 5G mobile networks, Johnson welcomed the decision as a victory for human rights and fair trading practices.[66] In July 2020, the State Department investigated allegations made by some current and former staff members that accused Johnson of making inappropriate comments about issues concerning race, personal appearance, and Black History Month.[67][68][69] Johnson denied the allegations, asserting that the claims were inconsistent with his values and record. The State Department and the U.S. Embassy in London stood by Johnson, highlighting his professional conduct and dedication to U.S.-UK relations. While an Inspector General report on the matter was pending, Johnson maintained that he had always followed ethical guidelines and that the accusations did not reflect his long-standing principles.[70] After the investigation, the inspector general issued a report in August 2020 that said that Johnson \"sometimes made inappropriate or insensitive comments on topics generally considered Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)-sensitive, such as religion, sex, or color\" that could \"create an offensive working environment\" and violate EEO (antidiscrimination) laws.[71] The inspector general's office recommended that the State Department's Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs and Office of Civil Rights (S/OCR) coordinate an investigation into Johnson's conduct. S/OCR did so, and found that allegations against Johnson were unsubstantiated.[72] In February 2018, Johnson as ambassador sought to have the lucrative British Open golf tournament moved to Trump's Turnberry Golf Resort in Scotland, raising the idea with Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell.[2] The New York Times reported, and the former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in London Lewis Lukens later confirmed, that Trump had asked Johnson to seek British government influence in obtaining the Open for Turnberry.[2][73] At the time Lukens warned Johnson not to raise the question with the UK government, saying that an attempt to further the president's personal financial interests in this way would be unethical and probably illegal. Johnson did so anyway, unsuccessfully.[2][73] In a statement, the British government said that Johnson \"made no request of Mr. Mundell regarding the British Open or any other sporting event\"; the statement did not say whether Johnson had raised the subject of Turnberry.[2] Johnson did not deny the episode, saying only that he complied with \"the ethical rules and requirements of my office\"; Trump denied that he had ever spoken to Johnson \"about Turnberry.\"[74] Lukens documented his concerns to State Department officials. Johnson forced out Lukens several months later, before the scheduled end of his tenure in London.[2] The report that Johnson used his position as ambassador to promote the president's personal business interests sparked an inquiry by the State Department inspector general's office.[40] In an interview in August 2020, Lukens said that the inspector general's report had halted without a public report being issued, which he considered unusual.[73] In 1977, Johnson married former fashion model Nancy Sale Johnson. They had three children before divorcing in 2001. In early 2010, daughter Casey Johnson died of diabetic ketoacidosis.[75] He started a research foundation, the Alliance for Lupus Research, after his daughter Jaime was found to have lupus.[76] In 2009, Johnson married Suzanne Ircha, a former actress and equities managing director at Sandler O'Neill & Partners.[77][78] They have two children.[79] Suzanne's father emigrated from Ternopil, Ukraine after World War II, and her mother was a first-generation Ukrainian American.[80] She grew up in a Ukrainian neighborhood in Greenwich Village.[81] Johnson has homes in Bedminster Township, New Jersey,[82] and Palm Beach island in Florida, residing in the latter since 2020.[83] He formerly had an apartment in Manhattan,[82] but sold the unit (a two-floor duplex at 834 Fifth Avenue) in 2014 to billionaire Leonard Blavatnik for $80 million, setting a record for the costliest co-op ever sold in New York.[84] Johnson is known for philanthropy, especially donations to medical research. He raised money and lobbied to increase federal funding for lupus and diabetes.[85] Johnson is also a trustee of the Robert Wood Johnson Jr. Charitable Trust.[31] He is the only member of the Johnson family to be invited to join the board of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.[86] Johnson was the chairman of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International. He and his wife became involved with diabetes charities after his daughter Casey was diagnosed with diabetes in 1988.[31] In 1994, he co-wrote the book Managing Your Child's Diabetes with his wife Nancy, and Casey.[87] As of 2000, he had donated $12 million to the foundation. Johnson was a chairman on the Council on Foreign Relations, and successfully lobbied Congress to approve a five-year, $750 million package for funding diabetes research in 2002.[88] Casey died of diabetic ketoacidosis on January 4, 2010.[89] On October 24, 2012, Johnson wrote an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal titled \"The Folly of Defunding Diabetes Research\", which urged Congress to approve long-term funding for the Special Diabetes Program.[90] He visited the University of Birmingham in 2018 to discuss the university's diabetes research and research library.[91] Johnson is the founding chairman of the Alliance for Lupus Research (ALR).[92] He founded the legacy organization, Alliance for Lupus Research, in 1999 after his daughter Jaime[93] was diagnosed with lupus, and he realized that there was a lack of research in that area.[94] During the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Johnson and his wife Suzanne, who comes from a Ukrainian background, have organized aid efforts for Ukraine.[95] Their family visited Poland, which is the primary destination for Ukrainian refugees displaced by the crisis.[96] While in Poland, they made visits to community centers, shelters, and orphanages housing Ukrainian refugees.[97] In an article for The Telegraph, Johnson urged the United States and the United Kingdom to aid Ukraine.[96] In April 2022, the Jets pledged a $1 million donation to Ukraine, to be distributed to various organizations, including Plast Scouting USA and United24.[98][99][97] Media related to Woody Johnson at Wikimedia Commons",

                "content": "ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON, a member of the founding family of Johnson & Johnson, has built upon his family's proud legacy of achievement as a successful businessman, compassionate philanthropist, civic leader, and diplomat. Upon purchasing the team in 2000, Johnson established his commitment to a culture of success built on three key elements: passionate players, supportive fans, and a new stadium. Under his leadership, the Jets entered their new home field, MetLife Stadium, an award-winning venue that has been ranked as the #1 highest grossing venue in the world and recognized by Billboard as stadium of the decade. He also moved the Jets into the Atlantic Health Jets Training Center, a world-class 224,000 square-foot complex that united the entire organization, and provided the perfect facility for everyone—players, coaches, and staff—to continually improve and excel. In 2017, Johnson was appointed the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom. As ambassador, he strengthened the 'Special Relationship' between the US and the UK, by promoting security and economic prosperity over a range of issues from trade to cyber security policies. While in London, the Ambassador resided in the historic Winfield House, receiving world leaders including Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and on multiple occasions, President Donald Trump. Ambassador Johnson led the relocation of over 1,000 employees from the Embassy's historic location at Grosvenor Square to a new state of the art headquarters at Nine Elms. When the pandemic struck London, he then directed those employees in the remote, effective, and efficient operation of the Embassy to continue to serve and promote the United States' interests in the United Kingdom. Throughout his tenure at the Embassy, Ambassador Johnson engaged with government leaders and the British people, traveling extensively throughout the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland to hear local concerns and emphasize the 'Special Relationship.' Beyond the field, Ambassador Johnson's philosophy of a successful team celebrates the crucial role of fans, as well as the significant role the team plays in the community. In this spirit, the team, through the New York Jets Foundation, positively influences the lives of young people in the area by expanding youth football, preventing bullying, and promoting social justice, particularly in disadvantaged communities. Among the Foundation's programs is the launch of the first Girls High School Flag Football League in New Jersey and first NFL Girls Flag Football League in the United Kingdom. In 2022, the Jets announced a $1 million donation to help aid the people of Ukraine, with the money distributed among various organizations, each receiving $100,000, over the course of a year. For Johnson, the events in Ukraine are personal; his wife, Suzanne, grew up in a Ukrainian neighborhood in New York. Her mother, Marie, was born to Ukrainian immigrant parents while Suzanne's father, Stefan Ircha, was originally from Ternopil, a town outside of Kyiv, and immigrated to the United States after WWII. In 2022, the Johnson family traveled to Poland to meet with Ukrainian refugees and understand firsthand how the unprovoked invasion has impacted their lives. Chief among Ambassador Johnson's healthcare initiatives is the support for lupus research. In 1999, he founded the Alliance for Lupus Research (now the Lupus Research Alliance). This was the first organization devoted exclusively to finding new methods to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure lupus. Thanks to his leadership, the organization has dedicated more than $245 million for research grants and achieved the major milestone of funding research which set the stage for the recent FDA approval of three new treatments for this autoimmune disease. Over many years, Ambassador Johnson has been active in philanthropy and civic affairs, including past roles as an Honorary Trustee of the Wildlife Conservation Society and a past board member of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center and the Peregrine Fund. The Ambassador also served as a Trustee and a Trustee Emeritus of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the nation's largest philanthropic organization devoted exclusively to promoting health and healthcare for Americans. Currently, the Ambassador is an active member of the NFL's Finance Committee, Investment Committee, and Stadium Committee. COPYRIGHT © 2024 NEW YORK JETS",

                "title": "New York Jets Owner Woody Johnson Faces Major Decision After Trump’s Election Win",
                "content": "With President Donald Trump winning the 2024 Election on November 5, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson will have a big decision to make. Many have wondered if Johnson plans to return to London. In Trump's first term as president, he served as the Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Johnson left the Jets for three and a half years to serve in that position. Woody's brother, Christopher Johnson, took over the day-to-day operations for New York when he was in London. As of November 6, it remains uncertain if Johnson wants to return to London or if Trump even wants him back. According to reports, many inside the organization believe there's a chance it'll happen again. Recent remarks might not suggest so, however. Sports Illustrated obtained comments Johnson made about his past work and the future in an interview with the Millbrook School, where he attended high school. \"I was hoping to stay [in London], as my work touched on a little bit of everything -- military, cultural affairs, and developing relationships -- and I didn't get the chance to start until August of 2017. President Trump was elected in November and took office in January. But senate confirmations take time, and time wastes resources.\" Johnson later added that his goal when he returned home was to win a Super Bowl. That could indicate he wants to stay with the Jets and build a winning team. With their struggles in 2024, it's also possible he wants to head back into politics. His comments came before the first game of the campaign for New York. \"But coming home, I wanted to win a Super Bowl. There are two things in life: sports and politics. In each, you're in the danger zone, and that's where you learn and you find success. So now, it's working on getting there. Winning seven games is not acceptable. This data dive is the best thing I've ever done--ripping the hell out of the Jets organization. Status quo is death; it will kill you. You have to change, so you have to have an organization that embraces change. Otherwise, it's impossible to win.\" If Trump wants Johnson back, that decision isn't expected to come for a while. Perhaps it'll happen quicker than last time, as Trump didn't appoint him until June of 2017.

                "content": "Nugget enthusiasts nationwide can savor a brand-new crispy chicken nugget with irresistible dipping sauces, available December 19 Taco Bell’s all-new tortilla chip-breaded Crispy Chicken Nuggets and the Hidden Valley™ Fire Ranch Sauce available December 19 nationwide. TLDR: Taco Bell’s Crispy Chicken Nuggets defy traditional nugget norms with a crunchy tortilla chip breading for maximum crisp and flavor in every all-white meat chicken bite, available nationwide starting December 19. Known for pushing the boundaries of flavor, Taco Bell’s uniquely coated nuggets are joined by a trio of dipping sauces to choose from – including the first-ever Hidden Valley™ Fire Ranch Sauce, and all-new Taco Bell signature Bell sauce and Jalapeño Honey Mustard – to deliver next-level flavor combinations that will have fans rethinking their usual saucy selection. Crispy Chicken Nuggets and Hidden Valley Ranch assets can be found here. Irvine, Calif. (Dec. 17, 2024) – In a world where chicken nugget loyalty runs deep, Taco Bell is daring to push the boundaries of innovation yet again with the introduction of Crispy Chicken Nuggets and a lineup of irresistible dipping sauces that’s sure to challenge people’s devotion to their typical favorites, available starting December 19, for a limited time and while supplies last. Entirely distinct, yet universally familiar, the tender all-white meat chicken bites are marinated in zesty jalapeño buttermilk flavor and breaded with a blend of breadcrumbs and crunchy tortilla chips to deliver the ideal balance of flavor and crisp that take the everyday chicken nugget to the next level. But what’s a nugget without an epic sauce pairing? In its culinary journey to find the perfect complementary sauce, Taco Bell tested over 100 sauces to curate not one, but three irresistible dip pairings – introducing the exclusive new Hidden Valley™ Fire Ranch Sauce, and brand new signature Bell Sauce and sweet and hot Jalapeño Honey Mustard Sauce. The star of this trio is the new Hidden Valley™ Fire Ranch Sauce, a fiery twist on America’s Favorite Ranch* inspired by the passion of Taco Bell and Hidden Valley Ranch fans. More than just a sauce, it’s a groundbreaking innovation that blends the iconic flavors fans love from both brands. “As the inventors of Nacho Fries, Taco Bell is fully aware that reinventing an American classic with a Taco Bell twist is a responsibility we don’t take lightly. But in a world dominated by chicken cravings, it was time to show the world how Taco Bell does chicken nuggets – unexpected and undeniably bold,” said Taco Bell’s Chief Marketing Officer, Taylor Montgomery. “The Crispy Chicken Nuggets deliver a crispier, more flavorful nugget experience, and combined with the Hidden Valley™ Fire Ranch Sauce, we hope it will test people’s devotion to their favorite nuggets.” Following successful tests in Minneapolis in 2023 and Houston earlier this year, fans nationwide can finally enjoy the brand’s unique approach to nuggets and the sauce pairings, including the new Hidden Valley™ Fire Ranch Sauce, while supplies last. Exclusive Hidden Valley Ranch Collab to Get Fired Up About Taco Bell scored the ultimate stamp of approval from America’s #1 Ranch*, Hidden Valley Ranch. As the go-to condiment for ranch lovers nationwide, Hidden Valley Ranch has cemented itself in the upper echelon of the condiment community and with Taco Bell, created a ranch sauce unlike any other. The Hidden Valley™ Fire Ranch Sauce harmoniously combines the flavors of Taco Bell’s most popular hot sauce with the flavor of Hidden Valley Ranch in an unexpected match up so addicting it will have everyone double dipping till the last bite. “We’re thrilled to partner with Taco Bell on the new Hidden Valley™ Fire Ranch Sauce, combining the bold flavors of Hidden Valley Ranch with Taco Bell's signature heat” said CC Ciafone, Marketing Director at Hidden Valley Ranch. “Ranch and chicken nuggets are an iconic pairing, so it just made sense to create a ranch perfectly designed for Taco Bell's unique twist on nuggets.” The exclusive sauce is one of three irresistible dip pairings, alongside the sweet and hot Jalapeño Honey Mustard and signature Bell Sauce. These game-changing sauces are served in custom dip cups for maximum dunking. The Dipping Line Up: Hidden Valley™ Fire Ranch Sauce: Taco Bell’s first-ever ranch partnership which blends two iconic flavors: Taco Bell Fire Sauce and Hidden Valley Ranch. Bell Sauce: The all-new Bell Sauce offers a familiar, rich, creamy and tangy signature blend with subtle chili notes crafted with tomatoes, red chiles, and garlic.

                "content": "Manage your account Taco Bell released its long-awaited crispy chicken nuggets nationwide on Thursday. The nuggets feature all-white chicken breast meat marinated in a jalapeño buttermilk. We thought Taco Bell's nuggets were crispy, juicy, and delicious. We also loved the new dipping sauces. From birria-style tacos to a crunchy twist on chicken empanadas, Taco Bell is always finding new ways to mix things up. Now, the chain is putting its own spin on an essential fast-food menu item — the almighty chicken nugget. And we think it's safe to say that McDonald's, Popeyes, and Chick-fil-A should be worried. Here's what we thought of Taco Bell's chicken nuggets and the chain's three new dipping sauces, which were added to menus nationwide on Thursday. Chicken is indisputably having a moment in fast food right now, and Taco Bell has appeared to take notice. Just take a look at the success of Raising Cane's. The chain, known for its focus on chicken tenders and a limited menu featuring sides like coleslaw and Texas toast, has become one of the fastest-growing fast-food brands in the US. Bloomberg reported that the chain brought in over $2.3 billion in revenue during the first half of 2024, reflecting a 30% increase from the previous year. When we first got to try Taco Bell's new chicken nuggets at the chain's headquarters in Irvine, California, we learned that the beloved fast-food brand had set out to create an \"elevated\" chicken nugget to compete in the crowded market. \"This is truly a very premium nugget,\" Mira Leon, a member of the product development team, told us during a tasting at the secret test kitchen. \"It's not a chicken nugget patty you might get at some fast-food restaurants. This is very much more elevated.\" \"This is real chicken,\" added chef Brett Pluskalowski, who works on Taco Bell's food innovation team. \"When you go to McDonald's, that's not what you see.\" Taco Bell developed three sauces to pair with its chicken nuggets. The jalapeño honey mustard combines honey and hot mustard for a sweet and tangy dipping sauce, while Bell Sauce features red chilies mixed with tomatoes, garlic, and onions. The newest sauce, the Fire Ranch sauce, is a collaboration with Hidden Valley — the first-ever ranch partnership for Taco Bell. It mixes the chain's signature Fire hot sauce with Hidden Valley Ranch. The nuggets were presented in a purple box with Taco Bell branding. The new chicken nuggets feature all-white chicken breast meat marinated in spiced jalapeño buttermilk and coated with a special crispy breading made from breadcrumbs and tortilla chips. The nuggets are $3.99 for a five-piece order and one dipping sauce or $6.99 for a 10-piece order with two dipping sauces, though prices may vary depending on location. Taco Bell's crispy chicken nuggets immediately won us over. Anneta: Chicken nuggets were my favorite thing to eat as a kid (groundbreaking, I know), and I've tried dozens of iterations from different chains and restaurants — many of them soggy, bland, or just forgettable. Taco Bell's chicken nuggets are none of the above. The meat tasted juicy and fresh and was clearly premium. The breading was true to the \"crispy\" name, providing a super satisfying crunch that gave way to the tender meat underneath. There was actually texture, which is more than I can say for some other very popular chains' nuggets. I tried these nuggets during a tasting that featured six different menu items, and I still couldn't resist finishing the entire box. They were really that good. Erin: These chicken nuggets, which come coated in a blend of breadcrumbs and crunchy tortilla chips, really impressed me with their texture and well-balanced flavor. When I first held one in my hand, I worried it would be hard to bite into — it had some weight to it. However, when I bit in, I found juicy, flavorful meat inside. They were salty, with a subtle corn taste from the tortilla-chip breading, and reminded me more of a boneless wing than a chicken nugget. I also liked how the outer breading wasn't completely uniform. You could clearly see the tiny pieces of tortilla chips that made up the breading. The sauces paired with the crispy chicken nuggets were also unique, creative, and super delicious. Anneta: I was a fan of both the Bell Sauce and the jalapeño honey mustard, which had very different flavor profiles. The Bell Sauce carried a smokiness that reminded me of barbecue sauce, while the jalapeño honey mustard was deliciously creamy with a zingy kick. Erin: I was a fan of all three sauces, but the jalapeño honey mustard and Fire Ranch stole the show for me. The jalapeño honey mustard was the perfect balance between a classic, tangy honey mustard and a slight kick of heat from the jalapeño flavor. I also quickly noted that this sauce actually tasted like I was biting into a real jalapeño pepper, unlike some sauces that say they're flavored with jalapeño but just taste generically spicy. The Fire Ranch was a good balance between creamy and a slight kick from the Fire sauce, but it didn't have as much heat as the other two sauces. The Bell Sauce was also good and reminded me of a chipotle aioli. It was more smoky than spicy. We think Taco Bell's chicken nuggets are the best of any fast-food chain. It's been years since the fast-food chains were embroiled in the chicken sandwich wars. But what they should really be worried about now is Taco Bell coming for their nugget crown. The crispy chicken nuggets and their new sauces taste elevated, and it's clear that Taco Bell's big swings and risks are paying off. The menu continues to feel fresh and exciting at a time when so many other chains are sticking to the norm. During the 2023 tasting, one of Taco Bell's representatives explained that the nuggets were also designed for people who don't like tacos but are along for the drive-thru ride — which is an extremely smart strategy move. People might think Taco Bell has no place in the nugget space, but it's been delivering delicious chicken for a long time, and chicken chains should be a little scared.

                "title": "Big Lots Closing Stores: See Full List of Locations - Newsweek",
                "content": "Ohio-based discount retailer Big Lots may have to close more stores, according to a recent filing in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, as reviewed by Newsweek. The potential for more store closures comes after a fifth notice was filed in bankruptcy court. Newsweek reached out Wednesday via email to Big Lots' press team for comment on Wednesday. On Monday, the fifth notice of store closures was filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, proposing the closure of more than a dozen Big Lots stores. The 19 new closures include five stores in California, three stores in Texas and Oregon, two in Florida and Nevada, and single stores in Georgia, Idaho, Arizona and Washington. The closures would affect Atlanta, San Antonio, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Florida's Orlando, among other cities. Big Lots, referred to as \"the debtors,\" has until 4 p.m. ET on Saturday to file an objection to the proposed closures, according to the court document. If no objection is filed and there is no court intervention, Big Lots is authorized to commence the process of store closing sales for the 19 stores across the country. Before this announcement, Big Lots had announced the closure of nearly 500 stores. The Hill reports that at least 140 of those stores have already been closed, and many are set to close by January 2025. California will have the most stores closed, with 75 out of 109 set to be shuttered in the state. In August, when a big wave of store closures was announced, a Big Lots spokesperson told Newsweek the move is part of a broader strategy to stabilize the company financially. The company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission reveal that these closures come as Big Lots grapples with significant debt and declining sales. High inflation and stiff competition have dampened consumer spending at retail chains. On September 9, Big Lots filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. At the time, the company operated about 1,300 stores nationwide, but that number has been dropping significantly since the filing. The company reported a net loss of $205 million for the first quarter of 2024 and an increase in long-term debt to $573.8 million. In a September 9 press release, Big Lots said it entered into a sale agreement with an affiliate of Nexus Capital Management for approximately $760 million, consisting of $2.5 million in cash plus payoff of remaining debt and assumption of liabilities. The retailer was co-founded by Michael Cohen and Damian Giangiacomo in 2013. Mandy Taheri is a Newsweek reporter based in Brooklyn. She joined Newsweek as a reporter in 2024.

Goodbye, weird treasure trove of cheap stuff Most of us have enjoyed rambling around a Big Lots store at some time or another—but maybe we should have gone more often. Big Lots announces closures of many of its locations throughout the U.S. We were just shopping in one last night—the cashiers were so nice, and it was sad to think they are likely out of a job now. These stores were always like a treasure trove of unexpected items, everything from a plug-in fireplace and mantel to an interesting snack aisle to patio furnishings. The store stocks items from production overruns, discontinued products and more, which explains the interesting hodgepodge of inventory. Right now, the chain’s website doesn’t mention anything about store closures, but members have gotten emails stating their local store is closing. Driving past these locations, a big banner announces the closure as well. The company said that inflation and competition difficulties have made it hard to keep stores open, according to The Hill. Consumers just aren’t spending as much these days. Another chain that closed restaurants in May, Red Lobster, said that debt and a fiasco with an all-you-can-eat shrimp promotion caused the closure of almost 100 locations. According to The Hill, the company, in an SEC filing, has said that between 35 and 40 locations could be closing, but the number looks far bigger. For instance, 60 locations in California are tagged for closures, and 89 others in the U.S. have closure notices on their individual websites. In California, these stores will close, according to Fox40.com: Closures in other states include, according to The Hill: Good news for folks in Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, or Wyoming—none of your stores are going to be closing, but you might want to do some shopping there to ensure that stays the case.

Kakko was selected second overall by the Rangers in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. Kakko plays right wing, but also has experience playing at centre. He made his professional debut playing with TPS of the Finnish Liiga. On 21 June 2019, as the top-ranked European skater heading into the 2019 NHL Entry Draft, Kakko was selected second overall by the New York Rangers.[3][4] On 11 July 2019, he was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Rangers.[5] Kakko made his NHL debut for the Rangers on 3 October 2019.[6] He scored his first NHL career goal on 12 October at home against the Edmonton Oilers, becoming the eighth player in Rangers franchise history to score a goal at the age of 18 or younger.[7] He also became the second player in NHL history born in the 21st century to score a goal, after Ville Heinola (also born in 2001) of the Winnipeg Jets, who scored a goal just hours before Kakko on the same day.[8] Following the conclusion of his entry-level contract with the Rangers, Kakko as a restricted free agent was re-signed to a two-year, $4.2 million contract extension with New York on 28 July 2022.[9] As a restricted free agent, Kakko signed a one-year, $2.4 million contract extension with New York on 13 June 2024.[10] During the 2024–25 season, on 18 December 2024, Kakko was traded by the Rangers to the Seattle Kraken in a deal for Will Borgen and two draft picks in 2025.[11] Kakko scored the gold-medal-winning goal for team Finland in the 2019 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships on 5 January 2019.[12] Kakko is the youngest player in hockey history to win gold in all three IIHF world championship tournaments: the World U18 Championships, the World Junior Championships and the World Championships.[13] Kakko has Type 1 diabetes and celiac disease.[14][15][16] This biographical article relating to a Finnish ice hockey winger is a stub.

                "content": "FARMERS BRANCH, Texas - One of the things Rangers’ teammates enjoyed the most about Kaapo Kakko was his unassuming nature. The 23-year-old forward has a matter-of-fact way of speaking, particularly when conversing in English rather than his native Finnish. He didn’t need to be joking around to draw a laugh, which he always took in stride. Kakko provided yet another of those signature moments when discussing how he found out about Wednesday’s trade to the Seattle Kraken. “I was actually at the hotel sauna in Dallas,” he said, setting a scene that drew chuckles from reporters on Thursday's introductory Zoom call. “I checked my phone and saw (Rangers team president Chris) Drury was calling me like three times.” That unintended humor will be missed in New York − \"I had a lot of laughs with him,\" center Mika Zibanejad said − but both sides came to believe a change of scenery was necessary. Despite Kakko’s lofty prospect status as the No. 2 overall pick in the 2019 NHL Draft, he never quite found his footing with the Rangers and felt it was time for a \"fresh start.\" \"I feel that’s what I need right now,\" he added. \"I liked my time in New York. It was a good time for many years over there, great team, but I think I’m waiting for a little more from myself. The team was waiting also, and it never worked out the way we wanted.\" The conversation surrounding Kakko's development amounts to a chicken-vs.-egg debate. Did the Rangers do him a disservice by yanking him around the lineup and rarely giving him top-six or power-play assignments? Or did the 6-foot-1, 215-pounder fall short of expectations because of his own limitations? Kakko seems to understand that the truth lies somewhere in the middle. \"I wasn't good enough, to be honest,\" he said. \"But I also felt like a lot of games I could have got on the ice a little more and got the chance to show what I can do.\" Culture problem?An exclusive look at what's bubbling at MSG Kakko spent much of his five-plus seasons longing for more ice time, but multiple coaches − first David Quinn, then Gerard Gallant, and most recently Peter Laviolette − were reluctant to give it to him. He averaged exactly 13:17 TOI per game the last two seasons, which tied for the lowest mark of his career. Kakko did little to earn extra minutes last season, when he averaged a career-worst 0.31 points per game, but he got off to a much better start this fall. He posted 14 points (four goals and 10 assists) through 30 games, including 11 in the first 17, to go along with a plus-nine rating that ranked second on the team. That made Laviolette's healthy scratch decision for Sunday's 3-2 loss in St. Louis especially frustrating for Kakko, who has found himself in that scapegoat position multiple times over the years. It boiled over prior to Tuesday's 2-0 loss in Nashville, with the young Finn criticizing the move while insisting he hasn't been \"the worst guy\" in the lineup lately. The Rangers shipped him to Seattle in exchange for defenseman Will Borgen and wo 2025 draft picks a little over 24 hours later, but both the team and Kakko say the singeing comments weren't the reason for the trade. \"I don’t think it’s because of that,\" Kakko said. \"The team was playing not well enough. There are a lot of good players over there, (but) they need to do something. I kind of knew something was going to happen, and I also knew it might be me. I was kind of waiting.\" Whether it influenced the decision or not, he landed in a place where he's expecting a more prominent role. Kraken general manager Ron Francis told reporters Thursday that his newest addition will be used in the top six and on the power play, which must have been music to Kakko's ears. He didn't give a firm answer when asked if he specifically requested a trade, but at the very least, he admitted there were \"talks about that.\" \"I was kind of thinking what could be the best thing for me – and for the (Rangers) also,\" Kakko said. Laviolette said he had \"a great conversation\" with Kakko after learning of the trade and \"thanked him for everything,\" echoing the sentiment that a fresh start could be just what he needs. \"Any player could take a change and turn it into something different, or make the most of it,\" the coach said. \"He’s a good player. He’s a good person, and I wish him the best.\" Laviolette previously expressed regret for not figuring out how to get more out of Kakko last season, but it was those who have been with him from the start who seemed to take the trade the hardest. \"Terrific teammate,\" Chris Kreider said. \"I really enjoyed playing with him. Awesome guy, especially a guy that comes over when he’s 17, 18 years old, seeing him grow up and kind of open up and get more comfortable around the guys, more comfortable with the language. It’s the hardest part of the business.\" Zibanejad had a unique perspective on Kakko's time in New York. He, too, was once a top-10 draft pick who came over from Europe facing sky-high expectations and sympathized with Kakko's plight. \"You try to be there,\" Zibanejad said. \"You try to help him out, but it’s hard because everyone is different. Everyone deals with it differently. I dealt with it one way because it’s my personality. All I can say is it’s not an easy situation, even though everyone’s trying to help you since day one. You try to get comfortable, but it’s still not your first language. It’s hard to express yourself sometimes, and it’s a completely different culture here than it is where we’re from. \"It’s obviously an adjustment, but I thought he did a good job,\" he added. \"He came out of his shell a little bit more towards the end here. I have nothing but great things to say about him as a person and a player. It’s sad, but I’m hoping everything works out for him.\" With the Kakko news still fresh and team morale plummeting in the midst of losing 11 of their last 14 games, Laviolette sought to brighten the mood for Thursday's practice at the StarCenter. It ended with a shootout competition that included the coaching staff, with Laviolette's attempts drawing some of the biggest reactions. It led to one of the liveliest sessions in recent memory. \"Everybody has to find a way to break through this,\" said Laviolette, who quipped that assistant coach Michael Peca had the best showing of anyone on the staff. \"Having a practice like that was maybe a little bit lighter, it’s an opportunity to go out and play and get back to it. The best remedy for all of it is winning.\" Afterward, there were smiles throughout a locker room that's lacked them lately. But Vincent Trocheck summoned reporters to deliver a serious message about a rumor that surfaced on the Steve Dangle Podcast. On the show, a players-only meeting that occurred following the Rangers' 5-1 loss to the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday was mentioned, with the host insinuating that the purpose was to discuss internal issues with team president Chris Drury. Trocheck said it \"couldn't be further from the truth.\" \"The last thing that we're going to do is complain about our general manager when we have closed-door meetings in here,\" he said. \"It's about us. It's about what we can do. Obviously, we're in a little bit of a hole right now, and it's about what we can do to get out of it. It has nothing to do with management.\" Trocheck has noticeably taken on a more vocal role in the aftermath of the Dec. 6 trade that sent captain Jacob Trouba to Anaheim. The 31-year-old center isn't among the leadership group who wear letters for the Rangers, but he's made it a point to speak up at a time when the team has been consumed by losses and trade speculation. \"I've been in the league for 12 years,\" Trocheck said. \"I've seen a lot of trades happen. I've been on some really good teams where very few things happen, and I've been on some really bad teams where there's turnover it seems like every day. Obviously, for (Kakko) and (Trouba), as people, I love both those guys. You never want to see a friend go. But also, we're losing games right now. \"Chris (Drury) has a job,\" he added. \"You can't just sit there and let us continue to lose and do nothing. His job is on the line, as well. He's doing what he can to put the right guys on the ice and make the right moves that he thinks are going to help us win hockey games. Yeah, it’s sad, but at the same time, you’ve got to win hockey games if you want to keep everybody in this locker room.\" Vincent Z.

New York received defenseman Will Borgen, and a third- and sixth-round pick in the 2025 NHL Draft. The forward, selected No. 2 by the Rangers in the 2019 NHL Draft, said he's hoping the trade gives him a fresh start. \"Yeah, that’s what I’m hoping,\" Kakko said Thursday. \"This year, there’s been some good games and kind of bad games, also. It’s a new chance for me. I played there for a long time, just one team. I’m happy to be here and that’s what I’m thinking, also.\" Seattle general manager Ron Francis said the Kraken have been looking for a forward on the right side. “We’ve been kicking tires on different things and with (forward Jordan Eberle) out, we’re short on the right side,” Francis said. “This guy gives us somebody that can play the right wing. He’s a big boy (6-foot-1, 215 pounds), and he’s got some skills. So, we thought it was the right move to make.” Eberle, the Seattle captain, underwent pelvis surgery on Nov. 22 and is expected to be out through at least the end of February. He last played on Nov. 14. Kakko, a 23-year-old forward, has 14 points (four goals, 10 assists) in 30 games this season while averaging 13:17 of ice time per game. He was selected No. 2 in the 2019 Draft by the Rangers and had 131 points (61 goals, 70 assists) in 330 games during his time in New York. Kakko returned to the lineup in a 3-0 loss to the Nashville Predators Tuesday after he was a healthy scratch in a 3-2 loss at the St. Louis Blues on Sunday. Earlier this week, he said he was suprised by the scratch.\" \"The team didn’t play good also. I was frustrated. I think everyone who is not playing — everyone wants to play,\" Kakko said. \"That’s what I wanted, also. They told me there’s a lot of good players, somebody playing PK, somebody power play. That doesn’t matter anymore. It’s a new team for me, I’m not thinking about it. A lot of good guys over there. New chance for me. Borgen, 27, has a goal and an assist in 33 games this season while averaging 15:12 of ice time. Selected in the fourth round (No. 92) of the 2015 Draft by the Buffalo Sabres, Borgen played 14 games over two seasons for the Sabres before he was claimed by Seattle in the 2021 Expansion Draft, where he had 55 points (nine goals, 46 assists) in 233 games. \"I also want to thank Will for everything he's done for our francise,\" Francis said. \"As an original member of the Kraken, we wish him all the best in New York.\" The Rangers also recalled center Matt Rempe from Hartford of the American Hockey League and assigned defenseman Victor Mancini to the AHL team. Mancini has played in 15 games for New York with five points (one goal, four assists), while Rempe has appeared in four games for the Rangers, averaging 6:26 of ice time. The Rangers (15-15-1) sit in sixth place in the Metropolitan Division having lost five of six and are 3-11-0 in their past 14 games after winning the Presidents’ Trophy as the top team in the NHL during the 2023-2024 regular season. They conclude a three-game road trip at the Dallas Stars on Friday. The Kraken (15-16-2) lost 3-0 to the Ottawa Senators Tuesday and are in sixth place in the Pacific Division.

                "content": "Sections Resources Resources Resources As Congress races against the clock to come up with a new bill to fund the government, the chances of a shutdown are increasing. Here’s how it could affect you. What to Expect in a Government Shutdown J. Scott Applewhite|AP-File The Capitol building in Washington, is framed by early morning clouds, March 19, 2024. Congress is careening once again toward a government shutdown after President-elect Donald Trump rejected a proposed stopgap bill late Wednesday. The temporary spending bill would have funded the government at current levels through March 14 while also providing a number of crucial add-ons. However, after Trump rejected both the bill and a proposed clean version, House Republicans were forced to go back to the drawing board. But with less than 36 hours left until current funding runs out, unproductive negotiations and Democrats signaling an unwillingness to bail out Republicans, the chances of a temporary shutdown are increasing by the hour. And while partisan politics is at the heart of the dispute, as with past government shutdowns the American people are the ones who will bear the brunt of the disruptions, the inconveniences and the expenses. Aneeta Mathur-Ashton Dec. 18, 2024 The federal government shuts down when Congress fails to pass funding bills that allocate money to agencies so they can function. Lawmakers are supposed to pass 12 spending bills that fund the agencies that make up the government. Five funding bills have passed the House, none has passed the Senate, and none has passed both chambers during this session of Congress. When the spending bills cannot be agreed upon, lawmakers often resort to temporary extensions, known as continuing resolutions. The stopgap bills fund government agencies at their existing levels for a certain period of time so Congress can work out a longer-term solution. Often, funding for many agencies is condensed into a single piece of legislation, frequently referred to as an “omnibus” bill. Some lawmakers, Republicans in particular, have bristled in recent years against the reliance on omnibus bills and have pledged to vote against them on general principle. They argue that the bills are massive in size, negotiated by only a handful of members and are released under urgent circumstances that provide little time for review. Historically speaking, government shutdowns rarely happen but are often threatened. Overall, the government has experienced 20 shutdowns of varying lengths going back to the 1970s, with the majority lasting as little as a day. Every federal agency has its own shutdown plan that identifies which operations will continue during a shutdown. In most cases, the areas considered exempt fall under the broad headings of protecting life or property, or fulfilling a required constitutional function. Activities in which funding is not dependent on the current year’s budget or which draw independently on private money or grant dollars are permitted to continue. If activities need to be ceased, employee furloughs and temporary pauses begin. Maintaining operations that are not essential would be a violation of a series of provisions in federal law going back to the 19th century known collectively as the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits the obligation of federal funds that have not been lawfully appropriated. Among the areas that are affected by a shutdown, benefit verification as well as card issuance will stop for Social Security and Medicare, for example, and health inspections from the Environmental Protection Agency and Food and Drug Administration will likely cease with exceptions for products considered high risk. Past shutdowns have also delayed tax refunds, put on hold loans to small businesses and homeowners, and prevented patients from enrolling in National Institutes of Health clinical trials. Due to the sheer number of furloughs, service delays across agencies will all but certainly likely occur. National parks, monuments, the National Zoo and the Smithsonian Institution museums will close to the public. Other attractions like the National Archives, Ford’s Theater and the White House Visitor Center also closed during the last shutdown. Aneeta Mathur-Ashton Sept. 23, 2024 Some federal offices will also face shorter hours or will close altogether, and government services like clinical trials, firearm permits and applications for passports could see delays. Shutdowns haven’t always looked like they do today. Prior to 1980, when Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti penned a series of legal opinions that more strictly interpreted the Antideficiency Act, funding lapses didn’t necessarily result in furloughs or agency closures. Many government operations continued uninterrupted under the assumption that the funds expended would be repaid when the crisis had passed. But starting with the budget process for 1982, appropriations bills contained provisions specifying that agencies did not have a legal basis to operate without federal funds and mandating closures and furloughs. Officials subsequently created the distinction between essential and nonessential workers. In the 1995 government shutdown, most city functions in the District of Columbia – including such things as public library operations – were halted because of the city’s status as a federal enclave under the jurisdiction of Congress. Even in more recent shutdowns – like in 2013, after the city’s mayor declared all city workers essential – the District’s federally funded court system was not performing marriages, a service deemed not essential. Its local operations have been exempt from shutdowns since 2015, due to budget language inserted into its annual appropriations bill. Still, in the 2019 shutdown, trash infamously collected on the National Mall after the workers who remove it were furloughed. Social Security and Supplemental Security Income recipients will all continue to receive payments, but response times for those reporting issues could be delayed due to the furloughs. Student loan payments will also still be collected during this time. However, furloughs in the Education Department would cause delays for those seeking help. Applications for federal aid will also likely see delays. Medicare and Medicaid benefits will also continue, meaning patients will still be able to see their doctors and have their bills paid. However, furloughs will likely cause delays as contingency plans from the Health and Human Services Department published last week said half of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would be furloughed if there is a lapse in funding. The U.S. Passport Agency will remain open during a shutdown and will continue to process passports and visas. But the State Department could stop issuing passports in places where passport services are normally offered in buildings but run by another agency that has been shuttered. The U.S. Postal Service will also be unaffected as well as air travel. Federal workers and those with direct interaction with civilians – like Transportation Security Administration agents and Postal Service workers – will all be affected. Government employees deemed nonessential will be furloughed and will not be allowed to work or be paid until the government reopens. Many are eligible to receive unemployment benefits during a shutdown. Included in the furlough will be half of the Pentagon’s 800,000 civilian employees as well as a significant portion of the White House staff. Government employees deemed essential workers, like law enforcement and air traffic control personnel, will continue to work but will go unpaid. Staffers for lawmakers will also not be paid, but those deemed essential will be required to work. However, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 guarantees that all federal employees will be retroactively paid at the end of a shutdown. This extends to those who were required to work as well as those employees who were furloughed. In fact, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget cites evidence that suggests shutdowns actually end up costing the government more than it saves. The last shutdown, a partial government shutdown, ran from Dec. 21, 2018, to Jan. 25, 2019, under Trump’s first administration. It was the longest shutdown in U.S. history, lasting 34 days. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that some 300,000 workers were furloughed during the 2018-19 partial shutdown, which had the effect on the overall U.S. economy of lowering the projected gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2019 by $8 billion – or 0.2%. Before that, the government shut down for 16 days in 2013, furloughing some 850,000 employees. It did the same for three days in early 2018. The last funding extension passed by the current session of Congress was in September and it maintained the current levels through Dec. 20 and averted a partial shutdown before the November election. If a new continuing resolution is not passed before midnight Dec. 20, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. on Dec. 21. The shutdown will then last until a funding bill is passed and the president signs it.

                "content": "Bowles–Simpson Commission 2007–2008 financial crisis 2013 budget sequestration Related events In the United States, government shutdowns occur when funding legislation required to finance the federal government is not enacted before the next fiscal year begins. In a shutdown, the federal government curtails agency activities and services, ceases non-essential operations, furloughs non-essential workers, and retains only essential employees in departments that protect human life or property.[1][2] Shutdowns can also disrupt state, territorial, and local levels of government. Funding gaps began to lead to shutdowns in 1980, when Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued a legal opinion requiring it. This opinion was not consistently adhered to through the 1980s, but since 1990 all funding gaps lasting longer than a few hours have led to a shutdown. As of February 2024, 10 funding shutdowns have led to federal employees being furloughed. The most significant include the 21-day shutdown of 1995–1996, during President Bill Clinton’s administration, over opposition to major spending cuts; the 16-day shutdown in 2013, during the Barack Obama administration, caused by a dispute over implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA);[3] and the longest, the 35-day shutdown of 2018–2019, during the Donald Trump administration,[4] caused by a dispute over expanding barriers on the U.S.–Mexico border.[5][6] Shutdowns disrupt government services and programs; they close national parks and institutions. They reduce government revenue because fees are lost while at least some furloughed employees receive back pay. They reduce economic growth. During the 2013 shutdown, Standard & Poor's, the financial ratings agency, said on October 16 that the shutdown had \"to date taken $24 billion out of the economy\", and \"shaved at least 0.6 percent off annualized fourth-quarter 2013 GDP growth\".[7] Under the separation of powers created by the United States Constitution, the appropriation and control of government funds for the United States is the sole responsibility of the United States Congress. Congress begins this process through proposing an appropriation bill aimed at determining the levels of spending for each federal department and government program. The finalized version of the bill is then voted upon by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. After it passes both chambers, it proceeds to the President of the United States to sign the bill into law. Government shutdowns tend to occur when there is a disagreement over budget allocations before the existing cycle ends. Such disagreements can come from the president – through vetoing any finalized appropriation bills they receive – or from one or both chambers of Congress,[8][9] often from the political party that has control over that chamber. A shutdown can be temporarily avoided through the enactment of a continuing resolution (CR), which can extend funding for the government for a set period, during which time negotiations can be made to supply an appropriation bill that all involved parties of the political deadlock on spending can agree upon. A CR can be blocked by the same parties if there are issues with the content of the resolution bill that either party has a disagreement upon, in which case a shutdown will inevitably occur if a CR cannot be passed by the House, Senate or president. Congress may, in rare cases attempt to override a presidential veto of an appropriation bill or CR. Such an act requires there to be majority support of two-thirds of both chambers. Prior to the 1980s, many federal agencies continued to operate during shutdowns, while minimizing all nonessential operations and obligations, believing that Congress did not intend that agencies close down while waiting for the enactment of annual appropriations acts or temporary appropriations. However, Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued two opinions in 1980 and 1981, that more strictly interpreted the Antideficiency Act in the context of a funding gap, along with its exceptions. The opinions stated that, with some exceptions, the head of an agency could avoid violating the Act only by suspending the agency's operations until the enactment of an appropriation. In the absence of appropriations, exceptions would be allowed only when there is some reasonable and articulable connection between the function to be performed and the safety of human life or the protection of property.[10] However, even after the Civiletti opinions, not all funding gaps led to shutdowns. Of the nine funding gaps between 1980 and 1990, only four led to furloughs.[11] Shutdowns of the type experienced by the United States are nearly impossible in other forms of government: While government shutdowns before 1995–1996 had very mild effects, a full federal government shutdown causes a large number of civilian federal employees to be furloughed. Such employees are forbidden even to check their e-mail, a prohibition that some agencies enforce by collecting government-issued electronic devices for the duration of the shutdown.[13] Because of the size of the government workforce, the effects of a shutdown can be seen in macroeconomic data. During the 2013 shutdown, for example, 800,000 employees were locked out, payment was delayed to 1.3 million workers,[14] confidence in the job market decreased for a month,[15][16] and GDP growth slowed 0.1–0.2%.[14] The loss of GDP is a bigger sum than it would have cost to keep the government open.[17] The complete effects of a shutdown are often clouded by missing data that cannot be collected while specific government offices are closed.[14] Some effects of the shutdown are difficult to measure and can linger afterward, such as destroyed scientific studies, lack of investment, and deferred maintenance costs.[18][19] The 2018–2019 shutdown curtailed safety and law enforcement investigations, caused air travel delays as essential workers stopped showing up, shut down some facilities for Native Americans and tourists, and delayed regulatory approvals and immigration hearings for non-detainees. The exact details of which government functions stop during a shutdown is determined by the Office of Management and Budget.[20] During the 2013 shutdown, the moral philosopher Peter Singer argued in Slate, that shutdowns were evidence that the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers constituted \"a fundamental flaw.\"[27] In 2019, following the end of the 2018–19 shutdown, Michael Shindler argued in The American Conservative that shutdowns protect popular sovereignty. He writes, \"No other political phenomena so forcefully and dramatically obliges the whole people to recognize that their ideological divisions have become so great that the exercise of their sovereignty has become virtually impossible,\" and \"During a shutdown, the government, which is bound by elaborate mechanisms to the national will, becomes confused. For a moment, it seems as if the march of American history is at a standstill. There are only two means of moving forward: either government officials follow the will of something other than the nation or the nation engages in a momentous reconciliation of its will.\"[28] In 2024, Michelle Buehlmann argued that government shutdowns are a form of brinksmanship. Elected officials use them to coerce their opponents into conceding.[29] Democrats (from Jan 2019) This list includes only major funding gaps which led to actual employee furloughs within federal departments of the US government. It does not include funding gaps that did not involve shutdowns of government departments, in which examples include: a brief funding gap in 1982, in which nonessential workers were told to report to work but to cancel meetings and not perform their ordinary duties;[41] a three-day funding gap in November 1983 that did not disrupt government services;[11] a 9-hour funding gap in February 2018 that did not disrupt government services;[42][43] and a 13-hour funding gap in March 2024 that did not furlough any workers. On 1 May 1980, during the presidential term of Jimmy Carter, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was shut down for one day after Congress failed to pass an appropriations bill for the agency, due to going against his political beliefs and goals. Prior to the shutdown, a review had been made of the 1884 Antideficiency Act regarding Congressional approval of agency funding. Initial opinion on the subject had been that this did not require a government agency to be closed down in the wake of the expiration of their funding, before Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti overruled this opinion with his own on 25 April 1980, stating that a provision of this act stipulated to the contrary.[32] Five days later, the FTC was shut down after Congress delayed funding for the agency, in order to seek approval for an authorization bill to limit the agency's investigative and rule-making abilities, following criticism of the FTC's aggressive monitoring of the economy.[44] The 1980 shutdown was the first time a federal agency shut down due to a budget dispute.[45] Around 1,600 federal workers for the FTC were furloughed as a result,[32][33] and Federal Marshals deployed to some FTC facilities to enforce their closure.[46] The shutdown ended after one day when Carter threatened to close down the entire US government if Congress did not pass spending bills by 1 October later that year. Economists of the time estimated that the 1-day shutdown of the FTC cost the government around $700,000, the majority of which was back-pay for the furloughed workers.[32][33] In the aftermath of the shutdown, Civiletti issued a revised edition of his original opinion on 18 January 1981, detailing that shutdowns would still require agencies that protect human safety or property to continue operating if funding for them expired.[33] In 1981, 1984, and 1986, federal employees were furloughed during both presidential terms of Ronald Reagan. The deadlocks focused on disagreements by Reagan towards Congressional bills that went against his political beliefs and goals. The first shutdown took place on 23 November 1981, lasting for a day and placing 241,000 federal employees into furlough,[34] after Reagan vetoed a proposed appropriation bill that contained a reduced set of spending cuts than he had proposed for select government departments.[47] While the shutdown affected only a number of government departments,[48] economists of the time believed that it cost taxpayers an estimated $80–90 million in back pay and other expenses over the entire day.[34] The second shutdown occurred on the afternoon of 4 October 1984, with 500,000 federal employees placed on furlough during this period, after Reagan mounted opposition towards the inclusion of a water projects package and a civil rights measure within the proposed appropriations bill that day.[34] The shutdown covered around nine of the 13 appropriations bills that had not been passed at that point.[49] Congress was forced to remove both of the opposed elements of the bill and include funding of the Nicaraguan Contras as a compromise to end the shutdown.[47] Economists believed that the short period cost taxpayers an estimated $65 million in back pay.[34] A third shutdown occurred for an afternoon on October 17, 1986, in which 500,000 federal employees were furloughed,[50] in order to pressure Congress to agree on a full-year omnibus appropriations bill more quickly.[51] All government agencies were affected by this shutdown.[52] It ended after Congress passed the omnibus appropriations bill later that day.[53][54] Economists estimated that this shutdown cost the U.S. government $62 million in lost work.[50] The shutdown of 1990 occurred during the presidential term of George H. W. Bush and focused on a disagreement over several measures he proposed for the 1991 appropriations bill - the inclusion of major tax increases, despite Bush's campaign promise against any new taxes,[55] and major cuts in spending towards benefit programs, including Medicare, to combat the deficit. On 5 October 1990, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans, led by then House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, opposed the initial appropriations package,[56][57] with Bush vetoing the second resolution to the spending bill the following day on 6 October.[58] The shutdown lasted until 9 October, when Bush agreed to remove his proposed tax increases and reduce the amount of spending cuts, in return for Congress providing a concession on the amended bill to allow for increasing income tax on the wealthy.[58] The effects of the deadlock were lessened due to the fact that the shutdown occurred across the Columbus Day weekend - 6 October to 8 October. 2,800 workers were furloughed over this period. The national parks and museums, such as the Smithsonian, were closed, and a handful of departments unable to function. The cost to the government for lost revenue and back wages was estimated at $2.57 million.[35] Between 1995 and 1996, the US government faced two shutdowns during the presidential term of Bill Clinton, who opposed proposed appropriation bills for 1996 by congressional Republicans, who had a majority in both chambers, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Both Gingrich and the majority of Congress sought to pass bills that would reduce government spending, much against Clinton's political objectives for 1996. Clinton objected to funding cuts affecting education, the environment, and public health. One proposed bill threatened to block a scheduled reduction he had planned towards premiums within Medicare.[59] Both sides had differing opinions over the impact the proposed House bills would have over economic growth, medical inflation, and anticipated revenues,[60] with Clinton vetoing the bills over amendments added to them by congressional Republicans, despite Gingrich threatening to refuse to raise the country's debt ceiling.[60] The first shutdown took place on 14 November 1995, after a CR issued on 1 October had expired, and meetings between Democrat and Republican leaders failed to end the deadlock.[60] The effect of the deadlock led to the majority of government departments being closed down and 800,000 federal workers being furloughed as a result. Although the shutdown ended five days later on 19 November,[10] the political friction between Clinton and Gingrich over the US budget remained unresolved. On 16 December 1995, after further spending bills failed to secure approval, a second shutdown took place. Although lasting 21 days, fewer departments were closed down, and around 284,000 federal workers were furloughed during this period.[10] The shutdown was eventually ended on 6 January 1996,[10] when White House and Congressional negotiators worked out a balanced budget agreement, which included approval towards modest spending cuts and tax increases. Both shutdowns had a contrasting impact on the major political players in the deadlock. Gingrich's political career was harmed by the shutdowns, in part due to a comment he made during the deadlock that made it sound like his reasons for it were petty.[61][62] Clinton's presidential term was improved by the shutdown and cited as part of the reason behind his successful re-election to the White House in 1996.[63] Some effects of the shutdowns included the government, tourism, and airline industry losing millions of dollars in revenue during this period, with disruptions made towards the processing of passports and visas, and work on medical research and toxic waste cleanup being halted. The shutdown of 2013 occurred during the second Obama term, focusing on a disagreement between Republican-led House of Representatives and the Democratic-led Senate towards the contents of the 2014 Continuing Appropriations Resolution bill, alongside other political issues. Congressional Republicans, encouraged by conservative senators such as Ted Cruz,[64] and conservative groups such as Heritage Action,[65][66][67] sought to include several measures to the bill in late 2013 that could delay funding for the 2013 Affordable Care Act (ACA) and thus allow time for changes to be made to the act. Both Obama and Democratic senators refused to agree to these measures, seeking instead for the bill to maintain government funding at then-current sequestration levels with no additional conditions.[68][69][70] The shutdown took place on 1 October 2013, as a result of an impasse over the contents of the bill, with the House unable to approve any CRs before this date. Democrats opposed further efforts by congressional Republicans, led by House Speaker John Boehner, to delay funding of the ACA, and rejected piecemeal Resolution bills proposed by them to resolve the shutdown.[71][72] As Congress was at an impasse amidst rising concerns that the US would default on public debt, US senators - particularly then Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid - negotiated a deal to end the deadlock.[73] Their proposal, which won a Senate vote,[73] approved an amended Resolution bill that would keep funding at sequestration levels, temporarily suspend the debt limit until 7 February 2014, and included a concession to congressional Republicans on the ACA by applying stricter income verification rules in regards to health insurance. Boehner eventually withdrew further objections and delaying attempts against the ACA upon the country being within hours of breaking its debt limit on 16 October 2013.[74] Congress approved the bill for Obama's signature the following day.[75] The 16-day shutdown had considerable impact upon the United States: approximately 800,000 federal employees were put on furlough, while an additional 1.3 million had to report to work without any known payment dates during this period,[36] costing the government millions in back pay;[76] major government programmes concerning Native Americans,[77][78] children,[79] and domestic violence victims,[80] alongside the legal processing of asylum and immigration cases,[81][82] and sexual assault cases handled by the Office of Civil Rights,[83] were badly disrupted by the shutdown; tourism was greatly impacted due to the closure of national parks and institutions during the shutdown and cost the government millions in lost revenue; and US economic growth was reduced during this period. In political circles, the shutdown had a negative impact on Republicans, as over half of Americans held Republicans accountable for the deadlock, in comparison to public opinion on the accountability of both the Democrats and Obama during this period.[84] The shutdown of January 2018 was the first to occur during the presidential term of Donald Trump and was centered around a disagreement on the issue of immigration. By the start of October 2017, Congress had failed to approve an appropriation bill to fund the US government in 2018, and instead passed three CRs to keep federal agencies open until 19 January 2018. The failure to establish a permanent spending bill was due to Democratic senators insisting that any proposed House bill needed to include funding for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration policy and assurances against deportation for immigrants that fell under the DREAM Act. Republicans refused to pass such bills, citing that discussions on immigration and those individuals under DACA would not be held until mid-March of the following year.[85][86] A senate vote to extend the 2018 Continuing Appropriations Resolution on 19 January 2018, which had passed a congressional vote the previous day, failed to achieve a majority,[87] after Democratic senators led a filibuster aimed at forcing Republicans to invoke a shorter duration of CR and thus invoke negotiations that could lead to extensions of the DACA policy.[88] but failed to achieve a majority, as Democrats sought a shorter duration of CAR to force negotiations. The shutdown took place on 20 January 2018, and led to approximately 692,000 federal workers being furloughed.[38] An attempt by Democrats to protect the payment of military personnel during the deadlock was rejected by Republicans, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stated that funding had to be restored for the entire US government rather than for individual government branches.[89][90] Despite the bill's failure, both sides engaged in negotiations that eventually culminated with a deal on a proposed stopgap measure to fund the government for four weeks - as part of the proposal, Democrats agreed to end their filibuster and approve the Republican's measure, in exchange for fresh talks on the DACA policy and DREAM Act within newly proposed Resolution bill. The measure was approved in the House and passed a Senate vote, effectively ending the shutdown on 23 January.[91] The impact of the shutdown was not as severe as in previous deadlocks - most government departments, such as the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, were able to continue their functions during the 3-day deadlock despite their workers needing back-pay in the aftermath,[92] and only a third of National Parks in the United States were closed down.[93] In the aftermath of the shutdown, the Senate debated on a bill for the 2018 Bipartisan Budget Act to provide 2-year funding for the military, and provide an extension to the Resolution to keep the government funded for another six weeks. However, the negotiations suffered delays that triggered the brief 9 February spending gap, though this merely lasted for nine hours, causing little disruption. The shutdown of December 2018–January 2019 was the second to occur during the presidential term of Donald Trump, and was due to a disagreement over negotiations for Trump's wall along the Mexico–United States border. Trump sought to have the appropriation bill for 2019 include $5.7 billion in funding toward construction of the wall.[94][95] Democrats viewed the wall as a waste of money and likely ineffective, and instead proposed bills that would fund improvements in existing border security measures.[citation needed] Trump initially backed down on demands for border wall funding, but reversed this decision on 20 December 2018 over pressure from supporters, refusing to sign any continuing resolution that did not include it.[96][97] The shutdown began on 22 December 2018, after Democrats refused to support a new continuing resolution in the Senate that included approximately $5 billion for the new border wall,[98][99] and continued to block further attempts upon taking control of Congress on 3 January 2019 following the 2018 mid-term elections. Although he had support from several Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Trump faced stiff opposition to border wall funding from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, with neither party able to break the political impasse through negotiations,[100] rallying public support through televised addresses,[101][102] offering proposals on alternative border security funding measures,[103] or making concessions for a proposed appropriation bill with regards to the DACA policy.[104][105] The 35-day shutdown, the longest in US history after surpassing the 21-day shutdown of 1995–1996,[106] led to 380,000 federal workers being furloughed, and an additional 420,000 workers were required to work without any known payment dates, forcing many to find other paid work or protest against the extended period of the deadlock.[107][108] Sharp reductions had to be made on payments from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,[109][110] the Internal Revenue Service faced delays in processing around $140 billion worth of tax refunds,[111] the FBI faced major disruptions to some of its investigations,[111][112] staff shortages in the Transportation Security Administration caused airports to be closed down, and economic growth was reduced by billions of dollars.[113][114][115][116] The deadlock ended on 25 January 2019, when both chambers of Congress approved a plan to reopen the US government for 3 weeks, in order to facilitate negotiations for a suitable appropriation bill; Trump endorsed the plan amidst rising security and safety concerns.[117][118][119] A source inside the White House told CNN that a \"contributing catalyst\" to the end of the shutdown was a significant number of absences of air traffic controllers, which caused significant flight delays and cancellations.[120] According to the Congressional Budget Office, the shutdown cost the government $3 billion in back pay for furloughed workers, plus $2 billion in lost tax revenues due to reduced tax evasion compliance activities by the Internal Revenue Service, and a smaller amount of lost fees such as for visits to national parks, for a total of about $5 billion.[40] [121]",

                "title": "Government Shutdown 2024 Update: Government Averts Closure",
                "content": "Table of Contents With the presidential and Congressional elections a little more than a month away, no party wanted to be responsible for shutting down the federal government and denying pay and work to millions of federal workers and military personnel. Legislators in the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate understood what the backlash could mean in the election in November and overwhelmingly passed a funding bill, 341-82 and 78-18, respectively. President Biden signed the bill ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline to avert a shutdown, funding the federal government through Dec. 20 to set up a post-election period filled with a potential change in control of the Executive and Legislative branches, another shutdown debate, and a debt ceiling deadline looming in 2025. For now, the following departments will be funded at their current levels: Defense, Financial Services-General Government, Homeland Security, Labor-Health and Human Services-Education, the Legislative Branch, and State and Foreign Operations, Military Construction-Veterans Affairs, Agriculture-Food and Drug Administration, Transportation-Housing and Urban Development, Energy-Water, Interior-Environment, and Commerce-Justice-Science. Even though this current shutdown threat went unrealized, businesses and their employees who rely on the federal government and its employees for their patronage should understand what a government shutdown is and how it might impact them. A government shutdown means the government can’t spend money that requires annual appropriations, which affects its ability to pay its employees and keep facilities and buildings open where those employees work. Some employees are considered essential such as air traffic controllers and would have to work without pay during the shutdown. Unlike previous shutdowns, however, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 entitles federal employees to backpay for as long as the appropriations are lapsed. It should be noted that employees of federal contractors are not guaranteed backpay under this 2019 law, but a company can decide if they want to provide backpay to these employees. Here are some other closures or partial closures that could impact your business based on previous shutdowns: Additional impacts should be anticipated in areas such as customer service, as non-essential functions will be eliminated and the number of employees on the job could be limited throughout a shutdown. On-site audits and food/environmental inspections might be put on hold by agencies such as OSHA, the Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, and others. Medicare and Medicaid are federal programs that are not subject to annual appropriations, but a shutdown could cause a disruption for participants. For example, there might be a delay in getting Medicare replacement cards and participants would be unable to make enrollment adjustments. There are tangential impacts to consider such as the closing of national parks and national museums (e.g., Smithsonian) during a shutdown. If your business relies on the foot traffic of federal employees or tourists, especially around the corridor in Washington, D.C. and in other cities where federal money pumps in, cash flow could become an issue. Air traffic controllers are considered essential employees but when some refused to work without being paid in a previous shutdown, issues arose for business travelers. States might have to suspend their unemployment program and possibly find alternative sources of funding because federal unemployment funding to states will cease during a shutdown. Although most shutdowns in U.S. history have not influenced the stock market because their durations were brief, a shutdown of significant length could shift the stock market. This would impact employee retirement plans (401k), as well as delay federal reports on job growth, housing starts, and other indicators that investors rely on to make decisions. Potentially, the most notable impact could be on the U.S. economy, which has steadily moved along following the pandemic. If people are not getting paid then, generally, consumer spending slows and that would trickle down to affect small businesses. The list is small of federal agencies and processes that continue to function through a shutdown. According to the contingency documentation from the Department of Health and Human Services, federal exchange activities will continue, which means individuals will have access to the healthcare marketplace.

                "title": "Government Shutdown Frequently Asked Questions | Representative Wild",
                "content": "A government shutdown happens when Congress does not pass appropriations bills: bills that finance the operation of the government for the upcoming fiscal year. These bills are designed to fund the government until the conclusion of each fiscal year, which ends on September 30. When new appropriations legislation is not enacted by this deadline, Congress needs to pass a temporary measure, known as a continuing resolution (CR), which sustains the government's funding at its current level. In January, President Biden signed a CR to fund the government through the beginning of March. With the March deadline looming, and no new appropriations bill or CR in place, the government faces a shutdown due to lack of authorized funding. If Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills that are then signed into law by the President by March 1st at 11:59pm, the government will begin to shut down. The most recent CR created a two-tiered deadline for a government shutdown. On March 2nd at 12:01am ET, the departments of Agriculture, Energy, Transportation, Military Construction and Housing and Urban Development and the Veterans Administration, as well as other programs, will all shut down. Funding for the rest of the government, including the departments of Commerce, Justice, State, Defense, Homeland Security, Interior, Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services and Congress expires a week later, on March 9th at 12:01am. My offices will remain open and ready to help in any way possible in the event that we go into a government shutdown. Our Allentown, Easton, Lehighton, and Washington, D.C. teams will be available to answer questions and direct you to resources. I understand the dire consequences a government shutdown would have on our nation and our economy. I have previously voted for continuing resolutions to keep up government funded, and I will continue to support bipartisan solutions to keep our government running for the American people. Frequently Asked Questions: Q: Will I continue to receive my Social Security check or Medicare? Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other mandatory programs will continue to operate. Be aware that new benefit verification and card issuance services will cease, meaning new recipients could see delays in processing new applications. Q: What is the impact on veterans' services? Veterans healthcare will not be impacted and burials in VA national cemeteries will continue. The VA will also continue to deliver benefits and process appeals. Regional offices will be closed, and some services will be impacted, including outreach, transition assistance, and career counseling. Q: What is the impact on U.S. military personnel? Members of the military would continue to protect national security interests but will not receive pay during a shutdown. 30,378 active duty and reserve personnel serving our nation's armed forces in Pennsylvania would be forced to go without the pay they earn during a shutdown. Additionally, military training operations may be affected, impacting long term readiness. Q: What is the impact on small businesses? The Small Business Administration (SBA) will not accept, review or approve new business loans, a program that provides $766,861,200 in funding to small businesses in Pennsylvania every year. Many small businesses rely on these loans to keep their doors open. A shutdown would also disrupt the average $13 billion per week in federal contracts that go to businesses across the country, nearly $3 billion of which goes to small businesses. Q: How will children and families be affected by a shutdown? Up to 10,000 children could lose access to Head Start services during a shutdown. SNAP payments will continue as normal. However, other nutrition programs, like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) will only continue at the state and local level. In Pennsylvania, that means 177,335 recipients are at risk of losing nutrition assistance. Q: How will a shutdown impact public health efforts? A shutdown could delay research on cancer, Alzhiemer’s, and other diseases funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Food and Drug Administration would be able to respond to foodborne outbreaks but would be unable to complete proactive inspections. Access to safe drinking water may also be impacted as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would be unable to inspect sites. Q: How will a shutdown affect travel? During a shutdown, federal air traffic controllers and TSA agents will continue to work, although travelers may experience longer lines and delays in airports. Passports and visas may also have longer processing times. Q: Will I receive my tax refund if I’m still waiting on it now? According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) contingency plan, the IRS will not process tax refunds except in cases with electronically filed, error-free refunds that can be automatically direct deposited. In addition, taxpayer phone calls will go unanswered and the Taxpayer Assistance Centers across the country would close. To check the state of your refund: Where's My Refund? | Internal Revenue Service (irs.gov) Q: Will federal workers be paid? 72,192 federal workers in Pennsylvania would be furloughed or forced to work without pay, in addition to the many employees of businesses with government contracts who could be laid off, furloughed, or see their hours cut. Q: What other government services will be impacted by a shutdown? National parks, monuments, and Smithsonian museums risk closures in the event of a shutdown. Q: Which other government services will NOT be impacted by a shutdown? Federal law enforcement officials will continue to work, and federal criminal prosecutions will proceed during a shutdown. Federal courthouses have funding to remain open until October 13. Additionally, embassies and consulates overseas will remain open to serve Americans abroad. Q: Will I still receive my mail? The U.S. Postal Service is funded independently from the appropriations process and will not be affected during a government shutdown. Q: Will my student loans be impacted by a shutdown? Federal Direct Student Loans and Pell Grants will continue to be disbursed during a shutdown as long as mandatory appropriations last, but Department of Education staff will be operating at a reduced capacity. Q: Will immigration applications be processed during a shutdown? The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will operate as normal during a government shutdown, with the exception of programs which rely on appropriated funding, including E-Verify. The Department of Homeland Security estimates that Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement will retain the vast majority of their employees during a shutdown. Q: What does a government shutdown cost? In addition to disrupting federal agencies and employees, a government shutdown would have significant negative impacts on the economy. The 2018-2019 government shutdown is estimated to have cost $11 billion according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). It’s estimated that the 2013 full government shutdown reduced GDP growth by $20 billion. From the last three shutdowns, government agencies lost just under 57,000 years of productivity from furloughed federal workers. And, a shutdown could further affect our nation’s credit rating. The credit agency Fitch already downgraded U.S. treasuries in the aftermath of the latest debt limit crisis, and a government shutdown would create more doubt about whether the United States can reliably manage our finances.",

December 19, 2024 at 1:00 p.m. EDT Yesterday the Federal Reserve cut rates by 25bps and signaled that the pace of rate cuts would slow in 2025 with the SEP projecting only 2 additional cuts next year which was largely in line with what futures markets were implying heading into the decision. The reasoning for this adjustment was a stronger than expected economic backdrop, a labor market that continues to moderate but was stronger than previously expected and lastly the thing markets really seemed to focus on, the increased upside risk to inflation. There was one official dissent by one of the Committee’s newest members, Beth Hammack, however, the DOTS showed that there were 4 officials who preferred to leave rates unchanged.

                "content": "The market has been steadily rising all year, but hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve signal uncertainty ahead. While Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was adamant that the central bank could not own bitcoin (BTC-USD), Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) believes 2025 is shaping up to be \"the year for bitcoin & digital assets\" in a social media post from earlier this week. Senator Lummis — who has championed the bipartisan Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA) alongside Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) — has been a vocal supporter of President-elect Donald Trump's choice of David Sacks as the incoming administration's \"AI and crypto czar\" and what it represents for the crypto space. Senator Lummis sits down with Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss the outlook of a US strategic bitcoin reserve, calling the landmark cryptocurrency \"the right asset\" and \"digital gold\" for being a finite resource. \"Only 21 million bitcoin will ever be mined. And it has the elements of strength. And even though it's slightly volatile, it's always volatile in an upward-leaning direction. And so the goal here of holding it for 20 years is in recognition that on the short term, there is short-term volatility. On the long term, there is long-term growth that far exceeds the ability of the US dollar to keep up.\" Bitwise Asset Management CIO Matt Hougan told Yahoo Finance this week that a US investment into a strategic bitcoin reserve could propel the cryptocurrency's price to $500,000. \"The US dollar is designed to debase. The Fed has a goal of 2% per year inflation, whereas bitcoin's goal is to far, far exceed in value inflation and far exceed the value of the US dollar,\" Sen. Lummis explains. \"And so far from inception, it has done exactly that. It's grown about 55% per year. And if you look at the long term, over time, it'll drop from 55% a year to 45% a year to 35% a year. But it will continue to grow where the US dollar will continue to decline in value.\" Catch Yahoo Finance's full interview with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), where the lawmaker speaks more about the crypto regulation bill and Trump's choice Paul Atkins as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

                "title": "Real Madrid CF - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 alongside with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[8] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023.[9][10] It was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable football club.[11] In 2024, Real Madrid become the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue according to the club's announcement.[12] Real Madrid are one of the most succesful clubs in the sport. In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 35 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record nine FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[17] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[18][19] Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.[20][21] Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[22] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018); however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.[23] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million);[24] he became both the club's and history's all-time top goalscorer.[25][26][27][28] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham[29] and Kylian Mbappé.[30][31] Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[32] while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[33] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (55),[18] a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[34] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18. In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records.[35] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[36] As of July 2024,[update] Real Madrid are ranked 2nd in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall.[37][38] Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.[39] They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[40][41][42] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[7] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[43][44] Three years after its founding, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[45] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[46] In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[47] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[48] On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco.[note 2][49] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[50] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper Ya reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[51] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: Reds! Separatists!... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[52] Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's José Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while Ángel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'.\"[53] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[54] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[50] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[55] Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[56] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"cantera,\" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[57] In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel)[58] and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[59] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[57] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[60] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[61] The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[62] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name \"Yé-yé\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[63] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[64] and 1964.[62] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[65] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[66] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[67] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president. Bernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[68] In the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[69][70] Spanish sports journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. All five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[69][70] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[69][70] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club. In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[71] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[72] In November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[73] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[74] In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[75] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[76] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[77] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the field, the Zidanes y Pavones policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[78] The few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[79] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[80] \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[81] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[81] The 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[82] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[83] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[84] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,[85] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[86] Ramón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[87] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[88] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.[89] On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[90][91] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[92] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[93] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos.[94] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[95] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[96][97] José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[98][99] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[100][101] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[102] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe. In the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[103] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[104] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[105][106] Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[107] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[108] On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[109] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[110] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[111] By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[112] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[113] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La Décima\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la ˈðeθima]).[114] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[115] After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[116] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[117] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[118] After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[119] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[120] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[121] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[122] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012.[123] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[124] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[125][126] On 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[127] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez.[128][129][130] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to get good results against top teams.[131] Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[132] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favour, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[133] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"La Undécima\".[134][135][126] Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[136] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[137] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[138] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[139] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[140] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[141] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[142][143] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duodécima\".[144] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[145] Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[146] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[147] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[148] In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[149][150] Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[151] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[152] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[97] On 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[153][154] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[155] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[156] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[157] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[158] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.[159] In the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million.[160] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[161] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[162] From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[163][164] Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[165] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[166] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[167][168][169] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[170] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[171] defeating pre-tournament favourites Paris Saint-Germain,[172][173] defending champions and favourites Chelsea,[174] Premier League champions and heavy favourites Manchester City,[175] all in dramatic fashion,[176] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favourites,[177] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius Júnior goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[178][179] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favoured to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[180] After a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club. Real Madrid's 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup. The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to FC Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate. In 2023, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham, who was given the number #5 jersey, previously used by Zinedine Zidane. Real also signed Arda Güler and Fran García. Meanwhile, Vinícius Júnior was given the number #7 jersey, previously used by Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo; while Rodrygo was given the number #11 jersey, previously used by Gareth Bale. Karim Benzema left the club, while Toni Kroos would later announce that he would retire from football after this season. The 2023-24 season would prove to be another highly successful season for Los Blancos. First, Real Madrid lifted the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona 4–1, taking revenge of the previous year's 3–0 defeat. Then, Real Madrid lifted the La Liga with relative ease, reaching 95 points, the second-best winning campaign by Real Madrid in La Liga history after the 2011–12 100 points season. In the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid knocked out RB Leipzig in the Round of 16, then defending champions Manchester City in penalties. In the semifinals, Real Madrid faced Bayern Munich again. The first match was a 2–2 draw, while the second match in the Bernabéu was marked by a double by Joselu in the last few minutes of the game, with Bayern Munich suffering a historic comeback after leading 1–0. Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in the final, and won 2–0, with Dani Carvajal being the man of the match and scoring with a header after a Toni Kroos corner, and Vinícius Júnior once again scoring in a UCL final. Real Madrid won their 15th Champions League without losing a single match during the campaign. Following the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, Real Madrid announced that striker Kylian Mbappé would be joining the club on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2024, concluding one of the most highly anticipated transfer sagas in modern history.[181] On 18 December 2024, Real Madrid clinched their first trophy of the season, uplifting the inaugural 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup by beating Pachuca 3-0.[182] The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[183] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[184] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[183] With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[48] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[185][56] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[183] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[183] Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[43] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 3] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[56] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[186] Real's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[187][188] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[189][190] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[191] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[192][193] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year.[194] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[195] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[196] Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[45] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[202] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[47] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[56][203] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[57] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[56] The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[204] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[204] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[205][206][207][208] The Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[209] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[210] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[211] On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground.[212] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.[213][164] The latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to nearly 85,000.[214][215] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[216][217] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[218][219] Raúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741 appearances from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times.[220] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176. Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[221][222] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[223] Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 129,690, which was for a European Cup match in 1956 against Milan. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 80,000.[224] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (36 as of 2023–24) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[225] The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fifteen times[226] and for the most semi-finals appearances (33). As of June 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[227] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game, before Bayern Munich breaks the record in 2021.[228] In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million).[229][230] The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million.[110] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[231] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million.[232] The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.[233] During most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[234] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[235][236] Real Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[237][238] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[239][240] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[241] Questioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\".[242] Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[243] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[244] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 100 victories for Madrid, 97 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[245] As early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[247][248] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[249] There is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[250] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[251][185] The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millonarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[252] Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[253] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[254] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[255] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[256] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[257] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[257][258] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.[257] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[257] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[257] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.[259] The club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.[47] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"[185] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were \"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\" – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).[260][261] The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[262] In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites).[263] By then, Real Madrid did not want to sign non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, \"Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote\" (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\").[264] Atlético's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the 2016–17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city.[265][266] In fact, the Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region). Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times is very favourable.[267] A high point came in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4–1 comeback victory in extra time.[268] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss.[269] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.[270] A further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico (the old classic),[271] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903.[272][273] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by El Clásico.[274] Athletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players,[275] have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the Lions won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005–06 to 2016–17.[271][276][277] However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.[278][261][279] Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times.[280][281] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws),[282] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings.[283][284][285] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\"). During the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium by the same method), then at the same stage in the 2013–14 edition with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate,[286] and again in 2017–18 with the Spanish club progressing 4–3;[287] both times they went on to win the competition. Another match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).[288][289][290] Their first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961–62 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in Paris.[289] At the quarter-final stage in 1995–96, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy.[289] In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1–0.[289][291] They met again in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate.[289] By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the Bianconeri in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.[292] The teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player Álvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid.[289] They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.[289][293][294] The latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017–18 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline.[295][296] Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick,[297] and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time,[298] he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.[299] It was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[300] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[78] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[301] The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[302] Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[81] By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion),[303] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million).[304] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[305] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.[306] A study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\"[307] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[308][309] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.[310] Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money,[311] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership.[312] The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[313] As of 2010, the club had 60,000 socios.[314] At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.[315][316] During the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football.[315] Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million.[315] For the 2010–11 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona;[317] furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, Forbes listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion.[318] Real Madrid was valued at €3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016–17 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million.[319] In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was £8.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona.[320][321] In 2022, Forbes listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.[322] Real Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the Goal! football movie trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream... (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.[323] Real, The Movie is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on galácticos such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase. The book White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled Legends, and a remix of the club's anthem, \"Himno del Real Madrid,\" was released as the first single from the album.[324] Real Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre. Hala Madrid is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the Madridistas Fan Club card holders.[325] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans).[6] The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches.[325] Real Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA, EA Sports FC, and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times. In 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play's liquidation in September 2009) would end up being Real Madrid: The Game, which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play's publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay. Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.

It’s extremely rare for it to spread from person to person. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy You might hear about bird flu when there’s an outbreak affecting large numbers of birds or other animals. This is concerning because it increases the risk of human infection, can affect wildlife and can reduce the food supply. There have been ongoing cases of human infections in the U.S. since 2024. There are many subtypes of avian flu. The recent cases in humans in the U.S. are influenza A(H5). The most common subtypes that have spread to humans in the past have been influenza A(H5N1) and influenza A(H7N9). The types of proteins on the surface of the virus determine the names of these subtypes. Symptoms of bird flu include: These symptoms can be mild or severe. Most recent cases of bird flu in the U.S. have caused pink eye and mild respiratory symptoms. A type of influenza A virus, often H5N1 in humans, causes bird flu. The virus can infect your upper respiratory tract and lungs, and sometimes spread to other parts of your body like your brain. Humans can get bird flu if they come in contact with an infected animal’s body fluid, like spit (saliva), milk, respiratory droplets or poop (feces). You can breathe it in from small dust particles in animal habitats or get it into your eyes, nose or mouth after touching body fluids. Advertisement You don’t get bird flu from eating properly cooked poultry or eggs or from drinking pasteurized milk. Any flocks known to have avian flu virus are immediately taken out of the human food supply. Bird flu is very rarely contagious (spread from person to person), but there have been a few cases of spread between humans. None of these happened in the U.S. In almost all cases so far, human bird flu infections have come from contact with infected animals. But any time a human is infected, it’s possible that the virus could mutate to spread easily to other humans. People who work with poultry, waterfowl (like ducks or geese) and dairy cows are at the highest risk for bird flu. Bird flu can often cause severe illness. Complications include: Healthcare providers can diagnose avian flu with a throat or nose swab or a swab from the conjunctiva of your eye. Current tests will detect highly pathogenic H5N1 (bird flu) as influenza A. Labs don’t routinely test all positive influenza A swabs for avian flu, so you have to let your provider know that you’ve been in contact with birds, cows or other animals that could be infected. Then, if the test is positive for influenza A, the lab will send the sample to a special lab to be tested for bird flu. If identified early, you can treat bird flu with antiviral medications. A provider might prescribe: Ways to reduce your risk of bird flu include: Public health authorities — like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the U.S. — monitor cases of bird flu in animals and people to try to reduce the risk of spread. Scientists are working to develop vaccines that could help prevent avian flu or reduce its severity. These could be put into use if there were a risk of a large outbreak. Advertisement Some people with bird flu only have mild symptoms, or even no symptoms at all. If you get severely ill, you’ll need to stay in the hospital so a healthcare team can monitor your symptoms and treat you for complications right away. Overall, the mortality (death) rate for bird flu in humans is high — historically, about half of all people with known infections have died. But most recent cases in the U.S. have been mild. If you’re at a higher risk for avian influenza, talk to your provider about prevention and when you should seek care if you have symptoms. See a provider if you think you’ve been exposed to bird flu. Go to the nearest emergency room if you have symptoms of severe illness, including: It might be helpful to ask your provider: Bird flu spreads in birds, cows and other mammals. It sometimes spreads from animals to people. This is a problem for wildlife health, food supply and human health. Advertisement It’s possible. If a version of bird flu had a gene mutation that allowed it to spread easily between people, it could cause a pandemic. Cattle and other animals get bird flu in the same way that humans can get it — through breathing in the virus from contaminated dust in animal habitats or direct contact with body fluids of infected animals. You might be alarmed when you see headlines about bird flu. While it’s still uncommon in humans, it’s true that some people are at a higher risk for infection, especially those who work around dairy cows, birds or other animals that can carry it. But there are ways to reduce your risks. Talk to a healthcare provider if you have concerns about bird flu. Advertisement Last reviewed on 12/05/2024.

                "content": "​By: Robert W. Frenck Jr., MD, FAAP Birds in the United States can be affected by avian flu (also called H5N1 bird flu or avian influenza). But can it affect your family? Here's what parents need to know about bird flu. Bird flu is caused by avian influenza type A viruses, including the avian flu type A(H5N1) that is the most recent strain circulating in our country. The virus is known to infect birds around the world. Sometimes, wild birds spread the virus and cause outbreaks on poultry farms. In January 2022, it was found in wild birds in our country for the first time since 2016. Several states have since reported bird flu in poultry flocks and wild birds. In the past few years, tens of millions of chickens were removed from farms where the virus was detected. This affected the egg supply and caused a big increase in the price of eggs. Bird flu is common in wild birds—especially wild waterfowl like ducks and geese. It is spread easily by infected birds that carry the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions and droppings (feces). When sick birds fly overhead, the virus can spread through their droppings to farms and backyard pens. If your family keeps birds as backyard pets or on small hobby farms, they are also at risk. Other animals can get bird flu, too. Wildlife and domestic livestock that are exposed to the viruses can become infected. In March 2024, bird flu was identified in dairy cattle in several states. It is the first time that this virus has been found in cows. Several cats on a farm in Texas also died after drinking raw milk from infected cows. In December 2024, two infected indoor cats died after drinking raw milk. The raw milk and cream products have been recalled. ​ Public health experts are watching the outbreaks and infections very closely. Bird flu can spread from animals to humans. Several people have been infected with bird flu from animals in the U.S. this year. Most infections have been in people who work with dairy cattle or poultry. In December 2024, a person was hospitalized with severe symptoms in Louisiana. It is the first report linked to exposure to a backyard flock in the U.S. Backyard flock owners, hunters, other bird enthusiasts and anyone who has contact with birds or other animals that may be infected should protect themselves. California issued an emergency declaration to speed up response and prevent the spread of infections in people. Over half of the human infections in the U.S. have been California. ​ In November 2024, a Canadian teenager with bird flu was hospitalized with serious symptoms. The source of exposure is not yet known. A child in California also tested positive for bird flu. The child had mild symptoms and was treated with flu antiviral medicine. So far, none of the people who got bird flu from sick animals have spread it to other people. Health experts continue to watch for any changes in how the virus spreads—including in people with exposure to dairy cows and poultry. In people, signs and symptoms of bird flu can include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, pneumonia, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, acute respiratory distress, respiratory failure, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting and sometimes neurologic changes (altered mental status, seizures). Seasonal flu vaccination will not prevent infection with bird flu viruses. The annual influenza vaccine protects against three strains that are most widely circulating in humans. The risk of kids—or adults—getting seasonal influenza is much greater. That is why annual influenza vaccination is recommended for everyone age 6 months and older. You cannot get bird flu from eating fully cooked domestic or wild poultry products like chicken, turkey or duck. There is no evidence that the flu can be spread through pasteurized dairy products. Health officials have long advised against drinking raw milk, which has not been pasteurized. However, raw milk may be extra risky now because of possible transmission of H5N1 virus. Public health experts keep a close watch for bird flu outbreaks on farms to make sure our food supply is safe. People who work in the livestock industry also follow safety steps to protect themselves and others in case they have close contact with sick animals. Cooking eggs will kill any virus or bacteria, so they are safe to eat. The germs that can make us sick are found on the eggshell. Salmonella, Campylobacter and other germs get on the egg shell from bird poop. Poultry often carry these germs. (That's why health experts advise us to avoid eating raw eggs and avoid licking the bowl when we make cake or cookie batter!) Eggs from the grocery store are washed before they are put into their cartons. If your family has backyard poultry, be sure to clean eggs carefully with fine sandpaper, a brush, or a cloth to remove germs from their shells. Don't wash warm, fresh eggs because colder water can pull germs into the egg through tiny pores in the shell. Other healthy steps include keeping a clean coop, collecting eggs often and throwing away cracked eggs you collect. In general, birds carry a lot of diseases besides bird flu. The best way to avoid getting sick is to make sure that children wash their hands with soap and water after being around any bird or bird droppings. Supervise children around birds and remind them not to rub their eyes or touch their nose or mouth while handling birds or bird feces. Tell your child not to touch, handle or move a sick or dead bird. They should let an adult know, so that it can be reported​. Raw Milk: Is it Safe to Drink?

Birds, just like people, can get the flu. Another name for bird flu is avian influenza. The viruses that cause bird flu normally only infect birds, including chickens, other poultry, and wild birds such as ducks. But sometimes the viruses can infect other animals and, in rare cases, people. A few types of these viruses have caused most of the infections in people. They are the H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6 viruses. These infections in people have mainly been in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and the Near East. Although it's very rare, there have also been some infections in people in the United States. The most common ways you can get bird flu are from: It's also possible (but very rare) to get bird flu from: Certain people may be more likely to get bird flu, including: Sometimes bird flu doesn't cause any symptoms. But if you do feel sick, your symptoms can range from mild to severe. Often, the symptoms are similar to the (seasonal) flu, such as: People with severe illness from bird flu may have pneumonia and might need to be hospitalized. Laboratory testing is used to diagnose bird flu. It's usually done with a nasal or throat swab. This testing is more accurate when the swab is collected during the first few days of illness. For people who are severely ill, health care providers may do testing of a different sample, such as fluid taken during a bronchoalveolar lavage or other procedure. Bird flu is treated with antiviral medicines. It's important to get them as soon as possible. The medicines may make your illness less severe. You may also be given antiviral medicines if you were exposed to a person or animal who has the virus. This may help prevent you from getting sick. There is currently no vaccine available to the public. The government has developed a virus that is similar to some H5N1 viruses. The virus could be used to produce a vaccine for people, if needed.

                "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Dow Jones, or simply the Dow (/ˈdaʊ/), is a stock market index of 30 prominent companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. The DJIA is one of the oldest and most commonly followed equity indexes. Many professionals[who?] consider it to be an inadequate representation of the overall U.S. stock market compared to a broader market index such as the S&P 500. The DJIA includes only 30 large companies. It is price-weighted, unlike other common indexes such as the Nasdaq Composite or S&P 500, which use market capitalization.[4][5][6][7] The value of the index can also be calculated as the sum of the stock prices of the companies included in the index, divided by a factor, which is approximately 0.163 as of November 2024[update]. The factor is changed whenever a constituent company undergoes a stock split so that the value of the index is unaffected by the stock split. First calculated on May 26, 1896,[2] the index is the second-oldest among U.S. market indices, after the Dow Jones Transportation Average. It was created by Charles Dow, co-founder of both The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones & Company, and named after him and his business associate, statistician Edward Jones. The index is maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, an entity majority-owned by S&P Global. Its components are selected by a committee. The ten components with the largest dividend yields are commonly referred to as the Dogs of the Dow. As with all stock prices, the prices of the constituent stocks and consequently the value of the index itself are affected by the performance of the respective companies as well as macroeconomic factors. As of December 6, 2024,[update] the Dow Jones Industrial Average consists of the following companies, with a weighting as shown:[8] As of November 8, 2024, the components of the DJIA have changed 59 times since its beginning on May 26, 1896. General Electric had the longest presence on the index, beginning in the original index in 1896 and ending in 2018, but was dropped and re-added twice between 1898 and 1907. Changes to the index since 1991 are as follows: Investing in the DJIA is possible via index funds as well as via derivatives such as option contracts and futures contracts. Index funds, including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETF) can replicate, before fees and expenses, the performance of the index by holding the same stocks as the index in the same proportions. An ETF that replicates the performance of the index is issued by State Street Corporation (NYSE Arca: DIA).[35] ProShares offers leveraged ETFs that attempt to produce three times the daily result of either investing in (NYSE Arca: UDOW) or shorting (NYSE Arca: SDOW) the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[36] In the derivatives market, the CME Group through its subsidiaries the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), issues Futures Contracts; the E-mini Dow ($5) Futures (YM), which track the average and trade on their exchange floors respectively. Trading is typically carried out in an open outcry auction, or over an electronic network such as CME's Globex platform. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) issues option contracts on the Dow through the root symbol DJX. Options on various Dow-underlying ETFs are also available for trading.[37] The following table shows the annual development of the Dow Jones Index, which was calculated back to 1896.[38][39] In 1884, Charles Dow composed his first stock average, which contained nine railroads and two industrial companies that appeared in the Customer's Afternoon Letter, a daily two-page financial news bulletin which was the precursor to The Wall Street Journal. On January 2, 1886, the number of stocks represented in what is now the Dow Jones Transportation Average dropped from 14 to 12, as the Central Pacific Railroad and Central Railroad of New Jersey were removed. Though comprising the same number of stocks, this index contained only one of the original twelve industrials that would eventually form Dow's most famous index.[40] Dow calculated his first average purely of industrial stocks on May 26, 1896, creating what is now known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average. None of the original 12 industrials still remain part of the index.[41] When it was first published in the mid-1880s, the index stood at a level of 62.76. It reached a peak of 78.38 during the summer of 1890, but reached its all-time low of 28.48 in the summer of 1896 during the Panic of 1896. Many of the biggest percentage price moves in the Dow occurred early in its history, as the nascent industrial economy matured. In the 1900s, the Dow halted its momentum as it worked its way through two financial crises: the Panic of 1901 and the Panic of 1907. The Dow remained stuck in a range between 53 and 103 until late 1914. The negativity surrounding the 1906 San Francisco earthquake did little to improve the economic climate; the index broke 100 for the first time in 1906.[44] At the start of the 1910s, the Panic of 1910–1911 stifled economic growth. On July 30, 1914, as the average stood at a level of 71.42, a decision was made to close the New York Stock Exchange, and suspend trading for a span of four and a half months. Some historians believe the exchange was closed because of a concern that markets would plunge as a result of panic over the onset of World War I. An alternative explanation is that the United States Secretary of the Treasury, William Gibbs McAdoo, closed the exchange to conserve the U.S. gold stock in order to launch the Federal Reserve System later that year, with enough gold to keep the United States on par with the gold standard. When the markets reopened on December 12, 1914, the index closed at 74.56, a gain of 4.4%. This is frequently reported as a large drop, due to using a later redefinition. Reports from the time say that the day was positive.[45] Following World War I, the United States experienced another economic downturn, the Post–World War I recession. The Dow's performance remained unchanged from the closing value of the previous decade, adding only 8.26%, from 99.05 at the beginning of 1910, to a level of 107.23 at the end of 1919.[46] The Dow experienced a long bull run from 1920 to late 1929 when it rose from 73 to 381 points.[47] In 1928, the components of the Dow were increased to 30 stocks near the economic height of that decade, which was nicknamed the Roaring Twenties. This period downplayed the influence of the Depression of 1920–1921 and certain international conflicts such as the Polish–Soviet War, the Irish Civil War, the Turkish War of Independence and the initial phase of the Chinese Civil War. After a peak of 381.17 on September 3, 1929, the bottom of the 1929 crash came just 2 months later on November 13, 1929, at 195.35 intraday, closing slightly higher at 198.69.[48] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression over the next several years saw the Dow continue to fall until July 8, 1932, when it closed at 41.22,[49] roughly two-thirds of its mid-1880s starting point and almost 90% below its peak. Overall for the 1920s decade, the Dow still ended with a healthy 131.7% gain, from 107.23 to 248.48 at the end of 1929.[47] In inflation-adjusted numbers, the high of 381.17 on September 3, 1929, was not surpassed until 1954. Marked by global instability and the Great Depression, the 1930s contended with several consequential European and Asian outbreaks of war, leading to the catastrophic World War II in 1939. Other conflicts during the decade which affected the stock market included the 1936–1939 Spanish Civil War, the 1935–1936 Second Italo-Abyssinian War, the Soviet-Japanese Border War of 1939, and the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937. The United States experienced the Recession of 1937–1938, which temporarily brought economic recovery to a halt. The largest one-day percentage gain in the index happened in the depths of the 1930s bear market on March 15, 1933, when the Dow gained 15.34% to close at 62.10. However, as a whole throughout the Great Depression, the Dow posted some of its worst performances, for a negative return during most of the 1930s for new and old stock market investors. For the decade, the Dow Jones average was down from 248.48 at the beginning of 1930, to a stable level of 150.24 at the end of 1939, a loss of about 40%.[50] Post-war reconstruction during the 1940s, along with renewed optimism of peace and prosperity, brought about a 33% surge in the Dow from 150.24 to 200.13. The strength in the Dow occurred despite the Recession of 1949 and various global conflicts. During the 1950s, the Korean War and the Cold War did not stop the Dow's climb higher. A nearly 240% increase in the average from 200.13 to 679.36 ensued over the course of that decade. The Dow began to stall during the 1960s as the markets trudged through the Kennedy Slide of 1962, but still managed an 18% gain from 679.36 to 800.36. The 1970s marked a time of economic uncertainty and troubled relations between the U.S. and certain Middle-Eastern countries. The 1970s energy crisis was a prelude to a disastrous economic climate along with stagflation, the combination of high unemployment and high inflation. However, on November 14, 1972, the average closed at 1,003.16, above the 1,000 mark for the first time, during a brief relief rally in the midst of a lengthy bear market.[44] Between January 1973 and December 1974, the average lost 48% of its value in what became known as the 1973–1974 stock market crash, closing at 577.60 on December 6, 1974.[51] The nadir came after prices dropped more than 45% over two years since the NYSE's high point of 1,003.16 on November 4, 1972. In 1976, the index reached 1,000 several times and it closed the year at 1,004.75. Although the Vietnam War ended in 1975, new tensions arose towards Iran surrounding the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Performance-wise for the 1970s, the index remained virtually flat, rising 4.8% from 800.36 to 838.74. The 1980s began with the early 1980s recession. In early 1981, the index broke above 1,000 several times, but then retreated. After closing above 2,000 in January 1987,[44] the largest one-day percentage drop occurred on Black Monday, October 19, 1987, when the average fell 22.61%. There were no clear reasons given to explain the crash. On October 13, 1989, the Friday the 13th mini-crash, which initiated the collapse of the junk bond market, resulted in a loss of almost 7% of the index in a single day.[52] During the 1980s, the Dow increased 228% from 838.74 to 2,753.20; despite the market crashes, Silver Thursday, an early 1980s recession, the 1980s oil glut, the Japanese asset price bubble, and other political distractions. The index had only two negative years in the 1980s: in 1981 and 1984. The 1990s brought on rapid advances in technology along with the introduction of the dot-com era. The markets contended with the 1990 oil price shock compounded with the effects of the early 1990s recession and a brief European situation surrounding Black Wednesday.[citation needed] Certain influential foreign conflicts such as the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt which took place as part of the initial stages of the Dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Revolutions of 1989; the First Chechen War and the Second Chechen War, the Gulf War, and the Yugoslav Wars failed to dampen economic enthusiasm surrounding the ongoing Information Age and the \"irrational exuberance\" (a phrase coined by Alan Greenspan[53]) of the dot-com bubble.[citation needed] Between late 1992 and early 1993, the Dow staggered through the 3,000 level making only modest gains as the biotechnology sector suffered through the downfall of the Biotech Bubble; as many biotech companies saw their share prices rapidly rise to record levels and then subsequently fall to new all-time lows.[54] The Dow soared from 2,753 to 8,000 between January 1990 to July 1997.[44] In October 1997, the events surrounding the 1997 Asian financial crisis plunged the Dow into a 554-point loss to a close of 7,161.15; a retrenchment of 7.18% in what became known as the October 27, 1997 mini-crash. However, the Dow continued climbing past 9,000 despite negativity surrounding the 1998 Russian financial crisis along with the subsequent fallout from the 1998 collapse of Long-Term Capital Management due to bad bets placed on the movement of the Russian ruble.[55] On March 29, 1999, the average closed at 10,006.78, its first close above 10,000. This prompted a celebration on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor, complete with party hats.[56] Total gains for the decade exceeded 315%; from 2,753.20 to 11,497.12, which equates to 12.3% annually. The Dow averaged a 5.3% return compounded annually for the 20th century, a record Warren Buffett called \"a wonderful century\"; when he calculated that to achieve that return again, the index would need to close at about 2,000,000 by December 2099.[57] On September 17, 2001, the first day of trading after the September 11 attacks on the United States, the Dow fell 7.1%. However, the Dow began an upward trend shortly after the attacks, and regained all lost ground to close above 10,000 for the year. In 2002, the Dow dropped to a four-year low of 7,286 on September 24, 2002, due to the stock market downturn of 2002 and lingering effects of the dot-com bubble. Overall, while the NASDAQ index fell roughly 75% and the S&P 500 index fell roughly 50% between 2000 and 2002, the Dow only fell 27% during the same period. In 2003, the Dow held steady within the 7,000 to 9,000-point level and recovered to the 10,000 mark by year end.[58] The Dow continued climbing and reached a record high of 14,198.10 on October 11, 2007, a mark which was not matched until March 2013.[59] It then dropped over the next year due to the 2007–2008 financial crisis. On September 15, 2008, a wider financial crisis became evident after the Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers along with the economic effect of record high oil prices which had reached almost $150 per barrel two months earlier. The Dow lost more than 500 points for the day, returning to its mid-July lows below 11,000.[60][61] A series of bailout packages, including the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, proposed and implemented by the Federal Reserve and United States Department of the Treasury did not prevent further losses. After nearly six months of extreme volatility during which the Dow experienced its largest one-day point loss, largest daily point gain, and largest intraday range (of more than 1,000 points) at the time, the index closed at a new 12-year low of 6,547.05 on March 9, 2009,[62] its lowest close since April 1997. The Dow had lost 20% of its value in only six weeks. Towards the latter half of 2009, the average rallied towards the 10,000 level amid optimism that the Great Recession, the United States housing bubble and the 2007–2008 financial crisis, were easing and possibly coming to an end. For the decade, the Dow saw a rather substantial pullback for a negative return from 11,497.12 to 10,428.05, a loss of a 9.3%.[63] During the first half of the 2010s decade, aided by the Federal Reserve's loose monetary policy including quantitative easing, the Dow made a notable rally attempt. This was despite significant volatility due to growing global concerns such as the European debt crisis, the Dubai World 2009 debt standstill, and the 2011 United States debt-ceiling crisis.[citation needed] On May 6, 2010, the Dow lost 9.2% intra-day and regained nearly all of it within a single hour. This event, which became known as the 2010 Flash Crash, sparked new regulations to prevent future incidents.[64] Six years after its previous high in 2007, the Dow finally closed at a new record high on March 5, 2013.[65] It continued rising for the next several years past 17,000 points until a brief 2015–2016 stock market selloff in the second half of 2015.[66] It then picked up again in early 2016 and climbed past 25,000 points on January 4, 2018.[67] On November 9, 2016, the day after Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election, the index soared, coming within roughly 25 points of its all-time intraday high to that point.[68] Volatility returned in 2018 when the Dow fell nearly 20%.[69][70][71] By early January 2019, the index had quickly rallied more than 10% from its Christmas Eve low.[72] Overall in the 2010s decade, the Dow increased from 10,428.05 to 28,538.44 for a substantial gain of 174%.[73] Despite the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, the Dow continued its bull run from the previous decade before peaking at 29,551.42 on February 12, 2020 (29,568.57 intraday on the same day). The index slowly retreated for the remainder of the week and into the next week, before coronavirus fears and an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia sent the index into a tailspin, recording several days of losses[74] (and gains[75]) of at least 1,000 points, a typical symptom of a bear market[76] as previously seen in October 2008 during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Volatility rose high enough to trigger multiple 15-minute trading halts.[77] In the first quarter of 2020, the DJIA fell 23%, its worst quarter since 1987.[78] The market recovered in the third quarter, returning to 28,837.52 on October 12, 2020, and peaked momentarily at a new all-time high of 29,675.25 on November 9, 2020, at 14:00 ET, following that day's announcement of the success of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in Phase III clinical trials.[79] The Dow (as reported by the United Press International) closed over 30,000 on December 31, 2020, at a record 30,606.48. On November 24, following news that the presidential transition of Joe Biden was approved, the Dow increased by more than 500 points, closing at 30,046.24. On January 22, 2024, the Dow Jones crossed 38,000 points for the first time; a month later it surpassed 39,000; and in May, it surpassed 40,000 points. The DJIA is computed as the sum of the prices of all thirty stocks divided by a divisor, the Dow Divisor. The divisor is adjusted in case of stock splits, spinoffs or similar structural changes, to ensure that such events do not in themselves alter the numerical value of the DJIA. Early on, the initial divisor was composed of the original number of component companies; this initially made the DJIA a simple arithmetic average. The present divisor, after many adjustments, is less than one, making the index larger than the sum of the prices of the components. That is: where p are the prices of the component stocks and d is the Dow Divisor. Events such as stock splits or changes in the list of the companies composing the index alter the sum of the component prices. In these cases, in order to avoid discontinuity in the index, the Dow Divisor is updated so that the quotations right before and after the event coincide: Since November 8, 2024,[update] the Dow Divisor is 0.16268413125742[80][81] and every $1 change in price in a particular stock within the average equates to a 6.146881 (or 1 ÷ 0.16268413125742) point movement. Despite its unusual weighting by price rather than market capitalization, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is highly correlated with other proxies of the US equities market, particularly the S&P 500 Index.[82] Between (1980-January-{{{day}}}) (2023-November-{{{day}}})January 1980 – November 2023, the DJIA returned an annualized 8.90%, with the S&P 500 returning a nearly identical 8.91%.[83] With the inclusion of only 30 stocks, critics such as Ric Edelman argue that the DJIA is an inaccurate representation of overall market performance compared to more comprehensive indices such as the S&P 500 Index or the Russell 3000 Index. Additionally, the DJIA is criticized for being a price-weighted index, which gives higher-priced stocks more influence over the average than their lower-priced counterparts, but takes no account of the relative industry size or market capitalization of the components. For example, a $1 increase in a lower-priced stock can be negated by a $1 decrease in a much higher-priced stock, even though the lower-priced stock experienced a larger percentage change. In addition, a $1 move in the smallest component of the DJIA has the same effect as a $1 move in the largest component of the average. For example, during September–October 2008, former component AIG's reverse split-adjusted stock price collapsed from $22.76 on September 8 to $1.35 on October 27; contributing to a roughly 3,000-point drop in the index.[84] As of June 2021,[update] Goldman Sachs and UnitedHealth Group are among the highest-priced stocks in the average and therefore have the greatest influence on it. Alternately, Cisco Systems and Coca-Cola are among the lowest-priced stocks in the average and have the least sway in the price movement.[85] Critics of the DJIA and most securities professionals[who?] recommend the market-capitalization weighted S&P 500 Index or the Wilshire 5000, the latter of which includes most publicly listed U.S. stocks, as better indicators of the U.S. stock market. A study between the correlation of components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average compared with the movement of the index finds that the correlation is higher when the stocks are declining. The correlation is lowest in a time when the average is flat or rises a modest amount.[86]",

The match featured a whopping four goalkeeping errors, two by each side, plus what was essentially an own-goal to finish it off. In the end, Spurs would barely survive to become the fourth and final side to qualify for the EFL Cup semifinals. The first half featured a lively but still somewhat muted back-and-forth affair. It was highlighted by a Dominic Solanke opener in the 15th minute off a poor moment by Man United backup keeper Altay Bayindir who was rotated in to give Andre Onana some rest. Spurs would find themselves 3-0 up just 10 minutes into the second half, with Dejan Kulusevski scoring less than a minute after the restart and Solanke grabbing his brace shortly after, seemingly putting the home side well and truly through into the semifinals. Oh, if we only knew what would come. From there Fraser Forster gifted Man United not one but two goals to see them right back in it, first passing the ball right to Bruno Fernandes on the end line to see Joshua Zirkzee score, before he was dispossessed by Amad Diallo who tackled the ball into the net. With 20 minutes to go, United were on the hunt for a sensational equalizer, but Heung-Min Son scored an all-important fourth for Spurs by bagging an Olimpico, the corner delivery sailing over Bayindir who judged it horribly. Spurs wouldn't go through without one more calamitous error in stoppage time, as Yves Bissouma essentially headed the ball in his own net off a corner. Bissouma was only saved on the scoresheet by a slight deflection off the head of Johnny Evans which officially gave the United defender the goal. In the end, Tottenham saw their names amongst the semifinalists, but they did so in as nervy and embarrassing a fashion imaginable.

The hosts went ahead 3-0 before trying extremely hard to cough it up, but Heung-Min Son's Olimpico proves the difference in the end! What a wild game! 90+4 min: GOAL! MAN UNITED! YOU ABSOLUTELY CANNOT MAKE THIS UP! YVES BISSOUMA HAS HEADED A CORNER INTO HIS OWN NET! On replay, Johnny Evans will claim it as it's clipped off his head last, but Bissouma was the one to initiate the redirection of the ball towards his own goal! Four goalkeeping errors, and now what is essentially an own-goal! VIDEO: Watch the Man United goal in the UK 90+1 min: Tottenham make a substitution as Djed Spence is replaced by Sergio Reguilon. Bruno Fernandes is booked shortly after. 88th min: GOAL! TOTTENHAM! HEUNG-MIN SON SCORES STRAIGHT FROM A CORNER! It's yet another truly awful goalkeeping moment, as Altay Bayindir misjudges the flight of the ball and sees it sail over his head into the top corner! That's a delicious moment for Son bagging the Olimpico, but for Bayindir, my word that's poor. The Man United goalkeeper is screaming for a foul, but all he gets is a booking. Replays show slight contact by Lucas Bergvall on the goalkeeper, but there's absolutely nothing in that. He's just misjudged it! The comeback is in tatters! VIDEO: Watch the Tottenham goal in the USA | Watch in the UK 79th min: A change for Spurs as James Maddison is withdrawn for James Bergvall, as Ange Postecoglou knows his midfield needs more solidity. 74th min: Chance, Man United! It's delicious from Manchester United who build possession quickly into the attacking third at pace before working it around from left to right. It ends up with Noussair Mazraoui from a tight angle, but he flashes his shot just wide of the far post! United have their tails up and have snatched all the momentum, can they produce a sensational equalizer? 72nd min: Ruben Amorim smells blood in the water and has gone for the throat, bringing on Alejandro Garnacho to replace Manuel Ugarte. It was a wonder why Garnacho didn't start, with Antony selected from the off, but he's got his chance now. 70th min: GOAL! MAN UNITED! MY OH MY, FRASER FORSTER WITH ANOTHER DISASTROUS ERROR! And this one's even worse than the last! The Tottenham goalkeeper takes a back-pass from Archie Gray, and he takes ages to decide what to do with the ball! In the end, Amad Diallo comes sliding in and tackles the ball straight into the back of the net before Forster could release a pass! VIDEO: Watch Man United goal in USA | Watch in UK 67th min: Chance, Man United! Goodness me, Spurs are suddenly rattled completely out of nowhere! Fraser Forster concedes a very silly corner while in possession, and with the set-piece Amad Diallo produces a deflected shot which slowly skitters just inches wide of the far post! What on earth are the hosts doing? They were 3-0 up and well through to the semifinals and suddenly they've put themselves under a torrent of Man United pressure! 63rd min: GOAL! MAN UNITED! Moments after being denied by a great save, Joshua Zirkzee pulls Man United one back! It's an absolutely CALAMITOUS moment for Spurs, as Fraser Forster gives the ball straight to Bruno Fernandes basically on the end line! He feeds Zirkzee right on the goal mouth for a gift of a lifeline! Game on? Maybe? VIDEO: Watch Zirkzee goal in USA | Watch in UK 62nd min: Chance, Man United! Joshua Zirkzee has just come on and is immediately denied by a wonderful Fraser Forster save! An excellent cross from deep in the left corner flies over the head of Archie Gray, who misjudges the flight of the ball, and it lands right on the forehead of Zirkzee who aims for the lower right-hand corner of the net. Yet Forster scrambles across so well and makes a brilliant save! 57th min: Dejan Kulusevski is absolutely skewering Manchester United today. He goes on a run down the right flank which leaves two defenders on their backside before a wild Lisandro Martinez hack pumps the ball out for a corner. He's absolutely cooking today. 54th min: GOAL! TOTTENHAM! Ruben Amorim is set to make a few attacking changes, but before he can do so, Dominic Solanke makes it 3-0! The hosts have run riot since the start of the second half! Solanke makes a great run near the midfield stripe and Djed Spence finds him, clearly onside despite protests from the United defenders. He gets one-on-one with Lenny Yoro and beats him, putting Ruben Amorim's rotated side to bed. The changes come too late now, as Amad Diallo, Joshua Zirkzee, and Kobbie Mainoo all enter to replace Antony, Rasmus Hojlund, and Christian Eriksen. VIDEO: Watch Solanke goal in USA | Watch in UK 46th min: GOAL! TOTTENHAM! Dejan Kulusevski scores 50 seconds into the second half! A lateral cross by James Madisson deflects off a Lisandro Martinez and falls right to Kulusevski's feet! He's deserved that, the best player on the pitch today so far! It's now four games for Kulusevski in his last four games! VIDEO: Watch Kulusevski goal in UK 2nd half kickoff: The ball is rolling as the second half is now under way. No changes for either side as we get going once again. HALFTIME: Tottenham 1-0 Man United There's been a lot of attacking intent by both sides, but not too much quality at the end of it, as Dominic Solanke's goal is the difference at the halftime break. Dejan Kulusevski played well in the attacking third to get Spurs into dangerous positions, while Bruno Fernandes and Rasmus Hojlund were both bright for United as well. Christian Eriksen's had two good opportunities blocked on poor low finishes, while Victor Lindelof was forced off due to another injury. United need some inspiration in the final third to finish the good attacking moves, and there's definitely more goals in this game come the second half. The match is very much there for the taking for either side. 45+2 min: Chance, Man United! Christian Eriksen's had another brilliant chance blocked from exactly the same shooting position and almost exactly the same defender placement! It's a carbon copy of the first opportunity! Twice in the first half he's been denied! 44th min: There's a real worry here for Manchester United as Victor Lindelof, who has been beset by injuries all year long, has been forced off due to injury. Johnny Evans will enter in his place just a few ticks before halftime. Lindelof looks incredibly frustrated and disheartened. 34th min: Dejan Kulusevski, who's been bright (or as the commentator calls it, \"full of beans\"), gets on the ball inside the left edge of the six-yard box. Cut off from the near post, he waits for support to arrive before delivering a ball laterally to the face of goal, but it's blocked out for a corner by a sliding Lisandro Martinez. 25th min: Chance, Tottenham! And now Noussair Mazraoui does get the yellow card he probably deserved minutes ago as he got to a 50/50 ball late and put Djed Spence flat on his stomach. On the ensuing free-kick, the ball comes to Dejan Kulusevski down the left edge of the penalty area, and his vicious tight-angle shot is saved by Altay Bayindir who covers his near post awkwardly but well enough. 23rd min: Pape Sarr is booked for a painful foul in midfield on Bruno Fernandes. He was covering the space vacated by Pedro Porro who had pushed way up the pitch. 22nd min: Chance, Man United! Christian Eriksen has a free hit at the top of the penalty area as he latches onto a lateral feed from Diogo Dalot on the left, but it's blocked by Yves Bissouma right before reaching the goal mouth! In the aftermath, Noussair Mazraoui is lucky not to be booked for a bad and silly foul on the touchline near the corner flag that ends the attacking possession. 21st min: Pedro Porro makes an extremely awkward but effective tackle on Bruno Fernandes to keep the Man United star from having a free shot on goal! Man United play direct and over the top, and it almost works out. 15th min: GOAL! TOTTENHAM! Dominic Solanke scores the opener after a disapponting moment from backup United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir! Pedro Porro takes a shot from acres outside the top of the penalty area, and while the effort has real pace, it's not placed well and ends up in the middle of the net. Bayindir doesn't react well, and can only parry the ball, which he does straight into the path of Solanke who remains onside and pounces for an easy finish! Ruben Amorim's squad rotation crops up as an early weakness! VIDEO: Watch Tottenham goal in USA | Watch in the UK 12th min: Chance, Man United! Oh dear, Rasmus Hojlund is clean through on goal but can't even get a shot off! The Man United striker is played in brilliantly by a wonderful Bruno Fernandes vertical ball that sees him perfectly split the two Spurs center-backs down the middle. Yet Hojlund doesn't have the pace or first touch necessary to get truly past the defenders, and before he can shoot he's dispossessed from behind by Radu Dragusin. A really big chance goes begging! 10th min: Manchester United have the first corner of the match, which is punched away awkwardly by Tottenham goalkeeper Fraser Forster. The Red Devils have had the majority of the possession, but Spurs have looked very dangerous with a few counter-attack moves. A lively start to this game, even with just the one real quality chance for either side. 2nd min: Chance, Tottenham! Yves Bissouma wins the ball in midfield and springs a Spurs counter, which is run well by Heung-Min Son. He finds Dejan Kulusevski on the left with a vertical ball, who looks to return it back to Son with a quality cutback, but it's just inches behind the South Korea international and cleared. That's close to an early goal! Kickoff: They're under way in London at the home of Tottenham Hotspur! The 2024/25 Carabao Cup awaits the decision of who will be the last semifinal participant. 15 mins to kickoff: Easily the player with the biggest spotlight on them today will be Manchester United winger Antony, who has struggled mightily to justify his hefty price tag in his time with the Red Devils so far. It's a big call from Ruben Amorim to pick him in this spot over the likes of Alejandro Garnacho who is just coming off his Puskas Award win. Bayindir, Lindelof, Eriksen and Antony all starting for Man United vs Spurs. Garnacho on the bench. No Rashford. 30 mins to kickoff: You can find our predictions and best bets for this match here. Both these teams have lacked any semblance of consistency this season, making this match extremely hard to predict, but we've gone for Manchester United to punish Tottenham for their weaknesses. 45 mins to kickoff: This clash is the final quarterfinal showdown with Arsenal, Newcastle and Liverpool already qualified for the semifinals and here are the full details to be held after this clash! 1 hour to kickoff: TEAM NEWS IS IN! The main focus for United is the absence of Rashford entirely - but Amorim names a strong team - with Rasmus Hojlund leading the attack. Yves Bissoma and Pedro Porro start for Spurs. Team news locked in 🔒🔢 @krakenfx pic.twitter.com/QjA7bxwQmx 📣 UNITED! 📣#MUFC || #CarabaoCup 1 hour 20 mins to kickoff: Tyrone Marshall of the Manchester Evening News reports that Rashford has not arrived with the United squad, which was expected after reports yesterday that he had not travelled to London with the team. Neither has Matthijs de Ligt, which is a surprise. The #mufc squad arrives at Tottenham. No Marcus Rashford, as expected. No Matthijs de Ligt either pic.twitter.com/6tZgXIdEq7 1 hour 25 mins to kickoff: The home side have arrived. They haven't won here since November 3, but they're fresh off a 5-0 hammering of Southampton. Would anyone care to take a guess as to how they'll perform today? Course you wouldn't. In the building 🏡 pic.twitter.com/x63s72ddEE 📣 UNITED! 📣#MUFC || #CarabaoCup 1 hour 45 mins to kickoff: It's an interesting quirk of fate that United's first two Carabao Cup wins this season — a 7-0 thrashing of Barnsley, and a 5-2 win over Leicester City — each came under two different managers: Erik ten Hag oversaw the first, while Ruud van Nistelrooy was in caretaker charge for the second. How will Amorim get on in his competition debut? Both of @ManUtd’s #CarabaoCup wins this season have come under different managers!Ruben Amorim takes charge of the Red Devils in this competition for the first time this evening. Can he replicate their previous results? 👀🏆#EFL pic.twitter.com/HPhvJYWDOo 2 hours to kickoff: A major storyline from the Manchester derby was the exclusion of Marcus Rashford, whose future with the club is once again in question. Rashford himself told the media he might \"look for a new challenge\" this coming transfer window but also admitted he is cracking on in the near future in the hopes of getting some playing time. The EFL Cup could have been just the chance for Ruben Amorim to hand Rashford a start and let him prove he can contribute. However, the England international has been reportedly left out of the squad entirely once again, a strong signal that Rashford's future lies elsewhere. 🚨 Marcus Rashford: “It’s disheartening to be left out of a Derby… but it’s happened, we won the game so let's move on”.“It’s disappointing but I’m also someone as I’ve got older I can deal with setbacks. What to do? Cry about it? Or do my best the next time I’m available”. pic.twitter.com/SHbSf2EOa8 This 2024/25 EFL Cup quarterfinal match kicks off from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Thursday, Dec. 19 at 8 p.m. local time in London, England. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories around the globe: Tottenham have an increasingly lengthy injury list to trouble Ange Postecoglou. Most recently, Destiny Udogie went off injured against Southampton with quad tightness, and while it doesn't sound like he'll miss much time, he misses out tonight. That strains the already depleted defensive depth, with Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero, and Ben Davies all out a few more weeks. Goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario is out through at least February with an ankle injury, while Richarlison remains out with a hamstring problem. Tottenham starting lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Forster (GK) — Porro, Dragusin, Gray, Spence — Sarr, Bissouma — Kulusevski, Maddison, Son — Solanke. Tottenham subs: Whiteman (GK), Austin (GK), Dorrington, Hardy, Reguilon, Olusesi, Bergvall, B. Johnson, Lankshear. Ruben Amorim has dropped Marcus Rashford from the squad amid major speculation over the England international's future but Alejandro Garnacho returns to the bench. Antony gets the call on the front line with Mason Mount again going down injured. Man United starting lineup (3-4-3): Bayindir (GK) — Martinez, Lindelof, Yoro — Dalot, Eriksen, Ugarte, Mazraoui — Antony, Hojlund, Fernandes. Man United subs: Onana (GK), Maguire, Evans, Malacia, Casemiro, Mainoo, Garnacho, Amad Diallo, Zirkzee.

Our centre-forward set us on the way with a smart finish after 15 minutes and after Dejan Kulusevski and Solanke had both netted in the opening 10 minutes of the second half, we looked like we were comfortably on our way to the last four. This was cup football at its dramatic best though and United came storming back, substitutes Joshua Zirkzee and Amad Diallo capitalising on goalkeeping errors to score twice in seven minutes to leave the game in the balance. The drama continued, Heung-Min Son scoring direct from a corner in the 87th minute before Jonny Evans headed home a corner deep into stoppage time to ensure it went right down to the wire, but we held out for a famous victory. Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was electric as the game got underway, both sets of supporters making for a great atmosphere and the match was played at a fierce tempo throughout. We took the lead with the game’s first real opportunity in the 15th minute. A short free-kick was worked to Pedro Porro 20 yards from goal, he took a touch and fizzed an effort forward which Altay Bayindir saved and, to be fair, pushed away from goal, but Solanke was onto it in a flash and drilled a low angled volley in off the near post. That was his fourth in four games against United, two for us and two for Bournemouth. The visitors went close to an equaliser on 22 minutes, ex-Spur Christian Eriksen firing in an effort which Yves Bissouma blocked before sending a free-kick out on the left just over the crossbar, while United were then thankful to Bayindir for a good near-post save from Kulusevski after another short free-kick routine. There was no let-up to the tempo, a really good game to watch and we almost doubled our lead on 33 minutes, Kulusevski nutmegging Victor Lindelof with a ball across the six yard box which Manuel Ugarte nearly turned into his own net and, at the other end, Bruno Fernandes and Rasmus Hojlund both fired well wide as we went into the break with a narrow advantage. But that very quickly became a bigger advantage as we doubled our lead in the 46th minute. Son and James Maddison combined well down our left, the latter sent over a low cross which Lisandro Martinez diverted into the path of Kulusevski and he rammed the ball home. And two soon became three, this time with a beauty from Solanke. Played in with a perfect ball over the top by Djed Spence, he skipped past Martinez, drifted inside Evans and hit a low shot back across goal to beat Bayindir and nestle in the bottom corner. United hit back though, shortly after Zirkzee had their first effort on target in the 62nd minute which Fraser Forster saved with a strong hand to his left. Just a minute later, Forster’s pass out to Radu Dragusin was intercepted by Fernandes and he squared for Zirkzee to tap home from close range. That lifted the visitors and they went close again when Amad’s effort took a slight deflection and just missed the post, however the United substitute had better luck moments later when he closed down Forster and blocked his attempted clearance with the ball cannoning into the net. Momentum was very much with the Red Devils and when Amad fizzed in another drive from 25 yards, Forster made a save with an unconventional boot away, but it did the job. Then, when we needed a shift to turn the game back our way, up stepped Son with a bizarre goal. We won a corner to help relieve the pressure but there was no suggestion of taking it short, instead the skipper whipped in a deep curling cross which evaded Bayindir’s attempted punched clearance and ended up in the back of the net.Back came United though, Evans glancing home a corner five minutes into stoppage time to keep the game at boiling point, however we saw out the final seconds and secured a place in the last four.

                "content": "The EFL Cup, often referred to as the League Cup and currently known as the Carabao Cup for sponsorship reasons, is an annual knockout competition in men's domestic football in England. Organised by the English Football League (EFL), it is open to any club within the top four levels of the English football league system—92 clubs in total—comprising the top-level Premier League, and the three divisions of the English Football League's own league competition (Championship, League One and League Two). First held in 1960–61 as the Football League Cup, it is one of the three top-tier domestic football competitions in England alongside the Premier League and FA Cup. It concludes in late-February, long before the other two major competitions, which end in May. It was introduced by the league as a response to the increasing popularity of European football, and to also exert power over the FA. It also took advantage of the roll-out of floodlights, allowing the fixtures to be played as midweek evening games. With the renaming of the Football League as the English Football League in 2016, the tournament was rebranded as the EFL Cup from the 2016–17 season onwards. The tournament is played over seven rounds, with single-leg ties throughout, except for the semi-finals. The final is held at Wembley Stadium, which is the only leg in the competition played at a neutral venue and on a weekend (Sunday). The first two rounds are split into North and South sections, and a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds and defers the entry of teams still involved in Europe. Winners not only receive the EFL Cup,[1] of which there have been three designs, the current one also being the original, but also qualify for European football: from 1966–67 until 1971–72 the winners received a place in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, from 1972–1973 until the 2019–20 season in the UEFA Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup) and starting with the 2020–21 season in the UEFA Conference League. Should the winner also qualify for Europe through other means at the end of the season, this place is transferred to the highest-placed Premier League team that has not already qualified for European competition. The most successful club in the competition are current holders Liverpool, who defeated Chelsea 1–0 in the 2024 final to win their tenth League Cup. Although the League Cup is one of the four domestic trophies attainable by English league teams, it is regarded as of lower prestige than the league title or the FA Cup.[2] League Cup winners receive £100,000 prize money (awarded by the Football League) with the runners-up receiving £50,000, considered relatively insignificant to top-flight teams, compared to the £2 million prize money of the FA Cup, which is in turn eclipsed by the Premier League's television money (awarded on final league position) and consequent participation in the Champions League.[3][4] Some clubs have repeatedly fielded a weaker side in the competition, making the opportunity for giant-killing of the larger clubs more likely. Many teams in the Premier League, Arsenal and Manchester United in particular, have used the competition to give young players valuable big-game experience.[5] Consequently, it began to be described sarcastically by many fans as the \"Mickey Mouse cup\". However, in 2010, in response to Arsène Wenger's claim that a League Cup win would not end his trophy drought, Alex Ferguson described the trophy as worth winning. After a period of decline when the competition's future was regularly questioned, recent years have seen a revival in respect for the trophy, as the larger Premier League clubs have come to dominate the competition again, and the development nature of the competition has begun to be viewed as a positive for the clubs involved. Premier League giants Manchester City (6), Manchester United (5), Liverpool (5) and Chelsea (3) between them won 19 editions of the tournament between 2001 and 2024.[6] The original idea for a League Cup came from Stanley Rous, who saw the competition as a consolation for clubs who had already been knocked out of the FA Cup. However, it was not Rous who came to implement it, but Football League Secretary Alan Hardaker. Hardaker initially proposed the competition as a way for the clubs to make up for lost revenue due to a reduction in matches played, for when the league was to be reorganised. The reorganisation of the league was not immediately forthcoming; however, the cup competition was introduced regardless. The trophy was paid for personally by Football League President Joe Richards, who was proud of the competition, and he had his own name engraved on it. Richards described the competition's formation as an \"interim step\" on the way to the league's re-organisation.[7] Richards' priority was the reorganisation of the leagues, \"perhaps by cutting down the number of clubs in each division, as has already been suggested, and even given more consideration to the system of four up and four down\". Hardaker felt that the Football League needed to adapt to the times, as the English game was losing prestige. He felt that the Football League should take the lead in revitalising football in the nation: \"It must be obvious to all of you that the time has come to do something, and it is up to the Football League to give the lead. I hope the Press will not immediately assume that the League is going to fall out with the F.A. or anybody else... the time has come for our voice to be heard in every problem which affects the professional game.\"[7] The League Cup competition was established at a time when match-day attendances were dwindling. The league had lost a million spectators compared to the previous season. It was established at a time when tensions between the Football League and The Football Association were high. The biggest disagreement was about how revenue was shared between the clubs. During the late 1950s, the majority of senior English clubs equipped their grounds with floodlights. This opened up the opportunity to exploit weekday evenings throughout the winter. The League Cup was introduced in the 1960–61 season specifically as a mid-week floodlit tournament to replace the Southern Professional Floodlit Cup.[8] The League Cup was criticised by the better-endowed clubs. The Times' correspondent at the time felt that the League Cup was a step in the wrong direction; the European Cup had been formed five years prior to the League Cup and the correspondent felt the League Cup's introduction was adding to existing problems. The Times published on 30 May 1960: \"Where a drastic reduction is required in an attempt to raise quality, no doubt quantity and a further spread of mediocrity will be the dose. Where men like Count Bernabeu with his wider horizons, think in terms of a European League for the future in which a lead could surely now be given jointly by our leaders, the Football League propose next season to implement their useless Football League Cup to be played in midweek. It gets the players, the clubs and the public nowhere.\"[9] Aston Villa were the inaugural winners in 1960–61, defeating Rotherham United 3–2 in the final over two legs. Football in England was considered to be of a low quality, compared to what was being played on the continent, as relatively unfashionable clubs Burnley and Wolverhampton Wanderers were England's representatives in Europe that year, having lifted the major honours ahead of much bigger clubs like Arsenal and Manchester United. Richards referred to the appetite for European football as 'continental fever'. He was keen for the league to re-establish itself: 'We must be prepared to put the interests of the League and the game before individual clubs.'[10] Sixteen clubs opposed the competition's creation, thirty-one approved it.[10] The average attendance across the League Cup was 10,556, just higher than the average gate in the Third Division.[11] The total attendance of the Football League competition had fallen by 4 million from the previous season. Richards is reputed to have told Hardaker that he foresaw 'the League Cup final being held at Wembley, but that it wouldn't be during his lifetime'. The first League Cup final to be held at Wembley was Third Division Queens Park Rangers's win over First Division West Bromwich Albion on 4 March 1967. Richards died in 1968. The first League Cup was won in 1960–61 by Aston Villa who, at the time, held the overall record for major trophies won in England.[citation needed] The next three finals, however, saw the trophy won by clubs who had never won a major trophy before. One of them, Norwich City, had yet to even play in the First Division, while their opponents Rochdale had played no higher than the Third Division.[12] The introduction of the League Cup gave the Football League more negotiating power with the FA and UEFA. Hardaker threatened UEFA with a boycott of the UEFA Cup, unless UEFA gave the League Cup winner European qualification. As a result of the negotiating tactics, UEFA provided the League Cup winner with a place in the European competitions, providing the team was in the first division. Tottenham Hotspur were the first team to qualify for Europe by virtue of winning the competition. Although Leeds United had won the competition before Tottenham, Leeds qualified for Europe based on league position. The winners of the 1966–67 and 1968–69 editions, Queen's Park Rangers and Swindon Town did not participate in Europe, as they were not in the First Division.[13] Prior to the agreement with UEFA, the competition was not considered worthy of the larger clubs' attention. However, once a position in Europe was on offer, as was a final at Wembley Stadium, the competition's standing was improved and in the 1968–69 season only Manchester United declined to participate.[14] Everton chose not to compete in 1970–71 so that they could concentrate their efforts on the European Cup. Entry was made compulsory for all Football League teams the following year. Liverpool have won the cup on the most occasions with ten victories, and both they and Manchester City have won four League Cups in successive years. Liverpool completed two trebles of trophy wins, in 1983–84 and 2000–01, winning the League Cup in both of these years.[15][16] English clubs lost their place in European competitions for an indefinite period in 1985 as a result of the Heysel disaster, where Liverpool fans had taken part in a riot at the European Cup final, resulting in the death of 39 spectators. That year's winners of the League Cup were Norwich City, who would otherwise have played in a European competition for the first time in the 1985–86 season. Oxford United, Arsenal, Luton Town and Nottingham Forest also missed out on the chance to compete in the UEFA Cup as League Cup holders over the next four years. Even when the ban was lifted in 1990, League Cup winners did not participate in European competitions for two more years, when Manchester United won the trophy and qualified for the UEFA Cup anyway, as they had finished second in the league. In the previous two seasons, Nottingham Forest and Sheffield Wednesday had both been prevented from competing in the UEFA Cup as League Cup winners, due to the gradual reintegration of English clubs in European competitions. In 2016–17, the competition was renamed the EFL Cup as part of the Football League's rebranding to become the English Football League. In the early 21st century, following restructuring of European football, particularly of its international club competitions, the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Conference League, there were considerations of removing the prize of European qualification from the League Cup's winners. England and France are the only UEFA members to offer a European berth to the winners of their second cup competitions until 2020, when Coupe de la Ligue was suspended indefinitely, meaning England is the only UEFA member to do so.[17] This has allowed the League Cup to retain popularity, especially with fans of clubs for whom success in cup competitions offers their only realistic chance of qualifying for Europe.[18][19] Giant-killings are less well remembered in the League Cup than in the FA Cup due to the absence of non-league sides and the fact that big clubs often field more inexperienced sides in the early rounds.[citation needed] However, there have been some notable upsets, the final of 1966–67 saw Division Three side Queens Park Rangers come from 2–0 down at half time to win 3–2 against top-flight West Bromwich Albion in the first League Cup Final to be hosted at Wembley Stadium. Two years later in 1968–69, Third Division side Swindon Town beat Arsenal 3–1 after extra time in the final to win the trophy. In 1974–75, Fourth Division side Chester beating defending league champions Leeds United 3–0 on their surprise run to the semi-finals. Former League club and now defunct Scarborough defeated Chelsea 4–3 on aggregate in October 1989, while a Fourth Division club. In 1992–93, Scarborough then defeated Coventry City (then a top-tier side) 3–2 on aggregate, before ultimately going out of the competition, narrowly, 1–0, against Arsenal. In 1995–96, Manchester United were beaten 3–0 at home by York City in the second round, first leg; United could only win 3–1 in the second leg and went out 4–3 on aggregate (York went on to repeat the achievement against Everton the following year). United went on to win the FA Premier League and FA Cup double and did not lose another home game that season, while York narrowly avoided relegation to Division Three (fourth tier). Grimsby Town recorded a number of upsets over a nine-year stretch; whilst playing in the third tier in 1997–98 they defeated Premier League side Sheffield Wednesday 4–3 on aggregate over both legs before knocking out fellow Premier League side (and League Cup holders) Leicester City 3–1. In 2001–02 they beat current holders Liverpool at Anfield with a 2–1 win in extra time. Four years later they recorded another giant killing by defeating Tottenham Hotspur 1–0 at home, by this time Grimsby were playing in the fourth tier. Manchester United have also been knocked out by Southend United and Coventry City in 2006–07 and 2007–08 respectively: in the match against Southend they fielded a strong side with 10 internationals, bucking a trend they had themselves started during the 1990s.[20] In the 2014–15 season, Manchester United fielded five international players but lost 4–0 in the second round (in which they entered the tournament) against third-tier side MK Dons.[21] In 2010, Liverpool were humbled again by Northampton Town, one of the lowest placed teams in League Two. In the 2012–13 competition, League Two (fourth tier) side Bradford City eliminated three Premier League sides from the competition, becoming the lowest-ranked team to do so since Rochdale in 1961–62. However, their luck finally ran out in the final, where they were beaten by Swansea City. In their centenary year, Swansea became the first team from outside England to win the League Cup on 24 February 2013, when they beat Bradford City 5–0 to win their first major English trophy. In the 2022–23 competition, Gillingham (then ranked 22nd in League Two) eliminated Brentford (then ranked 11th in the Premier League) in the third round on penalties; the teams were 79 places apart in the English football league system.[22][23] The League Cup is open to all 92 members of the Premier League and English Football League and is divided into seven rounds, organised so that 32 teams remain by the third round (with the exception of the 1961–62 competition).[24] The fixtures in every round except the final are determined by a random draw. Since 1996–97, teams involved in European competition during the season have received a bye to the third round; the remaining Premier League teams enter at the second round, and the remaining Football League teams enter at the first round.[24] If the number of byes causes an odd number of teams to enter a round, another team may be given a bye (usually the highest-placed team of those relegated from the Premier League the previous season) or a preliminary round may be played between the two teams promoted from the Football Conference the previous season (or, if only one team is promoted, that team would play against the lowest-placed team not to be relegated from the Football League the previous season); preliminary rounds have only been necessary in the 2002–03 and 2011–12 competitions.[24][25] Up to 1995–96, all teams were involved by the second round, although some received byes to that stage.[24] Matches in all rounds are single-legged, except for the semi-finals, which have been two-legged since the competition began.[24] The final was two-legged from 1961 to 1966, but has been single-legged ever since.[24] The first round was two-legged from 1975–76 to 2000–01, and the second round was two-legged from 1979–80 to 2000–01.[24] Single-legged matches would be replayed as necessary until 1993–94, when penalties were introduced to settle the first replay; the last single-legged tie to require a replay was played in 1996–97. Until 1974–75, two-legged ties that remained level after extra time in the second leg would be replayed; in that time, three ties reached a third replay.[24] Between 1975–76 and 1979–80, ties would still be replayed, but a penalty shoot-out would be used to settle ties that could not be decided after a replay; replays of two-legged matches were finally abolished for 1980–81, with the away goals rule and penalties being adopted instead.[24] The semi-finals were the exception to this, with level ties being replayed until 1986–87, after which the away goals rule and penalties were introduced.[24] The semi-finals, when played over two legs, would apply the away goals rule only after extra time.[26][failed verification] From 2018–19, extra time was scrapped for all rounds except the final, and the away goal rule was scrapped for the semi-final, with level ties going straight to a penalty shoot-out.[27][28] For the first six seasons of the Football League Cup, the final was played over two legs, one at the home ground of each finalist. Since 1967, the final has been played as a single match at Wembley Stadium, although the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was used between 2001 and 2007, following the demolition of the old Wembley. Between 1967 and 1997, finals that finished level after extra time were replayed at an alternative venue until a winner was decided.[24] The only final to require two replays was the 1977 final between Aston Villa and Everton.[24] The venues that hosted replays were Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, Old Trafford and Maine Road in Manchester and Villa Park in Birmingham. Since 1998, finals that have finished level after extra time have been decided by penalty shoot-out.[24] Until 1999–2000, the final was played in late March or early April. Thereafter it has been played in late February or early March. Since 1989–90, the best player in the League Cup final has been presented with the Alan Hardaker Trophy, named after Alan Hardaker, the former secretary of the Football League who devised the Football League Cup. John Terry, Ben Foster, Vincent Kompany and Virgil van Dijk are the only players to win the award more than once.[29] From 1981 to the present (except from 1960 to 1981 and in 2016–17), the League Cup has attracted title sponsorship, which meant, unlike its older sibling the FA Cup, the League Cup was named after its sponsor, giving it the following names: The winners receive the EFL Cup,[1] of which there have been three designs – the current one also being the original, a three-handled Georgian-style urn with a separate plinth (added later). Designed and manufactured by Mappin & Webb, it weighs 2.976 kg and measures 27 cm by 20.5 cm. It is worth around £20,000.[1] It was used until the 1980–81 competition, before coming back into use ever since the 1990–91 competition.[36] The reason for the break in usage was the introduction of the first competition sponsor – the Milk Marketing Board, who chose to award their own trophy from 1981–82 to 1985–86.[37] The next sponsor, Littlewoods, also chose to award their own trophy, from 1986–87 until 1989–90.[38] Later sponsors have used the original. In the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, 15 matches will be broadcast live by Sky Sports through 2024[39] with highlights from the several matches on ITV Sport beginning in 2022/23.[40] This competition is included in the EFL broadcast package. From 2024/25, all matches will be broadcast live by Sky Sports. As of 2024[update]:",
