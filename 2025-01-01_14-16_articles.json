(6) Penn State outlasted a strong upset attempt from (3) Boise State to win the 2024 Fiesta Bowl 31-14 and move onto the semifinals of the College Football Playoff. Running back Nick Singleton broke off a 58-yard touchdown run and tight end Tyler Warren added a pair of touchdown catches to give the Nittany Lions a monster victory and keep the program undefeated (8-0 all time) in the bowl game. The Nittany Lions focused on Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty and held him to only 3.5 yards per carry, though he did finish with 104 hard-fought yards. Jeanty ends the year with 2,601 yards rushing -- 28 behind the single-season record of 2,628 set by Barry Sanders. With Jeanty somewhat limited, Boise State quarterback Maddux Madsen stepped up and threw for 304 yards and a 53-yard tight end touchdown to Matt Lauter. Ultimately, though, two missed field goals from star kicker Jonah Dalmus kept the score from getting closer than arm's reach. Madsen also threw for three interceptions, matching his season total, though two came with the game out of hand. While Penn State stayed ahead, the Nittany Lions played an inconsistent offensive game. At one point, quarterback Drew Allar missed seven consecutive passes as offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki opted not to lean on the successful running game. However, Allar did have a few beauties, including a 38-yard bomb to Omari Evans in the back of the end zone. He also connected with Warren for an 11-yard beauty that was perfectly thrown. With the win, Penn State now advances to the Orange Bowl where the Nittany Lions await the winner of Notre Dame vs. Georgia, which will take place at the Sugar Bowl on Wednesday. CBS Sports was here throughout the evening with updates, highlights and analysis. Read on below for more takeaways from Penn State's victory over Boise State. The Nittany Lions pulled away and won the game, but some head-scratching decisions kept it close far longer than it needed to be. Penn State's Andy Kotelnicki has been perhaps the best offensive coordinator hire of the 2024 season a key reason why the Nittany Lions are the first to advance to the final four. However, his abandoning of the run triggered a run of four punts and a field goal in the middle portion of the game to let Boise State back in. Quarterback Drew Allar had some great moments and flashed his NFL arm talent at times and Kotelnicki was right to take some shots against an inconsistent Boise State secondary. At the same time, Kaytron Allen ran the ball for nearly eight yards per carry. The running backs touched the ball only 29 times to Allar's 25 pass attempts, which also engaged the fearsome Boise State passing attack. Penn State was lucky to get relatively overmatched opponents in Boise State and SMU in the first two rounds. That changes in the Orange Bowl. The messiness has to get cleaned up. That extends to penalties too -- the Nittany Lions gave Boise State 10 penalties for 98 yards. Penn State's offense wasn't at its best all night, but monster efforts from running back Kaytron Allen and tight end Tyler Warren ultimately proved to be the difference. Allen was the best individual player in the game with 134 yards and the offense flourished seemingly every time he touched the football. At times, quarterback Drew Allar focused in on tight end Tyler Warren, but the Mackey Award winner lived up to the hype with six catches for 63 yards and two touchdowns. The Nittany Lions have had moments of brilliance from playmakers, but Penn State's 2024 roster features perhaps the most comprehensive collection that James Franklin has ever put together. Penn State needs Omari Evans and Harrison Wallace III to keep making strides, but Allar's arm seems to be in a strong place. Penn State keyed in tight on Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty and tried to ensure that he would not be the reason the Nittany Lions lost. PSU boasted a top-10 rushing defense nationally and allowed only one 100-yard rusher heading into the Fiesta Bowl. Jeanty ultimately cleared 104 yards, but it took 30 carries and was not enough to reach Barry Sanders' record for rushing yards in a season. Jeanty's 104 yards gave him 2,601 yards rushing on the season, passing Wisconsin's Melvin Gordon for the second-most in NCAA history. He finished only 27 yards shy of the 2,628 yards Sanders accumulated for Oklahoma State in 1988. Still, his season will go down in the history books, especially combined with leading Boise State's first College Football Playoff team. The Frisco, Texas, native did not need to return to Boise State and had major offers in the portal. Even in loss, Jeanty etched his name in the history books. Penn State outlasted a strong upset attempt from Boise State to win the 2024 Fiesta Bowl and move onto the semifinals of the College Football Playoff. Running back Nick Singleton broke off a 58-yard touchdown run and tight end Tyler Warren added a pair of touchdown catches to give the Nittany Lions a monster victory and keep the program undefeated (8-0 all time) in the bowl game. The Nittany Lions focused on Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty and held him to only 3.5 yards per carry, though he did finish with 104 hard-fought yards. Jeanty ends the year with 2,601 yards rushing -- 28 behind the single-season record of 2,628 set by Barry Sanders. With Jeanty somewhat limited, Boise State quarterback Maddux Madsen stepped up and threw for 304 yards and a 53-yard tight end touchdown to Matt Lauter. Ultimately, though, two missed field goals from star kicker Jonah Dalmus kept the score from getting closer than arm's reach. Madsen also threw for three interceptions, matching his season total, though two came with the game out of hand. While Penn State stayed ahead, the Nittany Lions played an inconsistent offensive game. At one point, quarterback Drew Allar missed seven consecutive passes as offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki opted not to lean on the successful running game. However, Allar did have a few beauties, including a 38-yard bomb to Omari Evans in the back of the end zone. He also connected with Warren for an 11-yard beauty that was perfectly thrown. With the win, Penn State now advances to the Orange Bowl where the Nittany Lions await the winner of Notre Dame vs. Georgia, which will take place at the Sugar Bowl on Wednesday. Not that there was much hope left for Boise State after Nick Singleton's long touchdown run, but Penn State's defense just squashed any remaining cinders of optimism with a big defensive play. Needing to make magic happen, Boise State went for it on fourth-and-12 from its own 24-yard line. Nittany Lions defensive back Zion Tracy stuck hip-to-hip with his receiver and was rewarded with an interception when Boise State quarterback Maddux Madsen threw his way. That will just about do it. Penn State running back Nick Singleton has been an afterthought for most of the game. But facing a bleed-it-out final drive, Singleton hit the nitro and broke off a 58-yard touchdown run that should ice the Fiesta Bowl and give James Franklin his fourth major bowl game victory. The Nittany Lions are up to 212 yards rushing and a touchdown as the game clears a 10-point lead for the first time since 14-0 in the first quarter. Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty has largely been stifled, but on third-and-21, Jeanty broke off a 26-yard run to extend the drive and bring the Broncos back into play. He later added another 10-yard run. Jeanty is up to 24 carries for 96 yards and is still within distance of the 132 yards needed for Barry Sanders' record. After the 55-yard drive, Boise State missed a 38-yard field goal that would have made the game a one-score game. Instead, the lead remains 10 points in the fourth quarter. Boise State is running out of time. Boise State quarterback Maddux Madsen has thrown only three interceptions this season and been one of the cleanest passers in college football. However, on third-and-25, Madsen forced a pass that was picked off by safety Zakee Wheatley for a game-changing turnover. Dani Dennis-Sutton had a late cheap shot against Ashton Jeanty to push field position back, but Penn State will now have a chance to put away the game. Penn State remains in control entering the third quarter of the Fiesta Bowl against Boise State. Nittany Lions running back Kaytron Allen has been the star of the game with 112 yards on only 13 carries, but tight end Tyler Warren's two touchdowns have been the difference. With running back Ashton Jeanty bottled up, quarterback Maddux Madsen has been exceptional. The sophomore completed 17 of 21 passes for 223 yards and a touchdown with 96 yards going to Matt Lauter, who caught a 53-yard touchdown on a coverage bust to change the game. Jeanty has fumbled twice, losing one, and rushed for only 59 yards on 20 carries in a frustrating performance. Boise State has the ball at the Penn State 35-yard line with a chance to put more points on the board, but will have to escape from behind the chains. With his touchdown catch against Boise State, Penn State tight end Tyler Warren set a program record with his 98th catch of the season. The performance passes Allen Robinson's 97 receptions set in 2013. Warren has six catches for 63 yards and two touchdowns against the Broncos. Penn State quarterback Drew Allar missed on seven straight passes, but tight end Tyler Warren went to work to get him back on track. Facing third-and-11, Allar threw a wild jump ball to Warren that the latter brought down over a lengthy Boise State defender for a touchdown. The TD is the first for Penn State since the second drive of the game and helps push the lead out to two scores. Boise State came out for the second half locked in, especially behind quarterback Maddex Madsen. Despite committing a pair of false starts, Madsen found Matt Lauter for a 53-yard touchdown on a blown coverage caused by a play action to Ashton Jeanty. Even though Jeanty has been bottled up, Boise State offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter has found plenty of creative ways to have him impact the game. Penn State defensive lineman Abdul Carter remains on the sideline without his helmet as the Nittany Lions enter the second half. Carter was a massive part of PSU's win over SMU, but the Boise State offense has come to life without Carter in the lineup. It's unclear if he can return. The Nittany Lions got the ball out of halftime but went three-and-out after a pair of incompletions from Drew Allar, including a drop by tight end Tyler Warren. Allar has now missed on six straight passes as Penn State's only score drive in the second quarter was set up by a pass interference. Boise State must take advantage and score points to give themselves a chance. Penn State holds a comfortable halftime lead against Boise State after 30 minutes in the Fiesta Bowl. The Nittany Lions took a two-touchdown lead after two drives behind a pair of touchdown passes by Drew Allar, including a 38-yard bomb to Omari Evans, but Penn State was forced to punt three consecutive times to let Boise State get back in the game. The Nittany Lions appeared to get stopped on fourth down in the final minute of the second quarter, but a pass interference call helped set up a field goal for Penn State to push the lead out to two scores. They get the ball to start the second half. Allar completed 10 of 17 passes for 144 yards and two touchdowns. Running back Kaytron Allen added 76 yards on the ground. Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty has been shaky and fumbled twice, losing one, after fumbling just twice on the season. However, a solid punt return from Cooper Jones helped set up a 52-yard touchdown drive capped off by a fullback dive from Tyler Crowe that bowled over for eight yards. Jeanty has 13 carries for 39 yards at the half, along with 23 yards receiving. He'll need to triple that rushing output in the second half to eclipse Barry Sanders' single-season rushing record. In his stead, quarterback Maddux Madsen threw for 99 yards. Boise State was one of the top pass rushing teams in college football and joined Ole Miss as the only teams to clear 50 sacks. Late in the second quarter, top defender Ahmed Hassanein finally got home on Penn State quarterback Drew Allar and forced the first sack of the game to cause a punt. The momentum has quietly and quickly shifted. Boise State is suddenly back in. Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty was pulled from the game momentarily after dropping another fumble, recovered by the offense, but the Broncos were undeterred. Boise State motioned Jeanty to the flat as a receiver to move the Penn State defense and clear the way for fullback Tyler Crowe to bowl over eight yards into the end zone for the first Boise State points of the game. The Broncos have slowly started to find some success with Jeanty getting outside as both a receiver and decoy. Penn State defensive lineman Abdul Carter went to the injury tent holding his arm in the second quarter. Carter went back in, but had to leave the game again. The junior is one of the top defenders in college football with 22 tackles for loss and 11 sacks. He already forced a holding call in the game. Penn State took a major lead in the first quarter thanks to a pair of absolute dimes from quarterback Drew Allar. The junior hit Omari Evans for a rainbow 38-yard touchdown and found Tyler Warren for another 11-yard score to push the lead to 14-0 before Boise State ever got its composure. The Broncos traveled 47 yards on their first drive, but a whiffed 45-yard field goal kept Boise State scoreless after one quarter. Star running back Ashton Jeanty has only 20 yards on eight carries, with 12 yards coming on one carry. He also lost only his third fumble of the season against a physical Penn State defense. Allar has 75 yards and two touchdowns after one quarter. Boise State quarterback Maddux Madsen has 62 yards of his own with five passes completed to five different pass-catchers. Penn State has also run for 6.9 yards per carry. Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty only lost two fumbles during the entire 2024 season, but Penn State forced a wild swinging drop that was recovered by the Nittany Lions. However, Boise State got a huge break when Drew Allar lost the ball at the mesh point and it was recovered again. There's a huge opportunity ahead for the Broncos. Penn State quarterback Drew Allar has only thrown four passes -- one of which was a throwaway -- and he already has two of the best dimes of his season. On the Nittany Lions' second drive, Allar launched an absolute bomb that went 38 yards for a touchdown in the end zone. Boise State's passing defense is likely its weakest unit, and Allar has quickly exposed it. Penn State was inconsistent running the ball against SMU, but the job has been much easier against Boise State. The Nittany Lions leaned on running backs Nick Singleton and Kaytron Allen for easy yards, exploding for 55 yards on only six carries to set up an 11-yard touchdown pass from Drew Allar to Tyler Warren. Penn State averaged eight yards per carry on that drive despite primarily running the ball. Boise State defensive coordinator Erik Chinander will have to come up with more answers because the Broncos are getting blasted while playing head-up. Penn State is selling out to stop running back Ashton Jeanty, as expected, and offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter is happy to take advantage. Against heavy boxes, quarterback Maddux Madsen has completed all three of his passes attempts for 36 yards to get the Broncos deep into scoring possession. However, Boise State kicker Jonah Dalmus completely whiffed on a 45-yard field goal attempt and wasted a 47-yard drive that bled more than four minutes off the clock. Jeanty has been held to only four yards on three rushing attempts, along with a five-yard reception. Penn State won the toss and opted to defer, giving Boise State the first opportunity to get on the board. Star running back Ashton Jeanty has been exceptional early in games, averaging 8.6 yards per carry in first quarters. Penn State is the best rushing defense Boise State has played, but the Broncos opened with a field goal drive against No. 1 Oregon in their near-upset. The Boise State Broncos are clear underdogs in Friday's College Football Playoff Quartefinal at the Fiesta Bowl. Not many people are picking Boise State to upset Penn State, but one rhino at the Phoenix Zoo is standing with the Broncos. College Football Playoff: Watch as Phoenix Zoo rhino picks Boise State to upset Penn State in Fiesta Bowl Penn State was able to take advantage of miscues from SMU, but the Broncos rarely make mistakes. In fact, Boise State is tied for No. 2 nationally in turnovers lost with only four fumbles and four interceptions. Even the steady Nittany Lions had 13 turnovers. Ultimately, it means the game will stay closer than expected for four quarters. Pick: Boise State +11 Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty finished as the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy and is on track to set the all-time rushing record set by Barry Sanders in 1988. Jeanty needs only 131 yards against Penn State to set the mark.

PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. — It was April 7, 2023, when quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer got an offer from Indiana and head coach Tom Allen. 13 days later, Penn State did the same and offered the star from Olentangy High School in Lewis Center, Ohio. When people think about Boise State, the focus is always on running back Ashton Jeanty, who has run for 2,497 yards and 29 touchdowns. Penn State has travelled from Happy Valley to the Valley of the Sun to take on Boise State in the Fiesta Bowl. Penn State is set to tango with Boise State in the 2024 Fiesta Bowl on Tuesday, looking to ring in the new year with a win. Tom Allen was the special teams coordinator and linebackers coach for Ole Miss from 2012-2014. During the final two years, he watched from the sidelines as the Rebels clashed with Alabama and running back Derrick Henry. When Penn State defensive coordinator Tom Allen sat down to meet with the media, he was immediately asked two questions about Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty. One year ago, a dejected Drew Allar sat in front of the media following a Peach Bowl loss to Ole Miss and laid intentions on growing as a vocal leader. After Penn State rushed for 189 yards on one of the best run defenses in the country against SMU, Nick Singleton said he and fellow running back Kaytron Allen are “the best backfield in the nation.” Their quarterback, Drew Allar, agreed. Offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki expressed his gratitude for still playing this deep into the year when he met with the media ahead of Penn State’s Fiesta Bowl matchup against Boise State. With a dominant victory over SMU last Saturday, Penn State secured its eighth Fiesta Bowl appearance in program history. With a dominant victory over SMU last Saturday, Penn State secured its eighth Fiesta Bowl appearance in program history. A former member of the Penn State secondary has been released from his NFL squad with two weeks remaining in the 2024 season. While Penn State was dominating SMU in the first round of the College Football Playoff, some of its alumni in the NFL were doing the same to their opponents. James Franklin has received some national recognition with just a week until Penn State plays in the Fiesta Bowl. A holiday gift has arrived in a position of need for Penn State. A key piece of Penn State's safety room is coming back for another year. Defensive tackle Dvon J-Thomas swapped his helmet for a Fiesta Bowl hat and sauntered toward the tunnel after Penn State defeated SMU 38-10 on Saturday. With the victory bell and cheers as ambience, J-Thomas slowed his pace, fixed his head to the student section and howled. In its first round College Football Playoff matchup against SMU, Penn State came out victorious. But now its attention is set on the Fiesta Bowl, where the Nittany Lions will face Boise State. After a sudden departure before the first round of the College Football Playoffs, a former Penn State gunslinger has found a new home. Down just seven points to Penn State and driving, SMU quarterback Kevin Jennings pressed his hands as hard as he could to the side of his helmet in order to hear his offensive coordinator Casey Woods, sporting a confused look on his face.

                "title": "Michigan holds off Alabama in 2024 ReliaQuest Bowl as sloppy performance dooms Jalen Milroe, Crimson Tide - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Michigan earned a huge 19-13 win against No. 11 Alabama in the ReliaQuest Bowl on Tuesday. The shorthanded Wolverines, who were down several key players due to both opt outs and the transfer portal, led wire-to-wire after taking advantage of numerous Alabama mistakes in the first quarter. The Crimson Tide turned the ball over three times -- and had their first offensive drive end with a failed fourth-down conversion -- in the first 15 minutes. That means for its first four possessions Michigan's average starting position was Alabama's 21-yard line. The Wolverines took advantage, even if they left some points on the board. Three of Michigan's first four drives ended in a field goal from kicker Dominic Zvada, two of which came from 30 yards or less. Quarterback Davis Warren, who later exited the game with an apparent leg injury, did hit wide receiver Fredrick Moore for a 13-yard touchdown and Michigan left the first quarter with a 16-0 lead it never surrendered. Alabama had 2 total yards of offense until late in the second quarter when it went on two drives that covered a combined 161 yards and resulted in 10 points. It wasn't enough to spark a full comeback, however. The Crimson Tide actually had a chance to win it late in the fourth quarter. One possession after kicker Graham Nicholson hit a season-long 51-yard field goal which cut Michigan's lead to one possession, Alabama got the ball all the way to Michigan's 15-yard line. But on fourth-and-10, Milroe came under immediate pressure and threw an incomplete pass, which allowed Michigan to take possession and kneel the clock out on a momentum-building bowl victory. That was a common theme for the Wolverines through 2024, especially in their last two wins against Ohio State and Alabama. Michigan didn't play a great game on offense. In fact, after the first quarter, it was largely ineffective. But it did do enough to put the game away. Michigan's shorthanded defense definitely deserves a ton of credit, as the Wolverines held Alabama scoreless for almost three entire quarters, which allowed the offense to sit on their early 16-0 lead. Michigan did employ a smart ball-control strategy to limit Alabama's possessions and, thus, its explosive potential on offense. The Wolverines gained just 32 yards in the third quarter, but they held onto the football for a whopping 10:52 seconds. That took the air out of Alabama's late first-half surge, when it scored 10 unanswered points to cut Michigan's lead to 16-10. Michigan won the time of possession battle by almost 17 minutes, with a lot of its advantage created in that third quarter. That kept the defense fresh and it limited Alabama's window to mount a comeback. Michigan's modern run of success has been keyed, largely, by excellent running back play. The Wolverines have had star players like Blake Corum, Donovan Edwards and Kalel Mullings lead their offense while gashing opposing defenses on the ground. They may have found the next great one in freshman running back Jordan Marshall. Marshall was thrust into a starting role after Mullings and Edwards opted out and he responded with a strong performance, especially after Michigan lost starting quarterback Davis Warren to injury. Marshall carried the ball 23 times for 100 yards, averaging just over four yards per carry against a strong Alabama defense. He had a key 24-yard run early in the fourth quarter, bouncing off of Alabama defenders in the process, to set up Dominic Zvada's decisive 37-yard field goal. Not bad for a true freshman making his first career start. Marshall certainly provided Michigan fans with some optimism about the future of the Wolverines' offense, especially with players like five-star quarterback Bryce Underwood joining the fold moving forward. Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe still has yet to make a decision on his future. Before Tuesday's bowl game, he was considered an intriguing NFL Draft prospect with plenty of untapped upside and physical traits that would make him a desirable option for front offices, likely in the middle rounds. Now his stock is up in the air. Milroe definitely had his moments in the ReliaQuest Bowl. He had one 41-yard run where he flashed his athleticism and weaved around Michigan defenders to set up Alabama's second scoring drive. He had nice throws of 25 yards to tight end Robbie Ouzts for Alabama's first touchdown of the game, and a deep 40-yard completion to wide receiver Germie Bernard near the end of the second quarter. But, overall, he was largely ineffective. He turned the ball over three times in the first quarter alone. One of those was on a botched snap, and the other was an interception after he mistimed a shallow out route. Milroe also had multiple misses on passes at every level of the field. His pocket awareness was concerning, as he struggled to sense pressure and often held onto the ball for too long. There's a good chance that Milroe still gets drafted if he declares, especially since he's one of the most physically gifted quarterbacks in college football. His lackluster bowl performance left a sour last impression on scouts, though. Or, at the very least, take a late lead. Michigan was gifted a first down thanks to an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Alabama linebacker Justin Jefferson, but the Wolverines weren't able to do much more with the free yardage. The Crimson Tide defense, which has been great all day, forced a punt that Alabama's Ryan Williams returned 38 yards to give his team possession on Alabama's 44-yard line. Prime scoring opportunity, though the Tide need a touchdown at this point. We've got some clutch kicking in the ReliaQuest Bowl. Alabama stalled at Michigan's 33-yard line during a crucial drive. Instead of going for it on fourth-and-10, the Crimson Tide sent kicker Graham Nicholson out. He hit his second field goal of the day and set his season high with a 51-yard boot. It had enough power behind it to split the uprights from even further out. Alabama's hanging around. Dominic Zvada, still one of the most important players in college football. It's rare that a college kicker is so reliable, but he has now hit on all four of his field goal attempts in the ReliaQuest Bowl. His latest, from 37 yards out, was the biggest, as it expanded Michigan's lead back to two possessions with 7:21 left to play. Michigan leaned on running back Jordan Marshall, who carried the ball five times, to get into scoring range. He had a nice 24-yard run that moved the ball into Alabama territory. Alabama, which has scoring drives of 71 and 90 yards, was unable to capitalize on its best starting field position of the game after a Zabien Brown interception handed Alabama the ball on the 50-yard line. Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe almost threw an interception on third-and-7. The Crimson Tide still went for it, and Milroe was late on a pass to Jaylen Mbakwe, who caught the ball out of bounds. Michigan stills holds a narrow lead after three quarters of play. Five drives ended without any points in the third quarter. Four of those resulted in punts, while the fifth was cut short when Michigan quarterback Alex Orji threw an interception to Alabama defensive back Zabien Brown. The biggest news coming out of the third quarter was the fact that Michigan starting quarterback Davis Warren was taken to the locker room with an apparent leg injury. Without Warren, the Wolverines turned to Orji, who hasn't been able to make anything happen on offense. Alabama will start the fourth quarter with a prime opportunity to finally jump into the lead. Brown's interception gave the Tide the ball at the 50-yard line, and a quick 9-yard completion to wide receiver Rico Scott put Alabama in Michigan territory for the first time since the second quarter ended. All 16 of Michigan's points thus far came in the first quarter. Not counting the end of the first half, the Wolverines have punted on five consecutive drives since. They have crossed midfield just once since the first quarter and all four of their first-quarter drives began in plus territory. So that means Michigan's offense has possessed the ball 10 times, but it has made it past the 50-yard line just once. The Wolverines still have yet to gain more than 34 yards in a single drive. Now Alabama is having injury issues of its own. Top linebacker Jihaad Campbell just left the field with an apparent injury after attempting a tackle on Michigan running back Jordan Marshall. He was slow to get up and didn't walk off the field until Alabama's training staff came out to help him. He would be a huge loss fro the Crimson Tide defense, which has played very well today. Michigan's offense is still spinning its wheels after an ineffective drive to open the second half. To make matters worse, starting quarterback Davis Warren appears injured after taking a long sack. Alabama defensive linemen dragged Warren down near the sideline and Warren remained on the turf for a few moments. He initially got up, with the help of teammates, but went back to the ground after taking a few steps. Warren wasn't putting much weight on his right leg, which got bent under him when Smith brough him to the ground. Michigan leads No. 11 Alabama 16-7 at halftime of the ReliaQuest Bowl after the first two quarters felt way more lopsided than the score may indicate. Alabama turned the ball over three times in the first quarter -- and that doesn't include its first drive, which ended in a failed fourth-down conversion -- which gave Michigan three drives that started in the red zone. In spite of that, the Wolverines only found the end zone once in the first half thanks to a 13-yard connection between quarterback Davis Warren and wide receiver Fredrick Moore. Moore, who stepped into a bigger role when Michigan lost its top two receivers entering Tuesday's game, had a nice first half with three catches for 37 yards and the score. Though it took Alabama's offense a long time to find its footing, Michigan's inability to fully capitalize on Alabama's numerous mistakes allowed the Crimson Tide to keep the door open. They captured some late momentum with a four-play, 71-yard drive capped by a 25-yard touchdown connection between quarterback Jalen Milroe and tight end Robbie Ouzts near the end of the second quarter. Prior to that 71-yard scoring drive, Alabama had 2 total yards on offense. The Crimson Tide now enter halftime outgaining Michigan by 54 yards. Michigan's offense needs to figure something out in the second half. The Wolverines, who will receive the kickoff, cannot sit on their lead with Alabama's offense starting to hit its stride. It seemed like Alabama would have been content to run the clock out and enter half time when it gained possession at its own 4-yard line with just 50 seconds left to play and no timeouts. But, on third-and-1, Michigan inexplicably saved some clock for the Crimson Tide by calling a timeout. Then quarterback Jalen Milroe ripped off a 41-yard run, and hit wide receiver Germie Bernard for a gain of 40 yards, which put the Crimson Tide in prime scoring position. Kicker Graham Nicholson eventually ate into Michigan's lead with a 24-yard field goal. It took over 25 minutes, but Alabama's offense finally looks like itself. The Crimson Tide just battled back into this game with an easy 71-yard drive, marching down the field in just four plays to score their first touchdown of the game. Freshman wide receiver Rico Scott got things started with a 28-yard gain on a jet sweep play. Alabama then gained a combined 15 yards on a tight end screen that Josh Cuevas fumbled. Offensive lineman Elijah Pritchett recovered the ball and rumbled for another eight yards. Then, a couple plays later, Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe hit a wide open Robbie Ouzts for a 25-yard touchdown. The only positive thing to say for Alabama's offense thus far is that it has now gone two straight possessions without a turnover. Both of those drives still ended in a punt, though. The Crimson Tide have more turnovers (3) than total yards (2). Their offense totals are being dragged down by their minus 16 yards rushing. Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe has already been sacked three times, and Alabama's running backs have combined for 11 yards on five carries. Milroe, who was responsible for all three turnovers, is having a rough game. Outside of the mistakes, he's also been inaccurate passing the ball thus far and had a couple misses on Alabama's latest drive that forced it into another punt. Alabama's defense has played well thus far, and it just got a much-needed stop after the Crimson Tide punted for the first time. Michigan gained 24 yards in eight plays and took five minutes off the clock but, ultimately, had to punt short of the 50-yard line after a rush attempt was stoned on third-and-8. Alabama returner Ryan Williams decided to field the punt at Alabama's 16-yard line and was tackled immediately, which means that the Crimson Tide will, once again, start with unfavorable field position. The ReliaQuest Bowl really couldn't be going much worse for Alabama thus far. The Crimson Tide turned the ball over three times and had another drive end with a failed fourth-down conversion in the first quarter. One of those turnovers was an entirely unforced error when quarterback Jalen Milroe fumbled the ball on a botched snap exchange. That was the first of two fumbles for Milroe, who also had an interception. Even with all of that, Michigan wasn't able to exit the first quarter with a completely decisive lead. All four of Michigan's drives started in Alabama territory with the average start at Alabama's 21-yard line, but Michigan still came out with three field goals courtesy of kicker Dominic Zvada. Alabama's defense is keeping the Tide in this game and covering for an offense that, in addition to its sloppy play, finished the first frame with minus-2 total net yards. Credit Alabama's defense for keeping this game from spiraling entirely out of control. Michigan gained possession inside Alabama's 10-yard line after a strip-sack of Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe but the Wolverines were unable to score a touchdown with more advantageous field position. Instead, Michigan kicker Dominic Zvada made his third field goal of the game, this one a kick from 21 yards out. Four plays and three turnovers now for Alabama. This time, quarterback Jalen Milroe came under pressure off the edge when dropping back to pass on first-and-10. Cornerback Amir Hall, who came through on a blitz, got a hand on Milroe's arm and forced the ball loose. Michigan defensive lineman Cameron Brandt was able to recover the fumble and stumbled for a gain of five yards. Now a third straight possession that will start in the red zone for the Wolverines. Michigan finally took full advantage of another Alabama mistake. After kicking field goals on Alabama's first two turnovers -- a failed fourth-down conversion and a fumble -- the Wolverines got the ball in the red zone again thanks to an interception from defensive back Wesley Walker. On third-and-7, quarterback Davis Warren lofted a pass to wide receiver Fredrick Moore, who made a phenomenal toe-tapping catch to secure a 13-yard touchdown. About everything that could go wrong for Alabama thus far has. All three of the Crimson Tide's offensive drives have now ended in a turnover. Quarterback Jalen Milroe just threw a bad interception where he stared down a receiver on an out route and pulled the trigger too late, allowing Michigan defensive back Wesley Walker to hop the route and tip the ball to himself for an interception. This is Michigan's second straight drive that will start in the red zone. Two drives that started with favorable field position and two field goals for Michigan thus far. The Wolverines got the ball in the red zone after Alabama fumbled a snap due to the bad weather. They weren't able to get a ton of yardage with three straight runs and settled for the points with a 30-yard field goal from kicker Dominic Zvada. A smart strategy in a game that may not see a ton of offense due to the conditions. It's absolutely pouring in Tampa Bay. It didn't take long to negatively affect Alabama. On the first play of the Crimson Tide's second drive, Alabama snapped the ball in shotgun formation. Quarterback Jalen Milroe couldn't get a good handle on the wet ball and fumbled it. The loose ball bounced around a bit before ending up in the hands of Michigan's Derrick Moore, who already had a big sack that ended Alabama's first offensive drive. Michigan's defense gave its offense favorable field position with a big sack and the Wolverines were able to capitalize. It didn't take much effort to get into field goal range, given Dominic Zvada's leg, and Michigan did just enough to attempt a 45-yard kick that Zvada nailed in the pouring rain. He's been Michigan's offensive MVP all year and he'll be crucial in what's shaping up to be a very bad weather game. Alabama worked the ball just past the 50-yard line and decided to go for it on fourth-and-4, looking to put some points on the board early. But Michigan's defense, which is going to have to have a big game to keep this one close, was up to the task. Crimson Tide quarterback Jalen Milroe dropped back to pass and immediately came under pressure from Michigan edge rusher Derrick Moore, who bullied the right tackle and sacked Milroe for a big loss. Michigan takes over in Alabama territory, on the edge of kicker Dominic Zvada's field goal range. Michigan won the opening toss and deferred to the second half, which means that Alabama's offense will start with the ball. The Crimson Tide have a good chance to set the tone early against a shorthanded Michigan defense, given that Kalen DeBoer's squad is almost at full strength. That includes quarterback Jalen Milroe, who has yet to make a final NFL Draft decision and, as such, is playing in Tuesday's bowl game. Games between big-time programs are sometimes as simple as effort and participation. Expect that to take center stage. Alabama has a strong culture of showing up for bowl games, winning eight of their last nine -- all except the Rose Bowl against Michigan last season. Don't expect the Tide to waste the opportunity, especially with a chance to reach 10 wins. Pick: Alabama -10.5 Michigan has already secured at least one transfer portal win over Alabama. The Wolverines signed former Crimson Tide defensive lineman Damon Payne, who is a three star in 247Sports' Transfer Rankings. He, obviously, cannot play in the ReliaQuest Bowl, but he is a big add for Michigan's future. Michigan is also the presumed favorite for Alabama transfer running back Justice Haynes, the No. 1 running back in the portal. Haynes has already received two 247Sports Crystal Ball predictions to land at Michigan. He'd be a clear starter in a room that, as outlined below, looks a little depleted entering the 2025 season. Not counting its transfer portal departures, Alabama is expected to be at mostly full strength. Coach Kalen DeBoer said during the head coaches press conference Monday that he hasn't had conversations with any of Alabama's players about opting out. That includes quarterback Jalen Milroe, who is still mulling over his NFL Draft decision. \"I'd be pretty surprised,\" DeBoer said of any opt outs. \"I think they're here to win. To compete. To put the best product we can put out there on the football field for four quarters and go out there. I wouldn't expect something like that.\" Michigan running back Kalel Mullings will not play in the ReliaQuest Bowl as he prepares for the 2025 NFL Draft. Mullings, a former linebacker, had the best season of his college career in 2024, rushing for a team-high 948 yards and 12 touchdowns. Mullings entered the season as the backup behind Donovan Edwards and assumed the role as the Wolverines' bellcow running back just weeks into the season. Edwards also opted out, which leaves the Wolverines short on experienced running backs as they prepare for their showdown against Alabama. That leaves true freshman Jordan Marshall as Michigan's expected RB1. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

                "title": "Michigan stuns No. 11 Alabama in ReliaQuest Bowl: How shorthanded Wolverines shut down Tide - The Athletic",
                "content": "NCAAF TAMPA, Fla. — Even without some of its biggest stars, Michigan capitalized on a sloppy first quarter from No. 11 Alabama and beat the Crimson Tide 19-13 Tuesday in the ReliaQuest Bowl. Alabama, the first team left out of the College Football Playoff, was favored by more than two touchdowns against a Michigan team that was missing several of its top NFL Draft prospects. Two first-quarter fumbles and an interception from quarterback Jalen Milroe helped the Wolverines grab an early 16-0 lead, and Michigan hung on despite being outgained 260 yards to 190. Advertisement Michigan running back Jordan Marshall, playing in place of seniors Kalel Mullings and Donovan Edwards, had 100 yards on 23 carries. Milroe completed 16 of 32 passes for 192 yards with an interception, throwing four consecutive incompletions in the final two minutes after leading Alabama into the red zone. Michigan (8-5) finished the season on a three-game winning streak and beat the Crimson Tide for the second time in 2024 in a rematch of last season’s CFP semifinal at the Rose Bowl. GO DEEPER Michigan suddenly looks like it knows where it's going after upsets of Alabama, Ohio State One of the big storylines was how Michigan’s defense would perform without Mason Graham, Kenneth Grant, Josaiah Stewart and other players who opted out. The Wolverines answered that question by forcing three early turnovers and limiting Alabama to minus-2 yards in the first quarter while jumping out to a 16-0 lead. Edge rusher Derrick Moore, who has said he plans to return next season, made his case to be considered among the top defensive players in the Big Ten. Moore had two sacks and a fumble recovery in the first half, and Aamir Hall forced another Jalen Milroe fumble that was recovered by Cameron Brandt. Defensive coordinator Wink Martindale’s unit played its best football late in the season, and that continued in the bowl game, even without several players who were instrumental to Michigan’s late-season turnaround. The defensive line appears to be in good hands for next season, as Michigan sacked Milroe five times and limited Alabama to 68 rushing yards and 2.3 yards per carry. — Austin Meek Michigan’s season started with uncertainty at quarterback and ended the same way after Davis Warren left the game with an injury in the third quarter. Alex Orji, who has already announced plans to transfer, took over for Warren and completed 2 of 3 passes for two yards with an interception. Advertisement Sticking with Orji over freshman Jadyn Davis was a curious move. Davis was viewed as Michigan’s potential quarterback of the future when he signed with the Wolverines in the Class of 2024, though that title has since been claimed by Underwood, the No. 1 prospect in the Class of 2025. Underwood participated in bowl practices as an early enrollee and attended Tuesday’s game, though he wasn’t eligible to play. Now that the season is over, Michigan will turn its attention to 2025 and a new-look quarterback competition. Michigan signed Fresno State transfer Mikey Keene from the transfer portal to compete with Underwood, and coach Sherrone Moore said Warren is leaning toward using his fifth year of eligibility at Michigan. Warren completed 9 of 12 passes for 73 yards and a touchdown before his injury. — Meek Alabama appeared motivated by its College Football Playoff snub, its NFL hopefuls committed to playing and its opponent was a depleted Michigan team. But what felt like prime conditions for a strong bowl performance spiraled into an all-too-familiar outcome: Alabama playing a flat, uninspired game as a double-digit favorite. The primary question for head coach Kalen DeBoer to address this offseason is, what will Alabama do to re-establish consistency as a program? The comparison in cultures from Nick Saban to DeBoer has dominated this season’s conversation, and now at season’s end Alabama’s tendency to play down to its competition is in the spotlight again. The number that might’ve defined Saban’s tenure better than any other was his record against unranked opponents, a staggering 123-4. Alabama lost to three unranked opponents in 2024 alone: Vanderbilt, Oklahoma and now Michigan. The Crimson Tide’s consistency made them a dynastic program; for now, that trait has vanished. Alabama had plenty of opportunities to take control of the game but were undone by things that have plagued it all season, namely turnovers, penalties and poor pass protection. The result is the first single-digit-win season in Tuscaloosa since 2007, Saban’s first year in charge. Advertisement The sting of a Playoff snub could’ve been partly mitigated by a dominant bowl win and a 10-win season. Now, a loss to Michigan reinforces the thought that Alabama wasn’t a Playoff-quality team and puts the upcoming offseason under even more scrutiny. There’s a ton of work to be done for the Tide to return to contender status. The expectations for next season will be extremely high, and the work to re-establish the program’s standard begins now. — Kennington Smith III GO DEEPER Vannini: Indiana, SMU deserve an apology after yet another Alabama loss The autopsy of Tuesday’s loss for the Crimson Tide cannot start anywhere but the quarterback position, where three consecutive Jalen Milroe turnovers gifted the Wolverines 13 points in the first quarter. Another three points came as a result of Alabama turning it over on downs on its first possession. Michigan’s average starting field position in the first quarter was the Alabama 17-yard line, with drives starting at the Alabama 44, 19, 16 and 6; Alabama’s average starting position was its own 25-yard line. Milroe finished the game completing just 16 of 32 passes for 192 yards, one touchdown and one interception. Outside of the turnovers, he didn’t see the field very well, missing open receivers and taking unnecessary sacks. When he’s on, he’s nearly unstoppable, but when he’s off, as he was on Tuesday, the Crimson Tide’s offense melts down. But Milroe wasn’t the only issue on Tuesday. The offensive line had a rough day against a litany of Michigan backups, allowing five sacks and six tackles for loss. The running game was also nonexistent. Starter Jam Miller accounted for just 27 yards on on 10 carries. The offense needs re-tooling at all levels this offseason — a recommitment to a traditional run game and improvement at quarterback, offensive line and pass catcher. On several occasions, the side of the ball DeBoer specializes in has let the Tide down. Defensive coordinator Kane Wommack’s unit did more than enough to win the game. Despite the turnover disparity early, Alabama’s defense only allowed 16 points, then proceeded to hold Michigan scoreless for seven straight drives. But a 17-minute time of possession disparity was too much to overcome, and the defense allowed a late field goal drive (Michigan’s longest of the game at 47 yards) that extended Michigan’s lead to 19-10. Advertisement Overall numbers of 190 yards allowed on 14 drives (2.9 yards per play) with one forced turnover, two sacks and eight tackles for loss would’ve been happily accepted before the game. But the lack of complimentary football wasted the performance, which is emblematic of Alabama’s disappointing season. — Smith (Photo: Douglas P.

                "content": "TAMPA, Florida (WNEM) - Michigan ended the year 2024 the same way they started it; with a win over Alabama. The Wolverines defense was dominant to start the game. The Crimson Tide’s first four possessions ended in this order; turnover on downs, fumble, interception, fumble. Michigan cashed those four turnovers into 16 points. Three field goals by Dominic Zvada and a touchdown pass from Davis Warren to Fredrick Moore. Alabama would fight back making it 16-10 at the half. Second half, both teams would trade field goals. It was 19-13 during Alabama’s final drive. The Crimson Tide had 1st & 10 on Michigan’s 15 but were unable to score a touchdown. The Wolverines defense would get the turnover on downs as Michigan defeats Alabama, 19-13. “We talked about not losses; lessons,” Michigan Head Coach Sherrone Moore said in his postgame press conference. “We had a lot of lessons throughout the year and just learning from them so we learned the things that we needed to learn to ultimately end up on the plus side and we did that in these last few games and finishing on a strong note was huge for us. It’ll build great momentum going into the offseason. We feel like we have a bright future.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Michigan earned a huge 19-13 win against No. 11 Alabama in the ReliaQuest Bowl on Tuesday. The shorthanded Wolverines, who were down several key players due to both opt outs and the transfer portal, led wire-to-wire after taking advantage of numerous Alabama mistakes in the first quarter. The Crimson Tide turned the ball over three times -- and had their first offensive drive end with a failed fourth-down conversion -- in the first 15 minutes. That means for its first four possessions Michigan's average starting position was Alabama's 21-yard line. The Wolverines took advantage, even if they left some points on the board. Three of Michigan's first four drives ended in a field goal from kicker Dominic Zvada, two of which came from 30 yards or less. Quarterback Davis Warren, who later exited the game with an apparent leg injury, did hit wide receiver Fredrick Moore for a 13-yard touchdown and Michigan left the first quarter with a 16-0 lead it never surrendered. Alabama had 2 total yards of offense until late in the second quarter when it went on two drives that covered a combined 161 yards and resulted in 10 points. It wasn't enough to spark a full comeback, however. The Crimson Tide actually had a chance to win it late in the fourth quarter. One possession after kicker Graham Nicholson hit a season-long 51-yard field goal which cut Michigan's lead to one possession, Alabama got the ball all the way to Michigan's 15-yard line. But on fourth-and-10, Milroe came under immediate pressure and threw an incomplete pass, which allowed Michigan to take possession and kneel the clock out on a momentum-building bowl victory. That was a common theme for the Wolverines through 2024, especially in their last two wins against Ohio State and Alabama. Michigan didn't play a great game on offense. In fact, after the first quarter, it was largely ineffective. But it did do enough to put the game away. Michigan's shorthanded defense definitely deserves a ton of credit, as the Wolverines held Alabama scoreless for almost three entire quarters, which allowed the offense to sit on their early 16-0 lead. Michigan did employ a smart ball-control strategy to limit Alabama's possessions and, thus, its explosive potential on offense. The Wolverines gained just 32 yards in the third quarter, but they held onto the football for a whopping 10:52 seconds. That took the air out of Alabama's late first-half surge, when it scored 10 unanswered points to cut Michigan's lead to 16-10. Michigan won the time of possession battle by almost 17 minutes, with a lot of its advantage created in that third quarter. That kept the defense fresh and it limited Alabama's window to mount a comeback. Michigan's modern run of success has been keyed, largely, by excellent running back play. The Wolverines have had star players like Blake Corum, Donovan Edwards and Kalel Mullings lead their offense while gashing opposing defenses on the ground. They may have found the next great one in freshman running back Jordan Marshall. Marshall was thrust into a starting role after Mullings and Edwards opted out and he responded with a strong performance, especially after Michigan lost starting quarterback Davis Warren to injury. Marshall carried the ball 23 times for 100 yards, averaging just over four yards per carry against a strong Alabama defense. He had a key 24-yard run early in the fourth quarter, bouncing off of Alabama defenders in the process, to set up Dominic Zvada's decisive 37-yard field goal. Not bad for a true freshman making his first career start. Marshall certainly provided Michigan fans with some optimism about the future of the Wolverines' offense, especially with players like five-star quarterback Bryce Underwood joining the fold moving forward. Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe still has yet to make a decision on his future. Before Tuesday's bowl game, he was considered an intriguing NFL Draft prospect with plenty of untapped upside and physical traits that would make him a desirable option for front offices, likely in the middle rounds. Now his stock is up in the air. Milroe definitely had his moments in the ReliaQuest Bowl. He had one 41-yard run where he flashed his athleticism and weaved around Michigan defenders to set up Alabama's second scoring drive. He had nice throws of 25 yards to tight end Robbie Ouzts for Alabama's first touchdown of the game, and a deep 40-yard completion to wide receiver Germie Bernard near the end of the second quarter. But, overall, he was largely ineffective. He turned the ball over three times in the first quarter alone. One of those was on a botched snap, and the other was an interception after he mistimed a shallow out route. Milroe also had multiple misses on passes at every level of the field. His pocket awareness was concerning, as he struggled to sense pressure and often held onto the ball for too long. There's a good chance that Milroe still gets drafted if he declares, especially since he's one of the most physically gifted quarterbacks in college football. His lackluster bowl performance left a sour last impression on scouts, though. Or, at the very least, take a late lead. Michigan was gifted a first down thanks to an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Alabama linebacker Justin Jefferson, but the Wolverines weren't able to do much more with the free yardage. The Crimson Tide defense, which has been great all day, forced a punt that Alabama's Ryan Williams returned 38 yards to give his team possession on Alabama's 44-yard line. Prime scoring opportunity, though the Tide need a touchdown at this point. We've got some clutch kicking in the ReliaQuest Bowl. Alabama stalled at Michigan's 33-yard line during a crucial drive. Instead of going for it on fourth-and-10, the Crimson Tide sent kicker Graham Nicholson out. He hit his second field goal of the day and set his season high with a 51-yard boot. It had enough power behind it to split the uprights from even further out. Alabama's hanging around. Dominic Zvada, still one of the most important players in college football. It's rare that a college kicker is so reliable, but he has now hit on all four of his field goal attempts in the ReliaQuest Bowl. His latest, from 37 yards out, was the biggest, as it expanded Michigan's lead back to two possessions with 7:21 left to play. Michigan leaned on running back Jordan Marshall, who carried the ball five times, to get into scoring range. He had a nice 24-yard run that moved the ball into Alabama territory. Alabama, which has scoring drives of 71 and 90 yards, was unable to capitalize on its best starting field position of the game after a Zabien Brown interception handed Alabama the ball on the 50-yard line. Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe almost threw an interception on third-and-7. The Crimson Tide still went for it, and Milroe was late on a pass to Jaylen Mbakwe, who caught the ball out of bounds. Michigan stills holds a narrow lead after three quarters of play. Five drives ended without any points in the third quarter. Four of those resulted in punts, while the fifth was cut short when Michigan quarterback Alex Orji threw an interception to Alabama defensive back Zabien Brown. The biggest news coming out of the third quarter was the fact that Michigan starting quarterback Davis Warren was taken to the locker room with an apparent leg injury. Without Warren, the Wolverines turned to Orji, who hasn't been able to make anything happen on offense. Alabama will start the fourth quarter with a prime opportunity to finally jump into the lead. Brown's interception gave the Tide the ball at the 50-yard line, and a quick 9-yard completion to wide receiver Rico Scott put Alabama in Michigan territory for the first time since the second quarter ended. All 16 of Michigan's points thus far came in the first quarter. Not counting the end of the first half, the Wolverines have punted on five consecutive drives since. They have crossed midfield just once since the first quarter and all four of their first-quarter drives began in plus territory. So that means Michigan's offense has possessed the ball 10 times, but it has made it past the 50-yard line just once. The Wolverines still have yet to gain more than 34 yards in a single drive. Now Alabama is having injury issues of its own. Top linebacker Jihaad Campbell just left the field with an apparent injury after attempting a tackle on Michigan running back Jordan Marshall. He was slow to get up and didn't walk off the field until Alabama's training staff came out to help him. He would be a huge loss fro the Crimson Tide defense, which has played very well today. Michigan's offense is still spinning its wheels after an ineffective drive to open the second half. To make matters worse, starting quarterback Davis Warren appears injured after taking a long sack. Alabama defensive linemen dragged Warren down near the sideline and Warren remained on the turf for a few moments. He initially got up, with the help of teammates, but went back to the ground after taking a few steps. Warren wasn't putting much weight on his right leg, which got bent under him when Smith brough him to the ground. Michigan leads No. 11 Alabama 16-7 at halftime of the ReliaQuest Bowl after the first two quarters felt way more lopsided than the score may indicate. Alabama turned the ball over three times in the first quarter -- and that doesn't include its first drive, which ended in a failed fourth-down conversion -- which gave Michigan three drives that started in the red zone. In spite of that, the Wolverines only found the end zone once in the first half thanks to a 13-yard connection between quarterback Davis Warren and wide receiver Fredrick Moore. Moore, who stepped into a bigger role when Michigan lost its top two receivers entering Tuesday's game, had a nice first half with three catches for 37 yards and the score. Though it took Alabama's offense a long time to find its footing, Michigan's inability to fully capitalize on Alabama's numerous mistakes allowed the Crimson Tide to keep the door open. They captured some late momentum with a four-play, 71-yard drive capped by a 25-yard touchdown connection between quarterback Jalen Milroe and tight end Robbie Ouzts near the end of the second quarter. Prior to that 71-yard scoring drive, Alabama had 2 total yards on offense. The Crimson Tide now enter halftime outgaining Michigan by 54 yards. Michigan's offense needs to figure something out in the second half. The Wolverines, who will receive the kickoff, cannot sit on their lead with Alabama's offense starting to hit its stride. It seemed like Alabama would have been content to run the clock out and enter half time when it gained possession at its own 4-yard line with just 50 seconds left to play and no timeouts. But, on third-and-1, Michigan inexplicably saved some clock for the Crimson Tide by calling a timeout. Then quarterback Jalen Milroe ripped off a 41-yard run, and hit wide receiver Germie Bernard for a gain of 40 yards, which put the Crimson Tide in prime scoring position. Kicker Graham Nicholson eventually ate into Michigan's lead with a 24-yard field goal. It took over 25 minutes, but Alabama's offense finally looks like itself. The Crimson Tide just battled back into this game with an easy 71-yard drive, marching down the field in just four plays to score their first touchdown of the game. Freshman wide receiver Rico Scott got things started with a 28-yard gain on a jet sweep play. Alabama then gained a combined 15 yards on a tight end screen that Josh Cuevas fumbled. Offensive lineman Elijah Pritchett recovered the ball and rumbled for another eight yards. Then, a couple plays later, Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe hit a wide open Robbie Ouzts for a 25-yard touchdown. The only positive thing to say for Alabama's offense thus far is that it has now gone two straight possessions without a turnover. Both of those drives still ended in a punt, though. The Crimson Tide have more turnovers (3) than total yards (2). Their offense totals are being dragged down by their minus 16 yards rushing. Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe has already been sacked three times, and Alabama's running backs have combined for 11 yards on five carries. Milroe, who was responsible for all three turnovers, is having a rough game. Outside of the mistakes, he's also been inaccurate passing the ball thus far and had a couple misses on Alabama's latest drive that forced it into another punt. Alabama's defense has played well thus far, and it just got a much-needed stop after the Crimson Tide punted for the first time. Michigan gained 24 yards in eight plays and took five minutes off the clock but, ultimately, had to punt short of the 50-yard line after a rush attempt was stoned on third-and-8. Alabama returner Ryan Williams decided to field the punt at Alabama's 16-yard line and was tackled immediately, which means that the Crimson Tide will, once again, start with unfavorable field position. The ReliaQuest Bowl really couldn't be going much worse for Alabama thus far. The Crimson Tide turned the ball over three times and had another drive end with a failed fourth-down conversion in the first quarter. One of those turnovers was an entirely unforced error when quarterback Jalen Milroe fumbled the ball on a botched snap exchange. That was the first of two fumbles for Milroe, who also had an interception. Even with all of that, Michigan wasn't able to exit the first quarter with a completely decisive lead. All four of Michigan's drives started in Alabama territory with the average start at Alabama's 21-yard line, but Michigan still came out with three field goals courtesy of kicker Dominic Zvada. Alabama's defense is keeping the Tide in this game and covering for an offense that, in addition to its sloppy play, finished the first frame with minus-2 total net yards. Credit Alabama's defense for keeping this game from spiraling entirely out of control. Michigan gained possession inside Alabama's 10-yard line after a strip-sack of Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe but the Wolverines were unable to score a touchdown with more advantageous field position. Instead, Michigan kicker Dominic Zvada made his third field goal of the game, this one a kick from 21 yards out. Four plays and three turnovers now for Alabama. This time, quarterback Jalen Milroe came under pressure off the edge when dropping back to pass on first-and-10. Cornerback Amir Hall, who came through on a blitz, got a hand on Milroe's arm and forced the ball loose. Michigan defensive lineman Cameron Brandt was able to recover the fumble and stumbled for a gain of five yards. Now a third straight possession that will start in the red zone for the Wolverines. Michigan finally took full advantage of another Alabama mistake. After kicking field goals on Alabama's first two turnovers -- a failed fourth-down conversion and a fumble -- the Wolverines got the ball in the red zone again thanks to an interception from defensive back Wesley Walker. On third-and-7, quarterback Davis Warren lofted a pass to wide receiver Fredrick Moore, who made a phenomenal toe-tapping catch to secure a 13-yard touchdown. About everything that could go wrong for Alabama thus far has. All three of the Crimson Tide's offensive drives have now ended in a turnover. Quarterback Jalen Milroe just threw a bad interception where he stared down a receiver on an out route and pulled the trigger too late, allowing Michigan defensive back Wesley Walker to hop the route and tip the ball to himself for an interception. This is Michigan's second straight drive that will start in the red zone. Two drives that started with favorable field position and two field goals for Michigan thus far. The Wolverines got the ball in the red zone after Alabama fumbled a snap due to the bad weather. They weren't able to get a ton of yardage with three straight runs and settled for the points with a 30-yard field goal from kicker Dominic Zvada. A smart strategy in a game that may not see a ton of offense due to the conditions. It's absolutely pouring in Tampa Bay. It didn't take long to negatively affect Alabama. On the first play of the Crimson Tide's second drive, Alabama snapped the ball in shotgun formation. Quarterback Jalen Milroe couldn't get a good handle on the wet ball and fumbled it. The loose ball bounced around a bit before ending up in the hands of Michigan's Derrick Moore, who already had a big sack that ended Alabama's first offensive drive. Michigan's defense gave its offense favorable field position with a big sack and the Wolverines were able to capitalize. It didn't take much effort to get into field goal range, given Dominic Zvada's leg, and Michigan did just enough to attempt a 45-yard kick that Zvada nailed in the pouring rain. He's been Michigan's offensive MVP all year and he'll be crucial in what's shaping up to be a very bad weather game. Alabama worked the ball just past the 50-yard line and decided to go for it on fourth-and-4, looking to put some points on the board early. But Michigan's defense, which is going to have to have a big game to keep this one close, was up to the task. Crimson Tide quarterback Jalen Milroe dropped back to pass and immediately came under pressure from Michigan edge rusher Derrick Moore, who bullied the right tackle and sacked Milroe for a big loss. Michigan takes over in Alabama territory, on the edge of kicker Dominic Zvada's field goal range. Michigan won the opening toss and deferred to the second half, which means that Alabama's offense will start with the ball. The Crimson Tide have a good chance to set the tone early against a shorthanded Michigan defense, given that Kalen DeBoer's squad is almost at full strength. That includes quarterback Jalen Milroe, who has yet to make a final NFL Draft decision and, as such, is playing in Tuesday's bowl game. Games between big-time programs are sometimes as simple as effort and participation. Expect that to take center stage. Alabama has a strong culture of showing up for bowl games, winning eight of their last nine -- all except the Rose Bowl against Michigan last season. Don't expect the Tide to waste the opportunity, especially with a chance to reach 10 wins. Pick: Alabama -10.5 Michigan has already secured at least one transfer portal win over Alabama. The Wolverines signed former Crimson Tide defensive lineman Damon Payne, who is a three star in 247Sports' Transfer Rankings. He, obviously, cannot play in the ReliaQuest Bowl, but he is a big add for Michigan's future. Michigan is also the presumed favorite for Alabama transfer running back Justice Haynes, the No. 1 running back in the portal. Haynes has already received two 247Sports Crystal Ball predictions to land at Michigan. He'd be a clear starter in a room that, as outlined below, looks a little depleted entering the 2025 season. Not counting its transfer portal departures, Alabama is expected to be at mostly full strength. Coach Kalen DeBoer said during the head coaches press conference Monday that he hasn't had conversations with any of Alabama's players about opting out. That includes quarterback Jalen Milroe, who is still mulling over his NFL Draft decision. \"I'd be pretty surprised,\" DeBoer said of any opt outs. \"I think they're here to win. To compete. To put the best product we can put out there on the football field for four quarters and go out there. I wouldn't expect something like that.\" Michigan running back Kalel Mullings will not play in the ReliaQuest Bowl as he prepares for the 2025 NFL Draft. Mullings, a former linebacker, had the best season of his college career in 2024, rushing for a team-high 948 yards and 12 touchdowns. Mullings entered the season as the backup behind Donovan Edwards and assumed the role as the Wolverines' bellcow running back just weeks into the season. Edwards also opted out, which leaves the Wolverines short on experienced running backs as they prepare for their showdown against Alabama. That leaves true freshman Jordan Marshall as Michigan's expected RB1. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Ryan John Seacrest was born in Atlanta on December 24, 1974,[8] the son of homemaker Constance Marie (née Zullinger) and real estate lawyer Gary Lee Seacrest.[9][10] His father served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army, in which his grandfather Henry Gene Skeen was a major general.[11] His mother told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"Instead of playing with G.I. Joes or Cowboys and Indians, Ryan would always have a little microphone and do shows in the house.\"[12] At age 14, he attended Dunwoody High School. At age 16, while still attending high school, he won an internship at WSTR in Atlanta where Tom Sullivan trained him in many aspects of radio. When a regular DJ called in sick, Sullivan put him on the air for the first show of his broadcasting career.[13] He was given the weekend overnight shift at WSTR.[12] He continued to work on air at WSTR until graduating from Dunwoody High in 1992.[14] He studied journalism at the University of Georgia in the fall of 1992.

In 2001, he hosted a reality television program, Ultimate Revenge,[9] where elaborate practical jokes were played on family and friends instigated by their own relatives and friends. It was shown on TNN from 2001 to 2003.[15][17] In 2002, Seacrest accepted the position as co-host of a new Fox reality television series American Idol with comedian Brian Dunkleman. The following year he became the sole host. The show increased in popularity and was seen by some 26 million viewers weekly; Seacrest became recognizable around the world. In 2003, he hosted the spin-off show, American Juniors.[15] In July 2009, he signed a deal with CKX for $45 million to continue to host American Idol which made him the highest paid reality television host at the time.[18] In April 2012, he signed a two-year $30 million deal to stay on as host of American Idol.[19] In May 2014, Deadline Hollywood reported that he had signed a one-year deal with the option of signing for another year.[20] He remained host of the series until the end of its run in April 2016.[21] The following May, it was announced that ABC had won a multi-network bidding war for the rights to the show. On July 20, 2017, he announced on Live with Kelly & Ryan that he would be the host of an Idol reboot. His initial multi-year deal was reported to be worth over $10 million.[22][23] In August 2005, it was announced that Seacrest would become executive producer and co-host of ABC's Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve. On December 31, 2005, Seacrest performed much of the show's hosting duties; Dick Clark's role was limited by speech and mobility issues due to his recovery from a stroke. Seacrest also occasionally served as a substitute host on the CNN television program Larry King Live, and co-emceed Larry King's final show with Bill Maher on December 16, 2010.[15] In 2009, ABC renamed the program Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve With Ryan Seacrest, paying attention to Seacrest's role. He co-hosted the show delivering ABC's biggest New Year's numbers in twelve years, with 22.8 million viewers.[24] When Clark died, Seacrest publicly remembered his mentor's impact on his life in a special tribute in The Hollywood Reporter.[25] After Clark's death, Seacrest hosted the 2013 edition of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with co-hosts Jenny McCarthy and Fergie paying tribute to Clark in the pre-show.[26] In October 2013, Seacrest signed a multi-year contract extension with Dick Clark Productions to continue as host and executive producer of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve.[27] In 2017, Seacrest hosted Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve for the 13th consecutive year alongside McCarthy, who had co-hosted for eight years. The show had 25.6 million viewers, the highest in six years.[28][29] The 2019–20 edition of Rockin' Eve marked his 15th consecutive year as the host and Lucy Hale also hosted. Recently he received a multi-year deal extension to continue hosting the show.[30] In January 2006, US cable channel E! announced a three-year, $21 million deal for Seacrest to host various programs, including E! News and its red carpet awards show coverages.[31] In April 2012, Seacrest signed a deal with NBCUniversal expanding his on-air role beyond E! to NBC. He contributed to the Today Show, Olympics coverage, entertainment programming, as well as news and other special events. Seacrest will remain managing editor of E! News and host and produce its red carpet awards show coverage.[32] In September 2012, Seacrest left E! News and was replaced by Terrence J.[33] Seacrest was an NBC correspondent for the 2012 London Olympic Games and co-hosted the closing ceremony with Bob Costas and Al Michaels.[34] In 2016, Seacrest hosted NBC's live late-night coverage for the Rio Olympic Games.[35] After a year-long search, on May 1, 2017, it was announced that Seacrest would join Kelly Ripa as host of Live with Kelly and Ryan as her new permanent co-host and executive producer. Seacrest succeeded Michael Strahan starting work on the day of the announcement.[36] By December 2017 the show was averaging over 3 million viewers.[37] On February 16, 2023, Seacrest announced that he would be leaving Live with Kelly and Ryan after six years in April 2023, primarily due to traveling as his primary residence is in Los Angeles, while the show tapes in New York City.[38] Seacrest made his last appearance as full-time host on April 14, 2023. Mark Consuelos, husband of Kelly Ripa, replaced him full-time on April 17, 2023. Seacrest has stated, however, that he will return to guest host whenever Consuelos is unavailable, meaning he is not permanently leaving the show.[39][40][41] On June 27, 2023, The New York Times reported that Seacrest would replace the outgoing Pat Sajak as the host of Wheel of Fortune beginning with the show's 42nd season in fall 2024, citing \"two people familiar with the plan\".[42] Seacrest[43] and Sony would later confirm the news in separate releases.[44] In 2013, Seacrest hosted The Million Second Quiz which was an interactive game show on NBC.[45] Seacrest hosted Knock Knock Live in 2015, which premiered on Fox. The show featured celebrities arriving at the door of ordinary people who've done something special and giving them a prize.[46] However, the show was cancelled after two episodes.[47][48] In January 2004, Seacrest became the new host of the radio program American Top 40,[49] a syndicated weekly countdown show, created and formerly hosted by Casey Kasem. The show was syndicated by Premiere Radio Networks. In February 2004, Seacrest became host of Los Angeles radio station KIIS-FM's morning show, replacing long-time host Rick Dees.[50] The show, On Air With Ryan Seacrest, since 2017 Seacrest has been broadcasting from a studio at the facilities of WABC-TV in New York City, where Live with Kelly and Ryan is produced.[51][52] Seacrest renewed his contract with Premiere and KIIS parent company iHeartMedia in September 2021, a contract that will last through the end of 2025.[53] In 2018, Seacrest was inducted into the Library of American Broadcasting Foundation's 16th Annual Giants of Broadcasting & Electronic Arts.[54] Seacrest's three-year hosting deal with E! included executive producing credits on various programs, including E! News and its red carpet awards show coverages.[31] In the same year, Seacrest launched Ryan Seacrest Productions (RSP). In August 2008, Seacrest named his longtime William Morris agent Adam Sher as CEO.[55] Through 2012 Comcast had first-look rights for all RSP shows.[56] Clear Channel acquired a minority stake in RSP in early 2012, but RSP no longer has a first look deal with any network.[57] Seacrest remains managing editor of E! News and executive produces its red carpet awards show coverage but no longer hosts (since January 2012) E! News on a daily basis.[58] An Associated Press profile portrayed Seacrest as using both the deal with E! and Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve as springboards to a long-lasting career in television production and ownership.[59] Seacrest produces the hit series Keeping Up with the Kardashians, the highest-rated show on the E! network, and the spin-offs Khloe and Lamar, Kourtney and Kim Take New York and Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami. RSP also produced the Emmy Award-winning ABC reality series Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution. RSP also produced two new reality series in 2012 including Melissa and Tye, which aired on CMT and Shahs of Sunset for Bravo. Bravo announced a second season of Shahs of Sunset on April 18, 2012.[60] RSP's new show Married to Jonas premiered on August 19, 2012, on E! and was renewed for a second season.[61] On January 31, 2012, Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital announced they would invest up to $300M in Ryan Seacrest Media.[62] A consortium headed by Seacrest (with partners AEG and CAA) agreed to rebrand Mark Cuban's HDNet television network as AXS TV.[63] In 2017, Seacrest signed a multi-year overall deal between Ryan Seacrest Productions and ABC Studios in which the company's scripted division would develop scripted projects for ABC Studios exclusively.[64][65] In 2018, Seacrest joined the Paley Center for Media's Board of Trustees.[66] Seacrest was a principal investor in the Typo keyboard, which aimed at cloning the BlackBerry physical keyboard for use with iPhone devices that launched in 2014. The Typo keyboard was discontinued in a 2015 patent settlement with Blackberry Ltd.[67] He is also an investor and partner at Pathwater, a brand of purified water offered in a refillable aluminum bottle.[68][69] Seacrest worked with Burberry's Christopher Bailey who designed Seacrest's suits for red carpet events as well as New Year's Eve since 2009 and American Idol starting in 2010. Seacrest wore close-fitting suits and decided to make something similar for a wider audience at an \"accessible\" price point. In 2013, in conjunction with Randa Apparel & Accessories, Seacrest developed his own clothing and accessories collection, \"Ryan Seacrest Distinction.\" The Randa/Seacrest partnership signed an exclusive retail deal with Macy's to sell the brand and it successfully launched in 2014. It consists of suit separates, sports coats, and evening wear manufactured by Peerless Clothing International; accessories including ties, pocket squares, belts, wallets, cufflinks, and jewelry produced by Randa Accessories; and dress shirts from PVH (produced later by Itochu Prominent which added sportswear in September 2017).[70][71][72] Seacrest partnered with dermatologist Harold Lancer to produce the men's skincare line Polished.[73] The line has five items and they are designed for easy use.[74][75][76] Seacrest announced the line in August 2017 on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.[77] In 2010, Seacrest launched the nonprofit Ryan Seacrest Foundation.[78] The foundation has fourteen Seacrest Studios: at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (opened 2010), Children's Hospital of Orange County (2013), Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (2011), Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C. (2015), Levine Children's Hospital (2013), Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (2013), Children's Medical Center Dallas (2012), Boston Children's Hospital (2014), Children's Hospital Colorado (2014).[78] Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt in Tennessee (2016), Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Florida (2020), Le Bonheur Children's Hospital in Tennessee (2023 May), Cohen Children's Medical Center in New York (2023 September), and Primary Children's Hospital in Utah (2023 December).[79] Apparently there was a location at Children's Hospital Los Angeles,[78] but it isn't included in the Foundation's map in 2023.[79] In April 2012, Seacrest named Selena Gomez Ambassador of the Foundation.[80] In February 2017, the foundation partnered with the Atlanta Braves to promote the non-profit at SunTrust Park. Seacrest did voice overs for the Braves' \"Welcome Home\" broadcast media campaign.[81][82] Seacrest serves on the board of trustees of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,[83] and honorary co-chair of the GRAMMY Foundation board,[84] which later merged with the GRAMMY Museum and became the GRAMMY Museum Foundation.[85] The day before Georgia's special election in 2018, Seacrest, a Georgia native, urged voters in the state to visit the VoteRider's site or call or text the nonpartisan voter advocacy organization's helpline to find out what ID is required to vote.[86] Seacrest had a two-year on-and-off relationship with model Sara Jean Underwood, which was revealed on The Howard Stern Show in 2009.[87] He began dating dancer and actress Julianne Hough in April 2010.[88][89] In March 2013, it was announced that their relationship had ended.[90][91] He dated model Shayna Taylor from 2017 until 2020.[92][93] In May 2016, Seacrest returned to the University of Georgia to serve as the commencement speaker at the graduation ceremony and receive an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters.[94][95][96][97] In November 2017, it was reported that a former E! wardrobe stylist had accused Seacrest of sexual harassment and that he was under investigation.[98] Seacrest denied the allegations and said, \"This person who has accused me of horrible things offered, on multiple occasions, to withdraw her claims if I paid her millions of dollars. I refused.\"[99][100] In February 2018, the investigation was closed due to insufficient evidence.[101] Source[15] 2018–present",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Ryan Seacrest (born December 24, 1974, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.) is an American radio and television personality and producer who hosted the popular radio shows On Air with Ryan Seacrest and American Top 40 and appeared on numerous TV programs, most notably American Idol. During high school Seacrest worked at a hometown radio station. He left the University of Georgia prior to graduation to pursue a career in the entertainment industry in Los Angeles. In 1993 he had a stint as the host of ESPN’s sports game show Radical Outdoor Challenge. Two years later he began hosting the weekday radio show On Air with Ryan Seacrest. He continued to appear on TV, and, after hosting the game show Gladiators 2000 and a succession of not-so-popular programs, Seacrest began cohosting the singing competition American Idol in 2002. The program—which aired until 2016 on Fox and then returned in 2018 on ABC—was a hit, and it made Seacrest a household name. His easygoing manner and positive outlook appealed to the show’s audience as did his sometimes adversarial relationship in the show’s early years with Simon Cowell, one of the original judges. By 2003 Seacrest was hosting the show alone. The next year he launched a television edition of On Air with Ryan Seacrest, but it ended after several months. However, he continued hosting the radio show, which entered syndication in 2008. In 2006 he formed Ryan Seacrest Productions, which oversaw numerous reality TV programs, including Keeping Up with the Kardashians (2007–21), Denise Richards: It’s Complicated (2008–09), and Khloé & Lamar (2011–12). Among Seacrest’s many other responsibilities was his taking over of retiring radio personality Casey Kasem’s hosting of the weekly nationally syndicated radio show American Top 40, which provided a countdown of the most popular songs in the United States. In addition, Seacrest strengthened his ties to the cable channel E!, serving as cohost and executive producer of that channel’s celebrity red-carpet events. He joined ABC television’s Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve and participated as a special correspondent on NBC’s Today show. In 2012 Seacrest helped cover the Olympic Games in London, and in 2013 he hosted the TV game show The Million Second Quiz.

                "content": "The LSU Tigers football program, also known as the Fighting Tigers, represents Louisiana State University in college football. The Tigers compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Western Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). LSU ranks 16th best in winning percentage in NCAA Division I FBS history and claims four national championships (1958, 2003, 2007, and 2019), 16 conference championships, and 39 consensus All-Americans.[4] Three players for the Tigers have won the Heisman Trophy: Billy Cannon (1959), Joe Burrow (2019), and Jayden Daniels (2023). The team plays on the university's campus at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The program's current head coach is Brian Kelly. Dr. Charles E. Coates, a chemistry professor at the university known for his work on sugar, and former football player at Johns Hopkins, assembled a group of students to create the school's first team. Coates' plan for a football team dated back to autumn of the previous year, when he assembled a team and held one or two scrimmages before shelving the idea for the following autumn. The team wore makeshift uniforms with purple and gold ribbons for its first game, a 34–0 loss to Tulane and the only game played by LSU that year. The game was played in front of a crowd of 1,500 at Crescent City Base Ball Park in New Orleans.[5] The game sparked a rivalry between the schools that lasted well into the 20th century. Future Louisiana governor Ruffin G. Pleasant was the quarterback and captain of the LSU team. According to legend, purple and gold were chosen because they were Mardi Gras colors, and the green was sold out.[n 1] The game was the only one Coates ever coached, and the only football game Pleasant played in. Pleasant was later inducted into the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame.[6] LSU achieved its first victory by beating Natchez Athletic Club 26–0 in 1894. Samuel Marmaduke Dinwidie Clark has the honor of scoring the very first touchdown in LSU history. The first football game played on the LSU campus was at State Field on December 3, 1894, a loss against Mississippi. LSU's only touchdown in that game was scored by the head coach, Albert Simmonds.[7] This was the first year of play for William S. Slaughter who lettered as an end for 5 years (1894, 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898). Slaughter was LSU's first five time football letterman. By 1895, LSU had its first win in Baton Rouge. In 1896 LSU hired Allen Jeardeau of Platteville, Wisconsin. LSU went undefeated, winning the school's first conference championship in the school's first year as a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA), the first southern athletics. conference.[8] Tulane was forced to forfeit for its attempt to play Hall of Fame Penn back George H. Brooke.[9] This was the first team to be called the \"Tigers.\" The mascot was reputed to be named after the “Fighting Tigers,” the name of the 9th Louisiana Infantry in the Civil War.[10] Coach Jeardeau returned for his second but final year at LSU in 1897 for two games in Baton Rouge. A yellow fever outbreak throughout the South caused the postponement of LSU's classes starting, and the football season being cut back to only two games. Another outbreak of yellow fever similar to the one in 1897 caused LSU to play only one game in 1898. By the time LSU was able to play its only game of the season, Allen Jeardeau had departed from the school as head football coach, and no provision had been made to replace him. The job of coach then fell to the team's captain, Edmond Chavanne, thus the first LSU alumnus to coach the team. New coach John P. Gregg led the Tigers to a 1–4 season in 1899, including a loss to the \"iron men\" of Sewanee. The only wins were in an exhibition game against a high school team (which LSU does not officially record as a win) and against rival, Tulane. It was the first year of play for LSU's second five-year letterman, John J. Coleman (1899, 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903). Chavanne was rehired in 1900, posting a 2–2 record. Chavanne was replaced by W. S. Borland as head coach in 1901, leading the team to a successful 5–1 season. After the Tulane game, a 22–0 loss, LSU protested to the SIAA, and alleged that Tulane had used a professional player during the game. Several months later, the SIAA ruled the game an 11–0 forfeit in favor of LSU.[11] The seven-game 1902 season was the longest yet for the Tigers and also featured the most games on the road. LSU upset Texas, avenged last season's loss to Auburn, and lost only to Vanderbilt, which claimed an SIAA title after the win. The 1903 season broke the previous season's record for most games played (seven) with nine games. Dan A. Killian coached the Tigers from 1904 to 1906. Back René A. Messa made some All-Southern teams in 1904. The 1905 team went 3–0. In 1907, LSU became the first American college football team to play on foreign soil in the Bacardi Bowl against the University of Havana on Christmas Day in Havana, Cuba. LSU won 56–0. John Seip ran back a 67-yard punt return. The 1908 team posted an undefeated 10–0 record. Quarterback Doc Fenton led the nation in scoring with 132 points, posting then school records of 36 extra points and 6 field goals. Mike Lally was his running mate in the backfield. LSU beat Auburn 10–2, Seip going over for the first touchdown. Auburn's 2 was had by a safety, after T. C. Locke blocked Fenton's punt. Fenton could not recover the fumble because he was knocked unconscious by a spectator's cane.[12] The National Championship Foundation retroactively awarded 1908 LSU the national championship though it is not claimed by LSU. This season also led to an SIAA championship; but was clouded by accusations of professionalism from Grantland Rice and rival school Tulane.[13] Auburn and Vanderbilt were among those listed as alternative conference champions. Both Fenton and Seip were inaugural inductees into the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame. 1910 was a disastrous year for the Tigers. After a strong 1909 campaign under coaches Joe Pritchard and John W. Mayhew, which saw their only conference loss come to SIAA champion Sewanee, the team lost some star power; Stovall, Lally, and Seip had all graduated.[14] Pat Dwyer, an assistant at Auburn in 1908, was hired in 1911. He once used guard Tom Dutton for a \"kangaroo play\" in which back Lawrence Dupont would crawl between Dutton's legs; supposedly very effective in short yardage situations.[15] The 1913 team lost only to SIAA champion Auburn by a touchdown. Fullback Alf Reid made All-Southern.[16] LSU's largest loss margin came on October 31, 1914 in a game against Texas A&M in Dallas, Texas. The final score was Texas A&M 63, LSU 9. In 1916, Walter Camp gave Phillip Cooper honorable mention on his All-America team. Irving Pray and Dana X. Bible also served as the Tigers coach in 1916 Washington's Wayne Sutton coached the 1917 team to a 3–5 record. Irving Pray coached full seasons in 1919 and 1922, the inaugural season of the Southern Conference (SoCon). Branch Bocock led the Tigers for the 1921 season, in which they were beaten only by Tulane.[17] Mike Donahue came from Auburn to be the seventeenth head football coach at LSU in 1923. The biggest win in Donahue's tenure was probably the 20–14 victory over Indiana in 1924.[18] The final game of the 1924 season saw the first game played at Tiger Stadium, with an original seating capacity of 12,000, on Thanksgiving Day against Tulane. 18,000 fans managed to fit into the stadium to watch the Green Wave defeat the Tigers 13–0.[19] In 1925, the team's first full season in Tiger Stadium began with shutout wins over Louisiana Normal and Southwestern Louisiana. The following week coach Wallace Wade's national champion Alabama blew-out LSU in Tiger Stadium, 42–0, which was at the time the worst home loss in school history.[19] The 1925 team also beat John Heisman's Rice team, but ended the season with a second straight shutout loss to Tulane. Donahue resigned after the 1927 season, less than two months after signing a six-year contract extension with the team.[20] LSU compiled a record of 23 wins, 19 losses, and three ties while with Donahue, which included a 5–14–2 record in SoCon games.[21] Vanderbilt coach Dan McGugin recommended Russ Cohen for the LSU job.[22] Cohen's best year at LSU was his first, in 1928. Led by All-Southern captain Jess Tinsley, Tigers posted a 6–2–1 record, suffering losses to Arkansas and Wallace Wade's Alabama Crimson Tide. Star halfback Percy Brown broke his shoulder against Alabama.[23] The tie was to Bill Banker and rival Tulane, which was as good as its ever been from 1929 to 1931. In 1931 LSU played its first night game in Tiger Stadium, a 31–0 victory over Spring Hill. Under West Point's Biff Jones, the 1932 team tied for the Southern Conference championship in its last season as a member of the conference. The 1933 lost no games and was led by track and field athlete Jack Torrance. Jones resigned after the 1934 season after a heated exchange with noted LSU supporter, Louisiana senator Huey P. Long.[24] In the last game of the season, Long was displeased after the team had lost two straight games and were trailing at halftime to Oregon. Long decided to give a motivational speech to the team at halftime, but was turned away by Jones at the locker room door.[25] The ensuing argument ended with Jones declaring to resign, effective at the end of the game.[24] Gaynell Tinsley, the cousin of Jess, has a profile at the College Football Hall of Fame which describes him this way: \"Tinsley was a magnificent athletic specimen, standing 6-0, and weighing 196-pounds, size he used equally well as a defensive stalwart who was a blocking master.\"[26] As a sophomore in 1934, Tinsley had a 65-yard pass reception, thrown by halfback Abe Mickal, against Southern Methodist University, which stood as a record for several years as \"the longest pass in Southern football history.\"[26] Under head coach Bernie Moore, LSU won their first Southeastern Conference (SEC) Championship finishing with a 5–0 conference record and 9–2–0 overall in 1935. LSU played in their first Sugar Bowl game, falling to No. 4 TCU 3–2 at Tulane Stadium. The Tigers and Horned Frogs both took home the Williamson Poll national championship, which is not claimed by LSU. End Gaynell Tinsley was named a consensus All-American in 1935 and 1936, becoming the first All-America selection for LSU. Coach Moore once said, \"Tinsley could have made All-American at any position. He was so tough, he made blockers quit. He's the greatest lineman I ever saw.\" Along with Tinsley in the line were Marvin Stewart, Justin Rukas, and Jeff Barrett. In the backfield were Mickal, Jesse Fatherree, and Pinky Rohm – all members of LSU's \"Early Days\" team of the century.[27] The team's quarterback was Bill May, awarded the Jacobs Blocking Trophy in 1936. The 1936 team won the school's second SEC Championship finishing with a 6–0 conference record and 9–1–1 overall. The Tigers finished runner-up to Minnesota in the AP Poll. LSU won the Williamson Poll and Sagarin Ratings national championships, which are not claimed by the school. LSU's largest margin of victory, and most points scored in a football game came on November 21, in a game at Tiger Stadium against USL (University of Southwestern Louisiana, now University of Louisiana Lafayette). The final score was LSU 93, USL 0. The 1937 team featured Ken Kavanaugh and was upset by Vanderbilt using a hidden ball trick, the school's first-ever victory over a ranked opponent.[28] This season also featured the first game in the Florida–LSU football rivalry, which was won 19–0 by LSU. In 1939, in a game against Holy Cross, Kavanaugh caught four touchdown passes in the 26–7 win. According to Kavanaugh and teammate Young Bussey, Kavanaugh found four rusty nails on the sideline during the game. The next week against Rice, he found another nail and scored another touchdown to give LSU a 7–0 win. The pattern continued against Loyola and Vanderbilt, as Kavanaugh found two nails before each game and in each scored two touchdowns. A sportswriter for the Baton Rouge Advocate claimed he saw coach Moore at a local store stocking up on nails before LSU's game against No. 1 Tennessee.[29] Kavanaugh failed to score in the game, however, and the Tigers lost 20–0.[30] The Nashville Banner named Kavanaugh co-MVP of the Southeastern Conference along with Bob Foxx of Tennessee.[31][32] Kavanaugh was a consensus All-America selection for the 1939 All-America Team. The 1943 team was led by Steve Van Buren, moved to running back because of a lack of players due to World War II conscription,[33] and won the Orange Bowl. Van Buren led the NCAA in scoring that season, with 98 points (110 including the bowl game). The 1946 team played in one of the most notable instances of the Cotton Bowl Classic – \"Ice Bowl.\" LSU, led by head coach Moore and quarterback Y. A. Tittle, entered the game against Arkansas with a 9–1 record. Ice, sleet and snow pelted the stadium as LSU players filled oil drums with charcoal and started fires for makeshift heaters while fans built fires in the stands. LSU dominated the game with a 271–54 advantage in total yards and 15–1 advantage in first downs, but that did not equate to the numbers on the scoreboard; the game ended in a 0–0 tie and LSU finished the season 9–1–1. In 1948, Moore retired, and Gaynell Tinsley, who had been working as an assistant, was promoted to replace his former mentor.[34] The 1949 team made it to the Sugar Bowl, where it was swamped by Oklahoma. Tinsley became the first person to participate in the Sugar Bowl as both a player and a head coach.[35] Tinsley's LSU teams never met with the same success they had achieved in 1949. In seven years as head coach at LSU, Tinsley's teams compiled a record of 35–34–6.[36] In 1955, Paul Dietzel became the head coach at LSU.[37] Jim Taylor was an All-American in 1957, and led the SEC in scoring in 1956 and 1957. During Dietzel's first three years, none of his teams had a winning season. In 1958, however, Dietzel came up with a unique \"three-platoon system.\" Instead of replacing individual players during the game, Dietzel would bring in an entirely new set of players between plays and series. The three teams were called the White Team (the first-string offense and defense), the Gold (Go) Team (the second-string offense), and the Chinese Bandits (the second-string defense). The system worked, as the 1958 team won the school's first claimed national championship, beating No. 12 Clemson 7–0 in the Sugar Bowl. The only score was a pass from Billy Cannon to sophomore Mickey Mangham, one of the smallest players on the team. Cannon won the Heisman Trophy in 1959. On Halloween, late in the game between No. 1 LSU and No. 3 Ole Miss, LSU was trailing 3–0. Cannon returned a punt 89 yards for a TD, breaking seven tackles. This has become known as Cannon's Halloween Run. The Rebels then drove down the field but were stopped on the LSU 1-yard line as the game ended resulting in a 7–3 victory for LSU in Tiger Stadium. In the Sugar Bowl, one of the most anticipated rematches in college football history took place. This game, however, would not be the classic that transpired only weeks before. Ole Miss dominated the game from start to finish and came away with a decisive 21–0 win over the Tigers. LSU finished the season having only given up 29 points. Dietzel left for Army after the 1961 season, and Charles \"Charlie\" McClendon, an assistant since 1953, was named his successor. McClendon picked up where Dietzel left off, with three top ten finishes in his first four years. Doug Moreau broke Fenton's record of 6 field goals in 1965. In the 1966 Cotton Bowl, unranked LSU upset undefeated and No. 2 ranked Arkansas, winning the game 14–7 and snapping Arkansas' 22-game winning streak.[38] In 1972, number 6 LSU survived an upset bid from unranked Ole Miss in Tiger Stadium by winning the game on a touchdown pass from quarterback Bert Jones to running back Brad Davis. Ole Miss fans say the 1972 contest featured a few seconds of free football. The Tigers trailed the Rebels 16–10 with four seconds to play. After a lengthy incompletion by Jones, the game clock still showed one second remaining. The Tigers used the precious second to win the game on the last play, 17–16. A song was written to commemorate the game, called One Second Blues, which is featured on the album \"Hey Fightin' Tigers\".[39] The alleged home-clock advantage inspired a sign at the Louisiana state line, leaving Mississippi, reading, \"You are now entering Louisiana. Set your clocks back four seconds.\"[40][41] For that year, the Ole Miss yearbook reported the score for the game as \"Ole Miss 16, LSU 10 + 7 \". After having just four coaches over 44 years from 1935 to 1979, the team went through eight coaches in a 20-year period from 1980 to 1999. This stretch began with the death of Bo Rein in a plane crash before coaching a single game for the Tigers.[42] Following the 1979 season, NC State head coach Bo Rein was hired to replace McClendon as LSU's head coach. In January 1980, Rein took a recruiting trip to Shreveport, Louisiana. On his January 10, 1980, return trip back to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, his private aircraft crashed, leaving no survivors.[43] Rein and experienced pilot Louis Benscotter left Shreveport in a Cessna 441 aircraft. The flight was planned to be a 40-minute trip, but when Benscotter rerouted east to avoid a storm, air traffic control lost contact with him. The aircraft climbed to 40,000 feet and kept heading due east. After being tracked on radar, the aircraft was eventually intercepted by U.S. Air National Guard Convair F-106 Delta Dart fighter aircraft over North Carolina, a thousand miles off-course and at an altitude of 41,600 ft (12,700 m), 6,600 ft (2,000 m) feet higher than its maximum certified ceiling. The military pilots could not see anyone in the cockpit and the aircraft continued on over the Atlantic Ocean, where it crashed after running out of fuel. A US Coast Guard crew spotted some debris, but no wreckage was ever recovered. The bodies of Rein and Benscotter have never been found.[44] The cause of the crash is undetermined but was most likely cabin depressurization causing hypoxia, a lack of oxygen,[45] resulting in the occupants losing consciousness as in the 1999 South Dakota Learjet crash.[46] Rein's two-month stint at LSU is the fourth shortest head coaching stint in FBS history, behind only George O'Leary's five-day tenure at Notre Dame in December 2001, Mike Haywood's sixteen-day stint at Pittsburgh in December 2010 and Manny Diaz's eighteen-day stint as Temple head coach in December 2018.[47] Jerry Stovall was hired to replace Rein as head coach in 1980.[48] LSU defeated Alabama 20–10 in Birmingham, Alabama in Bear Bryant's last game coaching against LSU, in 1982. LSU's defense held Alabama to 119 yards of total offense,[49] as the Tigers defeated the Tide for the first time since 1970. \"You don't understand how it feels to get hit in the mouth for 11 years,\" Stovall said in the locker room after the game. \"This is going to feel pretty good when it soaks in.\"[50] 1983 was the first season calling LSU football for radio play-by-play man Jim Hawthorne, who served in this role until the 2016 season and became known as the \"Voice of the Tigers\".[51] LSU finished that season with a record of 4–7, and Stovall was dismissed as LSU's head coach.[52] Only two hours after the firing of Stovall, LSU hired Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger as head coach.[53] As the LSU head coach, Arnsparger led the Tigers to two Sugar Bowl berths in three seasons, in 1984 and 1986, both times against Nebraska. In 1984, LSU finished second behind Florida, but because of NCAA rules violations and a postseason ban on Florida, earned the Southeastern Conference (SEC) champion's automatic bid to the Sugar Bowl, with a panel of administrations subsequently voting to strip Florida of the conference championship as part of a reform that prohibits teams on NCAA postseason ban sanctions from earning conference championships. His 1986 LSU squad won the school's first outright SEC title since 1970 and the Tigers' last in the pre-championship game era, though the season was marred somewhat by an upset home loss to Miami University, his alma mater. By 1985, Arnsparger was growing frustrated with various scandals in the LSU athletic department, particularly involving basketball coach Dale Brown. After Sports Illustrated ran a cover story about the university's issues, Arnsparger met privately with athletic director Bob Brodhead to complain that the negative coverage was harming football recruiting and to threaten to leave the school if something wasn't done. Shortly after the final regular season game in 1986, Arnsparger announced he was resigning to become the athletic director at Florida.[54] Mike Archer came to LSU as an assistant coach in 1984 after being both a player and an assistant coach at Miami. He replaced Bill Arnsparger as the LSU Tigers football head coach in 1987 when Arnsparger left to become the athletic director at the University of Florida.[55] Archer was Arnsparger's defensive coordinator in 1985 and 1986, and was Arnsparger's hand-picked successor. When Archer took the LSU head coaching job, he was 34 years old, the youngest head coach in Division I-A football. Archer was chosen over a number of interviewed candidates, which reportedly included Steve Spurrier, Mike Shanahan, and Mack Brown. In 1987, LSU finished the season ranked #5 in both major polls with a 10–1–1 record, blemished only by a tie against Ohio State and a loss to Alabama. The latter was all that kept the Tigers out of the 1988 Sugar Bowl; Auburn went instead. It was LSU's first 10-win season in more than 25 years. In 1988, unranked LSU staged a near-literal, earth-shattering upset victory over No. 4 Auburn in Tiger Stadium, winning the game 7–6 with 1:41 remaining on a touchdown pass from quarterback Tommy Hodson to tailback Eddie Fuller. The reaction of the crowd was so immense that it registered as an earthquake on a seismograph in LSU's Howe-Russell Geoscience Complex.[56] It was later dubbed \"The Earthquake Game\" by ESPN.[57] After back-to-back losing seasons in 1989 and 1990, Archer was forced to resign.[58] He lost four of his last five games in 1990, the lone win coming in the season finale against Tulane. Archer was replaced by Southern Miss head coach Curley Hallman.[59] During Hallman's first season in 1991, several of Hallman's football players were accused of instigating a fight with LSU men's basketball players, including All-American Shaquille O'Neal, in Broussard Hall, LSU's athletic dormitory, two days prior to the Tigers' contest with Mississippi State.[60][61] LSU started the 1991 season with one-sided losses to Georgia (31–10) and Hallman's alma mater, Texas A&M (45–7), and finished 5–6. The season marked the second time LSU suffered three consecutive losing seasons, and the first time since 1954 to 1956. The 1992 season included being shut out 32–0 by Ole Miss on Halloween, and beaten 30–6 at Arkansas in the season finale, which was the first meeting between the Tigers and the Razorbacks upon Arkansas joining the SEC. The Tigers finished 2–9, still the worst in school history. In 1993, LSU's centennial football season, the Tigers lost 58–3 to the Florida Gators in Tiger Stadium, the worst loss in school history. Amazingly, just four weeks after that, the Tigers stunned the Alabama Crimson Tide, 17–13, at Bryant–Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, ending the Tide's 31-game unbeaten streak. LSU entered the season finale at 5–5, with a chance at its first bowl bid since the end of the 1988 season. However, the Tigers gave up 412 yards rushing in a 42–24 loss to Arkansas at home. The beginning of the end for Hallman came on September 17, 1994, at Jordan–Hare Stadium against Auburn. LSU led 23–9 early in the fourth quarter, and the Bayou Bengals were in good position to end Auburn's 13-game winning streak. But LSU quarterback Jamie Howard threw two interceptions that were returned for Auburn touchdowns, tying the game. LSU regained the lead with a field goal, but when the Bayou Bengals were trying to run out the clock, Howard threw his fourth interception of the game, and incredibly, Auburn returned the pick for another touchdown, giving the home team a 30–26 lead. LSU drove into Auburn territory in the game's final minute, but Howard threw his fifth and sixth interceptions on consecutive drives, sealing the win for Auburn. LSU never recovered, and ultimately finished 4–7. On November 12, LSU lost to Southern Miss, Hallman's former team, 20–18 in front of the smallest Death Valley crowd since 1974 (announced attendance was 51,718, but LSU officials estimated the actual crowd was closer to 40,000). Two days later, LSU athletic director Joe Dean gave Hallman an ultimatum–resign or be fired. When Hallman refused to resign, Dean fired him, though he was allowed to finish out the season.[62] He closed out his career at LSU with a 30–12 win over Arkansas—the Tigers' first regular-season win in the series since 1956. His overall record was 16–28; his winning percentage of .364 is the worst for a non-interim coach in school history. On December 13, 1994, LSU hired Vanderbilt head coach Gerry DiNardo as Hallman's replacement.[63] Prior to the 1995 season, DiNardo petitioned the NCAA to reverse a rule which had been in place since 1983 that prohibited teams from wearing white jerseys at home. After the ruling, LSU was able to wear its white jerseys at home in Tiger Stadium for the first time since 1982.[64] For its first home game of the 1995 season in what was dubbed the “Bring Back the Magic\" Game, LSU in white jerseys upset No. 5 Auburn, winning 12–6.[65] With no time remaining in the game, LSU defensive back Troy Twillie intercepted Auburn quarterback Patrick Nix's 11-yard pass into the end zone to secure the victory.[65] The Tigers achieved their first winning season in six seasons and finished with a 7–4–1 record defeating a Nick Saban led Michigan State team in the 1995 Independence Bowl.[66] After nine straight losses to Steve Spurrier-led Florida, the No. 14 Tigers defeated the No. 1 ranked defending national champion Gators 28–21 in Tiger Stadium in 1997. LSU running back Kevin Faulk was featured on the following week's cover of Sports Illustrated with the title \"See you later, Gators.\"[67] In a game referred to as, \"No. 1 Falls,\" it was the first time LSU defeated a No. 1 ranked team and the first time the goalposts were ever torn down in Tiger Stadium.[68] In 1998, LSU started the season with a preseason ranking of No. 9. They climbed to No. 6 before losing to No. 12 Georgia on October 3. The next week the No. 11-ranked Tigers lost to the No. 6 Florida. After the loss to the Gators, LSU dropped 13 of the next 17 games, including losses to a No. 10 Notre Dame and No. 13 Arkansas later in the 1998 season. In 1999 LSU lost to No. 10 Georgia, No. 8 Florida, No. 12 Mississippi State, No. 25 Ole Miss, and No. 12 Alabama.[69] On November 15, 1999, two days after the Tigers lost to unranked Houston at home, LSU chancellor Mark Emmert fired DiNardo with one game remaining in the season. DiNardo was given the option to coach the final game of the season against Arkansas, but DiNardo declined.[70] Instead, offensive line coach Hal Hunter was named interim coach, leading LSU to a 35–10 victory over the Razorbacks. On December 1, 1999, LSU hired Michigan State head coach Nick Saban as DiNardo's replacement.[71] In Saban's first season of 2000, LSU returned to national prominence by beating No. 11 Tennessee in overtime 38–31 on ESPN, after which the goal posts were torn down for only the 2nd time in the history of Tiger Stadium. The victory over Tennessee also marked the first time that LSU played in an overtime game at home. Just a few weeks later, the goal posts were again ripped down as LSU beat Alabama 30–28 on CBS in Baton Rouge for the first time in 31 years. This was the 3rd and final time that the goal posts came down in Death Valley. In 2001, No. 21 LSU staged an upset victory over No. 2 Tennessee in the SEC Championship, winning 31–20. The victory earned LSU a spot in its first Sugar Bowl since 1986, and knocked the Volunteers out of national title contention. No. 16 LSU survived an upset bid from unranked Kentucky in 2002 by winning the game 33–30 on a miraculous 75-yard Hail Mary pass as time expired known as the \"Bluegrass Miracle\". Kentucky coach Guy Morriss had received the traditional Gatorade bath right before the Hail Mary. Kentucky fans, believing they had won, had already rushed the field and torn down one goal post. In 2003, No. 11 LSU outlasted No. 7 Georgia, 17–10. With ESPN College Gameday on hand for the first time since 1997, Quarterback Matt Mauck found wide receiver Skyler Green for a 34-yard touchdown with 3:03 remaining in the game. All-American cornerback Corey Webster sealed the victory with an interception in the final minute. The contest dubbed the \"Let the Valley Shake\" Game is notable for LSU fans chanting LSU-LSU after a Georgia touchdown.[72] Georgia head coach Mark Richt was quoted as saying, \"Usually when the opposing team does well, the crowd quiets down.[72] All I began to hear was a chant, 'L-S-U, L-S-U.'[72] It got louder and louder and louder. It was the loudest I've ever heard a stadium.\"[72] The win catapulted LSU onto the national scene. LSU won its second title and became the BCS national champion by defeating Oklahoma 21–14 in the 2004 Sugar Bowl (BCS National Championship Game). The following season saw the Tigers post a 9–3 record, ending the year with a No. 16 ranking after a loss in the 2005 Capital One Bowl on a final play touchdown pass. Prior to the game, Saban announced that he would be leaving LSU to become the head coach for the Miami Dolphins.[73] On January 4, 2005, Oklahoma State head coach Les Miles was named the new LSU head coach.[74] In Miles's first season in 2005 at LSU was moved to Arizona State's Sun Devil Stadium due to the effects of Hurricane Katrina. With one endzone painted with \"www.KatrinaSRF.com\" and the other with \"Together We Stand\" along with logos of the states of Louisiana and Arizona, LSU rallied in the fourth quarter for a 35–31 comeback victory. Trailing 17–7 in the fourth quarter, LSU returned a blocked field goal and punt for touchdowns to ignite the comeback. The lead went back-and-forth with Arizona State taking a 31–28 lead with 4:07 to play. Quarterback JaMarcus Russell then lead the Tigers on a 10-play, 91-yard drive capped with a 39-yard touchdown pass to Early Doucet on fourth-and-10 to give LSU a 35–31 lead. LSU's defense then stopped Arizona State on downs at the LSU 30-yard line to secure the victory. In 2006, Russell completed a touchdown pass to WR Early Doucet with 9 seconds to go to beat Tennessee in Neyland Stadium after a breakout performance by Tennessee backup QB Jonathan Crompton. No. 2 LSU played what was hyped as one of the most exciting games ever played in Tiger Stadium against No. 9 Florida in 2007. The game is also known for the LSU students leaving thousands of messages on the phone of Florida quarterback, Tim Tebow, prompting him to give a \"telephone\" hand gesture to the LSU student section following an early touchdown. Florida began the fourth quarter with a 24–14 lead, but behind solid defense and being a perfect 5 for 5 on fourth down conversions, the Tigers were able to take the lead 28–24 with 1:06 left in the game after a Jacob Hester touchdown to defeat the Gators. It was LSU's first national primetime game on CBS since 1981 and the game has been dubbed, \"Primetime Drama.\" LSU went on to defeat No. 1 Ohio State in the BCS national championship 38–24, becoming the first school to win two BCS national championship titles and improving their BCS record to 4–0, the best of any team. They also became the first two loss team to ever play in the BCS national championship. In the 5th game of the 2010 season, undefeated No. 12 LSU trailed the Volunteers 14–10 with 0:04 left on the clock and the ball spotted on Tennessee's 2-yard line. On 3rd and goal, after a failed quarterback sneak attempt and with time disappearing off the clock, LSU attempted to send in several players for a substitution package. Seeing that the time was about to expire, center T-Bob Hebert snapped the ball before quarterback Jordan Jefferson was ready, the ball was fumbled, Jefferson was tackled, and the clock expired. On further review, Tennessee was penalized half the distance to the goalline for illegal participation. Amid the confusion in the waning seconds, Tennessee coaches sent 4 players onto the field when they saw LSU make a substitution. Only two players then left the field, leaving the Volunteers with 13 players lined up on defense. Due to the penalty, LSU got the ball back for a single untimed play on the 1-yard line. With the last play, running back Stevan Ridley received the toss sweep, charging forward, only to be hit near the line of scrimmage, but continued to drive forward through two Tennessee defenders and into the endzone for the game-winning score. The ninth regulation game of the 2011 season for LSU found the No. 1 nationally ranked Tigers against the No. 2 Alabama Crimson Tide in a match called the \"Game of the Century\"[75] or the \"Matchup of the Year\".[76] Both teams were undefeated and both were also coming off a bye week; viewed as important to the BCS Championship game as the \"inside track\" by many of the sportswriters, the press built up the game in a Super Bowl-style atmosphere. Ultimately, the game came down to field position and a series of field goals as the top-ranked defense of both teams prevented any touchdowns. Alabama missed three field goals and a fourth was blocked during regulation, leading to a 6–6 tie heading into overtime. On the first possession of overtime, Alabama again missed a field goal from 52 yards out, only to watch LSU earn the win on the next possession with a chip-shot field goal. As a result, it was the second-lowest scoring matchup between No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the history of the NCAA, with a 9–6 decision.[77] For the first time in BCS National Championship history, two SEC teams, the No. 1 LSU Tigers and the No. 2 Alabama Crimson Tide, again faced each other in the National Championship Game. Alabama won the game, 21–0. The SEC-only title game added impetus to the push for a national playoff system and hastened the death of the BCS system as implemented up to that time.[78] Having lost three straight games after a 7–0 start into the season, rumors were floating that LSU would buy-out Miles' contract after the 2015 season.[79] However, Miles was retained for the 2016 season.[80] On September 25, 2016, LSU fired Miles and offensive coordinator Cam Cameron after an 18–13 loss to Auburn the previous day and a 2–2 start to begin the season.[81] After the firing of Les Miles, defensive line coach Ed Orgeron became LSU's interim head coach.[82] Orgeron stated that he was going to \"flip the script\". He promoted tight ends coach Steve Ensminger to offensive coordinator and brought back Pete Jenkins to take over as defensive line coach. Orgeron also decided to shorten practices and spend more time in the film room in order to keep players fresh. In addition, he brought the \"theme of daily practices\" he modeled from coach Pete Carroll during Orgeron's first stint as an assistant at USC. These practice days have descriptive nicknames like Tell the Truth Monday, Competition Tuesday, Turnover Wednesday, No Repeat Thursday, and Focus Friday. Under Orgeron's watch, LSU finished out the season with a 6–2 record. Later in 2016, he was hired as the full-time head coach.[83] The beginning of the 2017 season saw Orgeron hire Matt Canada to be the offensive coordinator. Canada was known for an offensive playbook that was heavily based on setting skilled positions in motion prior to the snap, thus using jet sweeps often. The season began with LSU ranked in the top 15, but early losses to Mississippi State and Troy quickly found LSU unranked. However, the team went 7–2 in their remaining games, finishing the year with a 9–4 record. The 2018 season began with a season opening upset of 8th-ranked Miami, followed by another upset of 7th-ranked Auburn. These victories helped LSU rise to 5th in the CFP rankings, but a loss to 25th-ranked Florida sent LSU tumbling back to 13th. In response, the Tigers pulled off a shocking upset of No. 2 Georgia.[84] The Tigers then avenged the previous year's loss to Mississippi State. The victories over Georgia and Mississippi State propelled LSU to being ranked No. 3 by the CFP going into a game against top-ranked Alabama. The LSU offense that had seemed to turn around after Steve Ensminger took over the duties of offensive coordinator was unable to score against Alabama's defense. After the loss to Alabama, LSU was able to defeat Arkansas and Rice before falling to Texas A&M in a 7-overtime game. With a 9–3 record, LSU was invited to the Fiesta Bowl to play the University of Central Florida, who had not lost a game in the previous two seasons. On New Years Day 2019, LSU gave UCF their first loss since 2016. LSU finished the 2018 season with a record of 10–3 and were ranked sixth in the nation by the AP poll and seventh by the Coaches poll. LSU was not predicted to have a good season in 2018, and some, including SEC commentator Paul Finebaum, believed it would be Orgeron's last until he had a turnaround season. After opening the season with a home win versus Georgia Southern, Orgeron's 2019 team recorded a statement road win over Texas in week two. The key play of the game was a third down pass needing seventeen yards for a first down late in the fourth quarter.[85][86] The Joe Burrow to Justin Jefferson pass resulted in a 61-yard touchdown sealing the victory.[87] That play led to the game being labeled the \"3rd-and-17\" Game.[85][88] This game propelled the team to an undefeated regular season, including a 46–41 victory over Alabama in the 2019 version of the \"Game of the Century\" at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa. A win over Arkansas in the penultimate game of the regular season clinched the SEC West division title and secured a berth in the 2019 SEC Championship Game against Georgia. This was their first appearance in the SEC Championship Game since 2011. The traditionally defensive-minded Tigers averaged over 48 points per game, led by quarterback Joe Burrow, Baton Rouge-native running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire, and star receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson. Burrow set new LSU and SEC single-season records for passing yards with 4,366; his 44 touchdown passes set a new LSU record and tied the SEC mark. Orgeron's Tigers defeated the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship Game to win their first SEC title since 2011. On Sunday, December 8, 2019, they were named the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff. They met the Big 12 Conference champion Oklahoma Sooners in the semifinals in the Peach Bowl, defeating them by a score of 63–28. Following the regular season, Orgeron was named the winner of the 2019 AP College Football Coach of the Year Award and Home Depot Coach of the Year Award. Joe Burrow won the 2019 Heisman Trophy.[89] On January 13, 2020, Orgeron won his first national championship as a head coach with a win over the unbeaten defending national champion Clemson Tigers, 42–25, finishing the season 15–0.[90] Orgeron and the LSU Tigers won the national title in their home state at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. LSU's 2020 season was shortened in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. They played a ten-game, all-SEC schedule. LSU started the season ranked No. 6 in the AP Poll, but dropped out of the rankings after three games and finished the season with a record of 5–5. The Tigers had three different starting quarterbacks throughout the course of the season. Myles Brennan started the first three games, but was injured during the game against Missouri on October 10 and was lost for the season. T. J. Finley started the next five games. Max Johnson started the final two games of the season. He led the Tigers to an upset win over the No. 6 Florida Gators in Gainesville and a shootout win over Ole Miss in the season finale. In March 2021, a woman testifying in front of Louisiana state legislators claimed that she had reported an instance of sexual harassment by LSU running back Derrius Guice to Orgeron, but that the coach had taken no action against him, and in fact called the woman and asked her to forgive Guice. Despite high expectations and a favorable schedule, LSU stumbled to a 3–3 start in 2021, losing several games in which they were favored. Following the tumultuous start, Orgeron's Tigers were able to upend the No. 20-ranked Florida Gators in a thrilling rivalry game matchup. Despite the victory, LSU administrators announced the following day, on October 17, 2021, that they had reached a mutual agreement for Orgeron to leave the program at the end of the 2021 season.[91][92] Orgeron's last game was a last-second victory against Texas A&M at home, which allowed the Tigers to finish the season at 6–6 and become bowl eligible. Despite this, Orgeron announced shortly after the game that he would not coach in the bowl game, and that offensive line coach Brad Davis would be named interim head coach. On November 30, 2021, Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly was named the 34th head coach at LSU, replacing Ed Orgeron.[93] Kelly cited \"wanting to be with the best\" and \"the commitment to excellence, rich traditions, and unrivaled pride and passion of LSU Football\" for the move.[94] His signed contract also more than triples his previous salary, from his 2021 salary of $2.67 million to $9 million in 2022 with the total deal being worth $95 million over ten years excluding incentives. His season started with a 24–23 loss to Florida State in the Allstate Louisiana Kickoff at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. Florida State had a 24–10 lead, but LSU slowly chipped away at the Seminoles' lead and scored a last-second touchdown to make the game 24–23. The Tigers opted to kick the extra point to force overtime, but Florida State was able to successfully block the kick, and thus sealed the victory.[95] Moving forward, the Tigers would win 4 straight against Southern, Mississippi State, New Mexico, and Auburn before eventually losing to Tennessee by a score of 13–40. The Tigers would then go on to beat Florida, upset #7 ranked Ole Miss, upset #6 ranked Alabama 32–31, beat unranked Arkansas 13–10, clinching the SEC West and earning a spot in the 2022 SEC Championship against #1 ranked Georgia. They would go on to win against UAB 41-10 but lose to Texas A&M 23–38. LSU has been independent and affiliated with three conferences.[96]: 181–196 [inconsistent] LSU claims four national championships (1958, 2003, 2007, and 2019)[97] and have been selected national champions in four additional seasons (1908, 1936, 1962, 2011) by NCAA-designated major selectors.[98] They are additionally recorded as being the Williamson System co-champions for 1935, an apparent error in the NCAA records book.[98][99] In 1958 they finished as the only undefeated team with a victory over Clemson in the Sugar Bowl, and were named the national champions by both major polls (AP and Coaches). In 2003, 2007, and 2019 LSU claimed the national championship after winning a postseason bowl national championship game. Claimed national championships: 1958 national championshipThe 1958 LSU Tigers football team under head coach Paul Dietzel, cruised to an undefeated season capped by a win over Clemson in the 1959 Sugar Bowl. LSU was named the national champion in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll prior to their 7-0 Sugar Bowl victory over Clemson. LSU's shutout victory over #12 Clemson was convincing and highlighted LSU as the only team in the country to go undefeated. Army, Auburn, and Air Force did not lose all season but they each had one game that ended in a tie. It was the first recognized national championship for LSU in the poll era. With a 10–0 regular season record, LSU was crowned national champion by the Associated Press and the Coaches' Poll (UPI), as well as by 37 other selectors. LSU's total first place votes was 130 to win the 1958 National Championship in the AP poll. LSU received 29 of the 35 first-place votes to win the #1 ranking in the Coaches poll. LSU earned the #1 rankings in the AP and Coaches poll during week 6 and held on to the #1 rankings for the rest of the year to win the 1958 National Championship in both major polls. [100] 2003 national championshipThe 2003 LSU Tigers football team was coached by Nick Saban. LSU won the BCS National Championship, the first national championship for LSU since 1958. The Tigers battled for an 11–1 regular season record and then defeated Georgia in the SEC Championship Game. The LSU Tigers faced off against Oklahoma for the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) national title. LSU beat Oklahoma 21–14 in the 2004 Sugar Bowl designated as the BCS National Championship Game. 2007 national championshipThe 2007 LSU Tigers football team, coached by Les Miles, won the Southeastern Conference championship and the national championship with a 12–2 record. The LSU Tigers took on the top ranked Ohio State Buckeyes in the 2008 BCS National Championship Game defeating them 38–24. This win made the LSU Tigers the first team to win two BCS National Championships in its history. On their way to the BCS championship, the Tigers won their tenth Southeastern Conference championship by defeating Tennessee in the 2007 SEC Championship Game. LSU became the first program to win multiple BCS National Championship Games and the second program to win a national championship with multiple losses. 2019 national championshipThe 2019 LSU Tigers football team, coached by Ed Orgeron, won the Southeastern Conference championship and the national championship with a 15–0 record. The LSU Tigers defeated the Clemson Tigers in the 2020 College Football Playoff National Championship defeating them 42–25. On their way to the College Football Playoff National Championship, the Tigers won their twelfth Southeastern Conference championship by defeating Georgia in the 2019 SEC Championship Game. LSU has won a total of 16 conference championships in three different conferences.[101]: 107 Since becoming a founding member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 1933, LSU has won 12 SEC championships. ‡ LSU claims a co-championship,[101]: 107 while Clemson claims a sole championship.[102] Since the SEC began divisional play in 1992, LSU has won or shared the SEC West title 10 times, and is 5–2 in the SEC Championship game.[101]: 119–121 Helmets Pre-1946, LSU wore leather helmets. From 1947 through 1955, LSU wore an old gold helmet. In 1956, head coach Paul Dietzel changed the color of the helmet to a yellow-gold similar to that of the Green Bay Packers. It featured a white one-inch center stripe with purple three-quarter inch flanking stripes. From 1957 through 1971, LSU added jersey numbers to the sides of the helmet. In 1972, the first logo was introduced, a tiger head inside a purple circle with LSU written underneath the tiger head. In 1977, LSU introduced its current helmet. The logo features curved LSU lettering written above the Tiger head logo. Purple face masks were introduced in 1980. In 2014, LSU introduced a new Tiger head logo. Special helmets Jerseys The current style of jerseys were introduced by coach Paul Dietzel in 1957 with \"TV\" numerals on the shoulders. Those numbers were moved to the sleeves in 1959. LSU's white jerseys have purple numbers on the front, back and sleeves with a gold center stripe flanked by two purple stripes encircling the shoulders. LSU's purple jerseys have white numbers on the front, back and sleeves with a white center stripe flanked by two yellow stripes encircling the shoulders. Names were added to the backs of jerseys in 1972. LSU has worn gold jerseys four times recently: vs. Vanderbilt in 1996, vs. Notre Dame in the 1997 Independence Bowl, at Florida in 1998 and throwbacks vs. Mississippi State in 2016. LSU also wore gold jerseys as their primary jerseys during the 1940s. Save for the throwback jerseys, LSU wore gold due to the intense dislike of purple exhibited by then-LSU coach Gerry DiNardo. DiNardo's successor, Nick Saban, resurrected purple jerseys for the second game of the 2000 season vs. Houston. Since the wearing of white jerseys has become a tradition for LSU football, the white jerseys are typically worn for both home and away games.[105] The exception is for non-SEC home games, other than the home opener, where LSU wears purple jerseys. Also, though rare, in the case of away games the home teams may choose to wear white, and if so, purple is the default for LSU; this occurred in the 2004 season opener vs. Oregon State, which did not want to wear its black jerseys in the intense Louisiana heat. In 2015, South Carolina was forced to move its scheduled home game vs. LSU to Baton Rouge due to severe flooding in Columbia, South Carolina. Prior to the site change, the Gamecocks declared they would wear white jerseys at Williams-Brice Stadium, so the Tigers wore purple jerseys for the first time for an SEC game in Tiger Stadium (South Carolina was the designated home team) since 1994 vs. Alabama. In 2019, LSU was asked by the Southeastern Conference to wear purple jerseys for its away game vs. Vanderbilt to provide sufficient contrast to the Commodores' gray jerseys. From 1983 through 1994, LSU was mandated to wear purple jerseys at home, due to an NCAA rule which required the visiting team to wear white jerseys (LSU wore white jerseys as the designated home team for the 1987 Sugar Bowl vs. Nebraska and 1987 Gator Bowl vs. South Carolina). In 1995, the NCAA changed the rule to allow the home team to wear white if it obtained prior approval of the visiting team. In 1997, the Southeastern Conference ruled the home team would have choice of jersey color without consent of the visitors for conference games. Pants The team traditionally wears one style of pants, which are gold with white and purple trim. For a 1995 game at Kentucky, the Tigers wore purple pants, which had no stripes and a tiger head logo on the left thigh. LSU lost to the Wildcats 24–16 and the pants were never worn again.[106] LSU has worn white pants on 16 occasions since 1996: 5-yard lines – Tiger Stadium is notable for putting all 5-yard line numbers on the field, not just those that are multiples of 10. However, the 10-yard line numbers are the only numbers that get directional arrows, as the rules make no provision for 5-yard line numbers.[107] H-style goal posts – LSU's Tiger Stadium sports \"H\" style goal posts, as opposed to the more modern \"Y\" style used by most other schools today. This \"H\" style allows the team to run through the goal post in the north end zone when entering the field.[107] The crossbar from the goalposts which stood in the north end zone of Tiger Stadium from 1955 through 1984 is now mounted above the door which leads from LSU's locker room onto the playing field. The crossbar is painted with the word \"WIN!\", and superstition dictates every player entering the field touch the bar on his way out the door. Night games in Tiger Stadium – The tradition of playing night games in Tiger Stadium began on October 3, 1931, when LSU defeated Spring Hill 35–0. Several reasons were cited for playing at night such as avoiding the heat and humidity of afternoon games, avoiding scheduling conflicts with Tulane and Loyola football and giving more fans the opportunity to see the Tigers play. Attendance increased and night football became an LSU tradition. LSU has also traditionally played better during night games based on winning percentage.[108] Pregame show – Louisiana State University Tiger Marching Band \"pregame show\" was created in 1964, and revised over the next nine years into its current format. The marching band lines up along the end zone shortly before kick off. Then the band strikes up a drum cadence and begins to spread out evenly across the field. When the front of the band reaches the center of the field, the band stops and begins to play an arrangement of \"Pregame\" (Hold That Tiger). While it does this, the band turns to salute the fans in all four corners of the stadium. Then the band, resuming its march across the field, begins playing \"Touchdown for LSU\". Tailgating – For home football games, thousands of LSU fans gather on the Baton Rouge campus. They set up motor homes and tents as early as Thursday before Saturday football games.[109] Tailgating is found across the entire campus with many fans tailgating in the same spot year after year. LSU has been consistently ranked as the top tailgating location in the country. ESPN.com ranked LSU as the top tailgating destination in America.[citation needed] The Sporting News proclaimed \"Saturday Night in Death Valley\" and Tiger tailgating as the top tradition in college football.[110] Sports Illustrated said, \"When It Comes To Great Tailgating, Nothing Compares To LSU.\"[111] LSU's tailgating was named No. 1 in an Associated Press poll on top tailgating spots and by a CNN network survey on top tailgating locations.[112] Victory Gold – In 2012, a new tradition was established at Tiger Stadium. Following an LSU football victory, the lights that illuminate the upper arches on the north end of the stadium light up in LSU \"Victory Gold\".[113] Victory Hill – The LSU football players, coaches, cheerleaders and Mike the Tiger in his cage, \"Walk Down Victory Hill\" on North Stadium Drive prior to each home game on their way to Tiger Stadium.[107] Thousands of fans line both sides of the road to watch and cheer for the Tigers football team. The practice was started under head coach Gerry Dinardo and it endures today. The LSU Tiger Marching Band or The Golden Band from Tigerland, Golden Girls and Colorguard, \"March Down Victory Hill\" about an hour prior to each home game. Fans line both sides of the road and listen for the cadence of drums announcing the band's departure from the Greek Theatre and await the arrival of the band.[114] The band stops on top of Victory Hill and begins to play their drum cadence while beginning to march down Victory Hill. The band then stops on Victory Hill and begins to play the opening strains of the \"Pregame Salute.\" Then, while playing the introduction to \"Touchdown for LSU,\" the band begins to run in tempo through the streets and down the hill amidst the crowd of cheering fans. From there, the band enters the PMAC and plays a pep rally for TAF members. White jerseys – LSU is notable as one of the few college football teams that wears white jerseys for home games as opposed to their darker jerseys (in their case, purple). Most other NCAA football teams wear their darker jerseys in home games, even though football is one of the few college sports that do not require a specific jersey type for each respective team (for instance, college basketball requires home teams to wear white or light-colored jerseys while the away team wears their darker jerseys), and is similar to the National Football League in letting the home team decide what to wear. The tradition started in 1958, when Coach Paul Dietzel decided that LSU would wear white jerseys for home games. Another story is the tradition first started when Dietzel had LSU wear white at home for good luck against a ranked Georgia Tech team in 1957 because Georgia Tech's team had long been known for wearing white at home. LSU won the game and he continued that tradition for the 1958 season and LSU went on to win the national championship that year. Since the 1958 championship season, LSU continued to wear white jerseys at home games through the 18-year tenure of Charles McClendon. Then in 1983, new NCAA rules prohibited teams from wearing white jerseys at home. Because of this, LSU wore purple jerseys during home games from 1983 to 1994. The team's fans believed wearing purple jerseys were \"bad luck\" and often complained about being forced to wear purple jerseys at home.[115] In 1995, LSU's new coach, Gerry DiNardo, was determined to restore LSU's tradition of white home jerseys. DiNardo personally met with each member of the NCAA Football Rules Committee, lobbying LSU's case. DiNardo was successful, and LSU again began wearing white jerseys at home when the 1995 season began. In LSU's first home game with the white jerseys, unranked LSU prevailed in a 12–6 upset victory over No. 6 Auburn.[116] The 1995 rule allowing LSU to wear white at home had one stipulation: the visiting team must agree for conference and non-conference games. In 1997, the SEC amended its rule to allow the home team its choice of jersey color for conference games without prior approval of the visiting team. Therefore, only for non-conference home games does the home team seek permission to wear white jerseys at home. In 2009, the NCAA further relaxed the previous rule that required most away teams to wear white. The rule now states that teams must simply wear contrasting colors.[117] After the 1995 rule change, on three occasions LSU was forced to wear colored jerseys at Tiger Stadium. The first time was in 1996 against Vanderbilt, who was still angry at LSU for hiring Gerry DiNardo, who left Vanderbilt to become LSU's head coach after the 1994 season. LSU wore gold jerseys for that game (a 35–0 LSU victory), and fans were encouraged to wear white in an effort to \"white out\" the Commodores. The other was in 2004 when Oregon State did not want to suffer in its black jerseys due to the humid weather of Louisiana in late summer, thus forcing LSU to wear its purple jerseys for a nationally televised game on ESPN. On October 10, 2015, LSU was scheduled to play a road conference game at South Carolina, but due to massive flooding in the state of South Carolina, the game was relocated from Columbia to Baton Rouge. Despite the game being played at Tiger Stadium, South Carolina was still the designated home team and had first choice of jersey selection. South Carolina chose to wear white as they had originally planned, forcing LSU to wear their purple jerseys at Tiger Stadium for an SEC game for the first time since 1994.[118] After the 1995 rule change, LSU was forced to wear colored jerseys on the road on four occasions. In 1998 and 2000, Florida coach Steve Spurrier exercised this option and forced LSU to don a colored jersey at Gainesville. The Tigers wore gold in 1998 under Gerry DiNardo (lost 22–10) and purple in 2000 under Nick Saban (lost 41–9). In 2007 and 2009, LSU also wore its purple jerseys on the road at Mississippi State, but the Tigers emerged victorious both times (45–0 in 2007 and 30–26 in 2009).[119] Callin' Baton Rouge – The Garth Brooks song \"Callin' Baton Rouge\" is played at each game.[120] Geaux Tigers – A common cheer for all LSU athletics, Geaux Tigers, pronounced \"Go Tigers\", is derived from a common ending in Cajun French names, -eaux. Fans began using this spelling in the 1990s to add local flavor to the standard cheer. The phrase was trademarked by the university in 2005.[121] Hot Boudin – A cheer before and during games about famous food in Louisiana. It goes \"Hot boudin, cold coush-coush, come on tigers, push push push.\"[122] Push is pronounced poosh to rhyme with coush-coush [koosh-koosh]. Coush-coush is a Cajun dish generally served for breakfast.[123] Neck - A rendition of \"Talkin' Out the Side of Your Neck\", a marching band tune commonly performed by HBCU bands.[124] Performances of \"Neck\" have been infamous due to a vulgar chant based on the song's chorus (\"Suck that Tiger dick, bitch\"). In an effort to curb the chant, the tune was banned in 2010, before being allowed sparingly since 2013.[125] During a 2018 game against Georgia, the crowd broke into the chant several times despite \"Neck\" never being played.[126] The tune is reportedly planned to be included in the upcoming video game EA Sports College Football 25.[127] Tiger bait – LSU fans will yell \"Tiger Bait, Tiger Bait\" at visiting fans.[128] Tiger Bandits – Whenever LSU forces a turnover or gets the ball back via a defensive stop, the LSU band plays the Tiger Bandits song and LSU fans bow in respect to the defensive stop. The original title of the song was called \"Chinese Bandits\", but the title was eventually changed to \"Tiger Bandits\" (or just simply \"Bandits\") to make the tradition more inclusive. The term \"Chinese Bandits\" originated as the nickname that LSU Coach Paul Dietzel gave to the defensive unit he organized in 1958, which helped LSU to win its first national championship. The next season, the 1959 Chinese Bandit defense held their opponents to an average of only 143.2 yards per game. No LSU defense since has done better.[96] Jersey No. 18 is an LSU tradition established in 2003 when quarterback Matt Mauck guided LSU to a national championship. After Mauck's final season, he passed jersey No. 18 to running back Jacob Hester, who helped LSU win the 2007 national championship. The jersey became synonymous with success on and off the field as well as having a selfless attitude. Each season, a player is chosen by the coaching staff to wear the No. 18 jersey.[129] In 2017, it was the first year LSU awarded the jersey to two players, one each on offense and defense.[130] Beginning in 2012, LSU had a high number of defensive backs earn recognition for their play, leading to both current and former players to refer to the school as \"Defensive Back University\", or \"DBU\".[142][143] This has led to a sense of pride among LSU defensive backs, who strive to continue the tradition of excellence at the position.[144] Since 2005, 28 LSU defensive backs have been drafted into the NFL, including seven in the first round: LaRon Landry (6th pick in 2007), Patrick Peterson (5th pick in 2011), Morris Claiborne (6th pick in 2012), Eric Reid (18th pick in 2013), Jamal Adams (6th pick in 2017), Tre'Davious White (27th pick in 2017), and Derek Stingley Jr. (3rd pick in 2022).[145] Additionally, since 2013, LSU has also been recognized for their development of wide receivers, leading to the nickname of \"Wide Receiver University\", or \"WRU\". Particularly, LSU has been noted for its history of successful wide receiver duos, with the program having three seasons where two receivers had at least 1,000 yards receiving: 2013 (Jarvis Landry and Odell Beckham Jr.), 2019 (Ja'Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson), and 2023 (Malik Nabers and Brian Thomas Jr.). The duo of Chase and Jefferson were considered instrumental pieces in the team's 2019 national championship run. Since 2014, five LSU receivers have been drafted in the first round of the NFL Draft: Beckham Jr. (12th pick in 2014), Jefferson (22nd pick in 2020), Chase (5th pick in 2021), Nabers (6th pick in 2024), and Thomas Jr. (23rd pick in 2024).[146] LSU and Alabama have played every year since the 1960s. It has been mentioned by the LSU fan base, the origins of the rivalry date back to a 15-game undefeated streak Alabama had in Tiger Stadium, which is generally considered to be one of the most hostile atmospheres in college football. While the Alabama rivalries against Auburn and Tennessee may overshadow their rivalry with LSU, the significance of this annual rivalry increased after Alabama hired former LSU coach Nick Saban in 2007. The LSU-Alabama rivalry continued after the November 5, 2011, game and the 2012 National Championship where the two teams faced off.[147] Alabama leads the series 57-27-5 through the 2024 season.[148] Prior to Arkansas joining LSU in the Southeastern Conference, the two programs met a total of 36 times, including the famed Ice Bowl. The schools played against each other for the first time in 1901 in Baton Rouge, a 15-0 LSU victory. The rivalry grew while it was played annually from 1906 to 1936, with 1918 being the only year the game was not played between those dates. The series was contested in Shreveport from 1913 to 1936. After the Razorbacks left the Southwest Conference in 1990, Arkansas joined the SEC in 1991 and rekindled the rivalry with LSU. During their first year in the SEC, Arkansas would defeat the Tigers in the Razorbacks' first game against LSU in Fayetteville, 30–6; their first victory against LSU since the Razorbacks' 32–0 shutout of the Tigers in 1929. The winner takes home the Golden Boot, a 175-pound, four foot tall, 24-karat gold trophy in the shape of the states of Arkansas and Louisiana that resembles a boot. The game, played the day after Thanksgiving until the 2010 season, was usually the last regular season game for each team and is broadcast on CBS. LSU and Arkansas now close their respective seasons against the SEC's newest members, the Tigers vs. Texas A&M and the Razorbacks vs. Missouri. In 2002, the rivalry gained momentum as the game winner would represent the Western Division of the SEC in the SEC Championship Game. Arkansas won on a last-second touchdown pass by Matt Jones. In 2006, the Razorbacks, who had already clinched the SEC Western Division and were on a 10-game winning streak, were beaten by LSU in Little Rock. In 2007, Arkansas defeated top-ranked LSU in triple overtime, giving them their first win in Baton Rouge since 1993, and again defended the Golden Boot trophy with a last-minute touchdown drive in 2008. Fifteenth-ranked LSU won back the trophy for the first time in two years in 2009 after Razorback kicker Alex Tejada missed a field goal that would have sent the game into a second overtime, and LSU went on to lose the Capitol One Bowl. In 2011, with both teams ranked in the top 3 in the AP Poll, No. 1 LSU prevailed over No. 3 Arkansas by a score of 41–17, sending LSU to the SEC title game en route to being shutout in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game. LSU rode the momentum from the 2011 win by grinding out back-to-back one-possession wins in 2012 and 2013 against Arkansas teams that won four and three games, respectively. Arkansas returned the favor with consecutive 17-point victories in 2014 (breaking a 17-game SEC losing streak for the Hogs while pitching a 17–0 shutout against the No. 17 Tigers; Arkansas's tenth time holding LSU to 0 points and the only shutout in the series since 1995) and 2015 (a 31–14 romp in Baton Rouge which saw the unranked Razorbacks lead the No. 9 Tigers the whole game). LSU lost against Arkansas in overtime in 2021, but rebounded in 2022 to win 13–10 in Fayetteville. LSU leads the series 45*–23–2 through the 2024 season. *2 LSU wins have been vacated.[149] While Auburn's rivalries against Alabama and Georgia may overshadow its rivalry with LSU, in the 2000s, LSU had a heated rivalry with the Auburn Tigers. LSU and Auburn were not yearly rivals until the SEC's 1992 expansion placed both Tiger teams in the Western Division. The two share more than just a nickname, as they have both enjoyed success in the SEC West and plenty of memorable match ups. The home team won every game from 2000 through 2007. LSU leads the series 33-24-1 through the 2024 season, with two LSU wins being vacated.[150] Although both universities were founding members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in December 1932, the Florida Gators and Tigers did not meet on the gridiron for the first time until 1937. LSU is Florida's permanent inter-divisional rival. LSU has played Florida every year since 1971. The longest winning streak in the LSU–Florida series is held by Florida, with nine victories from 1988 to 1996. LSU's longest winning streak is four, from 1977 to 1980. The winner of the Florida-LSU game went on to win the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) national championship game from 2006 to 2008. Some of the notable games in this rivalry include the 1960: Wristband Robbery, 1964: Hurricane Delay, 1972: Flooded Swamp, 1989: College Football's First Overtime Game, 1997: LSU's Revenge, 2006: Tebow Domination, 2007: 5 for 5 on fourth down, and 2016: Hurricane Delay Pt 2. Florida handed LSU its most lopsided defeat in program history, a 58–3 rout at Baton Rouge in 1993. With a few exceptions, mostly during Spurrier's coaching tenure when the Gators routinely won by large margins, this rivalry has been known for close games in recent years, with both teams usually coming into the match-up highly ranked. The Gators and Tigers have combined to win five national championships and eleven SEC titles over the past two decades. The series is tied 34–34–3 through the 2024 season, though 3 LSU wins have been vacated.[151] The LSU–Mississippi State rivalry, is an annual football game between the Louisiana State Tigers and Mississippi State Bulldogs. Both universities are founding members of the Southeastern Conference, as well as the Western Division. This rivalry is LSU's longest rivalry with 108 meetings. LSU is second only to Ole Miss (3 games behind) on Mississippi St.’s list of most-commonly played opponents. Mississippi State's 34–29 victory on September 20, 2014, engineered by quarterback Dak Prescott, a Louisiana native, was the Bulldogs' first over LSU since 1999, their first in Baton Rouge since 1991, and just their fourth overall since 1985. State defeated LSU 37-7 in 2017 for their first win in the series at Starkville since 1999. The Tigers lead the series 78-36-3 through the 2024 season, with two LSU wins being vacated.[152] LSU's traditional SEC rival is Ole Miss. Throughout the 50's and 60's, games between the two schools featured highly ranked squads on both sides and seemingly every contest had conference, and at times national, title implications. The Magnolia Bowl Trophy is now awarded to the winner of the LSU-Ole Miss rivalry now known as the \"Magnolia Bowl\". Recently, the second to last regular season game has been between these two colleges. There is still a strong rivalry between both schools. From 1961 through 1988, LSU did not play on the Ole Miss campus in Oxford, Mississippi. Instead, all of the Rebels' home dates in the series were contested at Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium in Jackson. LSU and Ole Miss played at Oxford in 1989 for the first time in 29 seasons, then moved the series permanently to Vaught–Hemingway Stadium in 1994 after the 1991 and 1992 contests returned to Jackson. LSU leads the series 66-42-4 through the 2024 season, with two LSU wins being vacated.[153] LSU and Texas A&M began play in 1899. Since then, there have been four distinct eras; 1899 to 1923, 1942 to 1975, 1986 to 1995, and the current SEC era beginning in 2011. A&M took that first matchup over LSU, 52–0. The Aggies claimed the 1899 to 1923 era with 7 wins to LSU's 3, with two tie games. LSU took the 1942 to 1975 era winning 19 to A&M's 7, with one tie game. The 1986 to 1995 era belonged again to A&M, with the Aggies winning 6 games to LSU's 4. The current era began with A&M entering the SEC in 2011. LSU claimed victory 8 times in the first 10 meetings. In 2018, the Tigers lost at Kyle Field 74–72 in a game with 7 overtimes, the most overtimes in one game in FBS history. During the series, the two teams have meet in two bowl games. LSU won in the 1944 Orange Bowl 19–14 and prevailed 41–24 in the 2011 Cotton Bowl Classic. LSU leads the series 36–24–3 through the 2024 season, with four Tigers wins being vacated.[154] LSU's oldest rival is Tulane; the first LSU-Tulane football game was played in 1893 and for the first 50 or so years of Tiger football, no team was more hated by LSU fans than the Green Wave. The series, in which they battle for the Tiger Rag, was played continuously from 1919 to 1994.[155] The intrastate rivalry featured two teams which were geographically close (Baton Rouge and New Orleans are roughly 80 miles (130 km) apart) and drew on socio-political tensions between the state's capital and seat of government and its biggest and most culturally important city. As opponents in the SIAA, Southern Conference and SEC, the Tulane rivalry flourished for many years but slowly declined after Tulane left the SEC and de-emphasized athletics. Until 1949, the series was very competitive, with LSU leading 23–18–5; since 1949, LSU has dominated, going 45–4–2. The two teams renewed the annual series in 2006 and ended it again after the 2009 meeting with LSU leading 69–23–7.[156] Through the 2020 season[101]: 106 [157][failed verification] The LSU Tigers football team finished in the Top 25 in the first College Football Playoff ranking. The Tigers finished No. 1 in the final ranking in 2019. The LSU Tigers football team has been ranked No. 1 in the Pre-season Associated Press Poll (AP Poll) in 1959 and the Pre-season Coaches' Poll in 2012. The LSU Tigers football team finished the season ranked No. 1 in the Final Associated Press Poll (AP Poll) in 1958, 2007, and 2019. The Tigers were ranked No. 1 in the Final Coaches' Poll in 1958, 2003, 2007, and 2019.[158] The Tigers also finished No. 2 in the Final AP Poll in 1936, 2003, and 2011 and the Final Coaches Poll in 2011. LSU has played in 52 bowl games, compiling a record of 28–23–1.[159] The Tigers have played in 20 straight bowl games since 2000, the fourth longest active streak in the NCAA and second longest in the Southeastern Conference.[160] LSU players have been selected as consensus All-Americans on 40 occasions through the 2023 season, with 13 selections being unanimous.[1][2] † Unanimous selection Starting in 1994, the Southeastern Conference has annually honored one former football player from each of the member schools as an \"SEC Legend\". The LSU Tigers football team has had 381 players drafted into the National Football League (NFL).[176] This includes 39 players taken in the first round and three overall number one picks: Billy Cannon in the 1960 NFL draft and 1960 AFL draft, Jamarcus Russell in the 2007 NFL draft and Joe Burrow in the 2020 NFL draft.[177] Six former LSU football players have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[178] One former LSU player is a member of the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.[179] LSU has had eleven players and five head coaches inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Tiger Stadium is the 102,321 capacity home of the LSU Tigers football team. The stadium is the sixth largest on-campus stadium in the NCAA and the ninth largest stadium in the world. The current record attendance of 102,321 was set on September 20, 2014, when LSU played host to Mississippi State. Tiger Stadium contains 70 skyboxes, called \"Tiger Den\" suites and a 3,200 seat club level named \"The Stadium Club\". The Paul Manasseh Press Box is located in the west upper-deck. On April 27, 2012, the LSU Board of Supervisors voted unanimously in favor of an $80 million south end-zone upper deck expansion that added approximately 60 \"Tiger Den\" suites, 3,000 club seats and 1,500 general public seats to bring the total capacity of Tiger Stadium to 102,321, making it the 6th-largest college football stadium in the country. Tiger Stadium first opened its gates in the fall of 1924 with a seating capacity of 12,000. In the season finale, LSU hosted Tulane in the first game. As of the 2021 season, LSU has gone on to post a 439-154-18 (.733) mark in Tiger Stadium. Moreover, Tiger Stadium is also known for night games, an idea that was first introduced in 1931 against Spring Hill (a 35-0 LSU victory). In 2006, LSU celebrated its 75th year of playing night football in Tiger Stadium. LSU has played the majority of its games at night, and the Tigers have fared better under the lights than during the day. From 1960 to 2022, LSU is 237–68–4 (.773) at night in Tiger Stadium compared to a 26–27–3 (.491) record during the day over that span.[113] 445-155-18 (.733) State Field was the former home stadium of the LSU Tigers football team from 1893 to 1923. The field was located on the old downtown Baton Rouge campus of LSU. The Charles McClendon Practice Facility is the name of the LSU Tigers football practice facility. The facility features the LSU Football Operations Center, the Tigers Indoor Practice Facility and four outdoor 100-yard football practice fields.[158] In 2002, it was named after former LSU head coach and College Football Hall of Fame member, Charles McClendon.[180] The LSU Football Operations Center, built in 2006, is an all-in-one facility[181] that includes the Tigers locker room, players' lounge, Peterson-Roberts weight room, training room, equipment room, video operations center and coaches offices.[182][183][184] The operations center atrium holds team displays and graphics, trophy cases and memorabilia of LSU football.[185][186] The LSU Indoor Practice Facility, built in 1991, is a climate-controlled 82,500 square feet facility connected to the Football Operations Center. It holds the 100-yd Anderson-Feazel LSU indoor field with Momentum Field Turf by SportExe. The indoor practice facility is located behind the football operations center.[158] The four outdoor practice fields are directly adjacent to the football operations center and indoor practice facility. Three of the fields are natural grass, while the fourth, The Scott & Espe Moran Outdoor Turf Field has a Momentum Field Turf by SportExe playing surface.[158] LSU has had 32 head coaches since organized football began in 1893. In that time, 12 coaches have led the Tigers in postseason bowl games: Bernie Moore, Gus Tinsley, Paul Dietzel, Charles McClendon, Jerry Stovall, Bill Arnsparger, Mike Archer, Gerry DiNardo, Nick Saban, Les Miles, Ed Orgeron, and Brian Kelly. Six of those coaches also won conference championships after LSU left the Southern Conference to join the SEC: Moore, Dietzel, McClendon, Arnsparger, Archer, Saban, Miles, and Orgeron won a combined 12 as a member of the SEC. During their tenures, Dietzel, Saban, Miles, and most recently Orgeron, each won national championships awarded by major selectors while with the Tigers. Of the 32 different head coaches who have led the Tigers, Dana X. Bible, Michael Donahue, Lawrence \"Biff\" Jones, Moore and McClendon have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.[187] Since 2002, LSU has been ranked in the Top 25 in recruiting ranking by multiple ranking services.[189] From 1992 to 2023, LSU played in the West Division of the SEC and played each opponent in the division each year along with several teams from the East Division. The SEC will expand the conference to 16 teams and will eliminate its two divisions in 2024, causing a new scheduling format for the Tigers to play against the other members of the conference.[190] Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future.[191] LSU will not play Auburn for the first time since 1991, the year before the SEC expanded from 10 teams to 12, and will not play Mississippi State for the first time since 1943, when State did not field a team during World War II. Announced schedules as of April 13, 2024[192]",

                "content": "Happy New Year! New Year's Eve is here! The event is celebrated in various ways from all over the world, with each country and culture imbuing it with its own brand of glee. In the Western world, one big tradition is held in New York, specifically in Times Square, where a giant ball has been dropped from a building since 1907. Here's all we know about the Times Square ball drop and where you can watch it live from the comfort of your home: The Times Square ball drop has been around since 1907, with the first ball, made out of wood and iron, dropped and wowed spectators. Since, the celebration has occurred every year except in 1942 and 1943, when there were lightning restrictions due to World War II, reports NPR. According to the publication, the roots of Times Square's notorious New Year's Eve celebration date back to 1904, when the area acquired its name after Adolph Ochs, the owner of The New York Times, moved the newspaper's HQ to the Times Building, now called One Times Square. To commemorate the opening, Ochs organized a New Year's Eve celebration that kickstarted it all. A few years later, after fireworks were banned by the city, Ochs tried his hardest to make the celebration a memorable one, resulting in the iconic ball drop. One of the most memorable parts of New Year's Eve is the countdown, which can be found on basically every news channel airing a New Year's Eve program, whether set in New York or in any other city or country in the world. Interestingly enough, the countdown wasn't a part of the Times Square celebration. Per NPR, the countdown began in the 60's, with various TV announcers counting down. Times Square joined them in 1979. The New Year's Eve ball drop can be watched from various channels. The Times Square Alliance has a live stream that begins at 6 pm, and stays up until midnight, capturing all of the action. If you want a more guided experience, there are various programs airing New Year's Eve specials with various hosts and musical guests.",

                "content": "The South Carolina Gamecocks football program represents the University of South Carolina. The Gamecocks compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference. The team's head coach is Shane Beamer. They play their home games at Williams–Brice Stadium. From 1953 through 1970, the Gamecocks played in the Atlantic Coast Conference, finishing No. 14 in the 1958 final AP poll and winning the 1969 ACC Championship. From 1971 through 1991, they competed as a major independent, producing 1980 Heisman Trophy winner George Rogers, six bowl appearances, and final AP top-25 rankings in 1984 and 1987 (No. 11 and No. 15). Since 1992, they have competed in the Southeastern Conference, winning the SEC East Division in 2010 and posting seven final top-25 rankings, including three top-10 finishes and one top-5 finish. South Carolina has produced a National Coach of the Year in Joe Morrison (1984), four SEC coaches of the year in Lou Holtz (2000), Steve Spurrier (2005, 2010), and Shane Beamer (2024), one ACC coach of the year in Paul Dietzel (1969), and two overall #1 NFL Draft picks in George Rogers (1981) and Jadeveon Clowney (2014). They also have five members of the College Football Hall of Fame in former players George Rogers and Sterling Sharpe, and former coaches Holtz and Spurrier as well as former Athletic Director Mike McGee. Carolina fielded its first football team on Christmas Eve, in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1892 versus Furman.[3] At that time the football team was not sanctioned by the university.[3] They provided their own uniforms and paid their own train fare in order to participate in the game.[3] They were nicknamed the \"College Boys\" by The News and Courier and their supporters wore garnet and black.[4] USC won its first game in its third season, on November 2, 1895, against Columbia AA.[3] The squad designated their first head coach, W. H. \"Dixie\" Whaley, the following year.[3] The 1896 season also saw the inaugural game against arch-rival Clemson on November 12, which Carolina won 12–6.[3] From 1902 to 1903, coach Bob Williams led the Gamecocks to a 14–3 record.[5] In 1902, South Carolina beat Clemson, coached by John Heisman, for the first time since 1896, the first year of the rivalry.[6] \"The Carolina fans that week were carrying around a poster with the image of a tiger with a gamecock standing on top of it, holding the tiger's tail as if he was steering the tiger by the tail\", Jay McCormick said. \"Naturally, the Clemson guys didn't take too kindly to that, and on Wednesday and again on Thursday, there were sporadic fistfights involving brass knuckles and other objects and so forth, some of which resulted, according to the newspapers, in blood being spilled and persons having to seek medical assistance. After the game on Thursday, the Clemson guys frankly told the Carolina students that if you bring this poster, which is insulting to us, to the big parade on Friday, you're going to be in trouble. And naturally, of course, the Carolina students brought the poster to the parade. If you give someone an ultimatum and they're your rival, they're going to do exactly what you told them not to do.\"[7] As expected, another brawl broke out before both sides agreed to mutually burn the poster in an effort to defuse tensions. The immediate aftermath resulted in the stoppage of the rivalry until 1909.[8][9] 1903 also heralded the program's first 8-win season with an overall record of 8–2.[5] Future senator and former star player for South Carolina and UVA, Christie Benet led the Gamecocks from 1904 to 1905 and 1908 to 1909.[10] 1904's captain Gene Oliver played against Georgia with a broken jaw.[11] The Board of Trustees banned participation in football for the 1906 season after the faculty complained that the coarseness of chants and cheers, yelled by the students at football games, were not gentlemanly in nature.[12] Within months The Board of Trustees reversed their decision after hearing pleas, and receiving petitions, from students and alumni alike.[13] Play was allowed to resume in 1907.[13] A hastily assembled football team, coached by Board of Trustees member Douglas McKay, competed in an abbreviated season that same year, and the squad won all three games.[14] In 1910, South Carolina hired John Neff from UVA.[15] Norman B. Edgerton coached the team from 1912 to 1915.[16] A. B. Stoney played on the team.[17] Yet another UVA grad, W. Rice Warren coached the 1916 team.[18] Frank Dobson led the war-torn 1918 team to a 2–1–1 record.[19] Coach Sol Metzger led the 1921 team to a 5–1–2 record, losing only to Billy Laval's Furman.[20] Branch Bocock coached the 1925 and 1926 teams.[21] Billy Laval, a Columbia native, came to USC from Furman.[22] Laval accepted a three-year contract worth $8,000 per year to coach the Gamecocks, which made him the highest-paid coach in the state.[23] From 1928 to 1934, he led the Gamecocks to seven consecutive winning seasons and a 39–26–6 overall record, which included a perfect 3–0 Southern Conference campaign in 1933. Laval is one of only two South Carolina football coaches to have produced seven consecutive winning seasons (Steve Spurrier is the other, from 2008 to 2014).[24] In 2009, The State called him \"the greatest collegiate coach\" in the history of South Carolina.[23] Laval left USC after six seasons to coach multiple sports at Emory and Henry College, partly due to differences over his contract with the USC athletics department.[23] 1934 was the first season that Williams–Brice Stadium was used.[25] Prior to this, South Carolina played its home games on the school's campus.[26] Don McCallister led the Gamecocks for three seasons before being replaced. His final record is 13–20–1.[27] Under coach Rex Enright, who came to USC from his post as an assistant coach at Georgia,[28] the Gamecocks produced another undefeated Southern Conference season, (4–0–1), in 1941.[29] After the 1942 season, Enright joined the United States Navy serving as a lieutenant and working mostly in their athletic program in the United States.[28] After three head coaches (James P. Moran, Williams Newton, John D. McMillan) who had gone 10–10–5 combined in four years with one bowl appearance, Enright returned to the Gamecocks in 1946 as head football coach, and remained until 1955 when he resigned for health reasons.[28] He hired Warren Giese as his successor, and continued as athletic director until 1960. The Rex Enright Athletic Center on the South Carolina campus was named for him and the Rex Enright Award (also known as the Captain's Cup) given to the football captains of the previous season.[28] Enright gave-up his coaching duties in 1955 due to reasons related to poor health.[28] Enright retired with the distinction of being the head coach with the most wins and losses in school history (64–69–7), and he still retains the record for most school losses and is 2nd in wins.[28] Warren Giese, who was previously an assistant coach at Maryland, was hired as head coach in 1956,[30] and he led the Gamecocks to a 28–21–1 overall record in his 5-year tenure.[31] Giese employed a conservative, run-first game strategy, but he enthusiastically adopted the two-point conversion when it was made legal in 1958. That year, he also correctly predicted the rise of special teams after the NCAA relaxed its player substitution rules.[32] The Giese era included two 7–3 campaigns (1956 and 1958),[31] an 18–15–1 ACC record, and a 27–21 victory over Darrell Royal's 1957 Texas squad in Austin. Griese was replaced after a 3–6 season in 1960. Marvin Bass was hired away from Georgia Tech, where he served as defensive coordinator, as the Gamecocks head football coach.[33] He posted a 17–29–4 record in his four-year tenure and was replaced after five seasons due to the team's struggles and low fan support.[33][34] Paul Dietzel arrived in Columbia prior to the 1966 season, having previously coached at LSU, where he won a national championship, and Army.[35] In 1969, he led the Gamecocks to an ACC championship and an appearance in the Peach Bowl. As a result, Dietzel was named ACC Coach of the Year that season.[35] Soon after, South Carolina left the ACC and became an Independent program prior to the 1971 season.[36] Dietzel finished his USC tenure with a 42–53–1 overall record (18–10–1 ACC).[35] In addition to the 1969 ACC title, Dietzel's legacies at Carolina include his improvement of athletic facilities and his penning of a new fight song, which is still used to this day (\"The Fighting Gamecocks Lead the Way\").[37] Amid growing fan unrest after an upset loss to Duke, Dietzel announced that he would resign at the end of the season, which ended in a 4–7 record.[38] Jim Carlen, previously head football coach at Texas Tech and West Virginia, took over as coach in 1975.[39] Under his leadership the program achieved a measure of national prominence. Carlen led the Gamecocks to three bowl games,[39] coached 1980 Heisman Trophy winner George Rogers, and produced a 45–36–1 record during his tenure.[36] The Carlen Era included consecutive 8–4 finishes (1979–1980) and only one losing season in seven years.[39] The 1980 season was headlined by senior running back George Rogers, who led the nation in rushing with 1,894 yards. For his efforts, the Downtown Athletic Club named Rogers the winner of the 1980 Heisman Trophy award. Rogers beat out a strong group of players, including Georgia running back Herschel Walker. Behind the Rogers-led rushing attack, the Gamecocks went 8–4 overall and earned an appearance in the Gator Bowl. In addition, the 1980 Gamecocks defeated a heavily favored Michigan squad coached by the legendary Bo Schembechler. The 17–14 victory in Ann Arbor, which made Rogers a household name, was one of the biggest wins in both the Carlen Era and the program's history. Carlen retired from coaching after seven seasons at USC.[40] Joe Morrison was hired in 1983 following a one-year stint by Richard Bell.[41] After a 5–6 mark in his first year, the \"Man in Black\" led South Carolina to a 10–2 record, No. 11 final AP Poll ranking, and a Gator Bowl appearance in 1984. It was also before the 1984 season began that the team removed the Astroturf that had been in place at Williams–Brice Stadium since the early 1970s and reinstalled the natural grass that remains today. The 1984 season included victories over Georgia, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame, Florida State, and Clemson. The 1984 defense was called the \"Fire Ant\" defense. In 1987, the Gamecocks posted an 8–4 record, No. 15 Final AP Poll ranking, and another Gator Bowl trip.[42] The 1987 Gamecocks were led by the \"Black Death\" defense, which held seven opponents to 10 or fewer points and yielded just 141 points in 12 games played.[43] Morrison coached his last game in the 1988 Liberty Bowl,[42] as he died of a heart attack on February 5, 1989, at the age of 51.[41] He finished his USC tenure with a 39–28–2 overall record, three bowl appearances, and three seasons with 8 or more wins.[36][42] Due to his on-field success and \"Black Magic\" image (he traditionally wore all black on the sideline and introduced black uniforms into the team's rotation), Morrison remains a popular figure in Gamecock lore.[44] Morrison also began the tradition at Carolina, with his first game in 1983, of the pre-game entrance of the football team being the beginning of Also sprach Zarathustra, the theme from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey.[45] This is still part of the Carolina football game day experience over 40 years later.[46] Following Morrison's death, Sparky Woods was hired away from Appalachian State as head coach in 1989 and coached the Gamecocks until the end of the 1993 season.[47] He posted winning seasons in 1989 and 1990, but could not produce another winning campaign during his tenure.[47] Woods led the USC football program through the transition to the SEC and has the distinction of being South Carolina's first head coach in SEC play, as the Gamecocks entered the conference in 1992. Woods' overall record at South Carolina was 25–27–3.[47] Brad Scott left his post as offensive coordinator at Florida State and took over as the Gamecocks head coach in December 1993.[48] Despite modest preseason expectations, he led USC to a 7–5 record and a Carquest Bowl victory over West Virginia in his first season.[49] The bowl win was the first post-season victory in the program's long history. However, Scott was unable to capitalize on his early success. USC only had one non-losing record in SEC play during his tenure, only one other winning overall record, and won only six games in his final two seasons.[36] Scott was fired by athletics director Mike McGee after a 1–10 season in 1998 in which the Gamecocks lost their final ten games of the season.[50] Scott's final record at South Carolina was 23–32–1 in five seasons.[49] Former Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz came out of retirement and was hired as USC's head coach in 1999.[51] He inherited a relatively young SEC program (joined in 1992) that posted only three winning seasons from 1990 to 1998.[52] USC won just a single game the year before Holtz's arrival and, subsequently, went 0–11 in his inaugural campaign.[53] It didn't take long for Holtz to improve the Gamecocks' fortunes, however, as he engineered 8–4 and 9–3 records in the 2000 and 2001 seasons.[54] In addition, USC won consecutive Outback Bowls over Ohio State and produced the most successful two-year run in program history (at the time), going 17–7 overall and 10–6 in SEC play.[54] The 2000 and 2001 campaigns also saw USC's return to the polls, as the Gamecocks turned in No. 19 and No. 13 rankings in the Final AP ballots for those years.[55][56] After consecutive 5–7 finishes in 2002 and 2003 (in which the team was ranked in the Top 25 during both seasons),[54] Holtz ended his USC tenure on a winning note with a 6–5 record in 2004[54] before retiring again.[57] Holtz finished with a 33–37 overall record at South Carolina.[36][54] In 2005, USC was placed on 3 years probation by the NCAA for actions during the coaching tenure of Lou Holtz,[58] all of which were self-reported by the school.[59] Five of these actions were considered major violations, and included such activities as impermissible tutoring and non-voluntary summer workouts as well as a \"lack of institutional control\".[60] Coach Holtz pointed out following the close of the investigation, \"There was no money involved. No athletes were paid. There were no recruiting inducements. No cars. No jobs offered. No ticket scandal, etc.\"[61] Former Washington Redskins and Florida head coach Steve Spurrier was hired in 2005 to replace the retiring Lou Holtz.[62][63] Spurrier led the Gamecocks to a 7–5 record and Independence Bowl appearance in his first season.[64] As a result, Spurrier was named the 2005 SEC Coach of the Year.[64] The 2006 season saw an 8–5 record and a victory over Houston in the Liberty Bowl. In 2007, the Gamecocks started the season 6–1, but would lose all of their next five games.[65] South Carolina posted consecutive 7–6 records in 2008 and 2009, returning to postseason play with appearances in the Outback Bowl and PapaJohns.com Bowl. They also defeated a Top 5 opponent for the first time ever in 2009 when they upset then-No. 4 Ole Miss 16–10 at home on a Thursday night.[64] In 2010, Spurrier scored another first with the first SEC Eastern Division Championship in school history[66] and the program's first win over a No. 1 team in program history, with a 35–21 victory over top-ranked, defending national champion Alabama.[67] In 2011, Spurrier led USC to its most successful season in program history.[68] The Gamecocks posted an 11–2 overall record, went 6–2 in SEC play,[64] and defeated No. 20 Nebraska in the Capital One Bowl[69] to earn Final Top 10 rankings in the AP and Coaches' Polls (No. 9 and No. 8, respectively). The University of South Carolina was investigated in 2011–12 by the NCAA regarding an estimated $59,000 in impermissible benefits provided to student-athletes including football players including discounted living expenses at a local hotel.[70] The school imposed its own punishment, paying $18,500 in fines and cutting three football scholarships in each of the 2013 and 2014 seasons, and reduction in official recruiting visits for the 2012–13 year.[71] The NCAA accepted these self-imposed punishments.[72] In 2012 Steve Spurrier, once again, led his South Carolina football team to double-digit wins during the course of the regular season campaign.[64] The 2012 regular season culminated with the annual season-ending game against arch-rival Clemson at Clemson's Memorial Stadium.[73][74] In 2013, Spurrier and the Gamecocks finished with another extremely successful 11–2 season capped by a 34–22 victory over the No. 19 Wisconsin in the 2014 Capital One Bowl.[75][76][77] South Carolina finished with the highest ranking in school history in the AP poll, ranked at No. 4 in the country.[76] On October 12, 2015, after a 2–4 start to the season, Spurrier announced to his team that he would be resigning, effective immediately.[78] Offensive line coach/co-offensive coordinator Shawn Elliott was named the team's interim head coach.[79] Elliott led the Gamecocks to victory the following week against Vanderbilt but lost the final five games of the season.[80] Many of South Carolina's most successful seasons came during the Steve Spurrier era, including a SEC East Division championship in 2010 and three consecutive eleven win seasons (2011–13).[81] Spurrier also boasted a 6–4 record against the school's in-state rival, Clemson, including five consecutive wins during the 2009–2013 seasons.[82] Auburn defensive coordinator and former Florida head coach Will Muschamp was named as South Carolina's new head coach on December 6, 2015.[10][83] The Will Muschamp era began with a victory over Vanderbilt by a score of 13–10.[84] After a 2–4 start, Carolina won four of their final six regular season contests, including a 24–21 victory over 18th-ranked Tennessee.[85] The Gamecocks' 2016 campaign ended with a 46–39 overtime loss to South Florida in the 2016 Birmingham Bowl.[86] In 2017 Muschamp led the Gamecocks to a 9–4 season.[87] The season started with a neutral site win against NC State in the Belk Kickoff Game in Charlotte, North Carolina.[88] In conference play South Carolina defeated five SEC schools: Florida, Tennessee, Missouri, Vanderbilt, and Arkansas, finishing second in the SEC East.[89] They finished the season with a 26–19 victory over Michigan in the Outback Bowl.[90][91][92] The 2018 season saw Muschamp and the Gamecocks finish with a 7–5 regular season finish and a 28–0 loss to Virginia in the Belk Bowl in Charlotte, NC. South Carolina finished the 2019 season with a mark of 4–8, highlighted by a road upset over Georgia. The 2020 season was played with a conference-only schedule, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Gamecocks started off the season 2-2, with a win over then No. 15 Auburn. The Gamecocks then lost three straight, allowing 159 points in the process. Muschamp was dismissed as head coach on November 15, 2020, after starting the 2020 season with a 2–5 record with Mike Bobo being named interim head coach for the rest of the season.[93][94] On December 6, 2020, University of South Carolina athletic director Ray Tanner announced that the school had hired Oklahoma associate head coach/tight ends coach Shane Beamer as its head coach.[95] Beamer, the son of legendary Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer,[96] led the 2021 Gamecocks to a 7–6 record, including a 38–21 win in the Duke's Mayo Bowl over North Carolina.[97] The Gamecocks' 2022 season displayed significant growth under Shane Beamer's leadership in his second year as head coach. Despite inconsistent offensive line play and a lackluster rush defense throughout the season, the Gamecocks finished on a high note, posting an 8–5 record and finishing the season ranked at No. 23 in both the Coaches and AP poll, their first top 25 finish since the 2013 season.[98] Additionally, Shane Beamer became the first coach in program history to win back-to-back games against top ten opponents after beating #5 Tennessee and their in-state rival #8 Clemson in weeks 12 and 13, respectively.[99] South Carolina's dominant 63–38 victory against Tennessee set the record for most points scored by an unranked team against a top-five team in college football history.[100] During the same game, South Carolina quarterback Spencer Rattler gave a legendary performance, throwing for 438 passing yards,six touchdowns, and no picks, breaking the school record for most touchdown passes in a single game.[101] The Gamecocks were invited to play against the #21 Notre Dame Fighting Irish in the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl. Although South Carolina played a competitive game with a relatively depleted roster, they ultimately lost to the Irish by a score of 45–38. The 2023 season saw a setback in the trajectory of the program. Despite quarterback Spencer Rattler and wide receiver Xavier Legette having two of the best individual seasons in school history in their final college year,[102][103][104][105] the team was noted by the media for being heavily affected by injuries, particularly from the offensive line.[106][107][108] South Carolina finished sixth in the final SEC East,[109][110][111] with an overall record of 5–7, missing a bowl game for the first time since 2020.[112] Shane Beamer achieved massive success with the Gamecocks during the 2024 season, despite media outlets projecting a 13th place finish in the SEC. After a middling 3-3 start to the first half of the season, Beamer turned the page on the narrative and trajectory of the program by leading the team to six straight wins to finish the regular season with a 9-3 record. Beamer set many records over the course of the season, which included leading the Gamecocks to it's first 6-game win streak since 2013, the first winning record in conference play since 2017, and defeated four ranked teams on the season, becoming the very first coach in program history to do so.[113]Season highlights included a dominant 44-20 victory against No. 10 Texas A&M at home, a thrilling 4-point victory over No. 23 Missouri at home - their first victory over that team since 2021, and a 17-14 road victory against archrival, No. 12 Clemson, spearheaded by an elite performance from freshman quarterback LaNorris Sellers. For his outstanding efforts, Shane Beamer was awarded SEC Coach of the year by the Associated Press and USA Today. South Carolina has affiliated with three conferences and twice been an independent.[114][115] South Carolina has had 36 head coaches.[116][117] Shane Beamer became head coach in 2020. † Interim The SEC was split into two divisions from 1992 to 2023, with the Gamecocks competing in the SEC East in that time.[118] South Carolina has 26 bowl appearances, with a 10–16 record overall.[119] The rivalry is the largest annual sporting event by ticket sales in the state of South Carolina. From 1896 to 1959, the Carolina-Clemson game was played on the fairgrounds in Columbia, South Carolina, and was referred to as \"Big Thursday.\" In 1960, an alternating-site format was implemented utilizing both teams' home stadiums. The annual game has since been officially designated \"The Palmetto Bowl\".[120] It is the 21st most played college football rivalry at 120 meetings. The Gamecocks won 5 in a row against Clemson between 2009 and 2013, Clemson then won 7 straight, but failed to extend their win streak in the series with a 31–30 loss in 2022. Clemson holds a 73–43–4 all-time lead in the series as of the conclusion of the 2023 season. The South Carolina Gamecocks did not play the Clemson Tigers in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. A \"border rivalry\" dating to 1894. The 1980 game was between future Heisman Trophy winners George Rogers and Herschel Walker. Led by Walker's 219 rushing yards, Georgia won 13–10 and would go on to capture the National Championship. Rogers turned in 168 rushing yards during the course of the battle, setting the stage for a successful finish to his senior season and eventual Heisman Trophy award. The matchup has been televised yearly since 1997. The series has been far more competitive since USC joined the SEC in 1992. Georgia holds a 55–19–2 overall lead in the series as of the 2023 season.[121][122] A budding rivalry between the two schools located in cities named Columbia.[123] Although Missouri is the only school to beat the Gamecocks in multiple bowl games, the rivalry began in 2012, when Missouri joined South Carolina in the SEC East. A Mayor's Cup trophy is awarded to the winner of the annual game by the mayors of Columbia, South Carolina and Columbia, Missouri.[124] The rivalry began in 1903. While no longer a conference rivalry, since South Carolina left the ACC in 1971, the teams still meet occasionally. In the 2010s, the series had been played primarily on a Thursday. It was announced in September 2015 that USC and UNC will play every four years in 2019 and 2023.[125] South Carolina has won 7 out of the last 9 meetings; North Carolina leads the all-time series 36–20–4.[126] The Gamecocks, however have lead the series 13–7 since 1967, with the Tar Heels' overall lead in the series being reliant on victories from the earlier decades of the matchup. In 1933, under the direction of the legendary Billy Laval, the Gamecocks went undefeated in conference play. However, Duke would finish with a better conference record by one win and was awarded the championship.[127] In 1969, the Gamecocks won the ACC Championship by going undefeated in conference play. In its six ACC matchups, USC outscored its opponents by a 130–61 margin. The squad posted a 7–4 overall record with a Peach Bowl appearance against West Virginia to close the season (14–3 loss). Two years later, South Carolina left the ACC and competed as an Independent for two decades before joining the SEC in 1992. In 1980, the Gamecocks had a successful season led by running back George Rogers, who won the prestigious Heisman Trophy and was chosen #1 overall in the 1981 NFL draft. The team finished 8–4, with the biggest win coming against the eventual Big Ten champion Michigan Wolverines in front of a crowd of over 104,000 at Michigan Stadium. Led by Coach Morrison, the 1984 Gamecocks became the first team in school history to win 10 games (10–2 record) and were ranked as high as No. 2 in the polls before losing to an unranked Navy team 38–21 in the 10th game of the season. The Gamecocks finished No. 11 in the final AP Poll. Along the way, they defeated Georgia, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame, Florida State, and Clemson to earn an appearance in the Gator Bowl against Oklahoma State (21–14 loss). At the time, the No. 11 final ranking was the highest ever achieved by South Carolina. The team was nicknamed \"Black Magic\" due to their success and their distinctive black jerseys.[128] South Carolina made one of the biggest turnarounds in college football history, going from a winless season in 1999 to an eight-win campaign in 2000. Their first win of the season, against New Mexico State, came two years to the day after their previous win, against Ball State on September 2, 1998. South Carolina's turnaround in conference play was also one of the biggest in SEC history, going from 0–8 in 1999, to 5–3 in 2000 including a victory against a heavily favored Georgia team that ended the Gamecocks' SEC losing streak. South Carolina fans tore down the goalposts at Williams-Brice Stadium on both occasions in celebration. On New Year's Day 2001, the Gamecocks defeated Ohio State in the Outback Bowl in Tampa, Florida. South Carolina finished the season ranked #19 in the AP Poll and #21 in the Coaches Poll. In 2010, the Gamecocks won their first SEC Eastern Division Championship, going 5–3 in conference play.[129] For the first time in school history, they defeated the No. 1 ranked team in the country (Alabama) and won at Florida in the division-clinching game.[129] The season also included victories over division foes Georgia, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt as well as instate Atlantic Coast Conference rival Clemson.[129] In their first appearance in the SEC Championship Game, the Gamecocks lost to No. 1 Auburn, 56–17. Led by Coach Spurrier, the 2011 Gamecocks achieved its most wins in a single season and finished in the Top 10 for the first time in program history. USC posted an 11–2 overall record, went 6–2 in SEC play, and won the Capital One Bowl to finish No. 9/8 in the final AP and Coaches' Polls (respectively). Along the way, USC defeated Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, and Clemson to extend its winning streak over its biggest rivals to 3 games. This was also the first season that USC posted a 5–0 record against their SEC Eastern Division opponents. Spurrier's 2012 Gamecocks went 11–2, with their only losses coming at LSU and at Florida in consecutive weeks. USC defeated rival Clemson 27–17 in Death Valley to end the regular season. They then defeated Michigan 33–28 in the 2013 Outback Bowl with the game decided by a 28-yard touchdown pass from Dylan Thompson to Bruce Ellington with under a minute to go. The Gamecocks finished the season ranked No. 8/7 in the final AP and Coaches' Polls respectively. Again led by Coach Spurrier, the 2013 Gamecocks went 11–2, with their losses coming at Georgia and at Tennessee. Notable wins included Vanderbilt, UCF, and Missouri all of which finished ranked in the top 25. USC finished the regular season by defeating rival Clemson 31–17, marking Carolina's fifth straight win over their in-state rival. This was also the first Palmetto Bowl between top ten teams, with Carolina and Clemson ranked No. 10 and No. 6 respectively. South Carolina also completed their second consecutive season with an undefeated record on their home field, Williams–Brice Stadium. The Gamecocks' 18 game home win streak, dating back to the 2011 season, was good for the longest home winning streak in the nation at the time. The team ended the season with a 34–24 victory over Wisconsin in the 2014 Capital One Bowl. The Gamecocks finished the season ranked No. 4 in both the final AP and Coaches' polls, marking the first top five finish in program history. The Gamecocks posted an 8–5 record and finished the season ranked at No. 23 in both the Coaches and AP poll, their first top 25 finish since the 2013 season. Shane Beamer became the first coach in program history to win back-to-back games against top ten opponents after beating #5 Tennessee and their in-state rival #8 Clemson. South Carolina's dominant 63–38 victory against Tennessee set the record for most points scored by an unranked team against a top-five team in college football history. Predicted to win five games and finish thirteenth in the SEC,[130][131] South Carolina achieved the eighth nine-win season in program history.[132] The Gamecocks recorded their first 5–3 conference record since 2017 and the first of Beamer's tenure.[133] They defeated three conference opponents on the road for the first time since 2011.[134] Shane Beamer broke the record for most wins in the first four seasons by a Gamecock head coach,[135] and he was named the SEC Coach of the Year.[136][137][138] Following a disappointing and controversial first half of the season,[130][139] which saw close losses to LSU and Alabama as well as a blowout loss to Ole Miss,[140] the Gamecocks won the last six games in the regular season.[140] In this stretch, South Carolina defeated four straight conference opponents for the first time since 2005;[a] they also defeated four ranked teams and won all three trophy games for the first time in program history.[140][142][143] Two of those trophy games were decided by late-game touchdowns.[144][145] The winning streak earned South Carolina consideration for the College Football Playoff,[146][147][135][148] but they were instead selected to play Illinois in the Citrus Bowl.[149] The Gamecocks are led by redshirt freshman quarterback LaNorris Sellers as well as a defense that ranks among the best in the nation and school history.[148][150][151] Kyle Kennard won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, honoring him as the top defensive player in college football, and was a finalist for the Lombardi Award.[152][153] Dylan Stewart is a finalist for the Shaun Alexander Freshman of the Year Award.[154] Following the regular season, Sellers began receiving consideration as one of the best players in the country.[155][135] From 2003 to 2006, Syvelle Newton played multiple positions for the Gamecocks and left his mark on the national record books in the process. He became one of only four players in college football history to record 600+ yards passing, rushing, and receiving (each) in a collegiate career.[160] In Newton's four seasons, he posted 2,474 passing yards (20 TD, 13 INT), 786 rushing yards (10 TD), and 673 receiving yards (3 TD). He also returned 6 kickoffs for 115 yards (19.2 average) and made 18 tackles and an assisted sack in limited defensive action. Garnet and black have been South Carolina’s uniform colors of choice throughout the program’s history.[178] The gamecock first appeared on South Carolina’s helmet in 1966, and has remained on the helmet in some form since 1969.[178][179] Since 1975, South Carolina has used the 'Block C' primary logo on its helmets,[178][179] and has intermittently featured the script \"Carolina\" and \"Gamecocks\" on the front of its jerseys.[citation needed] While the jersey used \"Gamecocks\" for much of the 1980s and early 1990s, it has solely used \"Carolina\" on its jersey since the late 1990s.[citation needed] Also, as South Carolina's flagship university,[133][180][181][130] USC prominently displays the state flag, and imagery derived from it.[182][183] Since 2007, South Carolina has partnered with Under Armour as its official uniform supplier, replacing Russell Athletic. Under Armour has modified the Gamecocks’ look several times, with altered piping, varying font sizes, et cetera.[178] For example, before the 2013 season, a new uniform was unveiled with eleven total stripes, the same number of buildings on The Horseshoe, the most famous part of the South Carolina campus and a national historic landmark.[184] In 2016, South Carolina signed a ten-year extension with Under Armour, which at the time was reportedly the second-most valuable deal in the SEC and seventh-most valuable in the nation. This deal will expire on June 30, 2026.[185][186][187] In support of the Wounded Warrior Project, USC wore a special uniform against Florida in 2009, against Auburn in 2011, and against LSU in 2012.[188][178] In several seasons, South Carolina has worn \"throwback\" uniforms, including homages to the 1980s in 2019,[189] and to the 1980 season in 2024.[190] The University of South Carolina makes a distinction between retired jerseys and retired numbers. Since 2007, the current athletics department policy states that the school retires jerseys, not numbers. Numbers retired prior to 2007 will continue to be in a retired state, while current and future student-athletes can wear numbers that were affiliated with jersey retirements after 2007.[140] Four players' numbers have been retired, while an additional two players' jerseys have been retired.[191][140][192] As of September 2023, South Carolina had 21 players on active rosters in the NFL, which ranked tied for 21st in the country.[197] The following is a list of Gamecock players in the NFL in any capacity (active rosters, practice squads, reserve lists, et cetera), as of September 2024.[198][199] Sixteen Gamecock players have been selected in the first round of the NFL Draft, which is 44th in the nation, as of 2024.[202][203] From 1992 to 2023, South Carolina played in the East Division of the SEC and played each opponent in the division each year along with several teams from the West Division. The SEC expanded the conference to 16 teams and eliminated its two divisions in 2024, causing a new scheduling format for the Gamecocks to play against the other members of the conference.[204] Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future.[205] Announced schedules as of August 26, 2024.[206] †† Will be played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia Seifried, C.S., & Bolton, C.

                "content": "The Ohio State Buckeyes football team competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, representing Ohio State University in the Big Ten Conference. Ohio State has played its home games at Ohio Stadium in Columbus, Ohio, since 1922.[3] The Buckeyes are recognized by the university and NCAA as having won eight national championships,[4] including six from the major wire-service selectors: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll. The program has also captured 41 conference championships (2 OAC and 39 Big Ten), 10 division championships, and has compiled 10 undefeated seasons, including six perfect seasons (no losses or ties). Seven players have received the Heisman Trophy (second all-time), with the program holding the distinction of having the only two-time winner (Archie Griffin) of the award. As of 2017, the football program is valued at $1.5–2 billion,[5][6] the highest valuation of any such program in the country. NCAA's first millionaire student-athlete (Quinn Ewers) became such using NIL while in the program. After early attempts at forming a team in 1886 (led by future Nebraska governor Chester Hardy Aldrich) and 1887, football was ultimately established at the university in 1890.[7] On the site of the first OSU game, on the campus of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, on May 3, 1890, the Delaware County Historical Society has set an historical marker.[8] Some histories of Ohio State football credit George Cole, an undergraduate, and Alexander S. Lilley with introducing the sport to the campus. More recent research has challenged that claim, stating that George Cole did not persuade Lilley to coach the football team until after its first full season began that fall.[8] OSU's first home game took place at 2:30 p.m. on November 1, 1890. They played the University of Wooster on the site that was then called Recreation Park. Just east of historic German Village, the park occupied the north side of Schiller (now Whittier), between Ebner and Jaeger, in what is now Schumacher Place. OSU lost the game, 64–0. Over the next eight years, under a number of coaches, the team played to a cumulative record of 31 wins, 39 losses, and 2 ties. The first game against the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, was a 34–0 loss in 1897, a year that saw the low point in Buckeye football history with a 1–7–1 record. Jack Ryder was Ohio State's first paid coach, earning $150 per season, and lost his first game, against Oberlin College and John Heisman, on October 15, 1892.[9] In 1899 the university hired John Eckstorm to bring professional coaching skills to the program and immediately went undefeated.[10] In 1901, however, center John Sigrist was fatally injured in a game against Western Reserve University and the continuation of football at Ohio State was in serious question. Although the school's athletic board let the team decide its future, Eckstorm resigned.[11] In 1912, football underwent a number of developments that included joining the Western Conference, making football as part of a new Department of Athletics, and hiring Lynn W. St. John to be athletic director. Chic Harley attended East High in Columbus and was regarded as one of the greatest players to attend an Ohio high school. A well-rounded player, Harley came to Ohio State in 1916 and instantly became a fan favorite. Harley and the Buckeyes won the first Big Ten championship in school history in 1916, finishing 7–0. The team would repeat in 1917 finishing 8–0–1. In 1918, Harley left to be a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I. With Harley's return in 1919, the Buckeyes would only lose one game, to Illinois. Harley left OSU with a career record of 22–1–1. At the time, OSU played at the small Ohio Field and Harley brought such record crowds it became necessary to open Ohio Stadium in 1922. The stadium was built entirely on fan donations and several stadium drives around the city where Harley would often appear. In 1951, when the College Football Hall of Fame opened, Harley was inducted as an inaugural member. Ohio State's first rival was Kenyon College, a small liberal arts college in Gambier, roughly 50 miles to the northeast. The Buckeyes first played them in their first season in 1890 on Nov 27, Kenyon won the first two meetings; however, Ohio State won 15 in a row and the rivalry diminished. Kenyon made it their season goal to defeat OSU. After the Bucks joined the Big Ten they stopped playing Kenyon. The all-time record stands at 17–6, OSU.[12] In hiring Francis Schmidt in March 1934 to coach its football team, Ohio State moved its program to a \"big-time\" level of competition. Schmidt was a well-established coach and an acknowledged offensive innovator. His offensive schemes were a \"wide-open\" style called \"razzle-dazzle\" and led him to be the first Buckeye football coach granted a multi-year contract. Schmidt's first four seasons saw victories over archrival Michigan, all by shut-out. The 1935 squad went 7–1, its sole loss was to Notre Dame, 18–13, in the first contest between the programs. However Schmidt's remaining seasons were less successful, except in 1939 when the Buckeyes won the Big Ten championship, and his popularity faded for a number of reasons.[13] On December 17, 1940, he resigned. Ohio State hired the coach of Massillon Washington High School football team, Paul Brown, to succeed Schmidt.[14][15] Brown's Tigers had just won their sixth straight state championship. Brown immediately changed Ohio State's style of offense, planned and organized his program in great detail, and delegated to his assistant coaches using highly structured practices. In 1942, Ohio State lost 22 veteran players to military service as the United States joined World War II, and with a team of mostly sophomores went on to lose only once in winning its first national championship. Brown accepted a commission in the United States Navy in 1944, ending his coaching run prior to the season. When Brown went into the Navy, he directed his assistant Carroll Widdoes to head the team in his absence. The 1944 team fielded 31 freshmen but went undefeated and untied, including a victory over Paul Brown's Great Lakes Navy team. Ohio State finished second in the national rankings behind Army and Les Horvath became the first Buckeye to be awarded the Heisman Trophy. Also prominent on the 1942–44 teams was the first Buckeye African American star, Bill Willis. Brown chose not to return to Ohio State after the war, going into professional football instead. Widdoes, despite having the highest two-year winning percentage of any Buckeye coach, asked to return to an assistant's position. Offensive coordinator Paul Bixler and Widdoes switched positions, and Bixler endured a mediocre 4–3–2 season. Bixler resigned and talk of Ohio State being a \"graveyard of coaches\" became commonplace, a reputation that lingered for decades.[16] Wes Fesler became head coach in 1947 but finished last in the Big Ten for the only time in team history. Ohio State improved greatly in 1948, winning 6 and losing 3, then in 1949 enjoyed a successful season due to the play of sophomore Vic Janowicz. Ohio State received the Rose Bowl invitation, where they came from behind to defeat California. In 1950, Fesler, rumored to be resigning because of pressures associated with the position and abuse of his family by anonymous critics, returned to coach the Buckeyes, who won six games in a row to move into the top ranking in the AP poll. However, the season fell apart as the Buckeyes lost to Michigan during a blizzard, a game that came to be known as the \"Snow Bowl\". Two weeks later, citing concerns about his health and family, Fesler resigned. Wayne Woodrow \"Woody\" Hayes beat out Paul Brown,[17] among others, to be named head coach on February 18, 1951. He instituted a demanding practice regimen and was both aggressive and vocal in enforcing it, alienating many players accustomed to Fesler's laid-back style. The 1951 Buckeyes won 4, lost 3, and tied 2, leaving many to question the ability of the new coach. In 1952, the team improved to 6–3 and recorded their first victory over Michigan in eight years, but after a 1953 loss to Michigan, critics called for the replacement of Hayes. In 1954, the Buckeyes were picked to finish no higher than 10th in the Big Ten. Hayes, however, had the talents of Howard \"Hopalong\" Cassady, and a historic goal-line stand against Michigan propelled Ohio State to a perfect season. Hayes led the powerhouse Buckeyes to a shared national championship (his first and the team's second). In 1955 the team again won the Big Ten, set an attendance record, and won in Ann Arbor for the first time in 18 years, while Hopalong Cassady was securing the Heisman Trophy. Ohio State passed only three times against Michigan (the sole reception was the only completion in the final three games of the year), leading to the characterization of Hayes' style of offensive play as \"three yards and a cloud of dust\". In a 1955 article in Sports Illustrated, Hayes admitted to making small personal loans to financially needy players.[18] The article resulted in a furor over possible violations of NCAA rules, and the faculty council, followed by the Big Ten and NCAA, conducted lengthy investigations. Big Ten Commissioner Kenneth \"Tug\" Wilson found Hayes and the program guilty of violations and placed it on a year's probation in 1956. In 1957, Ohio State won all of its remaining games after an opening loss to claim the Big Ten championship, then won the Rose Bowl over Oregon, and shared a national title with Auburn, for which Hayes was named Coach of the Year. In 1961, the team went undefeated to be named national champions by the FWAA but a growing conflict between academics and athletics over Ohio State's reputation as a \"football school\" resulted in a faculty council vote to decline an invitation to the Rose Bowl, resulting in much public protest and debate.[19] Over the next 6 seasons, Ohio State finished no higher than 2nd and had a losing season in 1966, and public speculation that Hayes would be replaced as a coach grew to its highest point since 1953. In 1968, Ohio State defeated the number one-ranked Purdue Boilermakers and continued to an undefeated season including a 50–14 rout of Michigan and a Rose Bowl victory over the USC Trojans that resulted in the national championship. The Class of 1970 became known as the \"super sophomores\" in 1968 and might have gone on to three consecutive national championships except for what may have been the most bitter loss in Buckeye history. The winning streak reached 22 games as Ohio State traveled to Michigan. The Buckeyes were 17-point favorites but directed by first-year coach Bo Schembechler, Michigan shocked the Buckeyes in a 24–12 upset. The 1969 loss to Michigan initiated what came to be known as \"The Ten Year War\", in which the rivalry, which pitted some of OSU's and UM's strongest teams ever, rose to the uppermost level of all sports and the competition between Schembechler and Hayes became legendary.[20] Four times between 1970 and 1975, Ohio State and Michigan were both ranked in the top five of the AP Poll before their matchup. The Wolverines entered every game during those years undefeated and won only once, a 10–7 victory in Ann Arbor on November 20, 1971. Both teams used the annual game as motivation for entire seasons and after the initial win by Michigan, played dead even at four wins and a tie apiece. Hayes had the upper hand during the first part of the war, in which Ohio State won the conference championship and went to the Rose Bowl four straight years, while Michigan won the final three. It was also an era in which through television Ohio State football again came to the forefront of national attention. Hayes set the tone in spring practice in 1970, placing a rug at the entrance to the Buckeye dressing room emblazoned with the words: \"1969 MICH 24 OSU 12 — 1970 MICH:__ OSU:__\" as a constant reminder of their objective.[21] The \"super sophomores\", now seniors, used a strong fullback-oriented offense to smash their way through the season undefeated, struggling only with Purdue the week before the Michigan game. The return match in Columbus found both teams undefeated and untied, a \"first\" in the history of the rivalry, with Michigan, ranked fourth and Ohio State fifth. Ohio State combined a powerful defense that held Michigan to only 37 yards rushing, a rushing offense employing two tight ends as blockers, and a 26-yard touchdown pass from Kern to Bruce Jankowski to win 20–9. The Buckeyes returned to the Rose Bowl to be upset by Stanford 27–17. The \"super sophomores\" had garnered a record of 27–2, the best winning percentage of any three-year period in team history, and won or shared the Big Ten title all three years. The National Football Foundation named Ohio State as a national co-champion, along with Texas, for 1970 and awarded the teams joint possession of the MacArthur Bowl. 1971 was less successful than the preceding seasons, but the middle four years of the 10-year war saw the greatest success for Hayes against Michigan, although the teams fell short of repeating their 1968 national championship. Archie Griffin began his college football career in 1972, taking advantage of new NCAA eligibility rules that allowed freshmen to compete at the varsity level. In his second game, sent in against North Carolina late in the first quarter, Griffin set a new Buckeye rushing record with 239 yards and led the team in rushing for the season with 867. The following season, Hayes installed an I-formation attack with Griffin at tailback and fellow sophomore Cornelius Greene at quarterback. The Buckeyes went undefeated with a powerful offense and impenetrable defense, achieving an average margin of victory of 31 points a game. The only blemish on their record was a 10–10 tie with Michigan after both teams had entered the game unbeaten. (The tie was more galling for the Wolverines, however, as the Big Ten selected Ohio State to represent the conference in the Rose Bowl.) Despite soundly defeating defending national champion USC, however, the tie with Michigan resulted in the Buckeyes finishing second to Notre Dame in the final AP rankings. Griffin, Randy Gradishar, Van DeCree, and John Hicks were named All-Americans; Hicks, an offensive tackle, not only won both the Outland and Lombardi Trophies but placed second in the Heisman Trophy competition. 1974 and 1975 were seasons of both elation and frustration. The Buckeyes twice more defeated Michigan, and went to two Rose Bowls, but lost both. The 1974 team seemed bound for another national championship when it was derailed by a loss to unranked Michigan State (Ohio State lost only twice in the regular season during Griffin's four-year career, both to the Spartans), and the next year, the No. 1-ranked Bucks lost 23–10 to 11th-ranked UCLA in the 1976 Rose Bowl. In all, the Buckeyes were 40–5–1 from 1972 to 1975, winning the Big Ten all four years and never losing to Michigan, but it was the losses and ties that proved important to Ohio State missing out on achieving a national championship. At any rate, Archie Griffin rushed for 5,589 yards combined in his four seasons at Ohio State while winning the Heisman Trophy in 1974 (1,695 yards rushed) and 1975 (1,450 yards).[22] The falloff in the success of Hayes' last three years was not great. His teams forged records of 9–2–1, 9–3, and 7–4–1, and made bowl appearances in all three years (the rules had changed to allow appearances in other than the Rose Bowl). However, frustrations in losing three straight years to Michigan, and other factors, resulted in growing criticism of Hayes and his methods, particularly his on-the-field fits of temper. Even so, his downfall was sudden and shocking when near the end of the nationally televised Gator Bowl, Hayes punched Clemson middle guard Charlie Bauman after Bauman intercepted a pass to kill Ohio State's last chance to win.[23] Hayes was fired after the game by Ohio State president Harold Enarson and athletic director Hugh Hindman.[24] Hayes was replaced by a former protégé, Iowa State head coach Earle Bruce.[25] Bruce inherited a strong team led by sophomore quarterback Art Schlichter but that had also lost 11 starters, and the 1979 squad exceeded pre-season expectations, ending the 3-year loss drought against Michigan and going to the Rose Bowl with an opportunity once again to be national champions. The Buckeyes lost both by a single point, 17–16, but Bruce was named Coach of the Year. His success was hailed by those in the media who saw it as a rebuke of Hayes and the start of a \"new era\".[26] 1980, however, saw the start of a trend that eventually brought criticism to Bruce, when Ohio State finished with a 9–3 record, the first of six consecutive years at 9–3. Though each of these seasons, and the 10–3 season that followed them, culminated in a bowl game, Ohio State did not appear to be any closer to a national championship than during the end of the Hayes era. Bruce's teams were not without impact players, however. All-Americans and future National Football League stars included Keith Byars, Cris Carter, Chris Spielman, John Frank, Jim Lachey, Tom Tupa, Marcus Marek, and Pepper Johnson. His program was also known for the number of notable assistant coaches on staff, including Jim Tressel, Glen Mason, Pete Carroll, Nick Saban, Urban Meyer and Dom Capers. For the first time since 1922, the Buckeyes lost three in a row in Ohio Stadium in 1982, including rematches with Stanford and Florida State, and for the second year in a row to Wisconsin, but then won seven straight, the last over BYU in the Holiday Bowl. Sophomore running back Keith Byars had a stand-out season in 1983, rushing for 1,199 yards, and Ohio State defeated the Oklahoma Sooners in Norman, but three losses in conference meant a 4th-place finish. 1984 witnessed what Bruce called \"the greatest comeback after the worst start\" when Ohio State fell behind Illinois 24–0 at home but roared back on 274 yards rushing and five touchdowns by Byars to win 45–38. Ohio State also defeated Michigan to win an outright Big Ten championship. Byars led the nation in rushing and scoring but finished second in Heisman balloting. In 1986, Bruce received a 3-year contract, the first for the modern program but the team opened with two losses, which had not occurred in over 90 years. The Buckeyes then won 9 in a row before Michigan took a close game when kicker Matt Frantz missed a field goal with a minute to play. After the season Bruce was offered the position of head coach at the University of Arizona with a 5-year contract but was persuaded to stay at his alma mater by Athletic Director Rick Bay. Hopes for a standout season in 1987 suffered a serious setback when All-American wide receiver Cris Carter was dropped from the team for signing with an agent. Indiana defeated Ohio State for the first time since 1951, 31–10, in a game that came to be known as the \"darkest day\",[27] and Ohio State lost three conference games in a row going into the Michigan game. On the Monday of Michigan week, after a weekend of rumors and speculation, Ohio State President Edward Jennings fired Bruce but tried to keep the dismissal secret until after the end of the season. Bay, who had been instrumental in keeping Bruce at Ohio State, disregarded Jennings' orders and announced the firing and his own resignation in protest. Jennings made his own situation worse by refusing to give a reason for the firing and the circumstances have been the subject of controversy since.[28] The Buckeyes enjoyed an emotional come-from-behind victory over Michigan in Ann Arbor after the entire team wore headbands bearing the word \"EARLE\", then declined an invitation to play in the Sun Bowl. John Cooper was hired as the 21st football head coach at Ohio State before the end of 1987 and before he had coached his last game at Arizona State University.[29] Cooper's coaching record at ASU and at Tulsa prior to that stood out among his credentials, as did a victory over Michigan in the 1987 Rose Bowl.[30] Cooper's 13 years as the Buckeye head coach are largely remembered in the litany of negative statistics associated with him: a notorious 2–10–1 record against Michigan, a 3–8 record in bowl games, a 5-year losing streak to Illinois to start his term and a 6–7 record overall, and blowing a 15-point 3rd quarter lead in a 28–24 loss to unranked Michigan State when the Buckeyes were the top-ranked team in the nation and en route to a national championship. However, his record also has many positives: back-to-back victories over Notre Dame, two finishes second-ranked in the polls, and three Big Ten championships (albeit shared). Cooper also recruited 15 players who were first-round draft picks in the National Football League.[31] Both 1988 and 1989 began identically: a season-opening win followed by an embarrassing loss to a highly regarded team (Pitt and USC); a rebound win against two other highly regarded programs (LSU and Boston College) followed by a loss to Illinois in the conference opener. However, 1988 saw Ohio State lose its first three conference games and a close game at home against Michigan for a 4–6–1 record, its first losing season in 22 years. In 1989 the Buckeyes won 6 consecutive Big Ten games before losing its last two to go 8–4. The most noteworthy victory occurred in Minneapolis when Ohio State overcame a 31–0 deficit to Minnesota to win 41–37. 1990 continued the pattern with a 2-win 2-loss start and an overall 7–4–1 record that included an embarrassing loss to Air Force in the Liberty Bowl. 1991 was 8–4, notable primarily as the season that sophomore running back Robert Smith quit the team. 1992, with senior Kirk Herbstreit at quarterback, and Smith back on the team was 8–3–1, but the losing string to Michigan was broken with a 13–13 tie. Persistent rumors that Cooper would resign or be fired were laid to rest when University President Gordon Gee announced he would be back in 1993.[32] The next six seasons were very successful, winning 10 or more games in five out of six, and sharing the conference championship in three. Eddie George won the Heisman Trophy in 1995 after a tremendous senior season, Ohio State defeated Notre Dame in 1995 and 1996, and won half its bowl games. But in three seasons (1993, 1995, and 1996) the Buckeyes entered the Michigan game undefeated, with the possibility of a national championship in at least one, and lost all three to underdog Wolverine teams. Ohio State had won 62 games and lost only 12, but a third of those were to Michigan. After renewing his contract and becoming a member of the \"million dollar coaching club\",[33] Cooper started sophomore Austin Moherman against the Miami Hurricanes in the nationally televised Kickoff Classic and was soundly beaten. That presaged a mediocre season in which the Buckeyes finished 6–6, ending their successful 90's run. The 2000 team was more successful, going 8–4, but criticism of Cooper among fans had risen to a clamor again and touched on many areas of the program beyond specific game records. The negative publicity rose to a peak in the days leading up to Ohio State's matchup with South Carolina in the Outback Bowl, when wide receiver Reggie Germany was suspended for having a 0.0 GPA, team captain Matt Wilhelm publicly criticized fellow player Ken-Yon Rambo, and one Buckeye lineman sued another.[34] On January 3, 2001, Cooper was fired.[35] His loss in the Outback Bowl to a team that had not even won a single game the year before was a factor in his subsequent firing, as was negative publicity regarding player behavior before and during the game. Other contributing factors included the record against Michigan (which was actually considered by most people to be the biggest reason for his firing), a reputation of inability to win \"big games\", the lack of a national championship, the perception of him as an outsider by many alumni, the poor bowl game record, and finally a perceived lack of discipline on the team. Ohio State quickly sought a replacement for Cooper and after a nationwide search hired Jim Tressel.[36] With four NCAA Division I-AA National Championships at Youngstown State University, Tressel, formerly an assistant coach for Earle Bruce, was an Ohioan who was considered to be appreciative of Buckeye football traditions. Although there were some doubts as to whether or not Tressel could repeat his earlier success at the Division 1A level, most fans and alumni met the coaching change with enthusiasm. On the day of his hiring, Jim Tressel, speaking to fans and students at a Buckeye basketball game, made a prophetic implication that he would lead the Buckeyes to beat Michigan in Ann Arbor the following November.[37] Tressel's first season was difficult as the Buckeyes finished 7–5 (all but one loss was by a touchdown or less), but he made good on his promise, beating Michigan in Ann Arbor. While its fans were optimistic about the chance for success of the 2002 team, most observers were surprised by Ohio State's National Championship.[38][39] Ohio State used strong defense, ball-control play-calling, and field position tactics to win numerous close games, a style of play characterized as \"Tresselball\",[40] and disparaged by detractors as \"the Luckeyes\".[41] The 2006 and 2007 regular seasons ended with just one combined loss and consecutive appearances in the national championship game. The Buckeyes lost both by wide margins. On January 1, 2010, the Buckeyes defeated the Oregon Ducks in The Rose Bowl Game by a score of 26–17. This ended a 3-game BCS losing streak for Ohio State, having lost 2 national championships and one Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. Terrelle Pryor was named MVP of the contest with 2 touchdown passes for a career-high 266 passing yards. In addition, he had more total yards than the entire Oregon Ducks team. In December 2010, it was announced that five student-athletes on the football team would be suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season for NCAA violations. The punishments stemmed from an incident when some of the Buckeye players received tattoos for their autographs, according to news reports. Other violations committed by the players included the selling of several items given to them by the university, such as Big Ten championship rings.[42] On December 22, 2010, the NCAA announced that five players would be suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season due to receiving improper benefits. Mike Adams, Dan Herron, DeVier Posey, Solomon Thomas, and quarterback Terrelle Pryor were found to have signed autographs in return for tattoos, as well as selling memorabilia given to them by the university.[43] In addition, Jordan Whiting was suspended for the season opener for his involvement. The scandal originated at Fine Line Tattoos and Piercings in Columbus, whose owner, Edward Rife, was being investigated for felony drug trafficking. On January 4, 2011, with all the players allowed to participate by the NCAA, the Buckeyes defeated the Arkansas Razorbacks in the Sugar Bowl by a margin of 31–26.[44] The win, along with every other one from the 2010 season, would later be vacated due to the scandal. The Buckeyes finished the season 12–1, with their only official game being a loss to Wisconsin. On March 8, 2011, OSU suspended head coach Jim Tressel for the first 2 games of the 2011 season and fined him $250,000 for not informing the university and the NCAA that he had knowledge of his players receiving improper benefits. Coach Tressel's suspension would later be increased to 5 games by the university. On May 30, 2011, Jim Tressel resigned as head coach of the Buckeyes.[45] On June 6, 2011, a story in Sports Illustrated reported that at least 28 players, including Rob Rose, T. J. Downing, Louis Irizarry, Chris Vance, C. J. Barnett, Dorien Bell, Jamaal Berry, Bo DeLande, Zach Domicone, Storm Klein, Etienne Sabino, John Simon, Nathan Williams, Jermale Hines, Devon Torrence, Donald Washington, Thaddeus Gibson, Jermil Martin, Lamaar Thomas, and Doug Worthington traded team memorabilia or used equipment for tattoos or other merchandise or services between 2002 and 2010. The report alleged that Tressel had violated NCAA bylaw 10.1, unethical conduct, three times by not acting when told of the tattoo improprieties, by signing a statement saying he knew of no violations, and for withholding information on what was going on from university officials.[46] On July 8, 2011, Ohio State University decided to vacate all victories from the 2010 football season as self-imposed punishment for major NCAA violations.[47] Former coach Jim Tressel received more than $52,000 from the university and didn't have to pay a $250,000 fine for his involvement in the scandal. His status was also changed from \"Resigned\" to \"Retired\" in keeping with his wishes to \"remain a Buckeye for life\".[48] Ohio State named Luke Fickell interim head coach for the 2011 season following Tressel's resignation, and Fickell coached the 2011 Buckeyes to a 6–7 record; going 6–6 in the regular season and losing in the Gator Bowl to Florida. On November 28, 2011, former University of Florida head coach and ESPN college football analyst Urban Meyer accepted the position of Buckeyes head coach.[49] Meyer assumed head coaching responsibilities following the Buckeyes' January 2012 Gator Bowl appearance. Meyer's first season at Ohio State did not include a postseason contest, as the Buckeyes were sanctioned with a one-year bowl ban on December 20, 2011. The NCAA sanctions also included the loss of three scholarships each year for the following three years and three years' probation to end on December 19, 2014. Ohio State was required to vacate all wins from the 2010 season, the 2010 Big Ten Conference championship and their win in the 2011 Sugar Bowl. The school's share of the Sugar Bowl proceeds was forfeited as well.[50] In Meyer's first year, the Buckeyes went a perfect 12–0, winning the 2012 Big Ten Leaders Division, though the previously mentioned sanctions kept them from playing in the 2012 Big Ten Football Championship Game and a postseason bowl game.[50] On November 23, 2013, the Buckeyes clinched their second straight Leaders Division Championship, after defeating Indiana 42–14. With the victory over Indiana, Ohio State set a team record for all-time consecutive wins, with 23. The following week, Ohio State defeated Michigan 42–41 in Ann Arbor, to increase the streak to 24. The streak ended with Ohio State's 34–24 loss to Michigan State in the 2013 Big Ten Conference Championship game on December 7, marking Meyer's first loss as the Buckeyes' head coach. On January 3, 2014, the Buckeyes were defeated by Clemson in the Orange Bowl 40–35. On November 22, 2014, the Buckeyes clinched the first-ever Big Ten East Division Championship when they defeated Indiana 42–27, earning a berth in the 2014 Big Ten Championship Game, where they defeated West Division champion Wisconsin 59–0 to win the Big Ten Conference Championship and qualified for the four-team playoff to decide the National Champion. OSU defeated Alabama in the Sugar Bowl 42–35, on January 1, 2015, to qualify for the National Championship Game against Rose Bowl winner Oregon on January 12 (the Rose and Sugar Bowls were the designated semifinal games in 2014). OSU claimed the first-ever College Football Playoff National Championship by defeating Oregon 42–20.[51][52][53] The 2015 season for the Buckeyes began with a 10–0 start before losing on a last-second field goal to Michigan State on November 21, ending the Buckeyes' quest to repeat as National Champions. However, the Buckeyes recovered their 2 next games with dominating wins over Michigan and then over Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl to finish the season at 12–1. The 2016 season started off great with 6 straight victories, including a win over the Oklahoma Sooners, but the streak came to an end as the team lost a heart-breaker to the Penn State Nittany Lions. The Buckeyes went on to win the rest of their regular-season games, finishing 11–1. They did not play in the Big Ten Championship as Penn State took the division. In a controversial call, the College Football Playoff committee gave Ohio State a spot in the Playoff. Ohio State lost in the Fiesta Bowl to the Clemson Tigers in an embarrassing 31–0 loss, ending the season 11–2. The 2017 season started out on a high note with a victory over the Indiana Hoosiers, but the next week the Buckeyes fell to the Oklahoma Sooners. The Buckeyes won the next 6 games, including a win over No. 2 Penn State in a revenge game of sorts. The Buckeyes suffered an embarrassing defeat against the Iowa Hawkeyes. The Buckeyes ended the season 12–2 overall, winning the rest of their games including a Big Ten Championship victory over Wisconsin and a Cotton Bowl victory over USC. Urban Meyer was suspended for the first three games of the 2018 season for mishandling domestic violence allegations against then-wide receivers coach Zach Smith. Co-Offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Ryan Day served as interim coach and led the Buckeyes to a 3–0 start. Meyer returned to the sidelines and coached the team to four more victories before the team suffered a loss on October 20 to Purdue, 49–20. The Buckeyes won their last four games of the regular season, including a 62–39 win over archrival Michigan, in Columbus. The win gave the Buckeyes a share of the Big Ten East Division title, and the right to face Northwestern in the Big Ten Championship Game, which Ohio State won for its second consecutive Big Ten Championship. Ohio State would go on to win the Rose Bowl over Pac-12 Champion Washington 28–23, giving Ohio State their 8th Rose Bowl win. On December 4, 2018, the university announced that Meyer would retire after the 2019 Rose Bowl and be replaced by co-offensive coordinator Ryan Day.[54][55] In Day's first year, the Buckeyes went a perfect 13–0, including a win over archrival Michigan by a score of 56–27 and defeating Wisconsin for the Big Ten Championship. They would earn a spot in the College Football Playoff but would lose to Clemson 29–23 in the 2019 Fiesta Bowl. In Day's second year, the Big Ten season didn't start until late October due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Buckeyes would only play five out of a scheduled eight games due to several virus-related cancellations - including the Michigan game. Nevertheless, the Buckeyes would go 5–0 in the regular season, win the East Division title, and go on to beat Northwestern 22–10 in the Big Ten Championship Game, giving Day his second straight conference title. On January 1, 2021, the Buckeyes defeated Clemson 49–28 to win the Sugar Bowl in a rematch of the 2019 Fiesta Bowl to advance to the CFP National Championship Game against Alabama on January 11, which they lost 52–24. On September 11, 2021, he suffered his first regular season loss as head coach when the Oregon Ducks defeated the Buckeyes 35–28 in the 2nd game of the season. Ohio State's streak of defeating Michigan also came to an end on November 27, 2021, in Ann Arbor, when Ohio State lost 42–27.[56] They then won the 2022 Rose Bowl against Utah 48–45 on January 1, 2022. In 2022, Day led the team to an 11–0 record and was ranked #2 going into the Michigan game, which #3 Michigan would win 45–23 on November 26, 2022 (outscoring the Buckeyes 28–3 in the second half), in Ohio State's first loss to Michigan in Columbus since 2000, and first back–to–back losses to Michigan since 1999–2000. The Buckeyes would go on to play the defending national champion Georgia Bulldogs in the 2022 national semifinal game on New Year's Eve, taking a 14-point lead into the fourth quarter, but ultimately seeing their season come to an end with a 42–41 loss.[57] Kicker Noah Ruggles' would-be game-winning field goal attempt sailed wide left just as the clock struck midnight on New Year's Day, 2023. In 2023, Day led the team to an 11–0 record and was ranked #2 going into the Michigan game for the second consecutive year. This time, Michigan won by six points 30–24 on November 25, 2023. This marked the first three game losing streak to Michigan since 1995–97. The Buckeyes were then invited to the 2023 Cotton Bowl, where they lost to the Missouri Tigers 14–3 on December 29, 2023. Ohio State recognizes eight national championships from NCAA-designated \"consensus\" selectors,[58][59] including six (1942, 1954, 1957, 1968, 2002, 2014) from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll.[59][60] The following is a list of Ohio State's claimed national championships: Ohio State has also been selected an additional seven times by various NCAA-designated \"major selectors\", in 1933, 1944, 1969, 1973, 1974, 1975, and 2006.[59][63][64] However, the Buckeyes do not recognize any of those championships. Ohio State joined the Big Ten in 1912; before that they were a member of the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) and won two OAC titles. Ohio State has won a championship in the Big Ten 39 times, second-most in the conference.[65] † Co-champions From 2011 to 2023, Big Ten had divisions to decide who would play for the conference championship. The divisions were known as Legends and Leaders from 2011 to 2013. In 2014, the divisions were realigned geographically into East and West. The divisional format ended for the 2024 season. † Co-champions Ohio State has played in 56 bowl games in which they are 28–29–0.[66] The Buckeyes have been to the Rose Bowl 16 times. Below are the team's most recent bowl games. † Vacated Ohio State University Marching Band[68] is the most visible and possibly best-known tradition of Ohio State football.[69] Home games are preceded by four marching band traditions:[70] The series versus Illinois began in 1902 and became the longest continuous series in 2002 when the schools played in their 89th consecutive year. In 2007, Ohio State was given their only defeat of the regular season by the Illini. Through the 2019 season, Ohio State leads the series 68–30–4.[71] Ohio State's first game with Michigan dates to 1897. Michigan leads the series 62–51–6 through the 2024 season.[72]This rivalry is considered to be Buckeyes' biggest rivalry. All the appearances of the letter M in Ohio Stadium are crossed out with red tape. Halftime shows during OSU games often feature something bad happening to the Michigan logo. When Penn State was added to the Big Ten conference football play in 1993, every member was given two designated rivals, teams to be played every year, with the other conference teams rotated out of the schedule at regular intervals. For geographic convenience, the Big Ten named Penn State as Ohio State's new designated rival in addition to Michigan. Ohio State leads the series 25–14 through the 2024 season.[73] The Buckeyes have had 24 head coaches in their 121-year history. Of the team's eight national championships to date, Woody Hayes won five, with Paul Brown, Jim Tressel, and Urban Meyer each having one. Roster Last update: August 22, 2024 [74] This table reflects the results of Big Ten match-ups when both OSU and its opponent were members of the conference through November 9, 2019.[75] Ohio State began Big Ten play in 1913. Examples of excluded results are Chicago after 1939, Michigan between 1907 and 1916, Michigan State before 1953, Penn State before 1993, and Nebraska before 2011 (see Big Ten History for further information). Ohio State's vacated wins from 2010 are not included (see 2010 Ohio State Buckeyes football team for further information). Through the 2006 season, Ohio State players have by a significant margin won more trophies than any other NCAA Division 1A program. Ohio State players have won 34 of the listed major awards, with the next closest being 26 (Oklahoma). Ohio State is the only university to have received each of the awards at least once. Of the five awards created prior to 1980 (Heisman, Lombardi, Maxwell, Outland, and Walter Camp), Ohio State has received the most with 25 (Notre Dame follows with 23). Although these numbers are cited as \"retired\" on Ohio State website,[76] they are considered enshrined rather than retired, and are available to be worn. All previously retired jersey numbers remain retired.[77] In 2020, the NCAA approved the use of the No. 0.[78] In order to further pay tribute to Bill Willis, Coach Day decided to start a new tradition and choose the player who will wear the number each season.[79] Note: Due to number restrictions, Thayer Munford could not wear number 0. Instead, he wore his regular number and honored the award with a patch. Two head coaches have also been honored by the Buckeyes, with banners at Ohio Stadium: Ohio State players have won the Heisman Trophy seven times, which ties Notre Dame and Oklahoma for the second most awards for any school, behind only USC with eight. Archie Griffin is the only two-time recipient in the history of the award.[80] Ohio State players have won the Lombardi Award six times: Four Ohio State players have won the Maxwell Award: Four Ohio State players have won the Outland Trophy: Ohio State players have won the Walter Camp Award four times: Ohio State Players have won the Fred Biletnikoff Award twice: Ohio State Players have won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy award twice: Ohio State players have won the Dick Butkus Award twice: Ohio State players have won the Jim Thorpe Award twice: Ohio State players have won the Dave Rimington Trophy four times: Ohio State players have won the Chicago Tribune Silver Football award 23 times: Ohio State players have won the Graham–George Offensive Player of the Year 13 times: Ohio State players have won the Nagurski–Woodson Defensive Player of the Year 11 times: Through 2017, 199 Buckeyes have been named first team All-Americans since 1914. Of those 85 have been consensus picks. 388 have been named to the All-Big Ten team, and 16 have won the Chicago Tribune Silver Football, the Big Ten's Most Valuable Player award, including Troy Smith for 2006. The Athletic Directors of the Big Ten Conference voted Eddie George Big Ten-Jesse Owens Athlete of the Year for 1996. On November 22, 2006, ten Buckeyes were named to either the Coaches or Conference media All-Big Ten First Team selections for the 2006 season, and seven were named to both. Troy Smith was named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year. Four other Buckeyes received Second Team honors.

WBNS/Columbus (1460 AM) and sister station WBNS-FM/Columbus (97.1 FM) serve as flagship stations, with more than 60 affiliates in Ohio, and two additional affiliates in West Virginia. Paul Keels is the play-by-play announcer, while former Buckeye left guard Jim Lachey serves as color analyst. They are joined by sideline reporter Matt Andrews and Skip Mosic, host of the network pregame and halftime shows.[82] WBNS-TV (channel 10) in Columbus is the long-standing \"official TV home\" of the Buckeyes, airing the official coach's show Game Time with Ryan Day (simulcast statewide on Bally Sports Ohio).[83] In addition, Ohio State football games are broadcast by their student radio organization, Scarlet and Gray Sports Radio on OhioStateSports.net Schedule announced October 5, 2023[84] (*) denotes protected matchup Announced schedules as of September 28, 2023.[85] In 2011, a study conducted by Nate Silver of the New York Times, which he described as \"not quite scientific,\" determined that Ohio State had the most fans of any college football team.[86]",

                "title": "Anderson Cooper - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Anderson Hays Cooper (born June 3, 1967)[1] is an American broadcast journalist and political commentator who anchors the CNN news broadcast show Anderson Cooper 360°. In addition to his duties at CNN, Cooper serves as a correspondent for 60 Minutes, produced by CBS News. After graduating from Yale University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1989, he began traveling the world, shooting footage of war-torn regions for Channel One News. Cooper was hired by ABC News as a correspondent in 1995, but he soon took more jobs throughout the network, working for a short time as a co-anchor, reality game show host, and fill-in morning talk show host. In 2001, Cooper joined CNN, where he was given his own show, Anderson Cooper 360°; he has remained the show's host since. He developed a reputation for his on-the-ground reporting of breaking news events, with his coverage of Hurricane Katrina causing his popularity to sharply increase. For his coverage of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Cooper received a National Order of Honour and Merit, the highest honor granted by the Haitian government. From September 2011 to May 2013, he also served as the host of his own syndicated television daytime talk show, Anderson Live. Cooper has won 18 Emmy Awards and two Peabody Awards, as well as an Edward Murrow Award from the Overseas Press Club in 2011. A member of the Vanderbilt family, he came out as gay in 2012, becoming \"the most prominent gay journalist on American television\".[2] In 2016, Cooper became the first LGBT person to moderate a presidential debate, and he has received several GLAAD Media Awards. Cooper was born in Manhattan, New York City, the younger son of writer Wyatt Emory Cooper and artist Gloria Vanderbilt. His maternal grandparents were millionaire equestrian Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt of the Vanderbilt family and socialite Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, and Reginald's patrilineal great-grandfather was business magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, who founded the prominent Vanderbilt shipping and railroad fortune.[3] He has two older half-brothers, Leopold Stanislaus \"Stan\" Stokowski (b. 1950) and Christopher Stokowski (b. 1952), from Gloria's ten-year marriage to conductor Leopold Stokowski.[4] In 2014, Cooper appeared in Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s Finding Your Roots, where he learned of an ancestor, Burwell Boykin, who was a slave owner from the southern United States.[5][6] Cooper's media experience began early. As a baby, he was photographed by Diane Arbus for Harper's Bazaar.[7][8] At the age of three, Cooper was a guest on The Tonight Show on September 17, 1970, appearing with his mother.[citation needed] At the age of nine, he appeared on To Tell the Truth as an impostor. From age 10 to 13, Cooper modeled with Ford Models for Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Macy's.[9] Wyatt experienced a series of heart attacks while undergoing open-heart surgery, and died January 5, 1978, at the age of 50. Cooper considers his father's book Families to be \"sort of a guide on... how he would have wanted me to live my life and the choices he would have wanted me to make. And so I feel very connected to him.\"[9] When Cooper was 21, his older brother, Carter Vanderbilt Cooper, committed suicide on July 22, 1988, at age 23, by jumping from the 14th-floor terrace of Vanderbilt's New York City penthouse apartment. Gloria Vanderbilt later wrote about her son's death in the book A Mother's Story, in which she expressed her belief that the suicide was caused by a psychotic episode induced by an allergy to the anti-asthma prescription drug salbutamol. Carter's suicide sparked Anderson's interest in journalism:[9] Loss is a theme that I think a lot about, and it's something in my work that I dwell on. I think when you experience any kind of loss, especially the kind I did, you have questions about survival: Why do some people thrive in situations that others can't tolerate? Would I be able to survive and get on in the world on my own? Cooper attended the Dalton School, a private co-educational day school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. At age 17, after graduating from Dalton a semester early, Cooper traveled around Africa for several months on a \"survival trip\". He contracted malaria on the trip and was hospitalized in Kenya. Describing the experience, Cooper wrote \"Africa was a place to forget and be forgotten in.\"[9][10][11] Cooper attended Yale University, where he resided in Trumbull College and was a coxswain on the lightweight rowing team. He was inducted into the Manuscript Society and majored in political science, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1989.[12] During college, Cooper spent two summers as an intern at the Central Intelligence Agency while studying political science.[13] He pursued journalism with no formal journalistic education.[14][13] He is a self-proclaimed \"news junkie since [he] was in utero\".[15] After Cooper graduated from Yale, he tried to gain entry-level employment with ABC answering telephones, but was unsuccessful. Finding it hard to get his foot in the door of on-air reporting, Cooper decided to enlist the help of a friend in making a fake press pass. At the time, Cooper was working as a fact checker for the small news agency Channel One, which produces a youth-oriented news program that is broadcast to many junior high and high schools in the United States.[16] Cooper then entered Myanmar on his own with his forged press pass and met with students fighting the Burmese government.[15] After reporting from Myanmar, Cooper lived in Vietnam for a year to study the Vietnamese language at the University of Hanoi. Persuading Channel One to allow him to bring a Hi8 camera with him, Cooper began filming and assembling reports of Vietnamese life and culture that aired on Channel One. In 1992, he filmed stories from Somalia, Bosnia, and Rwanda.[citation needed] After having been on such assignments for a couple of years, Cooper realized in 1994 that he had slowly become desensitized to the violence he was witnessing around him; the horrors of the Rwandan genocide became trivial: \"I would see a dozen bodies and think, you know, it's a dozen, it's not so bad.\"[10] One particular incident, however, snapped him out of it:[10] On the side of the road [Cooper] came across five bodies that had been in the sun for several days. The skin of a woman's hand was peeling off like a glove. Revealing macabre fascination, Cooper whipped out his disposable camera and took a closeup photograph for his personal album. As he did, someone took a photo of him. Later that person showed Cooper the photo, saying, \"You need to take a look at what you were doing.\" \"And that's when I realized I've got to stop, [...] I've got to report on some state fairs or a beauty pageant or something, to just, like, remind myself of some perspective.\" In 1995, Cooper became a correspondent for ABC News, eventually rising to the position of co-anchor on its overnight World News Now program on September 21, 1999. In 2000, he switched career paths, taking a job as the host of ABC's reality show The Mole:[15] My last year at ABC, I was working overnights anchoring this newscast, then during the day at 20/20. So I was sleeping in two- or four-hour shifts, and I was really tired and wanted a change. I wanted to clear my head and get out of news a little bit, and I was interested in reality TV—and it was interesting. Cooper was also a fill-in co-host for Regis Philbin on Live with Regis and Kelly in 2007 when Philbin underwent triple-bypass heart surgery.[17] As of 2019, he still periodically serves as guest co-host on Live when one of the two hosts cannot go in to work.[citation needed] Cooper left The Mole after its second season to return to broadcast news. In 2001, he joined CNN, commenting, \"Two seasons was enough, and 9/11 happened, and I thought I needed to be getting back to news.\"[15] His first position at CNN was to anchor alongside Paula Zahn on American Morning. In 2002, he became CNN's weekend prime-time anchor. Since 2002, he has hosted CNN's New Year's Eve special from Times Square.[citation needed] On September 8, 2003, Cooper became the anchor of Anderson Cooper 360° on CNN. Describing his philosophy as an anchor, he has said:[15] I think the notion of traditional anchor is fading away, the all-knowing, all-seeing person who speaks from on high. I don't think the audience really buys that anymore. As a viewer, I know I don't buy it. I think you have to be yourself, and you have to be real and you have to admit what you don't know, and talk about what you do know, and talk about what you don't know as long as you say you don't know it. I tend to relate more to people on television who are just themselves, for good or for bad, than I do to someone who I believe is putting on some sort of persona. The anchorman on The Simpsons is a reasonable facsimile of some anchors who have that problem. In 2005, Cooper covered the tsunami damage in Sri Lanka; the Cedar Revolution in Beirut, Lebanon; the death of Pope John Paul II; and the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. In August 2005, he covered the Niger famine from Maradi.[citation needed] In 2005, during CNN coverage of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he confronted Sen. Mary Landrieu, Sen. Trent Lott, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson about their perception of the government response. As Cooper said later in an interview with New York magazine, \"Yeah, I would prefer not to be emotional and I would prefer not to get upset, but it's hard not to when you're surrounded by brave people who are suffering and in need.\"[9] A contributor to Broadcasting & Cable magazine wrote: \"In its aftermath, Hurricane Katrina served to usher in a new breed of emo-journalism, skyrocketing CNN's Anderson Cooper to superstardom as CNN's golden boy and a darling of the media circles because of his impassioned coverage of the storm.\"[18] In September 2005, the format of CNN's NewsNight was changed from 60 to 120 minutes to cover the unusually violent hurricane season. To help distribute some of the increased workload, Cooper was temporarily added as co-anchor to Aaron Brown. This arrangement was reported to have been made permanent the same month by the president of CNN's U.S. operations, Jonathan Klein, who has called Cooper \"the anchorperson of the future\".[19] Following the addition of Cooper, the ratings for NewsNight increased significantly; Klein remarked that \"[Cooper's] name has been on the tip of everyone's tongue.\"[20] To further capitalize on this, Klein announced a major programming shakeup on November 2, 2005. Cooper's 360° program would be expanded to two hours and shifted into the 10:00 pm ET slot formerly held by NewsNight, with the third hour of Wolf Blitzer's The Situation Room filling in Cooper's former 7:00 pm ET slot. With \"no options\" left for him to host shows, Aaron Brown left CNN, ostensibly having \"mutually agreed\" with Jonathan Klein on the matter.[21] In early 2007, Cooper signed a multi-year deal with CNN that would allow him to continue as a contributor to 60 Minutes, as well as doubling his salary from $2 million annually to a reported $4 million.[22] On April 16, 2023, CNN launched a new Sunday primetime series, The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper.[23] In 2007, he began hosting CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute, a show about extraordinary deeds by ordinary people.[citation needed] In October 2007, Cooper began hosting the documentary Planet in Peril with Sanjay Gupta and Jeff Corwin on CNN. In 2008, Cooper, Gupta, and Lisa Ling from National Geographic Explorer teamed up for a sequel, Planet in Peril: Battle Lines, which premiered in December 2008.[24][25] In September 2010, Warner Bros. and Telepictures (both corporate siblings of CNN) announced that Cooper had signed an agreement to host a nationally syndicated talk show. The journalist Brian Stelter (at the time employed by The New York Times, and now by CNN), reported on Twitter that the new Warner Bros. daytime talk show would be named Anderson (now titled Anderson Live).[26][non-primary source needed] The show premiered on September 12, 2011,[27] and as part of negotiations over the talk show deal, Cooper signed a new multi-year contract with CNN to continue as the host of Anderson Cooper 360°.[28][29] On October 29, 2012, it was announced that Anderson Live would end at the conclusion of its second season. The show, slightly renamed after season one and revamped with a variety of co-hosts, failed to achieve the ratings distributor Warner Brothers hoped for. The final Anderson Live aired on May 30, 2013.[citation needed] Along with Martha Raddatz, Cooper moderated the second presidential election debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.[30] This made him the first LGBT person to moderate a presidential debate in the general election.[31] In 2017, Cooper's close friend, Andy Cohen, joined Cooper in succeeding Kathy Griffin as co-host of CNN's New Year's Eve coverage.[32][33] They again co-hosted CNN's New Year's Eve for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022[34] and 2023.[35] Cooper has been a correspondent for the CBS News program 60 Minutes since 2007, while concurrently serving as a CNN anchor and correspondent.[citation needed] Andy Cohen and Cooper announced that they would be going on a national tour to perform their conversational stage show AC2 beginning in March 2015.[36][37] The tour opened in Boston, followed by Miami Beach, Chicago and Atlanta.[37] The idea for the show came about after Cooper interviewed Cohen about his then-latest book, The Andy Cohen Diaries, at an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York City.[38][39] Since then, the two-man show has continued to tour, reaching more than fifty cities as of October 2018.[40] Cooper was the narrator for the 2011 Broadway revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, directed by Rob Ashford and starring Daniel Radcliffe.[41] A freelance writer, Cooper has authored a variety of articles that have appeared in many other outlets, including Details magazine.[42] In May 2006, Cooper published a memoir for HarperCollins, Dispatches from the Edge, detailing his life and work in Sri Lanka, Africa, Iraq and Louisiana over the previous year. Some of the book's proceeds are donated to charity.[43] The book topped The New York Times Best Seller list on June 18, 2006.[44] In 2017, Cooper and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, co-authored The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son on Life, Love, and Loss. Compiled from a series of emails, the memoir recounts their shared past, and Vanderbilt's tumultuous childhood. Cooper said his goal in writing the book and correspondence was to leave \"nothing left unsaid\" between the pair.[45] It landed on multiple best-seller lists the year of its publication.[46] From April 19 to 30, 2021 Cooper served as a guest host on Jeopardy! following the death of Alex Trebek.[47] In 2022, Cooper launched a deeply personal podcast exploring grief and loss. On the show, he interviews other notable people on their experiences with grief. Guests have included TV host Stephen Colbert, musician Laurie Anderson and comedian Molly Shannon.[48] The inspiration for the podcast came from his own life. Reflecting on the loss of his father when he was 10, the loss of his brother to suicide at 21, and the more recent loss of his mother Gloria Vanderbilt, he said \"What has struck me is the degree to which I had not dealt with this stuff at all.\" He shared that he wanted to explore this universal human experience. \"I just felt like, 'Why am I so alone in this? This is something we all go through.' And this idea gave me great strength, that I'm on a road that has been traveled by everybody, in one form or another. Why every time somebody is going down this road should it feel like the first time?\"[49] Cooper won a 2023 Webby Award for Best Series for All There Is. His 5-word acceptance speech was \"All There Is, Is Love.\"[50] As of 2016, Cooper was not registered to any political party.[51] While promoting his book, Cooper told Oprah Winfrey he had dyslexia as a child.[52] Cooper played Dungeons & Dragons with his brother as a child. He later said that it gave him and his brother an escape from the grief of their father's death.[53] Cooper is gay; as of 2012, he was (according to The New York Times) \"the most prominent openly gay journalist on American television\".[54] For years, Cooper avoided discussing his private life in interviews. On July 2, 2012, however, he gave Andrew Sullivan permission to publish an email that stated, in part:[55] I've begun to consider whether the unintended outcomes of maintaining my privacy outweigh personal and professional principle. It's become clear to me that by remaining silent on certain aspects of my personal life for so long, I have given some the mistaken impression that I am trying to hide something—something that makes me uncomfortable, ashamed or even afraid. This is distressing because it is simply not true. ... The fact is, I'm gay, always have been, always will be, and I couldn't be any more happy, comfortable with myself, and proud. In 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook sought Cooper's advice before making the decision to publicly come out as gay.[56] In 2014, Cooper and his long-term partner at the time, Benjamin Maisani, purchased Rye House, a historic estate in Connecticut.[57] In March 2018, Cooper confirmed that he and Maisani had split up.[58] Cooper was friends with Anthony Bourdain, celebrity chef and host of the CNN series Parts Unknown. After Bourdain died by suicide on June 8, 2018, Cooper paid tribute to him in a CNN special program, Remembering Anthony Bourdain.[59][60] Cooper also paid tribute to Bourdain on the Thanksgiving 2020 episode of Anderson Cooper Full Circle, saying that he was \"proud to call Anthony Bourdain a friend\", and adding: \"He is so, so missed by so many.\"[61][62] In 2021, Cooper and co-author Katherine Howe published Vanderbilt: The Rise and Fall of an American Dynasty, a history of the Vanderbilt family going back to his Vanderbilt ancestors who came to New Amsterdam in the 17th century.[63] On April 30, 2020, Cooper announced the birth of his son Wyatt Morgan Cooper by a surrogate on April 27. \"On Monday I became a father. I've never said that out loud and it astonishes me. I have a son,\" he said at the end of a CNN Town Hall on his show, Anderson Cooper 360°. He also went on to make an announcement on Instagram, stating that \"Wyatt Morgan Cooper was born on Monday weighing 7 pounds 2 ounces.\"[64][65] Though Cooper and Benjamin Maisani are no longer romantically involved, the pair co-parent the child and Maisani was present in the delivery room for Wyatt's birth. Wyatt is named after Cooper's late father, Wyatt Cooper, and his middle name is derived from the Morgan side of his family, being the maiden name of his maternal grandmother Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt.[66] On February 10, 2022, Cooper announced at the beginning of his show on CNN that he had just become a father for a second time to a son named Sebastian Luke Maisani-Cooper. Maisani is in the process of adopting Cooper's son Wyatt, after which Wyatt's surname will become Maisani-Cooper.[67][may be outdated as of November 2024] Cooper helped lead CNN's Peabody Award-winning coverage of Hurricane Katrina, and the network's Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award-winning coverage of the 2004 tsunami. He has won 18 Emmy Awards, including two for his coverage of the earthquake in Haiti, and an Edward R. Murrow Award.[68]",

                "content": "The 2025 NHL Winter Classic was an outdoor regular season National Hockey League (NHL) game, part of the Winter Classic series. The game was played on December 31, 2024, with the Chicago Blackhawks hosting the St. Louis Blues at Wrigley Field in Chicago.[1] For the first time, two Winter Classics were held in the same calendar year, as the 2024 Winter Classic had been played on January 1, 2024. The Blues defeated the Blackhawks 6-2. The league announced the game on February 7, 2024, during the first intermission of the NHL on TNT's broadcast of the Tampa Bay Lightning–New York Rangers game.[1][2] Several media sources however leaked the game's site and opponents on the day before.[3][4][5] This was a rematch of the 2017 NHL Winter Classic, when the St. Louis Blues defeated the Chicago Blackhawks, 4−1, at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. This was also Wrigley Field's second time hosting an NHL outdoor game, having previously hosted the 2009 NHL Winter Classic.[1] New Year's Eve was chosen as the date for the Winter Classic, as opposed to its traditional New Year's Day scheduling, in response to the expansion of the College Football Playoff from four teams to 12 beginning in the 2024–25 postseason. The Winter Classic had been on a steady decline in ratings, one exacerbated by the move to the cable-only TNT Sports in 2022, and the move to the less crowded slot on New Year's Eve afternoon (much of the game will take place in the gap between the 2024 Texas Bowl ending and the Fiesta Bowl's kickoff) was intended to make the event \"something (...) very unique on that day.\"[6] A moment of silence for former president of the United States Jimmy Carter who died two days earlier was held prior to the game. The American national anthem was performed by Blackhawks anthem singer Jim Cornelison, accompanied by organist Carrie Marcotte and American Sign Language performer Samantha Taplin. This is Cornelison's third time performing the national anthem at the Winter Classic, following 2009 and 2019. Chicago-based rapper Chance the Rapper performed during the first intermission. Chicago-based rock group The Smashing Pumpkins performed during the player introductions while lead singer Billy Corgan performed \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\". In the United States, broadcasting rights to the game are held by TNT, with sister channel TruTV simulcasting, and streaming on Max. In Canada, rights are held by Sportsnet with streaming on Sportsnet+.",

The outage hit at dawn, plunging the island into an eerie silence as electrical appliances and air conditioners shut down before those who could afford generators turned them on. “It had to be on the 31st of December!” exclaimed one man, who only gave his name as Manuel, as he stood outside a grocery store in the capital of San Juan, grumbling about the outage that coincided with his birthday. “There is no happiness.” See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. Nearly 90% of 1.47 million clients across Puerto Rico were left in the dark, according to Luma Energy, a private company that oversees electricity transmission and distribution. By late Tuesday night, more than 700,000 clients, including 16 hospitals and Puerto Rico's water and sewer company, had power back, according to Luma. However, the company's webpage detailing who remained without power was down. \"We understand the deep frustration this outage has caused, especially on a day like today,\" Luma said in a statement. “We apologize for the disruption to your plans.” Luma said the power outage was likely caused by a failure of an underground power line. It said it's restoring power “in the quickest and safest way possible.” Hugo Sorrentini, a Luma spokesman, told The Associated Press that the incident was under investigation. Discover Puerto Rico, a not-for-profit organization that promotes the island, warned travelers about the outage on its website and asked that cruise ship passengers contact tour operators directly to determine whether they had generators and were open for the day. Five cruise ships were scheduled to dock in Puerto Rico on Tuesday. While most hotels were running on generators, short-term rentals lacking them reported cancellations. The main international airport in San Juan remained open. The blackout fanned simmering anger against Luma and Genera PR, which oversees the generation of power in Puerto Rico, as a growing number of people call for their ouster. Governor-elect Jenniffer González Colón, who is set to be sworn in on Jan. 2, has called for the creation of an “energy czar” to review potential Luma contractual breaches while another operator is found. “We can’t keep relying on an energy system that fails our people,” she wrote on the social media platform X, adding that stabilizing Puerto Rico’s energy grid would be her top priority in office. Meanwhile, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said he was in touch with Luma and Genera PR, adding on X that “we are demanding answers and solutions.” President Joe Biden spoke with Pierluisi on Tuesday evening about the outage and offered federal assistance. Biden also spoke with U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and directed her to offer any help needed to speed power restoration on the island. The outage forced businesses, parks and several malls to close, and the government announced limited schedules for some of its agencies. Workers checked on hundreds of bedridden patients and distributed ice for diabetics to keep their insulin cold. Other Puerto Ricans began to plan ahead. “I'll go to my balcony. That's where I'll sleep,” Raúl Pacheco said with a shrug, as the 63-year-old diabetic sat on a walker nursing an injured foot. Julio Córdova, a municipal worker, said he got dressed by the light of his cellphone and planned to buy candles. “This affects me because I had plans. It couldn't have been yesterday or tomorrow?\" he said, shaking his head as he raked leaves. While island-wide blackouts are rare in Puerto Rico, the U.S. territory struggles with chronic power outages blamed on a crumbling power grid that was razed by Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm in September 2017. The system, however, was already in decline after years of lack of maintenance and investment. Only recently did crews start making permanent repairs to Puerto Rico’s power grid following Hurricane Maria. The island continues to depend on generators provided by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to help stabilize the grid. In November, Puerto Rico’s government asked U.S. officials for permission to keep using more than a dozen portable generators for two additional years. Some Puerto Ricans took the latest outage in stride. “They're part of my everyday life,” said Enid Núñez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority struggles to restructure more than $9 billion in debt, the largest of the island's government agencies. Power plants that rely on petroleum generate more than 60% of Puerto Rico's energy, followed by natural gas and coal. Solar rooftops account for only about 7% of electricity consumption on an island with a poverty rate over 40%.",

                "content": "A major power outage hit Puerto Rico early on New Year's Eve, knocking out power to more than 90% of the island's 1.3 million utility customers. At 7 p.m., LUMA Energy announced that electrical service has been restored to more than 336,000 customers. Priority facilities, including 16 hospitals, the Water and Sewer Authority and the Super Aqueduct, have all also had their power restored. LUMA has also issued an apology to its customers, saying it understood \"the deep frustration that the power outage situation on a day like today is causing our customers and families in the country.\" \"We apologize to everyone for the impact that the event, which is still under investigation, has had on plans to say goodbye to this year and welcome the New Year,\" the company added in a statement. LUMA said the cause of the outage was still under investigation, adding that its teams and emergency operations personnel \"are working tirelessly to restore the electrical system as quickly and safely as possible.\" The island has faced ongoing power issues since Hurricane Maria in 2017, and many residents are frustrated with the grid's reliability. Governor Pedro Pierluisi said he has spoken with President Biden to ask for assistance, and has demanded quicker action and transparency from power companies. While key facilities like the San Juan Medical Center remained operational using backup generators, the blackout raised concerns about Puerto Rico's vulnerability to power failures during major events. Newsweek has reached out to Luma, inquiring about the outage, but the company did not immediately respond. Newsweek's live blog is closed. LUMA Energy has issued an apology to its customers for today's outage, and how it has effected many Puerto Rican residents' New Year's Eve plans. \"We understand the deep frustration that the power outage situation on a day like today is causing our customers and families in the country,\" the company said in a statement. \"We apologize to everyone for the impact that the event, which is still under investigation, has had on plans to say goodbye to this year and welcome the New Year.\" LUMA said the cause of the outage was still under investigation, adding that its teams and emergency operations personnel \"are working tirelessly to restore the electrical system as quickly and safely as possible.\" LUMA Energy said it has restored power to more than 336,000 customers. \"Our 7:00 p.m. update states that over 336,000 are currently in service and our teams continue to fully restore power,\" the energy company said in a statement. \"We currently have approximately 790 MW of generation back online. About 16 hospitals have been energized, including the Naguabo hospital and other facilities such as the Water and Sewer Authority, such as the Super Aqueduct, and critical loads. We will continue to work to restore service as quickly and safely as possible.\" LUMA Energy is a private Canadian-American company based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, responsible for the distribution of electricity in Puerto Rico. In 2021, the Puerto Rican government hired Luma to oversee electricity transmission and distribution, following the bankruptcy of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) after Hurricane Maria in 2017. LUMA's role includes modernizing and maintaining the island's electrical infrastructure, per its mission. CEO Juan Saca, appointed in 2023, said in a hearing in September that the company has made substantial investments to improve the grid, including installing over 17,850 hurricane-proof poles, which meant that more than 95% of customers had over 98% reliable service when power was available. However, LUMA has still come under fire for the repeated power outages that have affected Puerto Rico. Rep. Jenniffer González, the governor-elect for Puerto Rico, said she plans to make the failing energy grid her \"top priority\" when she takes office. \"We can't keep relying on an energy system that fails our people. Today's blackout and the uncertainty around restoration continue to impact our economy and quality of life,\" she said in a post on X. \"Even before officially taking office, I've met with energy and public safety teams to ensure swift action and updates. Restoring power is our priority. LUMA will provide hourly updates on progress. When I take office as Governor, stabilizing Puerto Rico's energy grid will be my top priority.\" We can't keep relying on an energy system that fails our people. Today's blackout and the uncertainty around restoration continue to impact our economy and quality of life. Even before officially taking office, I’ve met with energy and public safety teams to ensure swift action… The White House confirmed today that President Joe Biden had spoken with Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi to \"discuss the widespread power outages across Puerto Rico and offer any federal assistance that they need.\" Biden also spoke with Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm and directed her to provide assistance to \"speed power restoration for the people of Puerto Rico,\" a spokesperson said. Gov. Pierluisi confirmed he'd spoken to Biden who he said, \"reiterated to me the federal government's commitment to assist Puerto Rico in continuing and expediting the reconstruction of the electrical system.\" He added he was granted an extension to use temporary generators that produce 350 megawatts for two additional years, which allows us to use them until 2027.

As of 3:00 p.m. today, LUMA Energy announced that electrical service has been restored to more than 73,000 customers affected by the widespread blackout in Puerto Rico. Approximately 290 megawatts of generation have been reconnected to the grid. We will not settle for less. #PuertoRico pic.twitter.com/5mTeed0oUP New York Congressman Ritchie Torres has called Puerto Rico's failing grid \"he single worst infrastructure crisis in the United States.\" Rep. Torres, who represents a district in the Bronx, said in post on X that the repeated power outages and ageing grid were further symptoms of Puerto Rico's \"second-class status.\" \"Almost all of Puerto Rico has no electricity on New Year's Eve. The failing grid in Puerto Rico is the single worst infrastructure crisis in the United States,\" he said. \"The three million American citizens of Puerto Rico have no right to vote in federal elections.

The storm exacerbated these issues, leading to chronic power outages and high electricity costs. A recent outage in June 2024 affected over 340,000 residents, further emphasizing the system's fragility. Experts and critics, including grassroots groups, stress the urgent need for improvements to avoid further disruptions and hold responsible parties, such as Luma Energy, accountable for their role in the ongoing issues. Journalist Geraldo Rivera and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo have voiced their frustrations over Puerto Rico's persistent power grid issues. Rivera spoke on the grid's unreliability since Hurricane Maria in 2017, calling it \"antiquated and insufferable,\" and stressed that Puerto Ricans, as U.S. citizens, deserve better infrastructure. Cuomo echoed these sentiments, condemning the continuous blackouts as unacceptable and urging the federal government to take responsibility. Both emphasized that such conditions wouldn't be tolerated elsewhere in the United States, demanding immediate and comprehensive action. Former (and perhaps future) Governor Cuomo is right.Puerto Rico’s electrical grid has been notoriously unreliable since 2017 Hurricane Maria. As President Trump saw during his visit then, the system is antiquated and insufferable. Puerto Ricans are U.S.citizens & deserve better. https://t.co/WVkNWoUm0v As Puerto Rico grapples with a sweeping power outage, ALMA San Juan remains fully operational thanks to its emergency generators, a spokesperson told Newsweek. The luxury hotel, situated at the gateway to Old San Juan, is proceeding with its planned New Year's Eve events. \"Our commitment to providing an unforgettable experience remains unwavering,\" said Gisela Rivera, the hotel's General Manager. Signature restaurants Mar y Rosa and Andaluz are hosting their rooftop and ballroom celebrations, offering uninterrupted service despite the island-wide blackout affecting millions. T-Mobile Puerto Rico reported disruptions to its network operations due to the ongoing blackout impacting the island. Some transmission sites have been affected, leading the company to deploy engineering teams to recharge batteries and refuel generator-powered antennas. Although T-Mobile has not disclosed the extent of the outage or the affected areas, the company assured customers that efforts to stabilize services are underway. Updates will be provided through official channels as the situation develops. Luma Energy has shared an update on X, confirming that over 73,000 customers have had their power re-established. There are still many more without electricity at the moment. It added that the actual cause of the issues remains under investigation. Declaraciones 3:00 PM, LUMA continuamos restableciendo el servicio A la 3:00 PM, nuestros equipos continúan en el restablecimiento del servicio eléctrico. Al momento se encuentran en servicio sobre 73,000 clientes, con aproximadamente 290 MW de generación de vuelta en… Puerto Ricans have expressed their frustrations over the repeated power outages on the island. \"Frustration, disappointment with the government, with the institutions, with everything,\" Sonia Arroyo, a resident of Vega Alta, near San Juan, told CNN on Tuesday. The power grid that Puerto Ricans rely on is old, poorly-maintained, and overstretched, while efforts to modernize it have been slow. Liz Rebeca Aponte, from Dorado, said that she was concerned about the development of the island and that potential businesses and investors could be put off by the poor infrastructure. \"Here we work in the pharmaceutical industry, and industries that want to invest in the country will not come here if we do not improve the structure,\" she said. The critical failure in Puerto Rico's power grid on New Year's Eve knocked out power to nearly 90% of LUMA Energy customers this morning. LUMA, the Canadian-American power company on the island, have begun restoring power but 1.2 million users, or more than 80% of customers remained without power as of noon, local time, CNN reports. With Puerto Rico's power grid still unreliable, including the recent outage affecting residents, it's important to prepare, per Ready.gov. Consider using backup power sources, such as portable chargers and batteries. Ensure you have enough nonperishable food and water, and keep refrigerators and freezers closed. Stay safe by never using gas stoves for heating or generators indoors. For medical needs, consult your doctor about plans for power-dependent devices. And remember to monitor local updates during outages for further guidance. Puerto Rico's power grid remains vulnerable, even years after Hurricane Maria devastated the island. The grid's issues stem from outdated infrastructure, chronic underinvestment, and reliance on fossil fuels. Despite efforts to modernize, including transitioning to renewable energy sources, only 3% of the island's energy comes from renewables. The privatization of its power utility has led to mismanagement and delayed repairs, exacerbating outages like the one affecting the island today. The lack of resilience in the system, combined with the fragility of the grid, continues to leave Puerto Ricans in the dark during crises. The Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan has managed to continue flights using backup generators, ensuring that operations remain functional despite the ongoing power outage affecting Puerto Rico. However, airlines are cautioning travelers to monitor flight statuses closely, as there may be delays or cancellations if the power situation worsens. Passengers are advised to stay updated on their flight schedules. Rep. Dan Goldman shared his reaction to the ongoing outage issues in Puerto Rico, including today's, criticizing the response to the island's power grid. Puerto Rico’s crumbling power grid is a consequence of government negligence—full stop. In no other American community would we tolerate regular blackouts for millions of people.PR deserves the investment that every American is entitled to. We are failing that obligation. https://t.co/CmNxCNO52Q Puerto Rico's aging power grid, long plagued by recurring blackouts, continues to highlight the fragility of its infrastructure. The energy crisis has even permeated pop culture, with Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny addressing the issue in his hit song \"El Apagón,\" which references the recurrent blackouts. The latest outage, striking during New Year's Eve celebrations, has disrupted travel plans and daily life. For travelers, it has sparked concerns over flight delays and cancellations, while for residents, it serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for significant upgrades to the island's power system. This incident follows a series of blackouts earlier in the year, including a storm-related outage in August that left 700,000 without power. Despite a recent transition to private grid management, progress in improving reliability has been slow. Read the full article by Jesus Mesa on Newsweek. Following the widespread blackout that left most of Puerto Rico without power, authorities announced on Tuesday afternoon that electricity had been restored at the La Plata plant, Telemundo reports. The Bayamón municipality reported that water service would be restored within the next three hours. To mitigate the effects of the outage, several water distribution points, called \"water oases,\" were set up in key areas, offering water from 2:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., with additional emergency water supply at various locations. Rep. Nydia Velázquez expressed concern over the ongoing electricity issues in Puerto Rico, highlighting the stark reality that many Puerto Ricans are facing power outages as the New Year approaches. \"As we get ready to celebrate the New Year, Puerto Ricans be forced to celebrate in darkness,\" she wrote on X. \"This is just the latest injustice done to the people of Puerto Rico by a fractured system. \"I hope this matter gets solved swiftly.\" Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner-elect Pablo José Hernández Rivera shared a statement on X on the power grid crisis that caused the outage today. \"I will collaborate closely with Congressional leaders and the incoming administrations in Puerto Rico and the United States to deliver real, lasting solutions,\" the statement read. \"Our people deserve reliable energy and a brighter future.\" We will not settle for less. #PuertoRico pic.twitter.com/5mTeed0oUP LUMA Energy announced that by 1:27 p.m., power was restored to 44,700 customers in the metropolitan area and Culebra, marking 3% of those affected by the outage. The company continues to investigate the cause of the blackout while working closely with Governor Pedro Pierluisi, Governor-elect Jenniffer González, and local mayors. Critical facilities, including the Medical Center and San Juan Municipal Hospital, have been re-energized. Restoration efforts are expected to take 24 to 48 hours, with updates to be provided.

At Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, operations continue with backup power, though air conditioning is absent and food options are limited. Shopping malls, including Plaza Las Américas and The Mall of San Juan, remain closed, though some stores with backup power are open. Many businesses are running at reduced capacity, and residents are relying on personal generators for electricity where possible. Puerto Rico's power grid remains in a state of disrepair, largely due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, along with years of underinvestment and poor maintenance. Despite ongoing repairs, the island continues to rely heavily on FEMA-provided portable generators to stabilize the system. In November, the Puerto Rican government sought permission from U.S. officials to extend the use of these generators for an additional two years, underscoring the continued struggle to restore reliable power infrastructure. New York Attorney General Leticia James has called the outage situation in Puerto Rico \"unacceptable\" in a tweet this morning. \"The people of Puerto Rico deserve to have an infrastructure on their island that doesn't leave them in the dark,\" she wrote. This is unacceptable.The people of Puerto Rico deserve to have an infrastructure on their island that doesn’t leave them in the dark.https://t.co/hbjgz4WUcN The contract between LUMA Energy and the Puerto Rican government has faced significant backlash due to its lack of transparency. Signed behind closed doors, it grants LUMA control over critical infrastructure, customer service, and administrative functions. Legal experts have raised concerns about LUMA's ability to dissolve the agreement with just a 120-day notice and its request for limited liability, which was ultimately denied. Critics argue that the deal worsens Puerto Rico's energy crisis, with calls for legal challenges to the contract's validity. LUMA Energy is a private company responsible for the transmission and distribution of electricity in Puerto Rico. It took over these duties from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) on June 1, 2021, after a 15-year contract was signed in June 2020. LUMA's role includes modernizing and maintaining the island's electrical infrastructure, per its mission. The transition to private management was part of a broader shift that began in 2018, when the Puerto Rican government allowed private companies to manage PREPA's assets and services. The Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTOP) in Puerto Rico has extended the validity of vehicle tags that expire on December 31, 2024, until January 15, 2025, due to the ongoing power outage situation. This measure, under Resolution No. 2024-31, ensures no penalties for late inspections or renewals within this period. Additionally, the extension covers the ACAA and compulsory insurance, ensuring that affected individuals maintain access to necessary services in case of an accident. Luma Energy has shared an update on X, formerly Twitter, updating its customers about the re-establishment of power in Centro Médico hospital and the Hospital Municipal de San Juan. The municipality of Culebra also has electricity, according to the company. It added that there will be updates made on its X every two hours.

                "title": "College Football Playoff - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The College Football Playoff (CFP) is an annual postseason knockout invitational tournament to determine a national champion for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the highest level of college football competition in the United States. It culminates in the College Football Playoff National Championship game.[1][2] The inaugural tournament was held at the end of the 2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season under a four-team format.[3] The CFP Board of Managers voted in 2023 to expand the playoff to twelve teams beginning in 2024, an arrangement that will last at least through the end of the 2025 season. After 2025, the current contract between all major entities expires and a new contract will be drawn up, with indications that additional expansion to a 14-team playoff or larger may take place at that time.[4][5] As the NCAA does not organize or award an official national championship for FBS football (instead merely recognizing the decisions made by any of a number of independent major championship selectors), the CFP's inception in 2014 marked the first time a major national championship selector in college football was able to determine their champion by using a bracket competition.[6][7] A 13-member committee has selected and seeded the teams to take part in the CFP.[8] This system differs from the use of polls or computer rankings that had previously been used to select the participants for the Bowl Championship Series (BCS), the title system used in FBS from 1998 to 2013. The CFP format used from 2014 to 2023 was a four-team single-elimination tournament, with participants determined and seeded by the selection committee. The current 12-team CFP format will feature, for the first time, a first round of playoffs separated from bowl games. The first round will consist of seeds 5 through 12 playing one another at the home stadium of the better seeded teams, or another venue of their choice. Then, the quarter-final and semi-final games will consist of the New Year's Six bowl games, with a national championship game after that.[9][10] From 2014 through 2023, the two semifinal games rotated among the six New Year's Day bowl games: the Cotton Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, Orange Bowl, Peach Bowl, Rose Bowl, and Sugar Bowl.[11] In addition to the teams selected for the playoff, from 2014 to 2023 the final CFP rankings were used in determining the participants for the four New Year's Six bowls that were not hosting the semifinals that year. Under the original four-team format, the two semifinal games were played on the same day; with the expansion of the CFP in 2024, they will be played on back-to-back days. The College Football Playoff National Championship game is then played on the first Monday that is six or more days after the Semifinals.[12] The venue of the championship game is then selected based on bids submitted by cities, similar to the NCAA Final Four. The winner of the Championship Game is awarded the College Football Playoff National Championship Trophy. Playoff officials commissioned a new trophy that was unconnected with the previous championship systems, such as the AFCA \"crystal football\" trophy which had been regularly presented after the championship game since the 1990s (as the AFCA was contractually obligated to name the BCS champion as the Coaches Poll champion).[13] However, BCS Properties, LLC is the legal entity which owns all CFP trademarks.[14] CFP Administration, LLC is the legal entity that administers the College Football Playoff.[15] From its formation in 2014 to the end of the 2023 season, the College Football Playoff used a four-team knockout bracket to determine the national champion. Six bowl games—the Rose Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, Cotton Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, and Peach Bowl– rotated as hosts for the semifinals.[16] The rotation was set on a three-year cycle with the following pairings: Rose/Sugar, Orange/Cotton, and Fiesta/Peach. The two semifinal bowls and the other four top-tier bowls were marketed as the New Year's Six.[17] Per contract, the Rose and Sugar Bowls were always on New Year's Day. Originally three games were held on New Year's Eve with the other three on New Year's Day. However, disappointing TV ratings in the first rotation led to games originally planned for New Year's Eve be moved to as early as December 27 in some years.[2] The selection committee seeded the top four teams, and also assigned teams to the at-large bowls (Cotton, Fiesta, and Peach) in years when they did not host semifinals.[18] The four-team format pitted the No. 1-ranked team against No. 4 and No. 2 against No. 3. The seeding determined the semifinal bowl game assigned to each matchup; the No. 1 seed chose its bowl game to prevent it from playing in a \"road\" environment. There were no limits on the number of teams per conference, a change from previous BCS rules.[2] However, some non-semifinal bowl selections still maintain their conference tie-ins, similarly to the BCS's automatic qualifier berths.[19] The CFP will expand to a 12-team format for the 2024 and 2025 seasons.[20][21] Features of the expanded playoff include:[22] The teams seeded 5–12 will play first-round games hosted by the better seed, either at their home stadium or another venue of their choosing.[22] The semifinal and quarterfinal rounds of the playoff are hosted by the New Year's Six: the Rose Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, Cotton Bowl, Peach Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl. These games are played annually on or around New Year's Day and represent six of the oldest and most prestigious college football bowl games. During the four-team playoff era, the bowls rotated on a three-year cycle. Two of the six bowls served as the CFP semifinals for any given year with the following pairings: Rose/Sugar, Orange/Cotton, and Fiesta/Peach. The year's four off-cycle bowls hosted bowl games outside of the CFP tournament bracket. In the 12-team playoff format, four of the six bowls host quarterfinal games on or around New Year's Day (which are determined in the above pairings on a three-year cycle). The winners advance to play in the semifinals, held in the two remaining bowls one week later. The bowls will again cycle on a rotating basis.[22] Cities around the country bid to host each year's championship game. The playoff group's leaders make a selection from those proposals, in a similar fashion to other large sporting events, such as the NCAA Final Four. Officials say the championship game will be held in a different city each year, and that bids must propose host stadiums with a capacity of at least 65,000 spectators.[23] Under the system, cities cannot host both a semifinal game and the title game in the same year. In practice, since the inaugural CFP national championship game every title game up to and including the 2025 season has been played (or is scheduled to be played) in a stadium hosting at least one National Football League team, and has been played indoors and/or in a warm-weather city. The College Football Playoff Selection Committee consists of 13 members who generally serve three-year terms, although some initial 2013 selections served two- and four-year terms \"to achieve a rotation\" of members.[24][25] The 2024–25 CFP selection committee members are:[26] The committee members include one current athletic director from each of the five \"major\" conferences—ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, and SEC—also known as the Power Five conferences.[27][28][needs update] Other members are former coaches, players, athletic directors, and administrators, plus a retired member of the media. The goal was for the panel to consist proportionally of current \"Power Five\" athletic directors, former coaches, and a third group of other voters,[27] excluding current conference commissioners, coaches, and media members.[29] During the selection process, organizers said they wanted the committee to be geographically balanced.[30] Conference commissioners submitted lists totaling more than 100 names from which to select the final committee members.[31][32] The selection of Condoleezza Rice, a former U.S. Secretary of State and Stanford University provost, was met with some backlash within the sport and the media. Critics questioned her qualifications, citing gender and lack of football experience.[41][42] The committee releases its top 25 rankings weekly on Tuesdays in the second half of the regular season. The top four teams are seeded in that order for the playoff.[43][44] During the season, the committee meets and releases rankings six or seven times, depending on the length of the season (the number of games is consistent, but the number of weeks those games are played over can vary from year to year).[36] The group, which meets at the Gaylord Texan hotel in Grapevine, Texas,[45] reportedly meets in person up to 10 total times a year.[32] A team's strength of schedule is one of the most pertinent considerations for the committee in making its selections.[46] Other factors that the committee weighs are conference championships, team records, and head-to-head results,[12] plus other points such as injuries and weather.[47] Unlike the BCS system, the AP Poll, Coaches' Poll, and the Harris Poll, computer rankings are not used to make the selections.[8][27] Advanced statistics and metrics are expected to be submitted to the committee, though like other analytics, they have no formal role in the decision.[48] Committee members are not required to attend games.[45] Long said the panel considered less frequent rankings, but ultimately decided on a weekly release. \"That's what the fans have become accustomed to, and we felt it would leave a void in college football without a ranking for several weeks,\" he said. Long also noted: \"Early on there was some talk that we would go into a room at the end of the season and come out with a top four, but that didn't last long.\"[49] In analyzing this change in thinking, Stewart Mandel of Sports Illustrated commented: \"The whole point of the selection committee was to replace the simplistic horse-race nature of Top 25 polls – where teams only move up if someone above them loses – with a more deliberative evaluation method. Now the playoff folks are going to try to do both.\"[50] Addressing the \"pecking order\" nature of traditional polls, George Schrodeder of USA Today wrote that \"if it actually works as intended, we could see volatile swings\" from week to week, with lower-ranked teams moving ahead of higher-ranked teams without either team losing (a rarity in traditional polls). Both Long and Bill Hancock, the CFP executive director, say they expect that to happen.[51] The committee's voting method uses multiple ballots, similar to the NCAA basketball tournament selection process and the entire process is facilitated through custom software developed by Code Authority in Frisco, Texas.[52] From a large initial pool of teams, the group takes numerous votes on successive tiers of teams, considering six at a time and coming to a consensus on how they should be ranked, then repeating the process with the next tier of teams. Discussion and debate happens at each voting step. All votes are by secret ballot, and committee members do not make their ballots public.[49] Each week's ranking process begins anew, with no weight given to the previous week's selections.[51] In this fashion, the committee selects the teams to compete for the national championship. Committee members who are currently employed or financially compensated by a school, or have family members who have a current financial relationship (which includes football players), are not allowed to vote for that school. During deliberations about a team's selection, members with such a conflict of interest cannot be present, but can answer factual questions about the institution.[49] All committee members have past ties to certain NCAA institutions,[45] but the committee decided to ignore those ties in the recusal requirements. \"We just boiled it down to where we felt this group was fit to its high integrity and would differentiate from those past relationships,\" Long said.[49] Some football writers, like Dennis Dodd and Mark Schlabach, have said the recusal arrangement isn't transparent or objective, suggesting that members' alma maters and former coaching jobs should be considered disqualifying conflicts of interest.[53][54] College football is arguably the oldest organized sport in the United States. It is substantially older than its professional counterpart, the NFL, and its earliest game, in 1869, was occurring at almost the same time professional baseball was getting started. The game developed into a popular sport with its own unique \"post-season\" of bowl games by the end of the first four decades of the 20th Century, the time around which the NCAA began to develop and oversee post-season tournaments in other sports. The NCAA did eventually come to oversee much of college football. For example, in 1957, the NCAA organized college football into University and College divisions, with larger programs in the University Division, smaller ones in the College Division. In 1973, the NCAA created Division I out of the University Division, and Divisions II and III out of the College Division for smaller programs with scholarships (Div II) and without scholarships (Div III). In 1978, Division I was sub-divided into I-A (largest programs) and I-AA, which would later be renamed FBS (I-A) and FCS (I-AA) respectively. As the smaller divisions and FCS subdivision were created, the NCAA organized post-season playoffs for them. However, FBS programs resisted making any changes to how its post-season was organized. This was because of the popularity and profitability of bowl games, which had become major TV events in the decades following World War II. Bowl games, which for many years were only exhibition games, became so popular and important within college football that, starting in 1965, the AP (sportswriters) Poll waited until after the bowl games were completed to declare its national champion. The other major poll, UPI (Coaches) began doing so in 1974. This evolution led the FBS annual \"national champion\" open to considerable debate and controversy. At times in the past, particularly during the polling era from 1936 to 1997, the term \"mythical national championship\" was frequently used, and larger programs have often unilaterally declared themselves national champions.[55][56][57][58][59] While the NCAA has never officially endorsed a championship team, it has documented the choices of some selectors in its official NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records publication.[60][61] In addition, various analysts have independently published their own choices for each season. These opinions can often diverge with others as well as individual schools' claims to national titles, which may or may not correlate to the selections published elsewhere. Among the most widely recognized national champion selectors has been the Associated Press (AP), which has conducted the AP Poll of sportswriters since the 1936 season.[62] (see also: List of AP Poll national champions).[63][64] The AP's main competition, United Press International (UPI), created the first Coaches Poll in 1950. (see also: List of Coaches' Poll national champions).[64] The two polls have picked different final national poll leaders at the end of 11 different seasons since then;[65] this situation is referred to as a \"split\" national championship.[66] As the years passed, public pressure for a playoff grew, especially following seasons in which there were split national championships in the polls. By the 1990s, the sport underwent several changes that led to a playoff. The 1992 SEC Championship Game was an enormous risk that paid off well for the Southeastern Conference (SEC) that year and in future years and gave a glimpse at what post-season football might look like.[67] Other conferences would follow suit over the next decade. FBS schools also began making changes to bowl games themselves in the 1990s to increase the likelihood of having the top two ranked teams play each other. However, existing bowl tie-ins with conferences made arrangements such as the Bowl Coalition (1992–1994)[68] and then Bowl Alliance (1995–1997)[69] clumsy and incomplete at best. By 1997, public pressure from fans, coaches, and commentators for a true playoff of some kind had grown too great to ignore.[70][71][72][73] The Bowl Championship Series in 1998 succeeded in finally bringing all major conferences and bowl games into the fold for a combined BCS National Championship Game rotated amongst the four largest, most profitable bowl games - Fiesta, Orange, Rose, and Sugar.[62] BCS rankings originally incorporated the two major polls as well as a number of computer ranking systems to determine the two best teams at the end of the season.[74] Although the BCS era did regularly produce compelling matchups, the winnowing selection of the top two teams resulted in many BCS controversies, most notably 2003's split national championship caused by the BCS rankings leaving USC, No. 1 in both major polls, out of the Sugar Bowl.[75] This controversy ultimately led to the AP Poll withdrawing from the BCS, and additional fine-tuning of the BCS formula. After that, the controversies lessened, but the BCS approach itself had lost the confidence of many within the college football world, and ultimately the pressure for more change led to the development of the College Football Playoff. In 2014, the College Football Playoff made its debut, facilitating a multi-game single-elimination tournament for the first time in college football history. Four teams are seeded by a 13-member selection committee rather than by existing polls or mathematical rankings.[24][76] The Cotton and Peach bowls were also brought into the fold. The two semifinal games became rotated among these New Year's Six bowl games, set on a three-year cycle with the following pairings: Rose/Sugar, Orange/Cotton, and Fiesta/Peach.[17] The College Football Playoff National Championship is then played a week later at a separately determined neutral site.[16] From the beginning of the CFP, many within college football wanted a playoff larger than four teams. The four team playoff seems to have been arrived at through a combination of concerns such as keeping the regular season meaningful, balancing academic schedules, and fear of eroding public support for bowl games.[77] Several years of the 4-team playoff led to growing calls for expansion. In June 2021, the CFP announced that it would begin studying an expansion to a 12-team playoff. The CFP stated that the starting time of any new format would only be determined after it had been approved.[78] On February 18, 2022, the CFP rejected the playoff proposal that had seemed to have already won approval, largely through resistance of the Atlantic Coast Conference. This pushed implementation of any changes to the playoff pool to no sooner than the 2026 season.[79] However, that decision was reversed on September 2, 2022, following the announcement by USC and UCLA that they were leaving the Pac-12 for the Big Ten. The \"alliance\" between the ACC, Pac-12, and Big Ten dissolved, and along with it resistance to playoff expansion. The CFP Board of Managers unanimously voted to expand the playoffs to 12 teams, with the earliest possible change happening in the 2024 season.[80] Conferences and bowls negotiated early expansion for several months during the fall of 2022. A potential sticking point was the Rose Bowl, which desired to keep its traditional 5:00 p.m. ET/2:00 p.m. PT kickoff on New Year's Day or January 2, even during years it will host the semifinals instead of the quarterfinals. The problem was resolved when the commissioners gave the Rose Bowl an ultimatum to accept no special treatment or be excluded from the new playoffs, with the bowl agreeing to forgo its demands.[20] By the end of 2022, a new 12-team format was approved to be implemented for the 2024 season.[20] Originally, the expanded playoff was to include the top six ranked conference champions and six at-large bids, though it was later changed to five conference champions and seven at-large bids after the 2021–2024 NCAA conference realignment resulted in the Pac-12 Conference dropping to two members.[81] \"Strength of schedule will become such an important factor ... that if you want to be under consideration, you need to have a more meaningful schedule than perhaps you've had in previous years.\" Due to the increased emphasis on strength of schedule, teams have considered playing more challenging opponents during the non-conference portion of their schedules. Some teams have traditionally played three or four \"weak\" non-conference opponents, but wins against such low-level competition are unlikely to impress the committee. For teams on the cusp of making the playoff four, \"I think one of the first things the committee will look at is strength of schedule,\" said selector Oliver Luck.[83] Teams in the Big Ten, Big 12 and Pac-12 play nine conference games on their twelve-game schedules and thus only have flexibility in choosing their opponents for the three non-league games. Some programs are opting to increase their schedule strength by scheduling high-profile matchups at neutral sites and on weeknights, garnering primetime TV exclusivity.[84][85] In response to the new playoff system, the Southeastern Conference considered increasing its conference schedule from eight to nine games, with Alabama coach Nick Saban a vocal proponent.[86] According to Jon Solomon of the Birmingham News, \"The prevailing opinion among SEC athletics directors: The SEC is difficult enough that there's no need for a ninth game.\"[87] Some in the conference, like Mississippi State athletic director Scott Stricklin, expressed the opinion that a nine-game SEC schedule would result in more teams with two losses. Commissioner Michael Slive and Vanderbilt AD David Williams, among others, supported a stronger out-of-league schedule, which would likely impress the committee.[87][88] In April 2014, the league voted to mandate that all SEC teams must play a Power Five foe (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, or independent Notre Dame) in its non-conference slate beginning in 2016. Slive noted this rule \"gives us the added strength-of-schedule we were seeking\".[86] In 2014, the first year of the College Football Playoff, one team (Georgia) played two opponents from the Power Five, nine of the 14 teams played one Power Five conference opponent and three lower-level opponents (including one FCS school), and four teams did not face a Power Five foe.[84] In the spring of 2015, the SEC decided to count games played against Independents BYU and Army toward its Power Five requirement. The ACC, whose teams also play eight conference games (plus Notre Dame at least once every three years), also considered moving to a nine-game conference schedule. However, the league opted to stay with the eight-plus-Notre Dame model, stipulating instead that teams would have to play one Power Five school in their non-league slates beginning in 2017, which would include the Notre Dame game or other ACC schools,[89] as will games against another FBS independent, BYU.[90] Despite the push to increase schedule strength, some ACC coaches preferred the scheduling flexibility available with fewer permanent fixtures on a team's slate.[91] Opinion was split among league athletic directors on moving to a nine-game schedule prior to the vote.[92] An SEC expansion to a nine-game schedule would limit the ACC's opportunities to play Power Five non-conference opponents.[93] In the 4-team era of the College Football Playoff, lasting from 2014 until the 10th tournament in 2023, 32 of the 40 teams selected for the College Football Playoff were undefeated or 1-loss conference champions from one of the Power Conferences. Three 1-loss Power Conference teams were selected without playing in their conference championship game, and three others were selected after losing their respective conference championship games. One undefeated independent team was selected during this era, as well as one undefeated conference champion from a Group of Five conference. No teams with two or more losses were ever selected by the committee to compete in the 4-team playoff.[94][95][96][97][98][99][100][101] teams Records reflect conference affiliations at the time each game was played. For example, Oregon played in 2014 as a member of the Pac-12, and in 2024 as a member of the Big Ten. † In progress, results incomplete—(#) represents games to be played, when known In 2013, the television broadcast rights to all six CFP bowls and the National Championship were acquired by ESPN through the 2025–26 season.[102][103] ESPN then reached 12-year agreements to retain rights to the Rose Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Sugar Bowl following the dissolution of the Bowl Championship Series.[104] In November of that year, ESPN reached a 12-year deal to broadcast the remaining three bowls, the championship game, as well as shoulder programming such as ranking shows. As a whole, the contract is valued at around $470 million per year, or nearly $5.7 billion for the life of the contract. On March 19, 2024, ESPN reached a six-year extension, valued at $1.3 billion per year.[105] This deal will see ESPN add the four new first-round playoff games, of which ESPN has sublicensed two to TNT Sports and will simulcast the two others on ABC.[106] ESPN will continue to be the home for the New Year's Six bowls and the National Championship Game.[107][108] In addition, as part of this deal, beginning in 2026–27, ESPN will simulcast the National Championship Game on ABC, marking a return of the game to broadcast television for the first time since 2010.[109] The inaugural College Football Playoff games in January 2015 generated larger ratings than previous BCS games. The 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship had an 18.9 Nielsen rating[110] and was watched by approximately 33.4 million people, the largest broadcast audience of all time on American cable television (non-broadcast), according to AdWeek. That was a 31 percent audience increase over the previous year's championship game and a 22 percent increase over the BCS title game's best rating on cable (a 16.1 rating in 2011).[111] The semifinal games, the 2015 Rose Bowl and 2015 Sugar Bowl, saw 28.16 million and 28.27 million viewers, respectively.[112] According to ESPN, these games also set (and briefly held) all-time records for cable TV viewership.[113][114] In 2015, the ratings for the two semifinal games were down from the prior season's equivalents, with the Orange Bowl reaching a 9.7 rating (in comparison to 15.5 for the 2015 Rose Bowl) and the Cotton Bowl reaching a 9.9 rating (in comparison to a 15.3 rating for the 2015 Sugar Bowl). On the online WatchESPN streaming service, excluding 2014 FIFA World Cup games, the Cotton Bowl and the Orange Bowl drew the second and third-largest streaming audiences in the service's history, behind the 2015 national championship. The ratings drops were attributed to the New Year's Eve time slot, as fewer people were at home to watch the game.[115] The decline in ratings was a factor in changes for the scheduling of future CFP semi-final games.[116] In 2012, ESPN reportedly agreed to pay about $7.3 billion over 12 years for broadcasting rights to all seven games, an average of about $608 million per year. That includes $215 million per year which was already committed to the Rose, Sugar and Orange bowls,[117] plus $470–475 million annually for the rest of the package.[118] By comparison, the most recent contract with the BCS and the Rose Bowl had paid approximately $155 million per year for five games.[119] The average revenue to the new system over 12 years is to be about $500 million per year. After $125–150 million in expenses, the Power Five conferences split about 71.5 percent of the remaining money, for an approximate average payout of $250 million a year ($50 million per league) over the life of the contract. The \"Group of Five\" conferences split 27 percent, about $90 million a year ($18 million per league). Notre Dame receives around one percent, about $3.5-4 million, and other FBS independents get about 0.5 percent of the deal.[120][121] Extra revenue goes to conferences in contracts with the Rose, Sugar, and Orange bowls, which split revenue 50/50 between their participating leagues.[120] In non-semifinal years, the Rose Bowl's TV revenue would be divided between the Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences; likewise, the Sugar Bowl and Orange Bowl revenue to its participant conferences. When those bowls are semifinal games, the money is distributed by the playoff system to all FBS conferences.[117] ESPN has paid about $80 million a year each for the Rose and Sugar bowls over 12 years. The Orange Bowl deal is worth $55 million per year.[122] For example, in a non-semifinal year, the Big Ten could receive about $90 million (half of its $80 million Rose Bowl deal plus about $50 million from the playoff system).[120] Conferences receive an additional $6 million each year for each team it places in the semifinals and $4 million for a team in one of the three at-large bowls; Notre Dame receives the same amount in either scenario. No additional money is awarded for reaching the championship game.[120] The Power Five conferences and the \"Group of Five\" have not decided on their respective revenue-sharing formulas, though the SEC initially receives more revenue than the other four Power Five conferences due to its BCS success.[120][121] Reports say the money is to be divided based on several criteria such as \"on-field success, teams' expenses, marketplace factors and academic performance of student-athletes\".[123] The playoff system awards academic performance bonuses of $300,000 per school for meeting the NCAA's Academic Progress Rate standard of 930.[120] In a hypothetical 14-team conference, $4.2 million ($300,000 x 14) would be allocated to that league, and if only 12 of the 14 members meet the APR standard, then each of the 12 schools would receive $350,000 ($4.2 million / 12),[121] penalizing schools that fall below the threshold.[124] BCS Properties, LLC holds all properties related to the College Football Playoff.[125] Previous BCS commissioner Bill Hancock is the executive director of the playoff organization,[126] with former SEC Assistant Commissioner for Championships Byron Hatch as COO.[127] Like the BCS, the playoff system's management committee[128] consists of the conference commissioners from the 10 FBS conferences[129] and Notre Dame's athletic director.[31] The playoff system's headquarters is in Irving, Texas.[126] According to the CFP website, the system's operations are controlled by the Board of Managers, which consists of presidents and chancellors of the playoff group's member universities. The eleven members have sole authority to develop, review and approve annual budgets, policies and operating guidelines. The group also selects the company's officers.[130] According to the CFP website, the Athletics Directors Advisory Group is appointed by the management committee to \"offer counsel\" on the operations of the system. As an advisory board, it has no authority in the management of the CFP.[130] Although being generally well received,[10] the College Football Playoff has been criticized much like its predecessor, the Bowl Championship Series, which had several controversies.[131] Because the tournament has four teams, at least one Power Five champion misses the playoffs every season. However, not all teams selected have been conference winners: Some analysts have discussed whether the committee should select conference champions only.[132][133] Another critique centered around a perceived bias against smaller conferences such as the Big 12 which used to not stage a conference championship game, but reintroduced one for the 2017 season. The American Athletic Conference addressed this issue by enlisting Navy to its ranks for 2015, bringing its membership to 12 teams, which allowed it to stage a conference championship game under then-current NCAA rules.[134] Since the 2016 season, FBS conferences have been allowed to stage football championship games even if they do not have 12 members.[135] There are opinions[by whom?] labeling the CFP system \"just as\" or \"even more polarizing\" than the BCS or the old wire-service poll system.[136][137][138][139] However, most in sports media[who?] believe the College Football Playoff Committee got the right foursome for the 2017–18 playoff, for example, for advancing Alabama, a one-loss team excluded from its conference championship on a tiebreaker, instead of Ohio State, a two-loss conference champion.[140][141][142] In 2019, Urban Meyer, head coach of the national champion 2014 Ohio State Buckeyes football team, said that he intentionally ran up the score against Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game to help his team be chosen for the playoff. Criticizing the subjectivity of the selection process, Meyer said that he left the starting lineup in the game despite Ohio State being ahead 45–0 in the third quarter—not resting the starters and risking their health, and poor sportsmanship—because \"I don't think the 'eye test' and 'people think' is going to get enough to bump TCU and Baylor\". He continued, \"I had a job to do, and that was to get Ohio State in the playoff. Do I think that's right? That's wrong\", proposing a selection system based on defined criteria.[143] Late in the 2020 season, which was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Sports Illustrated writer Pat Forde was strongly critical of the CFP committee for what he considered unfair treatment of teams outside the Power Five; he note that the Big 12's Iowa State, at 8–2, were ranked No. 7, one spot ahead of the top Group of Five team, the AAC's then-unbeaten Cincinnati, and twelve spots ahead of the Sun Belt's Louisiana, a team who had beaten Iowa State by 17 points and whose only loss to that point had been in a conference game against unbeaten Coastal Carolina.[144] Michael Aresco, commissioner of Cincinnati's American Athletic Conference, had equally pointed criticism, accusing the committee of \"undermining its credibility with rankings that defy logic and common sense and fairness,\" and said that he would much prefer the computer-calculated BCS rankings system.\"[145] No Group of Five team was ranked in the CFP top four until Cincinnati was fourth in the rankings released on November 23, 2021.[146] The 2023 season saw the tightest playoff race in history, with eight teams in plausible contention before the conference championship weekend. The eventual selection of the one-loss conference champions Alabama (SEC) and Texas (Big 12) was controversial as both teams were selected ahead of unbeaten ACC champion Florida State; prior to 2023, no undefeated Power Five champion had failed to be selected for the playoff. ACC commissioner Jim Phillips called the decision \"unfathomable\" due to the significance the committee had previously afforded to undefeated conference champions, and Seminoles coach Mike Norvell said he was \"disgusted and infuriated\" at the decision.[147] CFP committee chair Boo Corrigan cited the late-season injury of Florida State's quarterback Jordan Travis as a reason to rank both Alabama and Texas over Florida State.[148] The qualifications of selection committee members have also been scrutinized. As an outsider to the sports world, Condoleezza Rice's selection was the focus of some criticism. Former Clemson head coach Tommy Bowden expressed the opinion that the committee's members should be \"people who played the game and preferably coached the game\".[149] Former Auburn head coach Pat Dye said, \"All she knows about football is what somebody told her ... or what she read in a book, or what she saw on television. To understand football, you've got to play with your hand in the dirt\". Former Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese also gained membership on the selection committee despite having never played football in college.[150] Former sportswriter Steve Weiberg and retired U.S. Air Force General Michael Gould are other committee members without significant football playing, coaching, or administrative experience. The semifinal games for the 2015 season were scheduled for December 31; they were expected to have lower television viewership because the date is not a federal holiday, and because the second game faced heavy competition for television viewers in primetime from New Year's Eve specials (such as New Year's Rockin' Eve, which is aired by ESPN's sister broadcast network ABC). Under television contracts with ESPN that predate the College Football Playoff, both the Rose and Sugar Bowl games are guaranteed exclusive TV time slots on January 1 (or January 2 if New Year's Day falls on a Sunday), regardless of whether they are hosting a semifinal game.[151] In an interview with CBS Sports, CFP commissioner Bill Hancock suggested this scheduling issue would \"change the paradigm of what New Year's Eve is all about,\" opining that \"if you're hosting a New Year's Eve party, you better have a bunch of televisions around\".[152] Although ESPN proposed moving the Thursday, December 31, 2015, semifinal games to Saturday, January 2, 2016, the idea was rejected.[153] The semifinal games' ratings were ultimately down significantly from those of the previous season.[115] In an effort to reduce the impact of their New Year's Eve scheduling, the 2016 semifinal games, which fell on a Saturday, had earlier kickoff times, at 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. ET respectively. The 2016 Orange Bowl was played in primetime on December 30, 2016, rather than in an early afternoon window on New Year's Eve. Hancock considered the earlier start times to be a compromise to reduce the games' intrusion into New Year's Eve festivities, but reiterated that there were no plans to move the semi-final games from New Year's Eve outside of years where they are hosted by the Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl.[154][155] On July 28, 2016, however, Hancock reversed this stance and announced revisions to the scheduling for future College Football Playoff semi-final games. The games were rescheduled so that they will not necessarily be played on New Year's Eve yearly: outside of years when they are hosted by the Rose and Sugar Bowls (where they retain their traditional New Year's Day scheduling), they will now be scheduled primarily on the last Saturday or federally observed holiday of the year. In some years, this date will land on New Year's Eve. In 2021, the games were played on Friday, December 31, because the day was observed as a holiday.[116][156] Viewership of the 2018 semi-finals were down by 25% over the previous semi-finals, which were played on New Year's Day.[157]",

For the first decade, four teams were selected to the Playoff field, with two semifinal games and a national championship game. Starting in the 2024-25 season, here's the new, expanded format to know: The quarterfinals and semifinals rotate among six bowls: Cotton, Fiesta, Orange, Peach, Rose and Sugar. Both semifinals will be played around the New Year's holiday with the national title game on a Monday night at least a week later. See the 2024-25 CFP schedule below. All times Eastern A committee of university presidents approved a plan for a newly 12-team College Football Playoff. In 2024, the College Football Playoff Board of Managers agreed to update the start of the 12-team CFP field beginning with the 2024-25 season to include a 5-7 format. Here's what you need to know about the postseason format put together by the commissioners of the 11 major college football conferences and Notre Dame's athletic director. There are 13 members on the CFP selection committee. It's a collection of people with experience as coaches, players, college administrators, athletic directors and journalists. Here are the members. The Selection Committee members will meet weekly to produce rankings. The committee’s rankings will be announced on ESPN. From the CFP website: \"The selection committee ranks the teams based on the members’ evaluation of the teams’ performance on the field, using conference championships won, strength of schedule, head-to-head results, and comparison of results against common opponents to decide among teams that are comparable.\" According to the CFP website, it begins like this: \"Each committee member will create a list of the 30 teams he or she believes to be the best in the country, in no particular order. Teams listed by three or more members will remain under consideration. At the conclusion of any round, other teams can be added to the group of teams under consideration by a vote of three or more members.\" You can read about each step here. Per the CFP, \"College Football Playoff Semifinal games rotate among the Orange Bowl, Rose Bowl Game, Sugar Bowl, Cotton Bowl, Fiesta Bowl and Peach Bowl.\" Click here for a look at the past, current and future CFP schedules.",

The 12-team College Football Playoff continues on New Year's Eve when (6) Penn State faces (3) Boise State in the Fiesta Bowl. The expanded format creates a more challenging path to the CFP title game, and the bracket will shrink from eight teams to four as we enter the new year. New Year's Day begins with (5) Texas facing (4) Arizona State in the Peach Bowl. Later in the day, (1) Oregon will face (8) Ohio State in a rematch of one of the best games of the 2024 season where the Ducks defeated the Buckeyes 32-31 on Oct. 12. The final quarterfinal matchup will see (7) Notre Dame take on (2) Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. Notre Dame defeated Indiana in the first round, and the Irish have won its last 11 games since its stunning loss to Northern Illinois in Week 2. As the College Football Playoff continues, here's a viewer's guide to help you navigate all the quarterfinal games through New Year's Day. All times Eastern Fiesta Bowl -- (6) Penn State vs. (3) Boise State (Tuesday) -- 7:30 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): This matchup will feature some of the best running backs in the country. Boise State star running back Ashton Jeanty put together one of the greatest seasons by a running back in the modern era and finished with nearly 2,500 rushing yards. The Heisman Trophy runner-up will face a stout Penn State defensive line led by All-American Abdul Carter. Penn State has a dynamic 1-2 punch in the backfield itself with Kaytron Allen and Nicholas Singleton. Peach Bowl -- (5) Texas vs. (4) Arizona State -- 1 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): The Sun Devils stunned the college football world this season by winning the Big 12 title after being picked to finish last in the preseason conference media poll. Arizona State running back Cameron Skattebo is one of the most dynamic players in college football, but he will face a Texas run defense that is among the best in the country. Texas defeated Arizona State 52-34 in the 2007 Holiday Bowl in the first and only matchup between the programs. Rose Bowl -- (8) Ohio State vs. (1) Oregon -- 5 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Oregon defeated Ohio State 32-31 back on Oct. 12 in one of the best games of the 2024 college football season. The Buckeyes had an opportunity to win the game on the final drive, but quarterback Will Howard ran out of time trying to get into field goal range. The Ducks have been on a tear since struggling in their season-opener against FCS Idaho in August. Ohio State's roster is full of blue-chip talent, but no player is more exciting than freshman wide receiver Jeremiah Smith, who had a monster game in the win over Tennessee and will be the Buckeyes' X-Factor to a deep run in the playoff. Sugar Bowl -- (7) Notre Dame vs. (2) Georgia -- 8:45 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): With Georgia quarterback Carson Beck out for the remainder of the season, the program will turn to backup Gunner Stockton. The heart and soul of this Georgia team is its defense, and that unit will have to face a dynamic Notre Dame run game led by running backs Jeremiyah Love and Jadarian Price and dual-threat quarterback Riley Leonard. Even without Beck in the lineup, Georgia is a slight betting favorite over its No. 7 seed opponent. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "title": "Louisville stops late two-point conversion to hold off Washington in 2024 Sun Bowl thriller - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Louisville escaped with a 35-34 victory over Washington in a thrilling Sun Bowl on Tuesday as the Cardinals thwarted a go-ahead two-point conversion attempt from the Huskies with nine seconds left. Then, after receiving an unsportsmanlike penalty, the Cardinals had to keep Washington from recovering a dangerous onside kick that could have returned the football to the Huskies in prime field position. It made for a wild finish to a game that the Cardinals led 35-21 until a furious Washington rally. The Huskies drew within 35-28 when they capped a 97-yard touchdown drive with a 31-yard touchdown connection between Demond Williams Jr. and Giles Jackson with 3:42 remaining. After a defensive stand from the Huskies, Williams and Jackson connected for a fourth score. But instead of kicking an extra point to tie the game and likely force overtime, first-year Washington coach Jedd Fisch rolled the dice and and went for two. Williams targeted receiver Jeremiah Hunter in the back corner of the end zone, but Louisville's Antonio Watts broke up the pass to preserve the victory. With Louisville quarterback Tyler Shough opting out, backup Harrison Bailey made the fourth start of his five-year college career. The former Tennessee and UNLV signal-caller threw a career-high three touchdown passes. The running game gave Bailey plenty of help, too, as Isaac Brown and Duke Watson combined for 182 yards rushing on 28 carries. While the Cardinals were without Shough and star receiver Ja'Corey Brooks, they did receive an infusion of talent as Caullin Lacy played for the first time since October. Lacy opted in October to sit out for the rest of the season after appearing in four regular season games. His decision came after a collarbone injury limited him to begin the season, and the move allowed him to use the 2024 season as a redshirt year. Playing in the bowl game did not jeopardize his redshirt status, and he showcased his dynamic playmaking ability with a rushing touchdown, a receiving touchdown and a 25-yard punt return. The win marked just the second bowl victory of the postseason for the ACC, which is now 2-9. Washington's Giles Jackson made his fourth touchdown grab of the day with nine seconds left on a fourth-and-goal play from the 1-yard line to bring Washington within 35-34 with nine seconds left. Huskies coach Jedd Fisch opted to go for two and the win, but Demond Williams Jr.'s pass attempt was deflected and fell incomplete, allowing the Cardinals to survive a Sun Bowl thriller. With Louisville quarterback Tyler Shough opting out, backup Harrison Bailey made the fourth start of his five-year college career. The former Tennessee and UNLV signal-caller threw a career-high three touchdown passes. The running game gave Bailey plenty of help, too, as Isaac Brown and Duke Watson combined for 182 yards rushing on 28 carries. Washington's offense finally found a rhythm again wit a 13-play, 97-yard touchdown drive capped by a 31-yard touchdown pass from Demond Williams Jr. to Giles Jackson. It was their third touchdown connection of the day — all on strikes of 30+ yards — and it brings the Huskies within a touchdown with under four minutes to play. Jackson had three receiving touchdowns on the season entering today but is ending his six-year college career with a bang. Louisville had some punter drama for this game with normal starter Brady Hodges away from the team. Carter Schwartz has stepped in and done a nice job. He just booted a 54-yarder downed on Washington's 3-yard line. He's punted five times and is averaging 43.4 yards per punt with three of his punts downed inside the 20-yard line. Per Hodges' Twitter account, he's been away from the team since Dec. 10 and is claiming Louisville's collective \"didn't want to hold up their end of things.\" Louisville turned on the jets with a 54-yard run from Duke Watson that set up an 8-yard touchdown run from Caullin Lacy to cap a 2-play drive that took a total of 52 seconds. That followed a three-and-out from Washington, which is reeling offensively to begin the second half. The balance in Louisville's attack has been impressive, and the Huskies continue to have little answer for the Cardinals' rushing attack. Louisville quarterback Harrison Bailey just found tight end Nate Kurisky wide open over the middle for a 21-yard touchdown strike on a 3rd-and-12. That was Bailey's third touchdown toss of the day, which matches the total he posted over the past four seasons at three different schools. The Cardinals have been lethal on third downs in this game and have broken the second half stalemate to take a 28-21 lead. Louisville's defense needs to regroup. After a strong start that included a pick-six from Tahveon Nicholson, the Cardinals have struggled to contain Washington's passing game. Giles Jackson has gashed Louisville's secondary for a pair of big touchdown receptions, and quarterback Demond Williams Jr.'s mobility is now giving Louisville's defense something else to think about. Washington's trouble has been defending Louisville's run game, which has kept the Huskies off-balance with a handful of explosive gains. Both offenses began on shaky footing under inexperienced backup quarterbacks, but as the half progressed, both of them settled in to create some fireworks in a tightly contested Sun Bowl. Demond Williams Jr. has been the star of the show for Washington in his second career start with 168 yards passing and two touchdowns through the air after beginning the game with a pick six. Not to be outdone, Louisville's Harrison Bailey has tossed a couple of scores. Isaac Brown and Duke Watson have also totaled 95 yards rushing on a combined 16 carries for the Cardinals in the first-ever meeting between these two teams. Demond Williams Jr. has now accounted for three touchdowns in the first half after taking off for an 8-yard touchdown run on a third-and-4 play. The freshman has settled in nicely during his second career start after beginning the game with a pick-six. Williams brings obvious shades of Arizona QB Noah Fifita to the table. He was originally committed to the Wildcats and coach Jedd Fisch before following Fisch to Washington. Like Fifita, Williams is an undersized but dynamic playmaker with a flair for the dramatic. Williams may have even more foot speed. Harrison Bailey just flashed his arm talent by dropping a corner route in the bucket for Antonio Meeks, who reeled it in for a 28-yard touchdown to put the Cards back on top. That was a perfect throw on third-and-4. Prior to that drive, Louisville hadn't completed a pass of more than nine yards. But Bailey has now completed 4 of his last 5, which included a 17-yard strike on third-and-8 to keep the scoring drive alive. The offenses have officially settled in. Demond Williams and Giles Jackson just connected for another huge touchdown against a Louisville secondary that is suddenly looking quite vulnerable. Jackson was wide open out of the slot, and Williams hit him in stride for a 49-yard score to tie the game. Williams has completed his last four passes, totaling 110 yards and two touchdowns in that span. Jackson has the first multi-touchdown game of his six-year college career. Jeff Brohm opted to go for it on fourth-and-1 from Louisville's 49-yard line. Duke Watson got a handoff, and Washington's Carson Bruener stuffed him with a leaping/diving tackle. The initial spot was unfavorable for the Cardinals, but the ruling was upheld upon review. Big-time defensive play for the Huskies, who will take over at midfield trailing 14-7 midway through the second quarter. Louisville star transfer Caullin Lacy was expected to make among the Cardinals' top perimeter threats this season but was limited to only four games due to injury. However, he's playing in the bowl game (he'll still be able to use 2024 as a redshirt year) and is making his presence felt. His 21-yard punt return helped give the Cardinals a short field, and he just scored on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Harrison Bailey. That was Lacy's third catch of the game in his first action since Oct. 19. Demond Williams Jr. just found a big dose of redemption for Washington. The freshman quarterback hit Giles Jackson for a 40-yard touchdown pass deep over the middle. Jackson was in 1-on-1 coverage and went up to make a big play to even the score at 7-7. There was no safety help, and Jackson beat his man without much trouble. That should help the Washington offense settle down after a shaky start. Both quarterbacks have been shaky early, which is not stunning considering the lack of starting experience for both. Louisville's Harrison Bailey misfired on both passing attempts on Louisville's second offensive series as the teams traded punts. Demond Williams Jr. is 0 for 2 for Washington with the pick-six. Neither team has a first down. Disaster struck early for Washington. Faced with a third-and-long, Demond Williams Jr. dropped back. He was looking for an underneath receiver breaking to the outside on a shallow cross. But Tahveon Nicholson jumped the route and ran it back 21 yards for a touchdown. Just like that, it's 7-0 Louisville. The Cards have seven interceptions in their last four games. There are just 12 total yards between the teams through two total possessions, but the Cards have the lead and Williams may have some shaky confidence. Louisville faced a fourth-and-1 from its own 34-yard line on its first possession, which forced Jeff Brohm to make a tough decision. He opted to play it safe, and Carter Schwartz booted it 44 yards. Washington will take over from its own 22-yard line. Demond Williams Jr. is making his second career start at QB for the Huskies, who are hoping to lay a foundation for their 2025 offense today. Two of the most productive passing offenses in the country clash at the historic Sun Bowl as Washington faces off against Louisville on New Year's Eve. The Huskies turned over much of the roster after a trip to the CFP National Championship a year ago but managed to reach bowl eligibility after beating USC and UCLA in the final weeks of the season. Louisville ranked among the top teams in the ACC but suffered at the expense of close-game luck, finishing with an 8-4 record. All four losses -- Notre Dame, SMU, Miami and Stanford -- were by one score. The Cardinals gave Notre Dame their closest game of the season outside of the loss to Northern Illinois. These two programs have never played one another, and they have rarely played in the Sun Bowl, either. Washington has played in the Sun Bowl four times but not since 2002. The program's only win came in 1979. Since Louisville only joined the ACC a little over a decade ago, you have to go all the way back to 1957 to catch the Cardinals' only appearance in El Paso -- a 34-20 win over Drake. Based on the season, Louisville would be substantial favorites to crush Washington. Even with several key opt outs, there's still plenty of talent remaining, headlined by Isaac Brown. Louisville's highly rated defense will be able to cause just enough mistakes from Washington QB Demond Williams and escape the battle as victors. Pick: Louisville -2.5 While incumbent Washington quarterback Will Rogers will participate in the bowl game, true freshman Demond Williams will start his second straight game for the Huskies after debuting against Oregon. Against one of the best teams in college football, Williams posted 201 yards passing and a touchdown on only 20 pass attempts, completing 85% of his passes and recording a passer rating of 185.9. Williams is the future of the program, and that will continue against Louisville. While these two teams are known for passing, the running backs may be the best players on the team, especially in the bowl games. Washington's Jonah Coleman transferred to Seattle with first-year coach Jedd Fisch from Arizona, posting 184 carries for 1,011 yards and 10 touchdowns in his first season. However, Louisville running back Isaac Brown might be the most surprising breakout player in the ACC. The freshman exploded for 1,074 yards and 11 touchdowns on a mind-boggling 7.3 yards per carry. In a decimation of ACC champion Clemson, he posted 151 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. After the 8-4 season for Louisville, several key players have declared for the NFL Draft and opted out of the bowl game -- most notably, quarterback Tyler Shough and wide receiver Ja'Corey Brooks are both leaving to prepare for the draft. Both ranked top 20 nationally in passing yards and receiving yards per game, respectively. Star defensive lineman Ashton Gillotte will do the same after posting 26.5 sacks and 41 tackles for loss in four seasons. Washington linebacker Khmori House is the only major loss for the Huskies after transferring to North Carolina. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Since Louisville only joined the ACC a little over a decade ago, you have to go all the way back to 1957 to catch the Cardinals' only appearance in El Paso -- a 34-20 win over Drake. Based on the season, Louisville would be substantial favorites to crush Washington. Even with several key opt outs, there's still plenty of talent remaining, headlined by Isaac Brown. Louisville's highly rated defense will be able to cause just enough mistakes from Washington QB Demond Williams and escape the battle as victors. Pick: Louisville -2.5 While incumbent Washington quarterback Will Rogers will participate in the bowl game, true freshman Demond Williams will start his second straight game for the Huskies after debuting against Oregon. Against one of the best teams in college football, Williams posted 201 yards passing and a touchdown on only 20 pass attempts, completing 85% of his passes and recording a passer rating of 185.9. Williams is the future of the program, and that will continue against Louisville. While these two teams are known for passing, the running backs may be the best players on the team, especially in the bowl games. Washington's Jonah Coleman transferred to Seattle with first-year coach Jedd Fisch from Arizona, posting 184 carries for 1,011 yards and 10 touchdowns in his first season. However, Louisville running back Isaac Brown might be the most surprising breakout player in the ACC. The freshman exploded for 1,074 yards and 11 touchdowns on a mind-boggling 7.3 yards per carry. In a decimation of ACC champion Clemson, he posted 151 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. After the 8-4 season for Louisville, several key players have declared for the NFL Draft and opted out of the bowl game -- most notably, quarterback Tyler Shough and wide receiver Ja'Corey Brooks are both leaving to prepare for the draft. Both ranked top 20 nationally in passing yards and receiving yards per game, respectively. Star defensive lineman Ashton Gillotte will do the same after posting 26.5 sacks and 41 tackles for loss in four seasons. Washington linebacker Khmori House is the only major loss for the Huskies after transferring to North Carolina. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Filed under: WE’RE GRRRRRRRREAT! The transfer portal and NIL, among other rule changes, have completely reshaped the sport of college football these last few years. Virtually every aspect of the sport has felt the impact of these changes, and bowl games are no exception. Following the end of the college football regular season, the majority of the conversation around Louisville football as been around the players leaving, the players coming, and what next season will look like. For most, gone are the days where they count down the days to the bowl game and see it as the crowning achievement and reward for a great season. For most, it’s just an afterthought and a fun exhibition where win or lose, it’s just nice to see your team play one last time. After all, who could blame them when the team looks dramatically different from the one you had just watched for 12 games? But I feel confident in saying all of that went out the window as soon as the game started. I’m not sure what it was about this bowl in particular, but I think it had a lot to do with seeing how much the players on both teams cared and how hard they were going after it. From the first snap it felt like fans were 100% back in and any fleeting thoughts of bowl games being “meaningless” or the result not mattering were completely gone. The game developed into an instant classic, a nailbiter, and ultimately a momentum boosting game that we can truly use as a launch pad for the 2025 season with the majority of the game’s biggest contributors coming back next year. On offense it’s hard not to be over the moon about what’s in store for us. The running back tandem of Isaac Brown and Duke Watson once again dominated as they helped Louisville rush for over 200 yards for the 6th time this year, leading the ACC. Chris Bell and Caulin Lacy are certifiable studs, and getting them both to return would be massive. Let’s take a moment to appreciate Caulin Lacy’s insane effort play today: Caullin Lacy came to play! What an effort for the @LouisvilleFB touchdown. pic.twitter.com/BH7QmjQ8Ls Still no idea how he scored on that play. Beyond ecstatic he’s coming back. The o-line gave the very green Harrison Bailey good protection for most of the game and you got to see him really settle into the game and improve as time went on. And they were obviously the force behind the dominant run game. Having a majority of that group coming back next year is another area to be excited about. And Harrison Bailey, what a game! You could tell early on that he was a little tight and rusty, but as he settled in he made some great reads and throws, especially this beautiful ball to Antonio Meeks: Another touchdown pass for Harrison Bailey and @LouisvilleFB grabs the lead. pic.twitter.com/hpn2WHDv5Z Word on the street is that Bailey has another year of eligibility, which would be great to have if he comes back and battles Miller Moss for a starting position. He’d be an awfully nice player to have as a back up if Moss is the real deal. Regardless, what a way for him to come in in a spot like this and lead the team to victory with 3 TDs on 16/25 passing attempts. As for the defense, while there were plenty of moments that weren’t so great, many of which DC Ron English was to blame for (a conversation for another day), they ultimately came up big when needed most and got us the win in dramatic fashion. The pick 6 was pretty cool: PICK SIX! Tahveon Nicholson soars into the end zone for a @LouisvilleFB touchdown. pic.twitter.com/woLBgB6jgp (we need to do whatever we can to get Tahveon Nicholson to come back next year) But the biggest play of the game came at the end of a wild game-defining drive where Washington had been sacked on 3rd and goal by a crazy shoelace sack by Rene Konga, and then were stopped on 4th and goal only for an egregious defensive pass interference call to be made, giving Washington another 4 chances. Washington eventually cashed in on 4th and Goal to cut the score to 35-34, and went for 2 to win and seal the game against a defense that was gassed. But then Antonio Watts made a play I think most of us will remember for a long time to come: ANTONIO WATTS MAKES THE PLAY FOR @LouisvilleFB!! pic.twitter.com/Z68I7Yfxt2 The defense, as they’ve done many times in the Jeff Brohm era, came up big when we needed them most. Such a cool way to all but end a dramatic bowl game. The onside kick was terrifying, but we don’t need to talk about that either. With so much to look forward to on offense, and with Miller Moss already in the fold, one would think that Louisville will be spending a majority of their transfer portal efforts on restocking a talented, but inconsistent defense. Whether or not any staff changes will be made on that side of the ball are yet to be seen, and I don’t want to bring up anything overly negative, but in my opinion it’s hard to see this program being a championship-caliber one with Ron English at the helm. MOVING ON! Washington deserves credit for battling their way back into this one. Demond Williams Jr. gave UofL headaches all day with his legs and his ability to make crazy play after crazy play. I finally understand how annoying it must be to play against guys like Lamar Jackson. He was outstanding as he went 26/32 for 374yds, 4 TDs through the air, and 48 rushing yards and 1 TD on the ground. He was especially good at finding Giles Jackson who had 11 receptions for 164 yards and 4 TDs. They were both studs and were massive problems. Before we put a bow on the season can we talk about the weird absence of starting punter Brady Hodges? Brad Nesslar was saying at the beginning of the game UofL came out for warmups and he wasn’t there, so Carter Schwartz got the start, and Brady Hodges was a “late opt-out”. Initially there was some speculation he had fled to Mexico, or had been kidnapped by the cartel, but he put those fears to rest with this very curious tweet: I have not been with the team since December 10th. @502_Circle told me September 6th, they would be paying and are still yet to hold up their end of the deal. I graduated on December 13th and had every intention on being with the team had they held up their end of the deal. A lot to unpack here. I really have no idea the validity of this tweet. It’s also the first I’ve ever heard of a player not being paid properly by the 502Circle, and for it to first occur with the punter(?) seems very... curious. And then the strong performance from Carter Schwartz didn’t exactly help Hodge’s matters. Something to keep an eye on, I guess. All in all, what a fun game and a great way to finish a season that can really be a launch pad for 2025. 242 Days until EKU. Can’t wait to see y’all then. Gambling Problem?

                "title": "Cleveland Cavaliers - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Cleveland Cavaliers, often referred to as the Cavs, are an American professional basketball team based in Cleveland. The Cavaliers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The team began play as an expansion team in 1970, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Buffalo Braves. Home games were first held at Cleveland Arena from 1970 to 1974, followed by the Richfield Coliseum from 1974 to 1994. Since 1994, the Cavs have played home games at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in downtown Cleveland, which is shared with the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League. Dan Gilbert has owned the team since March 2005. The Cavaliers opened their inaugural season by losing their first 15 games and struggled in their early years, placing no better than sixth in the Eastern Conference during their first five seasons. The team won their first Central Division title in 1976, which also marked the first winning season and playoff appearance in franchise history, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. The franchise was purchased by Ted Stepien in 1980. Stepien's tenure as owner was marked by six coaching changes, questionable trades and draft decisions, and poor attendance, leading to $15 million in financial losses. The Cavs went 66–180 over the course of those three seasons and endured a 24-game losing streak spanning the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons. George and Gordon Gund purchased the franchise in 1983. During the latter half of the 1980s and through much of the 1990s, the Cavs were a regular playoff contender – led by players such as Mark Price and Brad Daugherty – and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1992. After the team's playoff appearance in the 1997–98 season, however, the Cavs had six consecutive losing seasons with no playoff action. Cleveland was awarded with the top overall pick in the 2003 draft, and they selected LeBron James. Behind James and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers again became a regular playoff contender by 2005. They made their first appearance in the NBA Finals in 2007 after winning the first Eastern Conference championship in franchise history. After failing to return to the NBA Finals in the ensuing three seasons, James joined the Miami Heat in 2010. As a result, the Cavaliers finished the 2010–11 season last in the conference, enduring a 26-game losing streak, the third-longest in NBA history. Between 2010 and 2014, however, the team won the top pick in the NBA draft lottery three times – first in 2011 where they selected Kyrie Irving, and again in 2013 and 2014. After four seasons with the Heat and having won back-to-back titles in the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, James returned to the Cavs in 2014 and led the team to four straight NBA Finals appearances. In 2016, the Cavaliers won their first NBA Championship, marking Cleveland's first major sports title since 1964. The 2016 NBA Finals victory over the Golden State Warriors marked the first time in Finals history a team had come back to win the series after trailing, 3–1. The Cavaliers have 23 playoff appearances and have won seven Central Division titles, five Eastern Conference titles and one NBA title. The Cavaliers began play in the 1970–71 season as an expansion team.[9] They set losing records in each of their first five seasons before winning their first division title in 1976.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16] The 1976 team was led by Austin Carr, Bobby \"Bingo\" Smith, Jim Chones, Dick Snyder, Nate Thurmond and head coach Bill Fitch.[17] It was remembered for the \"Miracle at Richfield\", in which the Cavaliers defeated the Washington Bullets, 4–3, in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.[18] They won Game 7, 87–85, on a shot by Snyder with four seconds to go.[18] The Cavaliers moved on to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time,[18] but were without Chones after he broke his toe before the series opener.[19] As a result, the Cavaliers went on to lose, 4–2, to the Boston Celtics.[20] They made playoff appearances in the following two seasons before a six-year playoff drought.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28] The early 1980s were marked by Ted Stepien's ownership. During Stepien's tenure, the Cavaliers made a practice of trading future draft picks for marginal veteran players.[29] His most notable deal sent a 1982 first-round pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Don Ford and the 22nd overall pick in 1980.[30] As a result of Stepien's dealings, the NBA introduced the \"Stepien Rule\", which prohibits teams from trading first-round draft picks in successive seasons.[29][31] The Cavaliers went 66–180, dropped to the bottom of the league in attendance and lost $15 million during Stepien's three years as the owner.[29] The Cavs went through six coaches during this span, including four during the 1981–82 season.[29] The team finished 15–67, and between March and November 1982, the team had a 24-game losing streak, which, at the time, was the NBA's longest losing streak.[32][33][34][35][36] George and Gordon Gund purchased the Cavaliers from Stepien in 1983.[31][37] The Cavaliers made the playoffs 10 times between 1985 and 1998.[38] The 1988–89 seasons was the Cavaliers' best season to date, finishing the regular season at 57–25 with a team that included Brad Daugherty, Mark Price, Ron Harper and Larry Nance, and head coach Lenny Wilkens.[38][39] They had their second 57-win season in 1991–92 and reached the Eastern Conference Finals that year.[38][40] However, between 1999 and 2005, the Cavaliers failed to make a playoff appearance.[38] The Cavaliers finished the 2002–03 season 17–65, tied for the worst record in the NBA.[41] The Cavaliers had the No. 1 pick in the 2003 NBA draft, selecting future NBA MVP LeBron James, a native of nearby Akron.[42] On January 3, 2005, the team was sold to businessman Dan Gilbert for $375 million,[43][44][45] and the deal was finalized on March 1, 2005.[46] That year, the team also hired head coach Mike Brown and general manager Danny Ferry.[47] The Cavaliers built a team around James and Žydrūnas Ilgauskas by adding players such as Drew Gooden, Larry Hughes and Anderson Varajao.[48][49] Under this new leadership, the Cavaliers made five straight playoffs from 2006 to 2010, advancing to at least the second round each time.[38] The 2006–07 Cavaliers advanced to the franchise's first NBA Finals, but were swept by the San Antonio Spurs.[50][51] The 2008–09 Cavaliers won a franchise-record 66 games, including a franchise-best 39–2 record at home, but lost the Eastern Conference Finals to the Orlando Magic.[38] Despite the addition of four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal,[52] the 2009–10 Cavaliers were unable to return to the Eastern Conference Finals after losing to the Boston Celtics in the second round.[38] With the Cavaliers out of the playoffs, the focus turned to James' impending free agency.[53] On July 8, 2010, James announced in a nationally televised one-hour special titled The Decision that he would be signing with the Miami Heat.[54] The repercussions of this announcement left many in the city of Cleveland infuriated and feeling betrayed.[55] After a 19–win season in 2010–11, the Cavaliers began a rebuild around Kyrie Irving, whom they selected first overall in the 2011 NBA draft.[38][56] In 2014, James returned to the Cavaliers after four seasons in Miami. While the Heat had a 224–88 record during James' four-year tenure and won NBA titles in 2012 and 2013, the Cavaliers went 97–215 and missed the playoffs each season.[57] The Cavaliers made several moves to build a championship-contending team around James, most notably acquiring power forward Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, which created what many fans and media referred to as a \"Big Three\" with James, Love and Irving.[58] The Lebron-led Cavaliers made four consecutive Finals appearances from 2015 to 2018 – all against the Golden State Warriors – winning in 2016.[38][59] The 2016 NBA Championship marked the Cavaliers' first title in franchise history, as they became the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit to win the Finals.[59] It was also Cleveland's first championship in major professional sports since the 1964 Browns, signaling the end of the so-called Cleveland sports curse.[60] The Cavaliers' roster went through many changes in the 2017–18 season, most notably the trade of Irving to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Isaiah Thomas and other assets.[61][62] Thomas was later traded to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of a trade deadline overhaul that saw the Cavaliers add Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr. (son of Cavs legend Larry Nance) and others.[63] The following offseason, James declined his player option to rejoin the team, instead signing with the Lakers.[64] In the following two seasons, the team recorded only 19 wins and failed to make the playoffs.[38] In the first three seasons since James left the second time, the Cavaliers won a total of 60 games, missed the playoffs each season and have had four different head coaches: Tyronn Lue, Larry Drew, John Beilein and by this time, J.B. Bickerstaff, who was promoted to head coach for the 2020–21 season after he had been an assistant on Belien's staff the previous season.[38][65][66] In the 2021–22 season, the Cavs finished 44–38 and eighth in the Eastern Conference, and qualified for the NBA play-in tournament, marking the first time the team played in the event. This also marks the team's first postseason basketball since 2017–18 and the first time a non-LeBron-led team qualified for postseason play since 1997–98. The team, however, did not make it out of the play-in tournament, losing the game to the Brooklyn Nets and then to the Atlanta Hawks, ending their season. On March 26, 2023, the Cavaliers clinched a spot in the NBA playoffs, making this the first time since 2018 that the team entered the playoffs, with a 108–91 win over the Houston Rockets. This was also the first time since 1998 that the team entered the playoffs without LeBron James.[67] They wound up losing their first round playoff series to the New York Knicks four games to one.[68] On October 25, 2023, it was announced that defensive end Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns had purchased a minority ownership stake in the Cavaliers. Along with his ownership stake, Garrett would serve as an ambassador for the team.[69] The Cavaliers qualified the 2024 NBA Playoffs as the 4th seed in the Eastern Conference, defeating the Orlando Magic 4–3 in the first round, but losing to the Boston Celtics 4–1 in the Conference semifinals.[70] On November 6th, 2024 the Cavaliers beat their all-time franchise \"season start\" win-streak, beating the New Orleans Pelicans 131-122 for a season record of 9-0. [71] After a 128-114 win against the Charlotte Hornets on November 17, 2024, the Cavaliers achieved a 15-0 start, which is tied for the second-best start in franchise history, and the Cavaliers are the fourth team to achieve this milestone, after the 2015-2016 Golden State Warriors team, the 1993-1994 Houston Rockets team, and the 1948-1949 Washington Capitols team. [72][73] The 15-0 start is also the Cavaliers’ longest winning streak in franchise history. [74] On November 19, 2024, the Boston Celtics ended the Cavaliers 15–0 start and 15 game winning streak when they won 120–117, giving the Cavaliers their first loss of the season.

Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage When the Cleveland Cavaliers debuted in the NBA in 1970, the team's original jersey colors were wine and gold. The first jerseys featured the feathered treatment of the letter \"C\" in \"Cavaliers\". In 1974, they changed into the classic block lettering and checkerboard pattern that was synonymous to the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team of 1976. In 1980, the gold shade was changed from yellowish to metallic, and the uniforms removed the checkerboard pattern and placed the stripes above \"Cleveland\" and below the uniform number, the only time the city name was featured in both home and away jerseys. The original logo was that of a swashbuckling cavalier looking right with a sword pointing, surrounded by the team name and a basketball. A modernized swashbuckling cavalier logo was later used by the Cavaliers' NBA Development League affiliate, the Canton Charge. The gold checkerboard uniforms were used as throwbacks in the 2004–05 season to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team, while the gold \"feathered C\" uniforms were used again in the 2008–09 season as a buildup to the then-upcoming 40th season of the Cavaliers. The \"Miracle of Richfield\" gold uniforms were used again in the 2015–16 season on special \"Hardwood Classic\" nights to commemorate the Miracle of Richfield team's 40th-anniversary celebration. In the 1983–84 season, the colors were changed to burnt orange, blue and white. The first Cavaliers uniform under the new scheme featured the Cavaliers logo (with a \"V\" in the shape of a hoop and circle above as basketball) in an arched pattern and the player name sewn onto the back shoulder as a patch, with orange being the primary color in both the away and home uniforms. However, in the 1987–88 season, orange was relegated as a secondary color, and blue was used instead as the primary for the away and home uniforms; minor changes in the 1989–90 season include the city name on the blue away uniforms. The drop shadows were also removed. The orange version of the uniform was used again in the 2006–07 and 2016–17 seasons, as part of the respective 20th and 30th anniversaries of the 1986–87 team.[78] The blue versions were worn in the 2009–10 season as part of the franchise's 40th anniversary and as a tribute to the 1988–89 team. Coinciding with the move to Gund Arena in the 1994–95 season, the Cavaliers changed logos and uniforms, adding black in addition to the already existing blue, orange and white colors. The uniforms feature a blue splash in the abdomen area in front. From 1994 to 1997, the word \"CAVS\" on the home uniforms was orange with black lines, while the numbers are in black with white lines; \"CLEVELAND\" on the road uniforms was also orange with black lines, while the numbers are in white with a black line. From 1997 to 1999, the numbers and lettering were slightly tweaked: The word \"CAVS\" and the numbers on the home uniforms were black with orange lines, while the word \"CLEVELAND\" and the numbers on the road uniforms were white with orange lines. In the latter iteration, the blue splash was moved from the right leg to the left leg, surrounding \"CLEVELAND\" on the home uniforms and \"CAVS\" on the road uniforms, with a minor change in striping. In the 1999–2000 season, the Cavaliers opted to go for a cleaner look, eliminating the splash and adding an orange and blue line that runs through the shorts. The home jerseys feature the team nickname and the uniform numbers are in blue with black lines, while the away jerseys featured the city name and the uniform numbers in white with blue lines; these jerseys were used until the 2002–03 season. The logo used in this period was of a basketball on its way down a net, surrounded by a black square and the word \"CAVS\" in blue with black line below. The 1994–1996 black uniforms were revived for the 2019–20 season as part of the Cavaliers' 50th season, as well as the 25th anniversary of the move to Gund Arena (now Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse).[79] The Cavaliers switched to a modified version of the team's classic wine-and-gold scheme in the 2003–04 season: metallic gold and a crimson shade of wine with navy blue added. The home uniform was white, with the word \"Cavaliers\" in wine lettering with gold trim on the front, the player's name in wine lettering with gold trim on the back, the player's numbers in navy blue, and wine-and-gold trim on the sides. The team's standard road uniform was wine-colored, with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as white and gold trim on the sides. The team's alternate jersey was navy blue with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as a wine, gold and navy blue checkerboard trim. The checkerboard trim was a tribute to the original Cavaliers uniforms from the 1970s. The logo used was a gold sword piercing through the words \"Cleveland Cavaliers\" in white and navy trim, with a wine basketball surrounding it. The Cavaliers debuted new uniforms before the start of the 2010–11 NBA season to coincide with the team returning to the original shades of wine and gold used from 1970 to 1983.[80] The home uniform is white with a wine-and-gold horizontal stripe trim on the collar, sleeves, waistband and pant legs, the word \"CAVALIERS\" (in block style lettering) in wine on the front of the jersey with wine lettering for the name and number, and white shoes and socks. The road uniform is wine-colored with the same stripe trim, \"Cleveland\" in gold on the front of the jersey, gold lettering on the name and number, and black shoes and socks. An alternate jersey – gold with \"CAVS\" in wine on the front of the jersey, wine lettering on the name and number, white socks and shoes, and the same stripe trim as the other uniforms[81] – was added for the 2012–13 season. All uniforms have the team motto – \"All for one. One for all.\" – stitched on the inside of the collar and the secondary \"Sword C\" logo on the side of the pant legs. The logo used is the same piercing sword logo, updated to the classic wine-and-gold scheme. For the 2014–15 season, a second alternate jersey – and fourth uniform overall – was added, which is navy blue (a callback to the 1987–1994 style) with \"CAVS\" and the player's number in wine with gold trim, the player's name on the back of the jersey in gold and the \"Sword C\" logo on the side of the pant legs.[82] Two alternate jerseys were unveiled prior to the start of the 2015–16 season.[83] The second wine uniform is similar to their regular road jersey, except that it features the arched mid-1980s Cavs logo and white numerals in gold trim. A black sleeved uniform features the wine \"C\" logo in front and was famously worn in the title-clinching Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals.[84][85] Their logos for the 2017–18 season newly included the color black to commemorate the victory.[86][87] Beginning in the 2017–18 season, all NBA teams switched to Nike-designed white \"Association\" uniforms and \"Icon\" uniforms in the respective team's primary color. The Cavaliers' Icon uniforms were wine-colored with \"Cleveland\" across the front and the player's name in gold lettering with navy blue numerals both in the front and in the back. The white Association uniforms have \"Cavs\" across the front, with wine color letters and numbers both front and back. All teams have the choice of which uniform to wear for any home game. Also included on the Cavs' jerseys is a small Goodyear \"Wingfoot\" logo, as part of a sponsorship deal with the team.[88][89] Nike also provides a third, alternate uniform called the \"Statement\" uniform. The Cavaliers' Statement uniform is black with dark gray pinstripes, a wine-colored \"C\" trimmed in gold on the front, names in gold letters on the back, wine-colored/gold-trimmed numbers on the front and back, and gold-colored Nike and Goodyear logos on the front. In the same vein as the logo on their 2017–18 jerseys, the black jersey is a nod to the team's former black-sleeved jerseys that they wore when they won Game 7 of the 2016 Finals.[90] For the 2022–23 NBA season, the Cavaliers unveiled an updated logo and color scheme, removing navy blue while reverting to the metallic gold first used from 1980 to 1983, and from 2003 to 2010. The \"C-sword\" alternate logo was retired, and an updated \"V-net\" logo, merging the styles of the 1983–1994 and 1994–2003 logos with the current typeface, was also unveiled.[3][4] With the new logo, the team also introduced three coinciding new uniforms. The white Association uniform features a wine-colored \"V-net\" logo trimmed in gold across the front, wine names and numbers trimmed in gold, and a wine primary \"Cavs C\" logo (outlined in gold) on left leg of the shorts. The wine Icon uniform features \"Cleveland\" in gold lettering on the chest, gold names and numbers, and the \"Cavs C\" logo in wine with a gold outline on the left leg of the shorts. The black Statement uniform – a nod to the black uniforms worn during the team's 2016 NBA championship run – displays a wine \"Cavs C\" logo outlined in gold on the front of the jersey, gold names and numbers, and a gold \"V-net\" logo on the left leg of the shorts.[91][92] From the 2008–09 to the 2011–12 season, the Cavaliers wore special \"mash-up\" uniforms – combining the style from one era with the color scheme of another – on select \"CavFanatic Nights\". Nike also provides a fourth uniform known as the \"City Edition\", which honors the city of Cleveland as well as the state of Ohio: Cleveland Clinic Courts, the team's practice facility and team headquarters, is located in suburban Independence. The 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2) building opened in 2007 and includes two full-size basketball courts, a weight room, a team room, offices, medical facilities, and kitchen and dining facilities. Naming rights are held by the Cleveland Clinic, which is the team's official healthcare partner. Prior to the opening of Cleveland Clinic Courts, the team used the practice court located on the club level of Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.[104][105][106] In honor of the Cavs winning the NBA Championship, the city of Independence renamed the section of Brecksville Road leading to the team's practice facility \"Cavaliers Way\" in November 2016.[107] Roster Last transaction: December 29, 2024 The Cavaliers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player – either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him – is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[108] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. The following is a list of past Cavaliers players and other personnel who have been honored as \"Cavs Legends\" – either by retiring their number or having commemorative banners placed in the rafters at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.[112][113][114] In 2019, the Cavaliers introduced the Wall of Honor, which honors former players and other personnel, and is located in the newly added North Atrium of the renovated Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.[118] Note - All personnel who have had their numbers retired or have a similar banner in the rafters are also inducted into the Wall of Honor The following is a list of players and other personnel who have spent at least part of their careers with the Cavaliers that have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

The former was inspired by Cleveland radio DJ Alan Freed, who popularized the phrase \"rock and roll\" and had called himself \"Moondog\". Moondog was an NBA All-Star selection in 2003 and 2004, and he made his first appearance on November 5, 2003. Sir C.C., a swashbuckler character, debuted during a game on November 27, 2010.[124] During the 1990s and early 2000s, the Cavs had a polar bear mascot named Whammer, who was introduced on November 9, 1995. He still makes occasional appearances throughout the season at Cavaliers games.",

                "content": "Puerto Rico[i] (Spanish for 'rich port'; abbreviated PR),[21] officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,[b][j] is a self-governing Caribbean archipelago and island organized as an unincorporated territory of the United States under the designation of commonwealth. Located about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami, Florida, between the Dominican Republic in the Greater Antilles and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Lesser Antilles, it consists of the eponymous main island and numerous smaller islands, including Vieques, Culebra, and Mona. With approximately 3.2 million residents, it is divided into 78 municipalities, of which the most populous is the capital municipality of San Juan, followed by those within the San Juan metropolitan area.[21] Spanish and English are the official languages of the government,[23] though Spanish predominates.[24][25] Puerto Rico was settled by a succession of Amerindian peoples beginning 2,000 to 4,000 years ago;[26] these included the Ortoiroid, Saladoid, and Taíno. It was claimed by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 and subsequently colonized by Juan Ponce de León in 1508.[21] Puerto Rico was contested by other European powers into the 18th century but remained a Spanish possession for the next 400 years. The decline of the indigenous population, followed by an influx of Spanish settlers, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia, and African slaves vastly changed the cultural and demographic landscape of the archipelago. Within the Spanish Empire, Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategically significant role compared to larger and wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain.[27][28] By the late 19th century, a distinct Puerto Rican identity began to emerge, centered around a fusion of European, African, and indigenous elements.[29][30] In 1898, following the Spanish–American War, Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States.[21][31] Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917 and can move freely between the archipelago and the mainland.[32] However, residents of Puerto Rico are disenfranchised from federal elections[33] and generally do not pay federal income tax.[34][35][k] In common with four other territories, Puerto Rico sends a nonvoting representative to the U.S. Congress, called a Resident Commissioner, and participates in presidential primaries; as it is not a state, Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the U.S. Congress, which oversees it under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950. Congress approved a territorial constitution in 1952, allowing residents of the archipelago to elect a governor in addition to a senate and house of representatives. The political status of Puerto Rico is an ongoing debate.[36][37] Beginning in the mid-20th century, the U.S. government, together with the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company, launched a series of economic projects to develop Puerto Rico into an industrial high-income economy. It is classified by the International Monetary Fund as a developed jurisdiction with an advanced, high-income economy;[38] it ranks 40th on the Human Development Index. The major sectors of Puerto Rico's economy are manufacturing, primarily pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and electronics, followed by services, namely tourism and hospitality.[39] Puerto Rico is Spanish for \"rich port\".[21] Puerto Ricans often call the island Borinquen, a derivation of Borikén, its Indigenous Taíno name, which is popularly said to mean \"Land of the Valiant Lord\".[40][41][42] The terms boricua, borinqueño, and borincano are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage,[43][44] and derive from Borikén and Borinquen respectively.[45] The island is also popularly known in Spanish as La Isla del Encanto, meaning \"the island of enchantment\".[46] Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista, in honor of Saint John the Baptist, while the capital city was named Ciudad de Puerto Rico (\"Rich Port City\").[21] Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico, while San Juan became the name used for the main trading/shipping port and the capital city.[l] The island's name was changed to Porto Rico by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898.[48] The anglicized name was used by the U.S. government and private enterprises (also Porto in Italian, French, and Portuguese). The name was changed back to Puerto Rico in 1931 by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by Félix Córdova Dávila.[49][m][54][55][56] The official name of the entity in Spanish is Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico (\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\"), while its official English name is Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.[21] The Spanish official name was suggested by its architect Luis Muñoz Marín and adopted by a constitutional assembly on July 25, 1952. Some authorities have called it a euphemism and have charged that the official name in English of \"Commonwealth\" constitutes a fig leaf, i.e., associated with the covering up of an act that is actually embarrassing or distasteful with something of innocuous appearance.[57] Puerto Rico remains a territory of the United States, exercising substantial internal self-government, but subordinated to the U.S. Constitution in areas such as foreign affairs or defense. For this reason, it is not considered to be a full-fledged associated state under either international or U.S. domestic law.[58][59] The history of Puerto Rico began with the settlement of the Ortoiroid people before 430 BC. At the time of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World in 1493, the dominant indigenous culture was that of the Taínos. The Taíno people's numbers went dangerously low during the later half of the 16th century because of new infectious diseases carried by Europeans, exploitation by Spanish settlers, and warfare.[61] Located in the northeastern Caribbean, Puerto Rico formed a key part of the Spanish Empire from the early years of the exploration, conquest and colonization of the New World. The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European powers for control of the region in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. In 1593, Portuguese soldiers, sent from Lisbon by order of Phillip II, composed the first garrison of the San Felipe del Morro fortress in Puerto Rico. Some brought their wives, while others married Puerto Rican women, and today there are many Puerto Rican families with Portuguese last names. The smallest of the Greater Antilles, Puerto Rico was a stepping-stone in the passage from Europe to Cuba, Mexico, Central America, and the northern territories of South America. Throughout most of the 19th century until the conclusion of the Spanish–American War, Puerto Rico and Cuba were the last two Spanish colonies in the New World; they served as Spain's final outposts in a strategy to regain control of the American continents. Realizing that it was in danger of losing its two remaining Caribbean territories, the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815. The decree was printed in Spanish, English and French in order to attract Europeans, with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity and strength with the arrival of new settlers. Free land was offered to those who wanted to populate the islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Catholic Church.[62] In 1898, during the Spanish–American War, Puerto Rico was invaded and subsequently became a possession of the U.S. The first years of the 20th century were marked by the struggle to obtain greater democratic rights from the U.S.[citation needed] The Foraker Act of 1900 established a civil government, ending rule by American generals and the Department of War. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Ortega v. Lara, 202 U.S. 339, 342 (1906),[n] involving the Foraker Act and referring to the island as \"the acquired country\", soon affirmed that the U.S. Constitution applied within its territory and that any domestic Puerto Rican laws which did not conflict with it remained in force.[63] The Jones Act of 1917, which made Puerto Ricans U.S. citizens, paved the way for the drafting of Puerto Rico's Constitution and its approval by Congress and Puerto Rican voters in 1952.[citation needed] Puerto Rico is one of five territories with less representation in the Federal government, along with the Federal District. In 2009, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the U.S. government to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.[64] In November 2012, a two-question referendum took place, simultaneous with the general elections.[65][66] The first question, voted on in August, asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution. 54% voted against the status quo, effectively approving the second question to be voted on in November. The second question posed three alternate status options: statehood, independence, or free association.[67] 61.16% voted for statehood, 33.34% for a sovereign free-associated state, and 5.49% for independence.[68][failed verification] In 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 5278: PROMESA, establishing a Control Board over the Puerto Rican government. This board will have a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and operations. In particular, the authority to establish the control board derives from the federal government's constitutional power to \"make all needful rules and regulations\" regarding U.S. territories; The president would appoint all seven voting members of the board; and the board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by Puerto Rico's legislature, governor, and other public authorities.[69] There would be another referendum in 2017 in Puerto Rico, in favor of statehood although it was boycotted by some political opponents of it. (see 2017 Puerto Rican status referendum) In 2017, Puerto Rico suffered back-to-back large hurricanes: the Category 5 Hurricane Irma (September 7, 2017) and the Category 4 Hurricane Maria (September 20, 2017).[70] The storms caused an extreme amount of damage to the island, causing the following effects: all power was knocked out, 95% cell service, 43% of waste water treatment plants, 40 thousand land slides, 97% of roads blocked, 28% of health facilities damaged, leading to over 90% of the population applying for assistance after the storms.[70] See also Effects of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico It is thought that a combination of the debt crisis and two major hurricanes in the late 2010s, caused further departures from the island. Overall the population has decreased by about half a million in the 21st century, with many seeking better opportunities on the mainland.[71] Puerto Rico held its statehood referendum during the 3 November 2020 general elections; the ballot asked one question: \"Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the Union as a State?\" The results showed that 52 percent of Puerto Rico voters answered yes.[72] In the United States in the early 2020s, the Puerto Rico Status Act was being worked on by Congress, and H.R. 8393 passed the House in 2022—though it has not passed the Senate; this bill would support PR making a binding referendum. The bill does not decide PR's fate, it simply prepares the United States to respond the outcome of referendum.[73] In the 5 November 2024 elections, there was three choices in a non-binding referendum which included Statehood, Independence, or Independence with Free Association on the ballot; Statehood won with 59%.[74] In addition, on November 5, 2024, Jennifer Gonzalez won the office of Governor of Puerto Rico in the 2024 general election, with nearly 40% of the vote, who is pro-statehood.[75] Puerto Rico consists of the main island of Puerto Rico and various smaller islands, including Vieques, Culebra, Mona, Desecheo, and Caja de Muertos. Of these five, only Culebra and Vieques are inhabited year-round. Mona, which has played a key role in maritime history, is uninhabited most of the year except for employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources.[76] There are many other even smaller islets, like Monito, located near Mona,[77] and Isla de Cabras and La Isleta de San Juan, both located on the San Juan Bay. The latter is the only inhabited islet with communities like Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra, which are connected to the main island by bridges.[78][79] The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has an area of 5,320 square miles (13,800 km2), of which 3,420 sq mi (8,900 km2) is land and 1,900 sq mi (4,900 km2) is water.[81] Puerto Rico is larger than Delaware and Rhode Island but smaller than Connecticut. The maximum length of the main island from east to west is 110 mi (180 km), and the maximum width from north to south is 40 mi (64 km).[82] Puerto Rico is the smallest of the Greater Antilles. It is 80% of the size of Jamaica,[83] just over 18% of the size of Hispaniola and 8% of the size of Cuba, the largest of the Greater Antilles.[84] The topography of the island is mostly mountainous with large flat areas in the northern and southern coasts. The main mountain range that crosses the island from east to west is called the Cordillera Central (also known as the Central Mountain Range in English). The highest elevation in Puerto Rico, Cerro de Punta 4,390 feet (1,340 m),[81] is located in this range. Another important peak is El Yunque, one of the highest in the Sierra de Luquillo at the El Yunque National Forest, with an elevation of 3,494 ft (1,065 m).[85] Puerto Rico has 17 lakes, all man-made, and more than 50 rivers, most of which originate in the Cordillera Central.[86] Rivers in the northern region of the island are typically longer and of higher water flow rates than those of the south, since the south receives less rain than the central and northern regions. Puerto Rico is composed of Cretaceous to Eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks, overlain by younger Oligocene and more recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks.[87] Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern region. The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old (Jurassic) and are located at Sierra Bermeja in the southwest part of the island. They may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the Pacific Ocean realm. Puerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American Plates and is being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by their interaction. These stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis. These seismic events, along with landslides, represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean. The 1918 San Fermín earthquake occurred on 11 October, 1918 and had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.[88] It originated off the coast of Aguadilla, several kilometers off the northern coast, and was accompanied by a tsunami. It caused extensive property damage and widespread losses, damaging infrastructure, especially bridges. It resulted in an estimated 116 deaths and $4 million in property damage. The failure of the government to move rapidly to provide for the general welfare contributed to political activism by opponents and eventually to the rise of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. On 7 January 2020,[89] the country experienced its largest earthquake since 1918,[90] estimated at magnitude 6.4.[91] Economic losses were estimated to be more than $3.1 billion.[92] The Puerto Rico Trench, the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic, is located about 71 mi (114 km) north of Puerto Rico at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates.[93] It is 170 mi (270 km) long.[94] At its deepest point, named the Milwaukee Deep, it is almost 27,600 ft (8,400 m) deep.[93] The Mona Canyon, located in the Mona Passage between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, is another prominent oceanic landform with steep walls measuring between 1.25 and 2.17 miles (2.01 and 3.49 km) in height from bottom to top.[95] The climate of Puerto Rico in the Köppen climate classification is mostly tropical rainforest. Temperatures are warm to hot year round, averaging near 85 °F (29 °C) in lower elevations and 70 °F (21 °C) in the mountains. Easterly trade winds pass across the island year round. Puerto Rico has a rainy season, which stretches from April into November, and a dry season stretching from December to March. The mountains of the Cordillera Central create a rain shadow and are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances. The mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and direction due to their sheltering and channeling effects, adding to the climatic variation. Daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas. Between the dry and wet seasons, there is a temperature change of around 6 °F (3.3 °C). This change is due mainly to the warm waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean, which significantly modify cooler air moving in from the north and northwest. Coastal water temperatures during the year are about 75 °F (24 °C) in February and 85 °F (29 °C) in August. The highest temperature ever recorded was 110 °F (43 °C) at Arecibo,[96] while the lowest temperature ever recorded was 40 °F (4 °C) in the mountains at Adjuntas, Aibonito, and Corozal.[97] The average yearly precipitation is 66 in (1,676 mm).[98] Climate change in Puerto Rico has had a large impact on the ecosystems and landscapes.[99] Puerto Rico experiences the Atlantic hurricane season, similar to the rest of the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean. On average, a quarter of its annual rainfall is contributed from tropical cyclones, which are more prevalent during periods of La Niña than El Niño.[100] A cyclone of tropical storm strength passes near Puerto Rico, on average, every five years. A hurricane passes in the vicinity of the island, on average, every seven years. Since 1851, the Lake Okeechobee Hurricane (also known as the San Felipe Segundo hurricane in Puerto Rico) of September 1928 is the only hurricane to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane.[101] In 2017, Puerto Rico was affected by Category 5 Hurricane Irma and Category 4 Hurricane Maria,[102] causing widespread and devastating impacts, particularly to the electric grid.[102] Puerto Rico is home to three terrestrial ecoregions: Puerto Rican moist forests, Puerto Rican dry forests, and Greater Antilles mangroves.[103] Puerto Rico has two biosphere reserves recognized by the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme: Luquillo Biosphere Reserve represented by El Yunque National Forest and the Guánica Biosphere Reserve. Species endemic to the archipelago number 239 plants, 16 birds and 39 amphibians/reptiles, recognized as of 1998. Most of these (234, 12 and 33 respectively) are found on the main island.[104] The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the coquí, a small frog easily identified by the sound of its call, from which it gets its name. Most coquí species (13 of 17) live in the El Yunque National Forest,[105] the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. Forest Service system, located in the northeast of the island. It was previously known as the Caribbean National Forest. El Yunque is home to more than 240 plants, 26 of which are endemic to the island. It is also home to 50 bird species, including the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon. In addition to El Yunque National Forest, the Puerto Rican moist forest ecoregion is represented by protected areas such as the Maricao and Toro Negro state forests. These areas are home to endangered endemic species such as the Puerto Rican boa (Chilabothrus inornatus), the Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus venator), the Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus brunnescens) and the elfin woods warbler (Setophaga angelae). The Northern Karst country of Puerto Rico is also home to one of the remaining rainforest tracts in the island, with the Río Abajo State Forest being the first focus for the reintroduction of the highly endangered Puerto Rican parrot outside of the Sierra de Luquillo.[106][107] In the southwest, the Guánica State Forest and Biosphere Reserve contain over 600 uncommon species of plants and animals, including 48 endangered species and 16 that are endemic to Puerto Rico, and is considered a prime example of the Puerto Rican dry forest ecoregion and the best-preserved dry forest in the Caribbean.[108] Other protected dry forests in Puerto Rico can be formed within the Caribbean Islands National Wildlife Refuge complex at the Cabo Rojo, Desecheo, Culebra and Vieques National Wildlife Refuges, and in the Caja de Muertos and Mona and Monito Islands Nature Reserves.[109] Examples of endemic species found in this ecoregion are the higo chumbo (Harrisia portoricensis), the Puerto Rican crested toad (Peltophryne lemur), and the Mona ground iguana (Cyclura stejnegeri), the largest land animal native to Puerto Rico.[110] Puerto Rico has three of the seven year-long bioluminescent bays in the Caribbean: Laguna Grande in Fajardo, La Parguera in Lajas and Puerto Mosquito in Vieques. These are unique bodies of water surrounded by mangroves that are inhabited by the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense.[111][112] However, tourism, pollution, and hurricanes have highly threatened these unique ecosystems.[113] Puerto Rico has a republican form of government based on the American model, with separation of powers subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States.[114][115] All governmental powers are delegated by the United States Congress, with the head of state being the president of the United States. As an unincorporated territory, Puerto Rico lacks full protection under the U.S. Constitution.[116] The government of Puerto Rico is composed of three branches. The executive is headed by the governor, currently Pedro Pierluisi Urrutia. The legislative branch consists of the bicameral Legislative Assembly, made up of a Senate as its upper chamber and a House of Representatives as its lower chamber; the Senate is headed by a president, currently José Luis Dalmau, while the House is headed by the speaker of the House, currently Tatito Hernández. The governor and legislators are elected by popular vote every four years, with the last election held in November 2020. The judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, currently Maite Oronoz Rodríguez. Members of the judiciary are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. Puerto Rico is represented in the U.S. Congress by a nonvoting delegate to the House of Representatives, the resident commissioner, currently Jenniffer González. Current congressional rules have removed the commissioner's power to vote in the Committee of the Whole, but the commissioner can vote in committee.[117] Puerto Rican elections are governed by the Federal Election Commission and the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico.[118][119] Residents of Puerto Rico, including other U.S. citizens, cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, but can vote in primaries. Puerto Ricans who become residents of a U.S. state or Washington, D.C. can vote in presidential elections. Puerto Rico has eight senatorial districts, 40 representative districts, and 78 municipalities; there are no first-order administrative divisions as defined by the U.S. government. Municipalities are subdivided into wards or barrios, and those into sectors. Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for a four-year term. The municipality of San Juan is the oldest, founded in 1521;[120] the next earliest settlements are San Germán in 1570, Coamo in 1579, Arecibo in 1614, Aguada in 1692 and Ponce in 1692. Increased settlement in the 18th century saw 30 more communities established, following 34 in the 19th century. Six were founded in the 20th century, the most recent being Florida in 1971.[121] Since 1952, Puerto Rico has had three main political parties: the Popular Democratic Party (PPD in Spanish), the New Progressive Party (PNP in Spanish) and the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP). The three parties stand for different political status. The PPD, for example, seeks to maintain the island's status with the U.S. as a commonwealth, while the PNP seeks to make Puerto Rico a U.S. state. Meanwhile, the PIP seeks to make Puerto Rico a sovereign nation free from U.S. authority. In terms of party strength, the PPD and PNP usually hold about 47% of the vote each while the PIP holds about 5%. After 2007, other parties emerged on the island. The first, the Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party was registered that same year. The party claims that it seeks to address the islands' problems from a status-neutral platform. But it ceased to remain as a registered party when it failed to obtain the required number of votes in the 2008 general election. Four years later, the 2012 election saw the emergence of the Movimiento Unión Soberanista (English: Sovereign Union Movement) and the Partido del Pueblo Trabajador (English: Working People's Party) but none obtained more than 1% of the vote. Other non-registered parties include the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, the Socialist Workers Movement, and the Hostosian National Independence Movement. The nature of Puerto Rico's political relationship with the U.S. is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Congress, and the United Nations.[122] Specifically, the basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain an unincorporated territory of the U.S., become a U.S. state, or become an independent country.[123] Constitutionally, Puerto Rico is subject to the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress under the territorial clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution.[124] Laws enacted at the federal level in the U.S. apply to Puerto Rico as well, regardless of its political status. Their residents do not have voting representation in the U.S. Congress. Puerto Rico lacks \"the full sovereignty of an independent nation\", for example, the power to manage its \"external relations with other nations\", which is held by the U.S. federal government. The U.S. Supreme Court has indicated that once the U.S. Constitution has been extended to an area (by Congress or the courts), its coverage is irrevocable. To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they, not this Court, say \"what the law is\".[125] Puerto Ricans \"were collectively made U.S. citizens\" in 1917 as a result of the Jones–Shafroth Act.[126] U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, though both major parties, Republican and Democratic, hold primary elections in Puerto Rico to choose delegates to vote on the parties' presidential candidates. Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory and not a U.S. state, the U.S. Constitution does not fully enfranchise U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico.[116][127] Only fundamental rights under the American federal constitution and adjudications are applied to Puerto Ricans. Various other U.S. Supreme Court decisions have held which rights apply in Puerto Rico and which ones do not. Puerto Ricans have a long history of service in the U.S. Armed Forces and, since 1917, they have been included in the U.S. compulsory draft when it has been in effect. Though the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws, residents of Puerto Rico, contrary to a popular misconception, do pay U.S. federal taxes: customs taxes (which are subsequently returned to the Puerto Rico Treasury), import/export taxes, federal commodity taxes, social security taxes, etc. Residents pay federal payroll taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare, as well as Commonwealth of Puerto Rico income taxes. All federal employees, those who do business with the federal government, Puerto Rico-based corporations that intend to send funds to the U.S., and some others, such as Puerto Rican residents that are members of the U.S. military, and Puerto Rico residents who earned income from sources outside Puerto Rico also pay federal income taxes. In addition, because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the U.S. IRS code, and because the per-capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per-capita income on the mainland, more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island. This occurs because \"the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has a wider set of responsibilities than do U.S. State and local governments.\"[128][129][130][131][132][133][134] In 2009, Puerto Rico paid $3.742 billion into the U.S. Treasury.[135] Residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security, and are thus eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement. They are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income, and the island receives a smaller fraction of the Medicaid funding it would receive if it were a U.S. state.[136] Also, Medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico, even though the latter paid fully into the system.[137] Puerto Rico's authority to enact a criminal code derives from Congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states. Thus, individuals committing a crime can only be tried in federal or territorial court, otherwise it would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible.[138] In 1992, President George H. W. Bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This memorandum directs all federal departments, agencies, and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state, insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations. Many federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in Puerto Rico, just as in any state, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, Social Security Administration, and others. While Puerto Rico has its own Commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a U.S. state, there is also a U.S. federal district court in Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans have served as judges in that Court and in other federal courts on the U.S. mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment. Sonia Sotomayor, a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent, serves as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Puerto Ricans have also been frequently appointed to high-level federal positions, including serving as U.S. ambassadors to other nations. Unlike the vast majority of U.S. states, Puerto Rico has no first-order administrative divisions akin to counties, but has 78 municipalities or municipios as the secondary unit of administration; for U.S. Census purposes, the municipalities are considered county equivalents. Municipalities are subdivided into barrios, and those into sectors. Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for four-year terms, per the Autonomous Municipalities Act of 1991. Puerto Rico is subject to the Commerce and Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution and is thus restricted on how it can engage with other nations, sharing the opportunities and limitations that state governments have albeit not being one. As is the case with state governments, it has established several trade agreements with other nations, particularly with Latin American countries such as Colombia and Panamá.[139][140] It has also established trade promotion offices in many foreign countries, all Spanish-speaking, and within the U.S. itself, which now include Spain, the Dominican Republic, Panama, Colombia, Washington, D.C., New York City and Florida, and has included in the past offices in Chile, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Such agreements require permission from the U.S. Department of State; most are simply allowed by existing laws or trade treaties between the U.S. and other nations which supersede trade agreements pursued by Puerto Rico and different U.S. states. Puerto Rico hosts consulates from 41 countries, mainly from the Americas and Europe, with most located in San Juan.[120] At the local level, Puerto Rico established by law that the international relations which states and territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the Department of State of Puerto Rico, an executive department, headed by the secretary of state of Puerto Rico, who also serves as the unincorporated territory's lieutenant governor. It is also charged to liaise with general consuls and honorary consuls based in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, along with the Office of the Resident Commissioner, manages all its intergovernmental affairs before entities of or in the U.S. (including the federal government of the U.S., local and state governments of the U.S., and public or private entities in the U.S.).[citation needed] Both entities frequently assist the Department of State of Puerto Rico in engaging with Washington, D.C.-based ambassadors and federal agencies that handle Puerto Rico's foreign affairs, such as the U.S. Department of State, the Agency for International Development, and others. The current secretary of state is Larry Seilhamer Rodríguez from the New Progressive Party, while the current director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration is Jennifer M. Stopiran also from the NPP and a member of the Republican Party of the U.S.[citation needed] The resident commissioner of Puerto Rico, the delegate elected by Puerto Ricans to represent them before the federal government, including the U.S. Congress, sits in the U.S. House of Representatives, serves and votes on congressional committees, and functions in every respect as a legislator except being denied a vote on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor. The current resident commissioner is Jenniffer González-Colón, a member of the New Progressive Party and the Republican Party, elected in 2016. She received more votes than any other official elected in Puerto Rico that year.[141] Many Puerto Ricans have served as U.S. ambassadors to different nations and international organizations, such as the Organization of American States, mostly but not exclusively in Latin America. For example, Maricarmen Aponte, a Puerto Rican and now an acting assistant secretary of state, previously served as U.S. ambassador to El Salvador.[142] As it is an unincorporated U.S. territory, the defense of Puerto Rico is provided by the U.S. as part of the Treaty of Paris with the president of the U.S. as its commander-in-chief. Puerto Rico has its own National Guard, and its own state defense force, the Puerto Rico State Guard, which by local law is under the authority of the Puerto Rico National Guard. The commander-in-chief of both local forces is the governor of Puerto Rico who delegates his authority to the Puerto Rico adjutant general, currently Major General José J. Reyes. The Adjutant General, in turn, delegates the authority over the State Guard to another officer but retains the authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard as a whole. U.S. military installations in Puerto Rico were part of the U.S. Atlantic Command (LANTCOM after 1993 USACOM), which had authority over all U.S. military operations that took place throughout the Atlantic. Puerto Rico had been seen as crucial in supporting LANTCOM's mission until 1999, when U.S. Atlantic Command was renamed and given a new mission as U.S. Joint Forces Command. Puerto Rico is currently under the responsibility of U.S. Northern Command. Both the Naval Forces Caribbean (NFC) and the Fleet Air Caribbean (FAIR) were formerly based at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. The NFC had authority over all U.S. Naval activity in the waters of the Caribbean while FAIR had authority over all U.S. military flights and air operations over the Caribbean. With the closing of the Roosevelt Roads and Vieques Island training facilities, the U.S. Navy has basically exited from Puerto Rico, except for the ships that steam by, and the only significant military presence in the island is the U.S. Army at Ft Buchanan, the Puerto Rican Army and Air National Guards, and the U.S. Coast Guard. Protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of the naval base. This resulted in a loss of 6,000 jobs and an annual decrease in local income of $300 million.[143] A branch of the U.S. Army National Guard is stationed in Puerto Rico – known as the Puerto Rico Army National Guard – which performs missions equivalent to those of the Army National Guards of different U.S. states, including ground defense, disaster relief, and control of civil unrest. The local National Guard also incorporates a branch of the U.S. Air National Guard – known as the Puerto Rico Air National Guard – which performs missions equivalent to those of the Air National Guards of each one of the U.S. states. At different times in the 20th century, the U.S. had about 25 military or naval installations in Puerto Rico.[144] The largest of these installations were the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility (AFWTF) on Vieques, the National Guard training facility at Camp Santiago in Salinas, Fort Allen in Juana Diaz, the Army's Fort Buchanan in San Juan, the former U.S. Air Force's Ramey Air Force Base in Aguadilla, and the Puerto Rico Air National Guard's Muñiz Air National Guard Base in San Juan.[145] The former U.S. Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads, Vieques, and Sabana Seca have been deactivated and partially turned over to the local government. Other than U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico National Guard facilities, there are only two remaining military installations in Puerto Rico: the U.S. Army's small Ft. Buchanan (supporting local veterans and reserve units) and the PRANG (Puerto Rico Air National Guard) Muñiz Air Base (the C-130 Fleet). In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered their deactivations, but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in Puerto Rico – such as retired military who rely on Ft. Buchanan for the services available there. Puerto Ricans have participated in many U.S. military conflicts, including the American Revolution, when volunteers from Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Mexico fought the British in 1779 under the command of General Bernardo de Gálvez (1746–1786).[146] They continue to be disproportionately represented in present-day conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.[147] The most notable example is the 65th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army, nicknamed The Borinqueneers, from the original Taíno name of the island (Borinquen). The all-Puerto Rican regiment participated in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the War on Terror; in 2014, it was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for its heroism during the Korean War. A significant number of Puerto Ricans serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, largely as National Guard members and civilian employees. The size of the overall military-related community is estimated to be 100,000, including retired personnel.[145] Fort Buchanan has about 4,000 military and civilian personnel. In addition, approximately 17,000 people are members of the Puerto Rico Army and Air National Guards, or the U.S. Reserve forces.[148] The insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems. Puerto Rico is the only current U.S. jurisdiction whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than American English: namely, Spanish. Because the U.S. federal government operates primarily in English, all Puerto Rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in English in U.S. federal courts, and litigate federal preemption issues in Puerto Rican courts.[149][original research?] Title 48 of the United States Code outlines the role of the U.S. Code to U.S. territories and insular areas such as Puerto Rico. After the U.S. government assumed control of Puerto Rico in 1901, it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law, criminal procedure, and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in California. Although Puerto Rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary, several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the California Penal Code. The judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, which is the only appellate court required by the Constitution. All other courts are created by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico.[150] There is also a Federal District Court for Puerto Rico, and someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a Commonwealth court, and vice versa, since Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory lacks sovereignty separate from Congress as a state does.[138] The U.S. Supreme Court held in 2016 that such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy.[151] The homicide rate of 19.2 per 100,000 inhabitants was significantly higher than any U.S. state in 2014.[152][153] Most homicide victims are gang members and drug traffickers with about 80% of homicides in Puerto Rico being drug related.[154] In 1992, the FBI made armed carjacking a federal crime and rates decreased per statistics,[155] but as of 2019, the problem continued in municipalities like Guaynabo and others.[156][157][158][159][160] From 1 January 2019 to 14 March 2019, thirty carjackings had occurred on the island.[161] Puerto Rico is classified as a high income economy by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.[38] It is considered the most competitive economy in Latin America by the World Economic Forum and ranks highly on the Human Development Index. According to World Bank, gross national income per capita in Puerto Rico in 2020 was $21,740.[162] Puerto Rico's economy is mainly driven by manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals, textiles, petrochemicals and electronics) followed by services (primarily finance, insurance, real estate and tourism); agriculture represents less than 1% of GNP.[163][o][p] In recent years, it has also become a popular destination for MICE (meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions), with a modern convention center district overlooking the Port of San Juan.[164] Responsibility for San Juan port inspections lies with PPQ.[165] So high is the volume of cargo traffic that between 1984–2000 the San Juan PPQ station recorded 7.74% of all interceptions, #4 in the country, #2 for insects and #3 for pathogens.[165] Most species are originally from South America or elsewhere in the Caribbean due to PR's position as an intermediary on the way to the mainland.[165] This is one of the worst locations for cut flowers and other plant parts – both in terms of number of problems and diversity of species – for insects in plant parts in baggage, and for pathogens in plant parts in baggage and cargo.[165] Pathogen interceptions were dramatically (17%) higher 1999–2000 than in 1985–1986.[165] Puerto Rico's geography and political status are both determining factors for its economic prosperity, primarily due to its relatively small size; lack of natural resources and subsequent dependence on imports; and vulnerability to U.S. foreign policy and trading restrictions, particularly concerning its shipping industry. Puerto Rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011, interrupted by four quarters of economic growth, and entered into recession again in 2013, following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the IRS Section 936 corporate incentives that the U.S. Internal Revenue Code had applied to Puerto Rico. This IRS section was critical to the economy, as it established tax exemptions for U.S. corporations that settled in Puerto Rico and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time, without paying federal tax on corporate income. Puerto Rico has been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80% of the rest of the world.[166] Academically, most of Puerto Rico's economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired, have been repealed, or no longer apply to Puerto Rico; its inability to become self-sufficient and self-sustainable throughout history;[q] its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power;[r] as well as its highly inefficient local government[s][t] which has accrued a public debt equal to 68% of its gross domestic product throughout time.[u][v] Puerto Rico currently has a public debt of $72.204 billion (equivalent to 103% of GNP), and a government deficit of $2.5 billion.[172][173] By American standards, Puerto Rico is underdeveloped: It is poorer than Mississippi, the poorest state of the U.S., with 41% of its population below the poverty line.[w] However, it has the highest GDP per capita in Latin America. Puerto Rico's main trading partners are the United States, Ireland, and Japan, with most products coming from East Asia, mainly China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Puerto Rico's dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation, as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials, makes Puerto Rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate. Tourism in Puerto Rico is also an important part of the economy. In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused severe damage to the island and its infrastructure, disrupting tourism for many months. The damage was estimated at $100 billion. An April 2019 report indicated that by that time, only a few hotels were still closed, that life for tourists in and around the capital had, for the most part, returned to normal.[175] By October 2019, nearly all of the popular amenities for tourists, in the major destinations such as San Juan, Ponce and Arecibo, were in operation on the island and tourism was rebounding. This was important for the economy, since tourism provides up to 10% of Puerto Rico's GDP, according to Discover Puerto Rico.[176] A tourism campaign was launched by Discover Puerto Rico in 2018 intended to highlight the island's culture and history, branding it distinct, and different from other Caribbean destinations. In 2019, Discover Puerto Rico planned to continue that campaign.[177] In early 2017, the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion.[178] The debt had been increasing during a decade-long recession.[179] The Commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts, including bonds, since 2015. With debt payments due, the governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system.[180][181] \"Without action before April, Puerto Rico's ability to execute contracts for Fiscal Year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened, thereby putting at risk beginning July 1, 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico\", according to a letter sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. They also said that \"Congress must enact measures recommended by both Republicans and Democrats that fix Puerto Rico's inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth.\"[181] Initially, the oversight board created under PROMESA called for Puerto Rico's governor Ricardo Rosselló to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by 28 January. Just before that deadline, the control board gave the Commonwealth government until 28 February to present a fiscal plan (including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt) to solve the problems. A moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to 31 May.[179] It is essential for Puerto Rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy-like process under PROMESA.[182] An internal survey conducted by the Puerto Rican Economists Association revealed that the majority of Puerto Rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the Board and the Rosselló government, with more than 80% of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt.[183] In early August 2017, the island's financial oversight board (created by PROMESA) planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees, down from the original plan of four days per month; the latter had been expected to achieve $218 million in savings. Governor Rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary. Pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10% reduction in benefits to begin addressing the $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.[184] Puerto Rico has an operating budget of about U.S.$9.8 billion with expenses at about $10.4 billion, creating a structural deficit of $775 million (about 7.9% of the budget).[185] The practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 24 consecutive years starting in 2000. Throughout those years, including present time, all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover these projected deficits rather than making structural adjustments. This practice increased Puerto Rico's cumulative debt, as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades beginning in 1973.[x][187] Projected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of $71B or about 70% of Puerto Rico's gross domestic product. This sparked an ongoing government-debt crisis after Puerto Rico's general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade (\"junk status\") by three credit-rating agencies. In terms of financial control, almost 9.6%—or about $1.5 billion—of Puerto Rico's central government budget expenses for FY2014 is expected to be spent on debt service.[y] Harsher budget cuts are expected as Puerto Rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the coming years.[needs update] For practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects: a \"general budget\" which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the Department of Treasury of Puerto Rico, and the \"consolidated budget\" which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget, by Puerto Rico's government-owned corporations, by revenue expected from loans, by the sale of government bonds, by subsidies extended by the federal government of the United States, and by other funds. Both budgets contrast each other drastically, with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget; currently $29B and $9.0B respectively. Almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from U.S. federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose more than 31% of the consolidated budget. The critical aspects come from the sale of bonds, which comprise 7% of the consolidated budget – a ratio that increased annually due to the government's inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses. In particular, the government-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt, as none is self-sufficient. For example, in FY2011 the government-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than $1.3B with the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority (PRHTA) reporting losses of $409M, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA; the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island) reporting losses of $272M, while the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA; the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island) reported losses of $112M.[189] Losses by government-owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40% of Puerto Rico's entire public debt today.[190] Holistically, from FY2000–FY2010 Puerto Rico's debt grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% while GDP remained stagnant.[191] This has not always provided a long-term solution. In early July 2017 for example, the PREPA power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure $9 billion in bond debt; the agency planned to seek Court protection.[192] The cost of living in Puerto Rico is high and has increased over the past decade.[z][194][195][196][197][198][199][200] Statistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain costs, such as the high cost of electricity, which has hovered in the 24¢ to 30¢ range per kilowatt-hour, two to three times the national average, increased travel costs for longer flights, additional shipping fees, and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers \"outside the continental United States\". While some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to Puerto Rico, many merchants exclude Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. The household median income is stated as $19,350 and the mean income as $30,463 in the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 update. The report also indicates that 45.5% of individuals are below the poverty level.[201] The median home value in Puerto Rico ranges from U.S.$100,000 to U.S.$214,000, while the national median home value sits at $119,600.[aa] One of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in Puerto Rico is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also known as the Jones Act, which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports, a practice known as cabotage.[203] Because of the Jones Act, foreign ships inbound with goods from Central and South America, Western Europe, and Africa cannot stop in Puerto Rico, offload Puerto Rico-bound goods, load mainland-bound Puerto Rico-manufactured goods, and continue to U.S. ports. Instead, they must proceed directly to U.S. ports, where distributors break bulk and send Puerto Rico-bound manufactured goods to Puerto Rico across the ocean by U.S.-flagged ships.[203] The local government of Puerto Rico has requested several times to the U.S. Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from the Jones Act restrictions without success.[ab] In 2013 the Government Accountability Office published a report which concluded that \"repealing or amending the Jones Act cabotage law might cut Puerto Rico shipping costs\" and that \"shippers believed that opening the trade to non-U.S.-flag competition could lower costs\".[ac][ad] Ultimately, the report concluded that \"[the] effects of modifying the application of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico are highly uncertain\" for both Puerto Rico and the U.S., particularly for the U.S. shipping industry and the military preparedness of the U.S.[205][206] A 2018 study by economists at Boston-based Reeve & Associates and Puerto Rico-based Estudios Tecnicos has concluded that the 1920 Jones Act has no impact on either retail prices or the cost of living on Puerto Rico.[207] Cities and towns in Puerto Rico are interconnected by a system of roads, freeways, expressways, and highways maintained by the Highways and Transportation Authority under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation, and patrolled by the Puerto Rico Police Department. The island's San Juan metropolitan area is served by a public bus transit system and a metro system called Tren Urbano ('Urban Train'). Other forms of Puerto Rican public transport include seaborne ferries that serve Puerto Rico's archipelago as well as carros públicos (private mini buses). Puerto Rico has three international airports, the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in Carolina, Mercedita International Airport in Ponce, and the Rafael Hernández International Airport in Aguadilla, and 27 local airports. The Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport is the largest aerial transportation hub in the Caribbean.[208] Puerto Rico has nine ports in different cities across the main island. The San Juan Port is the largest in Puerto Rico, and the busiest port in the Caribbean and the 10th busiest in the United States in terms of commercial activity and cargo movement, respectively.[208] The second largest port is the Port of the Americas in Ponce, currently under expansion to increase cargo capacity to 1.5 million twenty-foot containers (TEUs) per year.[209] The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA, Spanish: Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica, AEE)—is an electric power company and the government-owned corporation of Puerto Rico responsible for electricity generation, power transmission, and power distribution in Puerto Rico.[210] PREPA was, by law, the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly until 2018. The Authority is ruled by a governing board appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate of Puerto Rico, and is run by an executive director. On 20 July 2018, Puerto Rico Law 120-2018 (Ley para Transformar el Sistema Eléctrico de Puerto Rico) was signed. This law authorized PREPA to sell infrastructure and services to other providers. As a result, a contract was signed on 22 June 2020, making LUMA Energy the new operator of the energy distribution and transmission infrastructure, as well as other areas of PREPA's operations, in effect partially privatizing the Puerto Rican power grid. The takeover was set for 1 June 2021, amidst protests and uncertainty from the point of view of the general public and the former-PREPA workers and union members.[211][212] Similarly, the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA, Spanish: Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados, AAA)—is a water company and the government-owned corporation responsible for water quality, management, and supply in Puerto Rico.[213] It is the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly. Its existence is designated by Law No. 40 of 1 May 1945, including the corresponding amendments.[214] Telecommunications in Puerto Rico includes radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Broadcasting in Puerto Rico is regulated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[215] As of 2007[update], there were 30 TV stations, 125 radio stations and roughly 1 million TV sets on the island. Cable TV subscription services are available, and the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service also broadcast on the island.[216] Puerto Rico also has its own amateur radio prefixes, which differ from those of the contiguous United States in that there are two letter before the number. The most well-known prefix is KP4, but others separated for use on the archipelago (including Desecheo and Mona) are: KP3/KP4/NP3/NP4/WP3/WP4 (Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra) and KP5/NP5/WP5 (Desecheo Island).[217] Amateur radio operators (also known as ham radio operators) are a well-known group in the island and can obtain special vehicle license plates with their callsign on them.[218] They have been a key element in disaster relief.[219] The population of Puerto Rico reflects influences from initial Amerindian settlement, European colonization, slavery, economic migration, and the archipelago's status as unincorporated territory of the United States. Puerto Ricans are characterized by a high degree of ethnic and cultural diversity, as well as a long history of intermarriage and acculturation among different demographics; racial and ethnic identity is subsequently complex and often nebulous, shaped by the broader attitudes and policies of the Spanish colonial period, 20th century American racial politics, and modern trends in cultural and identity in the 21st century United States.[221] According to the most recent 2020 United States Census, Puerto Rico had 3,285,874 residents, an 11.8% decrease since 2010.[16] The commonwealth's population peaked in 2000, when it was 3,808,610, before declining (for the first time in census history) to 3,725,789 in 2010.[222] Emigration due to economic difficulties and natural disasters, coupled with a low birth rate, have resulted in continued population decline into the 21st century.[223] The most populous municipality is the capital, San Juan, with 342,259 people based on the 2020 Census.[224] Other major cities include Bayamón, Carolina, Ponce, and Caguas. Of the ten most populous cities on the island, eight are located within what is considered San Juan's metropolitan area, while the other two are located in the south (Ponce) and west (Mayagüez) of the island. As of 2020, Hispanic or Latinos made up 98.9 percent of the population, of which 95.5 percent were Puerto Rican and 3.4% were Hispanic of non-Puerto Rican origins; only 1.1 percent of the population was non-Hispanic.[226] Fewer than one-fifth of people (17.1 percent) identified as \"White\", a decline of almost 80 percent; by contrast, nearly half of Puerto Ricans (49.8 percent) reported being multiracial—compared to just 3 percent in 2010—while roughly one-quarter chose \"some other race alone\" (25.5 percent).[221] Censuses of Puerto Rico were completed by Spain in 1765, 1775, 1800, 1815, 1832, 1846 and 1857, yet some of the data remained untabulated and were considered reliable in a 1943 report by Irene Barnes Taeuber, an American demographer at the Office of Population Research at Princeton University.[227] Continuous European immigration and high natural increase helped the population of Puerto Rico grow from 155,426 in 1800 to almost a million by the end of the 19th century. A census conducted by royal decree on 30 September 1858 gave the following totals of the Puerto Rican population at that time: 341,015 were free colored; 300,430 were white; and 41,736 were slaves.[228] A census in 1887 found a population of around 800,000, of which 320,000 were black.[229] During the 19th century, hundreds of families arrived in Puerto Rico, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia, but also from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia, Asturias, Galicia and the Balearic Islands; they were later joined by numerous Spanish loyalists from Spain's former colonies in South America. There were also smaller numbers of settlers from outside Spain, including from Corsica, France, Lebanon, Portugal, Ireland, Scotland, Germany and Italy; this immigration from non-Hispanic countries was largely the result of the Real Cédula de Gracias de 1815 (Royal Decree of Graces of 1815), which provided European Catholics with land allotments in the sparsely inhabited interior of the island, provided they paid taxes and continued to support the Catholic Church. Between 1960 and 1990, the census questionnaire in Puerto Rico did not ask about race or ethnicity. The 2000 United States Census included a racial self-identification question in Puerto Rico, according to which most Puerto Ricans identified as white and Latino and few identified as black or some other race. Although less than one percent of the population identifies as indigenous, a large proportion of Puerto Ricans have native ancestry: A 2003 study by the University of Puerto Rico,[230] which took genetic samples from 800 randomly selected subjects throughout the island, found that 61.1 percent of those surveyed had mitochondrial DNA of indigenous origin; additionally, 26.4 percent had African markers and 12.5 percent showed European descent.[231] The study reportedly resulted in a resurgence of indigenous and Taino identity among Puerto Ricans; in the 2010 census, 19,839 respondents identified as \"American Indian or Alaskan Native\", an increase of almost 49 percent from 2000 count.[231] The vast majority of recent immigrants, both legal and illegal, come from Latin America, over half come from the Dominican Republic. Dominicans represent 53% of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics, about 1.8% of Puerto Rico's population.[193] Some illegal immigrants, particularly from Haiti, Dominican Republic,[232][233] and Cuba[citation needed], use Puerto Rico as a temporary stop-over point to get to the U.S. mainland. Other major sources of recent immigrants include Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, Ecuador, Spain, and Jamaica.[234][235] Additionally, there are many non-Puerto Rican U.S. citizens settling in Puerto Rico from the U.S. mainland, majority of which are White Americans and a smaller number are Black Americans. In fact, non-hispanic people represent 1.1% and majority of them are from the U.S. mainland. Smaller numbers of U.S. citizens come from the U.S. Virgin Islands. There are also large numbers of Nuyoricans and other stateside Puerto Ricans coming back, as many Puerto Ricans engage in 'circular migration'.[236] Small numbers of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics in Puerto Rico are actually American-born migrants from the mainland U.S. and not recent immigrants. Most recent immigrants settle in and around the San Juan metropolitan area. Emigration is a major part of contemporary Puerto Rican history. Starting soon after World War II, poverty, cheap airfares, and promotion by the island government caused waves of Puerto Ricans to move to the U.S. mainland, particularly to the northeastern states and nearby Florida.[237] This trend continued even as Puerto Rico's economy improved and its birth rate declined. Puerto Ricans continue to follow a pattern of \"circular migration\", with some migrants returning to the island. In recent years, the population has declined markedly, falling nearly 1% in 2012 and an additional 1% (36,000 people) in 2013 due to a falling birthrate and emigration.[238] The impact of hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017, combined with the unincorporated territory's worsening economy, led to its greatest population decline since the U.S. acquired the archipelago. According to the 2020 U.S. census, the number of Puerto Ricans living outside of Puerto Rico in the U.S. is almost twice as many as those living in Puerto Rico.[239] As those who leave tend to be better educated than those who remain, this accentuates the drain on Puerto Rico's economy. Based on 1 July 2019 estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of the Commonwealth had declined by 532,095 people since the 2010 Census data had been tabulated.[240] The official languages[241] of the executive branch of government of Puerto Rico[242] are Spanish and English, with Spanish being the primary language. Spanish is, and has been, the only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system, despite a 1902 English-only language law.[243] However, all official business of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English. English is the primary language of less than 10% of the population. Spanish is the dominant language of business, education and daily life on the island, spoken by nearly 95% of the population.[244] Out of people aged five and older, 94.3% speak only Spanish at home, 5.5% speak English, and 0.2% speak other languages.[2] A Pew Research survey indicated an adult literacy rate of 90.4% in 2012 based on data from the United Nations.[245] In Puerto Rico, public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in Spanish. There have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only. Objections from teaching staff are common, perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English.[246] English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school. The languages of the deaf community are American Sign Language and its local variant, Puerto Rican Sign Language. The Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere. Puerto Rican Spanish utilizes many Taíno words, as well as English words. The largest influence on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico is that of the Canary Islands. Taíno loanwords are most often used in the context of vegetation, natural phenomena, and native musical instruments. Similarly, words attributed to primarily West African languages were adopted in the contexts of foods, music, and dances, particularly in coastal towns with concentrations of descendants of Sub-Saharan Africans.[247] Religious affiliation in Puerto Rico (2014)[248][249] Christianity is the dominant religion in Puerto Rico. Catholicism was brought by Spanish colonists and gradually became the prevailing faith. The first dioceses in the Americas, including that of Puerto Rico, were authorized by Pope Julius II in 1511.[250] In 1512, priests were established for the parochial churches. By 1759, there was a priest for each church.[251] One Pope, John Paul II, visited Puerto Rico in October 1984. All municipalities in Puerto Rico have at least one Catholic church, most of which are located at the town center, or plaza. Protestantism, which was suppressed under the Spanish Catholic regime, reemerged under U.S. rule, making contemporary Puerto Rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries, although Catholicism continues to be the dominant religion. The first Protestant church, Iglesia de la Santísima Trinidad, was established in Ponce by the Anglican Diocese of Antigua in 1872.[252] It was the first non-Catholic church in the entire Spanish Empire in the Americas.[253][254] Sources differ on the denominational breakdown of the population. Pollster Pablo Ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38 percent Catholic, 28 percent Pentecostal, and 18 percent independent churches; the total number of Protestants collectively added up to almost two million people, or 46 percent of the population. Another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of Protestants in 1997, finding a Protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent, the majority of whom are Pentecostal; however, it estimated that Puerto Rico would become 75 percent evangelical by 2022.[255] A 2014 Pew Research report found that only 56% of Puerto Ricans were Catholic, while 33% were Protestant and 8% were unaffiliated;[256][245] these figures are shared by the CIA World Factbook, which further notes that Protestants are \"largely Pentecostal\", while other religions make up 2 percent and atheists only one percent.[257] Pew Research from the year before, which surveyed Puerto Ricans living in the mainland United States, found that only about 45% of Puerto Rican adults identified themselves as Catholic, 29% as Protestant and 20% as unaffiliated with a religion.[258] By contrast, an Associated Press article in March 2014 stated that \"more than 70 percent\" of Puerto Ricans identified as Catholic.[259] There is a small Eastern Orthodox community, centered mostly around two Eastern Orthodox Churches in the territory: the Russian Orthodox mission of Saint John Climacus in San German and the Saint George Antiochian Orthodox Church in Carolina; both have services in English and Spanish.[260][261] There is a small Syriac Orthodox church in Aguada, which represents the only Oriental Orthodox denomination in the Island. Orthodox Christians accounted for one percent of the population in 2010.[262] In 2017, the first Eastern Catholic Church was established in Puerto Rico.[263][264] In 2023, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints dedicated a temple in San Juan,[265] and reported having a membership of approximately 23,000 in the commonwealth.[266] In 2015, the 25,832 Jehovah's Witnesses represented about 0.70% of the population, with 324 congregations.[267] Puerto Rico has the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean, at roughly 3,000,[268] and is the only Caribbean island where Conservative, Reform and Orthodox Jewish movements are all represented.[269][270] The island's first synagogue, Sha'are Zedeck, was established in 1952 by American Jews.[271][272][269] In 2007, there were about 5,000 Muslims in Puerto Rico, representing about 0.13% of the population.[273][274] Eight mosques are located throughout the island, with most Muslims living in Río Piedras and Caguas; most Muslims are of Palestinian and Jordanian descent.[275][276] There is also a Baháʼí community.[277] Buddhism in Puerto Rico is represented with Nichiren, Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, with the New York Padmasambhava Buddhist Center for example having a branch in San Juan.[278] There are several atheist activist and educational organizations, and an atheistic parody religion called the Pastafarian Church of Puerto Rico.[279] An ISKCON temple in Gurabo is devoted to Krishna, with two preaching centers in the San Juan metropolitan area. Taíno religious practices have been rediscovered and reinvented to some degree by a handful of advocates.[280] Similarly, some aspects of African religious traditions have persisted, as African slaves maintained various ethnic African religious practices associated with different peoples; in particular, the Yoruba beliefs of Santería or Ifá, and the Kongo-derived Palo Mayombe. Some indigenous and African practices and beliefs are syncretized with Christianity. In 1940, Juanita García Peraza founded the Mita Congregation, the first religion of Puerto Rican origin.[281] The first school in Puerto Rico was the Escuela de Gramática (Grammar School). It was established by Bishop Alonso Manso in 1513, in the area where the Cathedral of San Juan was to be constructed. The school was free of charge and the courses taught were Latin language, literature, history, science, art, philosophy and theology.[282] Education in Puerto Rico is divided in three levels—Primary (elementary school grades 1–6), Secondary (intermediate and high school grades 7–12), and Higher Level (undergraduate and graduate studies). As of 2002, the literacy rate of the Puerto Rican population was 94.1%; by gender, it was 93.9% for males and 94.4% for females.[283] According to the 2000 Census, 60.0% of the population attained a high school degree or higher level of education, and 18.3% has a bachelor's degree or higher. Instruction at the primary school level is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 18. As of 2010[update], there are 1539 public schools and 806 private schools.[284] The largest and oldest university system is the public University of Puerto Rico (UPR) with 11 campuses. The largest private university systems on the island are the Sistema Universitario Ana G. Mendez which operates the Universidad del Turabo, Metropolitan University and Universidad del Este. Other private universities include the multi-campus Inter American University, the Pontifical Catholic University, Universidad Politécnica de Puerto Rico, and the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón. Puerto Rico has four schools of Medicine and three ABA-approved Law Schools. In 2017, there were 69 hospitals in Puerto Rico.[285] As of 2021, average life expectancy is approximately 82.1 years according to the CIA World Factbook, an improvement from 78.7 years in 2010.[286] Reforma de Salud de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Health Reform) – locally referred to as La Reforma ('The Reform') – is a government-run program which provides medical and health care services to the indigent and impoverished, by means of contracting private health insurance companies, rather than employing government-owned hospitals and emergency centers. The Reform is administered by the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration.[287] Modern Puerto Rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents: including European (predominantly Spanish, Italian, French, German and Irish), African, and, more recently, some North American and many South Americans. Many Cubans and Dominicans have relocated to the island in the past few decades. From the Spanish, Puerto Rico received the Spanish language, the Catholic religion and the vast majority of their cultural and moral values and traditions. The United States added English-language influence, the university system and the adoption of some holidays and practices. On 12 March 1903, the University of Puerto Rico was officially founded, branching out from the \"Escuela Normal Industrial\", a smaller organization that was founded in Fajardo three years earlier. Much of Puerto Rican culture centers on the influence of music and has been shaped by other cultures combining with local and traditional rhythms. Early in the history of Puerto Rican music, the influences of Spanish and African traditions were most noticeable. The cultural movements across the Caribbean and North America have played a vital role in the more recent musical influences which have reached Puerto Rico.[288][289] Puerto Rico has many symbols, but only the Flor de Maga has been made official by the Government of Puerto Rico.[290] Other popular, traditional, or unofficial symbols of Puerto Rico are the Puerto Rican spindalis, the kapok tree, the coquí frog, the jíbaro, the Taíno Indian, and Cerro Las Tetas with its jíbaro culture monument.[291][292] The architecture of Puerto Rico demonstrates a broad variety of traditions, styles and national influences accumulated over four centuries of Spanish rule, and a century of American rule. Spanish colonial architecture, Ibero-Islamic, art deco, post-modern, and many other architectural forms are visible throughout the island. From town to town, there are also many regional distinctions. Old San Juan is one of the two barrios, in addition to Santurce, that made up the municipality of San Juan from 1864 to 1951, at which time the former independent municipality of Río Piedras was annexed. With its abundance of shops, historic places, museums, open air cafés, restaurants, gracious homes, tree-shaded plazas, and its old beauty and architectonical peculiarity, Old San Juan is a main spot for local and internal tourism. The district is also characterized by numerous public plazas and churches including San José Church and the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista, which contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León. It also houses the oldest Catholic school for elementary education in Puerto Rico, the Colegio de Párvulos, built in 1865. The oldest parts of the district of Old San Juan remain partly enclosed by massive walls. Several defensive structures and notable forts, such as the emblematic Fort San Felipe del Morro, Fort San Cristóbal, and El Palacio de Santa Catalina, also known as La Fortaleza, acted as the primary defenses of the settlement which was subjected to numerous attacks. La Fortaleza continues to serve also as the executive mansion for the governor of Puerto Rico. Many of the historic fortifications are part of San Juan National Historic Site. During the 1940s, sections of Old San Juan fell into disrepair, and many renovation plans were suggested. There was even a strong push to develop Old San Juan as a \"small Manhattan\". Strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city. When a project proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be demolished to erect a new hotel, the Institute had the building declared as a historic building, and then asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility. This was what became the Hotel El Convento in Old San Juan. The paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in the Americas, particularly Havana, Lima and Cartagena de Indias. Ponce Creole is a unique architectural style created in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This style of Puerto Rican buildings is found predominantly in residential homes in Ponce that developed between 1895 and 1920. Ponce Creole architecture borrows heavily from the traditions of France, Spain and the Caribbean vernacular to create houses that were especially built to withstand the hot and dry climate of the region, and to take advantage of the sun and sea breezes characteristic of the southern Puerto Rico's Caribbean Sea coast.[293] It is a blend of wood and masonry, incorporating architectural elements of other styles, from Classical revival and Spanish Revival to Victorian.[294] Puerto Rican art reflects many influences, much from its ethnically diverse background. A form of folk art, called santos evolved from the Catholic Church's use of sculptures to convert indigenous Puerto Ricans to Christianity. Santos depict figures of saints and other religious icons and are made from native wood, clay, and stone. After shaping simple, they are often finished by painting them in vivid colors. Santos vary in size, with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall. Traditionally, santos were seen as messengers between the earth and Heaven. As such, they occupied a special place on household altars, where people prayed to them, asked for help, or tried to summon their protection. Also popular, caretas or vejigantes are masks worn during carnivals. Similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both Spain and Africa, though for different purposes. The Spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed Christians into returning to the church, while tribal Africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they represented. True to their historic origins, Puerto Rican caretas always bear at least several horns and fangs. While usually constructed of papier-mâché, coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as well. Red and black were the typical colors for caretas but their palette has expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patterns. Puerto Rican literature evolved from the art of oral story telling to its present-day status. Written works by the native islanders of Puerto Rico were prohibited and repressed by the Spanish colonial government. Only those who were commissioned by the Spanish Crown to document the chronological history of the island were allowed to write. Diego de Torres Vargas was allowed to circumvent this strict prohibition and in 1647 wrote Descripción de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico (\"Description of the Island and City of Puerto Rico\"). This historical book was the first to make a detailed geographic description of the island.[296] Some of Puerto Rico's earliest writers were influenced by the teachings of Rafael Cordero. Among these was Manuel A. Alonso, the first Puerto Rican writer of notable importance. In 1849 he published El Gíbaro, a collection of verses whose main themes were the poor Puerto Rican country farmer. Eugenio María de Hostos wrote La peregrinación de Bayoán in 1863, which used Bartolomé de las Casas as a springboard to reflect on Caribbean identity. After this first novel, Hostos abandoned fiction in favor of the essay which he saw as offering greater possibilities for inspiring social change. In the late 19th century, with the arrival of the first printing press and the founding of the Royal Academy of Belles Letters, Puerto Rican literature began to flourish. The first writers to express their political views in regard to Spanish colonial rule of the island were journalists. Alejandro Tapia y Rivera, also known as the Father of Puerto Rican Literature, ushered in a new age of historiography with the publication of The Historical Library of Puerto Rico. Cayetano Coll y Toste was another Puerto Rican historian and writer. His work The Indo-Antillano Vocabulary is valuable in understanding the way the Taínos lived. Manuel Zeno Gandía in 1894 wrote La Charca and talked about the harsh life in the remote and mountainous coffee regions in Puerto Rico. Antonio S. Pedreira, described in his work Insularismo the cultural survival of the Puerto Rican identity after the American invasion. With the Puerto Rican diaspora of the 1940s, Puerto Rican literature was greatly influenced by a phenomenon known as the Nuyorican Movement. Puerto Rican literature continued to flourish, and many Puerto Ricans have since distinguished themselves as authors, journalists, poets, novelists, playwrights, essayists, and screenwriters. The influence of Puerto Rican literature has transcended the boundaries of the island to the U.S. and the rest of the world. Over the past fifty years, significant writers include Ed Vega (Omaha Bigelow), Miguel Piñero (Short Eyes), Piri Thomas (Down These Mean Streets), Giannina Braschi (Yo-Yo Boing!), Rosario Ferrer (Eccentric Neighborhoods). and Esmeralda Santiago (When I was Puerto Rican).[297][298] The mass media in Puerto Rico includes local radio stations, television stations and newspapers, the majority of which are conducted in Spanish. There are also three stations of the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service. Newspapers with daily distribution are El Nuevo Día, El Vocero and Índice, Metro, and Primera Hora. El Vocero is distributed free of charge, as are Índice and Metro. Newspapers distributed on a weekly or regional basis include Claridad, La Perla del Sur, La Opinión, Visión, and La Estrella del Norte, among others. Several television channels provide local content in the island. These include WIPR-TV, Telemundo, Univision affiliate WLII-DT (Teleonce), WAPA-TV, and WKAQ-TV. The music of Puerto Rico has evolved as a heterogeneous and dynamic product of diverse cultural resources. The most conspicuous musical sources have been Spain and West Africa, although many aspects of Puerto Rican music reflect origins elsewhere in Europe and the Caribbean and, over the last century, from the U.S. Puerto Rican music culture today comprises a wide and rich variety of genres, ranging from indigenous genres like bomba, plena, aguinaldo, danza and the popular salsa to recent hybrids like reggaeton. Puerto Rico has some national instruments, like the cuatro (Spanish for \"four\"). The cuatro is a local instrument that was made by the \"Jibaro\" or people from the mountains. Originally, the Cuatro consisted of four steel strings, hence its name, but currently the Cuatro consists of five double steel strings. It is easily confused with a guitar, even by locals. When held upright, from right to left, the strings are G, D, A, E, B. In the realm of classical music, the island hosts two main orchestras, the Orquesta Sinfónica de Puerto Rico and the Orquesta Filarmónica de Puerto Rico. The Casals Festival takes place annually in San Juan, drawing in classical musicians from around the world. With respect to opera, the legendary Puerto Rican tenor Antonio Paoli was so celebrated, that he performed private recitals for Pope Pius X and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. In 1907, Paoli was the first operatic artist in world history to record an entire opera – when he participated in a performance of Pagliacci by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in Milan, Italy. Puerto Rico has been commemorated on four U.S. postal stamps. Insular Territories were commemorated in 1937, the third stamp honored Puerto Rico featuring 'La Fortaleza', the Spanish Governor's Palace.[299] The first free election for governor of the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico was honored on 27 April 1949, at San Juan, Puerto Rico. 'Inauguration' on the 3-cent stamp refers to the election of Luis Muñoz Marín, the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico.[300] San Juan, Puerto Rico was commemorated with an 8-cent stamp on its 450th anniversary issued 12 September 1971, featuring a sentry box from Castillo San Felipe del Morro.[301] In the \"Flags of our nation series\" 2008–2012, of the fifty-five, five territorial flags were featured. Forever stamps included the Puerto Rico Flag illustrated by a bird issued 2011.[302] Puerto Rican cuisine has its roots in the cooking traditions and practices of Europe (Spain), Africa and the native Taínos. Basic ingredients include grains and legumes, herbs and spices, starchy tropical tubers, vegetables, meat and poultry, seafood and shellfish, and fruits. Main dishes include mofongo, arroz con gandules, pasteles, and pig roast (or lechón). Beverages include maví and piña colada. Desserts include flan, arroz con dulce (sweet rice pudding), piraguas, brazo gitanos, tembleque, polvorones, and dulce de leche. Baseball was one of the first sports to gain widespread popularity in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Baseball League serves as the only active professional league, operating as a winter league. No Major League Baseball franchise or affiliate plays in Puerto Rico; however, San Juan hosted the Montreal Expos for several series in 2003 and 2004 before they moved to Washington, D.C., and became the Washington Nationals. The Puerto Rico national baseball team has participated in the World Cup of Baseball winning one gold (1951), four silver and four bronze medals, the Caribbean Series (winning fourteen times) and the World Baseball Classic. In March 2006, San Juan's Hiram Bithorn Stadium hosted the opening round as well as the second round of the newly formed World Baseball Classic. Puerto Rican baseball players include Hall of Famers Roberto Clemente, Orlando Cepeda and Roberto Alomar, enshrined in 1973, 1999, and 2011 respectively.[306][307][308] Boxing, basketball, and volleyball are considered popular sports as well. Wilfredo Gómez and McWilliams Arroyo have won their respective divisions at the World Amateur Boxing Championships. Other medalists include José Pedraza, who holds a silver medal, and three boxers who finished in third place, José Luis Vellón, Nelson Dieppa and McJoe Arroyo. In the professional circuit, Puerto Rico has the third-most boxing world champions and it is the global leader in champions per capita. These include Miguel Cotto, Félix Trinidad, Wilfred Benítez and Gómez among others. The Puerto Rico national basketball team joined the International Basketball Federation in 1957. Since then, it has won more than 30 medals in international competitions, including gold in three FIBA Americas Championships and the 1994 Goodwill Games 8 August 2004, became a landmark date for the team when it became the first team to defeat the United States in an Olympic tournament since the integration of National Basketball Association players. Winning the inaugural game with scores of 92–73 as part of the 2004 Summer Olympics organized in Athens, Greece.[309] Baloncesto Superior Nacional acts as the top-level professional basketball league in Puerto Rico and has experienced success since its beginning in 1930. Puerto Rico is also a member of FIFA and CONCACAF. In 2008, the archipelago's first unified league, the Puerto Rico Soccer League, was established. Other sports include professional wrestling and road running. The World Wrestling Council and International Wrestling Association are the largest wrestling promotions in the main island. The World's Best 10K, held annually in San Juan, has been ranked among the 20 most competitive races globally. The \"Puerto Rico All Stars\" team, which has won twelve world championships in unicycle basketball.[310] Organized Streetball has gathered some exposition, with teams like \"Puerto Rico Street Ball\" competing against established organizations including the Capitanes de Arecibo and AND1's Mixtape Tour Team. Six years after the first visit, AND1 returned as part of their renamed Live Tour, losing to the Puerto Rico Streetballers.[311] Consequently, practitioners of this style have earned participation in international teams, including Orlando \"El Gato\" Meléndez, who became the first Puerto Rican born athlete to play for the Harlem Globetrotters.[312] Puerto Rico has representation in all international competitions including the Summer and Winter Olympics, the Pan American Games, the Caribbean World Series, and the Central American and Caribbean Games. Puerto Rico hosted the Pan Am Games in 1979 (officially in San Juan), and The Central American and Caribbean Games were hosted in 1993 in Ponce and in 2010 in Mayagüez. Puerto Rican athletes have won ten medals in Olympic competition (two gold, two silver, six bronze), the first one in 1948 by boxer Juan Evangelista Venegas. Monica Puig won the first gold medal for Puerto Rico in the Olympic Games by winning the Women's Tennis singles title in Rio 2016.[313][314] 18°12′N 66°30′W﻿ / ﻿18.2°N 66.5°W﻿ / 18.2; -66.5﻿ (Commonwealth of Puerto Rico)",

                "title": "Puerto Rico - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",
                "content": "Puerto Rico, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico), is a U.S. territory in the Caribbean Sea.[20] This means that it belongs to the United States and citizens of Puerto Rico are citizens of the United States as well. Puerto Rico is not an independent country, but like all populated U.S. territories, it enjoys a greater degree of autonomy than U.S. states. There has been a movement for independence for almost two centuries. There have been protests, votes, and armed attacks for independence.[21][22][23] Puerto Rico has about 3.3 million (3,300,000) people. Its political system is based on a republican system. It has two official languages: Spanish and English, but Spanish is almost only used by the government, the legislature and the judiciary (courts). Spanish is also the main language of the school curriculum, though English is taught in all schools as a second language (from grade 1 to 12). Puerto Rico is one of two U.S. territories where the metric system is officially used and is dominant. (The other is Guam, which was also a Spanish colony. The metric system was introduced to both territories, before they became U.S. territories.)[24] Spanish is spoken by 94.7% of the population and English is spoken by 5.3% of the population as a mother language. The currency used is the United States dollar. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico includes the largest, main island and a number of smaller islands, including Mona, Vieques, and Culebra. Of those three smaller islands, only Culebra and Vieques are populated all year. Mona is unpopulated, but employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources sometimes visit the island to inspect it and its wildlife. People can visit the island for hiking and camping by getting the permission needed. San Juan, on the northern side of the main island, is the island's largest city and the capital of the territory. Puerto Rico means \"rich port\" in Spanish. On May 3, 2017, Puerto Rico filed for bankruptcy after a massive debt and weak economy.[25] It is the largest bankruptcy case in American history.[25] Puerto Rico is one of the unincorporated territories of the USA. These are organized, self-governing territories with locally elected governors and legislatures. Because it is not a state, its citizens can not vote in U.S. national elections unless they have an address in one of the 50 US states. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and can move to or from the 50 states. Puerto Rico elects a Resident Commissioner to the U.S. House of Representatives.[26] The history of Puerto Rico began when the Ortoiroid people started living in the island between 3000 and 2000 BC. Other tribes, for example the Saladoid and Arawak Indians, lived in the island between 430 BC and 1000 AD. When Christopher Columbus arrived at the island in 1492 and named it San Juan Bautista,[27] the people living there were the Taínos.[28][29] Since it is in the northeastern Caribbean Sea, Puerto Rico formed an important part of the Spanish Empire from the early years of the exploration, conquest, and colonization of the New World. The Spanish spread race-based slavery across the island. In the 19th century, slave revolts and the abolitionist movement brought an end to legal slavery.[30] The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European countries for control of the region in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. In 1898, during the Spanish-American war, Puerto Rico was invaded and became a possession of the United States. During the 20th century, Puerto Rico's political status changed from time to time. The Foraker Act of 1900 created a civil government to replace the military government made after the Spanish–American war, and the Jones Act of 1917 gave Puerto Rican people United States citizenship. Afterwards. In 1932, the name Porto Rico was changed to Puerto Rico. in 1952, the drafting of Puerto Rico's own Constitution and democratic elections were established. A 1948 law called the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law) made it illegal to speak in favor of Puerto Rican independence or even display the Puerto Rican flag. This law, implemented by the U.S. colonial government, was used to persecute and imprison Puerto Rican independence leaders, instilling fear in the population, and discouraging any form of nationalist and patriotic expression.[31] The political status of Puerto Rico, a Commonwealth controlled by the United States, is still not completely defined. Many people want to resolve this status, while others want the status to remain the same. Of the people who want to change the status, some want Puerto Rico to become a new U.S. state, while others want Puerto Rico to become a fully independent country. In May 2022, Members of Congress sponsoring competing bills on how to resolve Puerto Rico’s territorial status and its relationship to the U.S. have come together to introduce new legislation combining both. The proposed legislation combines elements of the pro-statehood bill introduced by Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., and Rep. Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting member of Congress and a Republican, alongside the Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act from Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nydia Velázquez, both New York Democrats. The draft legislation says that a plebiscite to resolve Puerto Rico’s political status shall be held on November 5, 2023.[1] On December 15, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of the Puerto Rico Status Act. The act sought to resolve Puerto Rico's status and its relationship to the United States through a binding plebiscite.[32] Puerto Rico is an archipelago, with a main island where most of the population lives, two smaller islands (Vieques and Culebra) with residents, and many other smaller islands. The main island has a mountain range in the center, which covers most of the island. The highest point is 4,390 feet (1,338 meters) Puerto Rico has three main political parties: the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which favors Puerto Rico becoming an independent nation; the New Progressive Party, which supports Puerto Rico's transition to becoming a state of the U.S; and the Popular Democratic Party, which supports Colonialism. The issue of the political status of the island (meaning whether it's a country, a U.S. state, or a colony) is an issue of debate amongst the Puerto Rican people. In the past there have been many attempts to clearly define the island's political status by means of voting. Most of the time the majority of the people have chosen to remain a colony. However, in the last \"status voting\" the colonial option appeared to have lost well over 90% of its support, while the U.S. state option has only gained strength in the last few decades. The Puerto Rican Independence party, on the other hand, has mainly lost a great deal of support within the last six decades (60 years). Puerto Rico is said to comprise a White majority, an extinct Amerindian population, persons of mixed ancestry, Africans and a small Asian minority. Recent genetic research, however, contradicts that information. According to the 2010 US Census, 99% of the population consider themselves of Puerto Rican descent (regardless of race or skin color), making Puerto Rico one of the most culturally unified societies in the world. The population of Puerto Rico is nearly about 4 million people. The ethnic composition of the population is: Puerto Rico has a strong literary tradition. The most important playwrights are René Marqués (author of \"The Oxcart\") and Lin Manuel Miranda (creator of the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\"). The most famous poets are Julia de Burgos (\"Yo fui mi ruta\")[33] and Giannina Braschi[34] (author the poetry epic \"Empire of Dreams\"). Celebrated Puerto Rican novelists include Rosario Ferre (Eccentric Neighborhoods), Giannina Braschi (United States of Banana), and Esmeralda Santiago (When I Was Puerto Rican).[35] Puerto Rican poets who live in New York are called Nuyorican poets. José Campeche (1751-1809) is the first known Puerto Rican painter.[36] He painted in the best rococo style. Franciso Oller painted Puerto Rican landscapes and still life paintings the 19th Century. In the 20th century Franciso Rodón who paints portraits of celebrities.[37] In the 21st century, Allora and Calzadilla are conceptual artists in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[38] Puerto Rico music is often called Latin music. There are many popular styes of Puerto Rican dance music, including Salsa, Bomba, Plena, and Reggaeton.[39] One of the most popular bands today is Calle 13.[40] World famous Puerto Rican singers include Jennifer Lopez, Hector Lavoe, Tito Puentes, and Marc Anthony. Ricky Martin won the 1999 Grammy Award for \"Best Latin Pop Performance\" for Living La Vida Loca.[39] Puerto Rican philosophy deals with Puerto Rican independence, education, racism, and liberty for all. The first major Puerto Rican philosopher was Eugenio María de Hostos.[41] He was born in the 19th Century in Puerto Rico. He believed that Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba should unite to be free from Colonial powers. Francisco José Ramos was born in the 20th century. His philosophy deals with Ancient Greeks, American imperialism, and Buddhism.[42] Giannina Braschi is a contemporary political philosopher. She writes about freedom, immigration, revolution, and justice.[43] Braschi was inspired by a major Mexican woman philosopher Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz.[44] Puerto Rican philosophers are sometimes called Latinx philosophers or Latin American philosophers.",

                "content": "Pontic Steppe Caucasus East Asia Eastern Europe Northern Europe Pontic Steppe Northern/Eastern Steppe Europe South Asia Steppe Europe Caucasus India Indo-Aryans Iranians East Asia Europe East Asia Europe Indo-Aryan Iranian Indo-Aryan Iranian Others European The Celts (/kɛlts/ KELTS, see pronunciation for different usages) or Celtic peoples (/ˈkɛltɪk/ KEL-tik) were a collection of Indo-European peoples[1] in Europe and Anatolia, identified by their use of Celtic languages and other cultural similarities.[2][3][4][5] Major Celtic groups included the Gauls; the Celtiberians and Gallaeci[6][7] of Iberia; the Britons, Picts, and Gaels of Britain and Ireland; the Boii; and the Galatians. The interrelationships of ethnicity, language and culture in the Celtic world are unclear and debated;[8] for example over the ways in which the Iron Age people of Britain and Ireland should be called Celts.[5][8][9][10] In current scholarship, 'Celt' primarily refers to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single ethnic group.[11] The history of pre-Celtic Europe and Celtic origins is debated. The traditional \"Celtic from the East\" theory, says the proto-Celtic language arose in the late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of central Europe, named after grave sites in southern Germany,[12][13] which flourished from around 1200 BC.[14] This theory links the Celts with the Iron Age Hallstatt culture which followed it (c. 1200–500 BC), named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt, Austria,[14][15] and with the following La Tène culture (c. 450 BC onward), named after the La Tène site in Switzerland. It proposes that Celtic culture spread westward and southward from these areas by diffusion or migration.[16] A newer theory, \"Celtic from the West\", suggests proto-Celtic arose earlier, was a lingua franca in the Atlantic Bronze Age coastal zone, and spread eastward.[17] Another newer theory, \"Celtic from the Centre\", suggests proto-Celtic arose between these two zones, in Bronze Age Gaul, then spread in various directions.[11] After the Celtic settlement of Southeast Europe in the 3rd century BC, Celtic culture reached as far east as central Anatolia, Turkey. The earliest undisputed examples of Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions from the 6th century BC.[18] Continental Celtic languages are attested almost exclusively through inscriptions and place-names. Insular Celtic languages are attested from the 4th century AD in Ogham inscriptions, though they were being spoken much earlier. Celtic literary tradition begins with Old Irish texts around the 8th century AD. Elements of Celtic mythology are recorded in early Irish and early Welsh literature. Most written evidence of the early Celts comes from Greco-Roman writers, who often grouped the Celts as barbarian tribes. They followed an ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. The Celts were often in conflict with the Romans, such as in the Roman–Gallic wars, the Celtiberian Wars, the conquest of Gaul and conquest of Britain. By the 1st century AD, most Celtic territories had become part of the Roman Empire. By c. 500, due to Romanisation and the migration of Germanic tribes, Celtic culture had mostly become restricted to Ireland, western and northern Britain, and Brittany. Between the 5th and 8th centuries, the Celtic-speaking communities in these Atlantic regions emerged as a reasonably cohesive cultural entity. They had a common linguistic, religious and artistic heritage that distinguished them from surrounding cultures.[19] Insular Celtic culture diversified into that of the Gaels (Irish, Scots and Manx) and the Celtic Britons (Welsh, Cornish, and Bretons) of the medieval and modern periods.[2][20][21] A modern Celtic identity[22] was constructed as part of the Romanticist Celtic Revival in Britain, Ireland, and other European territories such as Galicia.[23] Today, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton are still spoken in parts of their former territories, while Cornish and Manx are undergoing a revival. The first recorded use of the name 'Celts' – as Κελτοί (Keltoi) in Ancient Greek – was by Greek geographer Hecataeus of Miletus in 517 BC,[24] when writing about a people living near Massilia (modern Marseille), southern Gaul.[25] In the fifth century BC, Herodotus referred to Keltoi living around the source of the Danube and in the far west of Europe.[26] The etymology of Keltoi is unclear. Possible roots include Indo-European *kʲel 'to hide' (seen also in Old Irish ceilid, and Modern Welsh celu), *kʲel 'to heat' or *kel 'to impel'.[27] It may come from the Celtic language. Linguist Kim McCone supports this view and notes that Celt- is found in the names of several ancient Gauls such as Celtillus, father of Vercingetorix. He suggests it meant the people or descendants of \"the hidden one\", noting the Gauls claimed descent from an underworld god (according to Commentarii de Bello Gallico), and linking it with the Germanic Hel.[28] Others view it as a name coined by Greeks; among them linguist Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel, who suggests it meant \"the tall ones\".[29] In the first century BC, Roman leader Julius Caesar reported that the Gauls called themselves 'Celts', Latin: Celtae, in their own tongue.[30] Thus whether it was given to them by others or not, it was used by the Celts themselves. Greek geographer Strabo, writing about Gaul towards the end of the first century BC, refers to the \"race which is now called both Gallic and Galatic\", though he also uses Celtica as another name for Gaul. He reports Celtic peoples in Iberia too, calling them Celtiberi and Celtici.[31] Pliny the Elder noted the use of Celtici in Lusitania as a tribal surname,[32] which epigraphic findings have confirmed.[33][34] A Latin name for the Gauls, Galli (pl.), may come from a Celtic ethnic name, perhaps borrowed into Latin during the Celtic expansion into Italy from the early fifth century BC. Its root may be Proto-Celtic *galno, meaning \"power, strength\" (whence Old Irish gal \"boldness, ferocity\", Welsh gallu \"to be able, power\"). The Greek name Γαλάται (Galatai, Latinized Galatae) most likely has the same origin, referring to the Gauls who invaded southeast Europe and settled in Galatia.[35] The suffix -atai might be a Greek inflection.[36] Linguist Kim McCone suggests it comes from Proto-Celtic *galatis (\"ferocious, furious\"), and was not originally an ethnic name but a name for young warrior bands. He says \"If the Gauls' initial impact on the Mediterranean world was primarily a military one typically involving fierce young *galatīs, it would have been natural for the Greeks to apply this name for the type of Keltoi that they usually encountered\".[28] Because Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Κελτοί (Keltoi) or Celtae,[5][8][9] some scholars prefer not to use the term for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] However, they spoke Celtic languages, shared other cultural traits, and Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Gauls in customs and religion.[11] For at least 1,000 years the name Celt was not used at all, and nobody called themselves Celts or Celtic, until from about 1700, after the word 'Celtic' was rediscovered in classical texts, it was applied for the first time to the distinctive culture, history, traditions, language of the modern Celtic nations – Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Brittany, and the Isle of Man.[37] 'Celt' is a modern English word, first attested in 1707 in the writing of Edward Lhuyd, whose work, along with that of other late 17th-century scholars, brought academic attention to the languages and history of the early Celtic inhabitants of Great Britain.[38] The English words Gaul, Gauls (pl.) and Gaulish (first recorded in the 16–17th centuries) come from French Gaule and Gaulois, a borrowing from Frankish *Walholant, 'Roman-land' (see Gaul: Name), the root of which is Proto-Germanic *walha-, 'foreigner, Roman, Celt', whence the English word Welsh (Old English wælisċ). Proto-Germanic *walha comes from the name of the Volcae,[39] a Celtic tribe who lived first in southern Germany and central Europe, then migrated to Gaul.[40] This means that English Gaul, despite its superficial similarity, is not actually derived from Latin Gallia (which should have produced *Jaille in French),[citation needed] though it does refer to the same ancient region. Celtic refers to a language family and, more generally, means 'of the Celts' or 'in the style of the Celts'. Several archaeological cultures are considered Celtic, based on unique sets of artefacts. The link between language and artefact is aided by the presence of inscriptions.[41] The modern idea of a Celtic cultural identity or \"Celticity\" focuses on similarities among languages, works of art, and classical texts,[42] and sometimes also among material artefacts, social organisation, homeland and mythology.[43] Earlier theories held that these similarities suggest a common \"racial\" (race is now a contested concept) origin for the various Celtic peoples, but more recent theories hold that they reflect a common cultural and linguistic heritage more than a genetic one. Celtic cultures seem to have been diverse, with the use of a Celtic language being the main thing they had in common.[5] Today, the term 'Celtic' generally refers to the languages and cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, and Brittany; also called the Celtic nations. These are the regions where Celtic languages are still spoken to some extent. The four are Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton; plus two recent revivals, Cornish (a Brittonic language) and Manx (a Goidelic language). There are also attempts to reconstruct Cumbric, a Brittonic language of northern Britain. Celtic regions of mainland Europe are those whose residents claim a Celtic heritage, but where no Celtic language survives; these include western Iberia, i.e. Portugal and north-central Spain (Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Castile and León, Extremadura).[44] Continental Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of mainland Europe and Insular Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of the British and Irish islands, and their descendants. The Celts of Brittany derive their language from migrating Insular Celts from Britain and so are grouped accordingly.[45] The Celtic languages are a branch of the Indo-European languages. By the time Celts are first mentioned in written records around 400 BC, they were already split into several language groups, and spread over much of western mainland Europe, the Iberian Peninsula, Ireland and Britain. The languages developed into Celtiberian, Goidelic and Brittonic branches, among others.[46][47] The mainstream view during most of the twentieth century is that the Celts and the proto-Celtic language arose out of the Urnfield culture of central Europe around 1000 BC, spreading westward and southward over the following few hundred years.[14][48][49][50] The Urnfield culture was preeminent in central Europe during the late Bronze Age, circa 1200 BC to 700 BC. The spread of iron-working led to the Hallstatt culture (c. 800 to 500 BC) developing out of the Urnfield culture in a wide region north of the Alps. The Hallstatt culture developed into the La Tène culture from about 450 BC, which came to be identified with Celtic art.[citation needed] In 1846, Johann Georg Ramsauer unearthed an ancient grave field with distinctive grave goods at Hallstatt, Austria. Because the burials \"dated to roughly the time when Celts are mentioned near the Danube by Herodotus, Ramsauer concluded that the graves were Celtic\".[51] Similar sites and artifacts were found over a wide area, which were named the 'Hallstatt culture'. In 1857, the archaeological site of La Tène was discovered in Switzerland.[51] The huge collection of artifacts had a distinctive style. Artifacts of this 'La Tène style' were found elsewhere in Europe, \"particularly in places where people called Celts were known to have lived and early Celtic languages are attested. As a result, these items quickly became associated with the Celts, so much so that by the 1870s scholars began to regard finds of the La Tène as 'the archaeological expression of the Celts'\".[51] This cultural network was overrun by the Roman Empire, though traces of La Tène style were still seen in Gallo-Roman artifacts. In Britain and Ireland, the La Tène style survived precariously to re-emerge in Insular art.[citation needed] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to be challenged in the latter 20th century, when it was accepted that the oldest known Celtic-language inscriptions were those of Lepontic from the 6th century BC and Celtiberian from the 2nd century BC. These were found in northern Italy and Iberia, neither of which were part of the 'Hallstatt' nor 'La Tène' cultures at the time.[11] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory was partly based on ancient Greco-Roman writings, such as the Histories of Herodotus, which placed the Celts at the source of the Danube. However, Stephen Oppenheimer shows that Herodotus seemed to believe the Danube rose near the Pyrenees, which would place the Ancient Celts in a region which is more in agreement with later classical writers and historians (i.e. in Gaul and Iberia).[52] The theory was also partly based on the abundance of inscriptions bearing Celtic personal names in the Eastern Hallstatt region (Noricum). However, Patrick Sims-Williams notes that these date to the later Roman era, and says they suggest \"relatively late settlement by a Celtic-speaking elite\".[11] In the late 20th century, the Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to fall out of favour with some scholars, which was influenced by new archaeological finds. 'Celtic' began to refer primarily to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single culture or ethnic group.[11] A new theory suggested that Celtic languages arose earlier, along the Atlantic coast (including Britain, Ireland, Armorica and Iberia), long before evidence of 'Celtic' culture is found in archaeology. Myles Dillon and Nora Kershaw Chadwick argued that \"Celtic settlement of the British Isles\" might date to the Bell Beaker culture of the Copper and Bronze Age (from c. 2750 BC).[53][54] Martín Almagro Gorbea (2001) also proposed that Celtic arose in the 3rd millennium BC, suggesting that the spread of the Bell Beaker culture explained the wide dispersion of the Celts throughout western Europe, as well as the variability of the Celtic peoples.[55] Using a multidisciplinary approach, Alberto J. Lorrio and Gonzalo Ruiz Zapatero reviewed and built on Almagro Gorbea's work to present a model for the origin of Celtic archaeological groups in Iberia and proposing a rethinking of the meaning of \"Celtic\".[56] John T. Koch[57] and Barry Cunliffe[58] have developed this 'Celtic from the West' theory. It proposes that the proto-Celtic language arose along the Atlantic coast and was the lingua franca of the Atlantic Bronze Age cultural network, later spreading inland and eastward.[11] More recently, Cunliffe proposes that proto-Celtic had arisen in the Atlantic zone even earlier, by 3000 BC, and spread eastwards with the Bell Beaker culture over the following millennium. His theory is partly based on glottochronology, the spread of ancient Celtic-looking placenames, and thesis that the Tartessian language was Celtic.[11] However, the proposal that Tartessian was Celtic is widely rejected by linguists, many of whom regard it as unclassified.[59][60] Celticist Patrick Sims-Williams (2020) notes that in current scholarship, 'Celt' is primarily a linguistic label. In his 'Celtic from the Centre' theory, he argues that the proto-Celtic language did not originate in central Europe nor the Atlantic, but in-between these two regions. He suggests that it \"emerged as a distinct Indo-European dialect around the second millennium BC, probably somewhere in Gaul [centered in modern France] ... whence it spread in various directions and at various speeds in the first millennium BC\". Sims-Williams says this avoids the problematic idea \"that Celtic was spoken over a vast area for a very long time yet somehow avoided major dialectal splits\", and \"it keeps Celtic fairly close to Italy, which suits the view that Italic and Celtic were in some way linked\".[11] The Proto-Celtic language is usually dated to the Late Bronze Age.[14] The earliest records of a Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions of Cisalpine Gaul (Northern Italy), the oldest of which pre-date the La Tène period. Other early inscriptions, appearing from the early La Tène period in the area of Massilia, are in Gaulish, which was written in the Greek alphabet until the Roman conquest. Celtiberian inscriptions, using their own Iberian script, appear later, after about 200 BC. Evidence of Insular Celtic is available only from about 400 AD, in the form of Primitive Irish Ogham inscriptions.[citation needed] Besides epigraphic evidence, an important source of information on early Celtic is toponymy (place names).[61] Arnaiz-Villena et al. (2017) demonstrated that Celtic-related populations of the European Atlantic (Orkney Islands, Scottish, Irish, British, Bretons, Basques, Galicians) shared a common HLA system.[clarification needed][62] Other genetic research does not support the notion of a significant genetic link between these populations, beyond the fact that they are all West Europeans. Early European Farmers did settle Britain (and all of Northern Europe) in the Neolithic; however, recent genetics research has found that, between 2400 and 2000 BC, over 90% of British DNA was overturned by European Steppe Herders in a migration that brought large amounts of Steppe DNA (including the R1b haplogroup) to western Europe.[63] Modern autosomal genetic clustering is testament to this fact, as both modern and Iron Age British and Irish samples cluster genetically very closely with other North Europeans, and less so with Galicians, Basques or those from the south of France.[64][65] The concept that the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures could be seen not just as chronological periods but as \"Culture Groups\", entities composed of people of the same ethnicity and language, had started to grow by the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century the belief that these \"Culture Groups\" could be thought of in racial or ethnic terms was held by Gordon Childe, whose theory was influenced by the writings of Gustaf Kossinna.[66] As the 20th century progressed, the ethnic interpretation of La Tène culture became more strongly rooted, and any findings of La Tène culture and flat inhumation cemeteries were linked to the Celts and the Celtic language.[67] In various[clarification needed] academic disciplines the Celts were considered a Central European Iron Age phenomenon, through the cultures of Hallstatt and La Tène. However, archaeological finds from the Halstatt and La Tène culture were rare in Iberia, southwestern France, northern and western Britain, southern Ireland and Galatia[68][69] and did not provide enough evidence for a culture like that of Central Europe. It is equally difficult to maintain that the origin of the Iberian Celts can be linked to the preceding Urnfield culture. This has resulted in a newer theory that introduces a 'proto-Celtic' substratum and a process of Celticisation, having its initial roots in the Bronze Age Bell Beaker culture.[70] The La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age (from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC) in eastern France, Switzerland, Austria, southwest Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. It developed out of the Hallstatt culture without any definite cultural break, under the impetus of considerable Mediterranean influence from Greek, and later Etruscan civilisations. A shift of settlement centres took place in the 4th century. The western La Tène culture corresponds to historical Celtic Gaul. Whether this means that the whole of La Tène culture can be attributed to a unified Celtic people is difficult to assess; archaeologists have repeatedly concluded that language and material culture do not necessarily run parallel. Frey notes that in the 5th century, \"burial customs in the Celtic world were not uniform; rather, localised groups had their own beliefs, which, in consequence, also gave rise to distinct artistic expressions\".[71] Thus, while the La Tène culture is certainly associated with the Gauls, the presence of La Tène artefacts may be due to cultural contact and does not imply the permanent presence of Celtic speakers.[citation needed] The Greek historian Ephorus of Cyme in Asia Minor, writing in the 4th century BC, believed the Celts came from the islands off the mouth of the Rhine and were \"driven from their homes by the frequency of wars and the violent rising of the sea\". Polybius published a history of Rome about 150 BC in which he describes the Gauls of Italy and their conflict with Rome. Pausanias in the 2nd century AD says that the Gauls \"originally called Celts\", \"live on the remotest region of Europe on the coast of an enormous tidal sea\". Posidonius described the southern Gauls about 100 BC. Though his original work is lost, later writers such as Strabo used it. The latter, writing in the early 1st century AD, deals with Britain and Gaul as well as Hispania, Italy, and Galatia. Caesar wrote extensively about his Gallic Wars in 58–51 BC. Diodorus Siculus wrote about the Celts of Gaul and Britain in his 1st-century history.[citation needed] Diodorus Siculus and Strabo both suggest that the heartland of the people they call Celts was in southern Gaul. The former says that the Gauls were to the north of the Celts, but that the Romans referred to both as Gauls (linguistically the Gauls were certainly Celts). Before the discoveries at Hallstatt and La Tène, it was generally considered that the Celtic heartland was southern Gaul, see Encyclopædia Britannica for 1813.[citation needed] The Romans knew the Celts then living in present-day France as Gauls. The territory of these peoples probably included the Low Countries, the Alps and present-day northern Italy. Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars described the 1st-century BC descendants of those Gauls.[citation needed] Eastern Gaul became the centre of the western La Tène culture. In later Iron Age Gaul, the social organisation resembled that of the Romans, with large towns. From the 3rd century BC the Gauls adopted coinage. Texts with Greek characters from southern Gaul have survived from the 2nd century BC.[72] Greek traders founded Massalia about 600 BC, with some objects (mostly drinking ceramic vessels) being traded up the Rhône valley. But trade became disrupted soon after 500 BC and re-oriented over the Alps to the Po valley in the Italian peninsula. The Romans arrived in the Rhone valley in the 2nd century BC and encountered a mostly Celtic-speaking Gaul. Rome wanted land communications with its Iberian provinces and fought a major battle with the Saluvii at Entremont in 124–123 BC. Gradually Roman control extended, and the Roman province of Gallia Transalpina developed along the Mediterranean coast.[73][74] The Romans knew the remainder of Gaul as Gallia Comata, 'Long-haired Gaul'.[75] In 58 BC, the Helvetii planned to migrate westward but Julius Caesar forced them back. He then became involved in fighting the various tribes in Gaul, and by 55 BC had overrun most of Gaul. In 52 BC, Vercingetorix led a revolt against Roman occupation but was defeated at the Battle of Alesia and surrendered.[76] Following the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BC, Caesar's Celtica formed the main part of Roman Gaul, becoming the province of Gallia Lugdunensis. This territory of the Celtic tribes was bounded on the south by the Garonne and on the north by the Seine and the Marne.[77] The Romans attached large swathes of this region to neighbouring provinces Belgica and Aquitania, particularly under Augustus.[78] Place- and personal-name analysis and inscriptions suggest that Gaulish was spoken over most of what is now France.[79][80] Until the end of the 19th century, traditional scholarship dealing with the Celts did acknowledge their presence in the Iberian Peninsula[81][82] as a material culture relatable to the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures. However, since according to the definition of the Iron Age in the 19th century Celtic populations were supposedly rare in Iberia and did not provide a cultural scenario that could easily be linked to that of Central Europe, the presence of Celtic culture in that region was generally not fully recognised. Modern scholarship, however, has proven that Celtic presence and influences were most substantial in what is today Spain and Portugal (with perhaps the highest settlement saturation in Western Europe), particularly in the central, western and northern regions.[83][84] In addition to Gauls infiltrating from the north of the Pyrenees, the Roman and Greek sources mention Celtic populations in three parts of the Iberian Peninsula: the eastern part of the Meseta (inhabited by the Celtiberians), the southwest (Celtici, in modern-day Alentejo) and the northwest (Gallaecia and Asturias).[85] A modern scholarly review[86] found several archaeological groups of Celts in Spain: The origins of the Celtiberians might provide a key to understanding the Celticisation process in the rest of the Peninsula. The process of Celticisation of the southwestern area of the peninsula by the Keltoi and of the northwestern area is, however, not a simple Celtiberian question. Recent investigations about the Callaici[91] and Bracari[92] in northwestern Portugal are providing new approaches to understanding Celtic culture (language, art and religion) in western Iberia.[93] John T. Koch of Aberystwyth University suggested that Tartessian inscriptions of the 8th century BC might be classified as Celtic. This would mean that Tartessian is the earliest attested trace of Celtic by a margin of more than a century.[94] In Germany by the late Bronze Age, the Urnfield culture (c. 1300 BC – c. 750 BC) had replaced the Bell Beaker, Unetice and Tumulus cultures in central Europe,[97] whilst the Nordic Bronze Age had developed in Scandinavia and northern Germany. The Hallstatt culture, which had developed from the Urnfield culture, was the predominant Western and Central European culture from the 12th to 8th centuries BC and during the early Iron Age (8th to 6th centuries BC). It was followed by the La Tène culture (5th to 1st centuries BC). The people who had adopted these cultural characteristics in central and southern Germany are regarded as Celts. Celtic cultural centres developed in central Europe during the late Bronze Age (c. 1200 BC until 700 BC). Some, like the Heuneburg, the oldest city north of the Alps,[98] grew to become important cultural centres of the Iron Age in Central Europe, that maintained trade routes to the Mediterranean. In the 5th century BC the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned a Celtic city at the Danube – Pyrene, that historians attribute to the Heuneburg. Beginning around 700 BC (or later), Germanic peoples (Germanic tribes) from southern Scandinavia and northern Germany expanded south and gradually replaced the Celtic peoples in Central Europe.[99][100][101][102][103][104] The Canegrate culture represented the first migratory wave of the proto-Celtic[105][106] population from the northwest part of the Alps that, through the Alpine passes, had already penetrated and settled in the western Po valley between Lake Maggiore and Lake Como (Scamozzina culture). It has also been proposed that a more ancient proto-Celtic presence can be traced back to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, when North Westwern Italy appears closely linked regarding the production of bronze artefacts, including ornaments, to the western groups of the Tumulus culture.[107] La Tène cultural material appeared over a large area of mainland Italy,[108] the southernmost example being the Celtic helmet from Canosa di Puglia.[109] Italy is home to Lepontic, the oldest attested Celtic language (from the 6th century BC).[110] Anciently spoken in Switzerland and in Northern-Central Italy, from the Alps to Umbria.[111][112][113][114] According to the Recueil des Inscriptions Gauloises, more than 760 Gaulish inscriptions have been found throughout present-day France – with the notable exception of Aquitaine – and in Italy,[115][116] which testifies the importance of Celtic heritage in the peninsula.[citation needed] In 391 BC, Celts \"who had their homes beyond the Alps streamed through the passes in great strength and seized the territory that lay between the Apennine Mountains and the Alps\" according to Diodorus Siculus. The Po Valley and the rest of northern Italy (known to the Romans as Cisalpine Gaul) was inhabited by Celtic-speakers who founded cities such as Milan.[117] Later the Roman army was routed at the battle of Allia and Rome was sacked in 390 BC by the Senones.[118] At the battle of Telamon in 225 BC, a large Celtic army was trapped between two Roman forces and crushed.[119] The defeat of the combined Samnite, Celtic and Etruscan alliance by the Romans in the Third Samnite War sounded the beginning of the end of the Celtic domination in mainland Europe, but it was not until 192 BC that the Roman armies conquered the last remaining independent Celtic kingdoms in Italy.[citation needed] The Celts also expanded down the Danube river and its tributaries. One of the most influential tribes, the Scordisci, established their capital at Singidunum (present-day Belgrade, Serbia) in the 3rd century BC. The concentration of hill-forts and cemeteries shows a dense population in the Tisza valley of modern-day Vojvodina, Serbia, Hungary and into Ukraine. Expansion into Romania was however blocked by the Dacians.[citation needed] The Serdi were a Celtic tribe[120] inhabiting Thrace. They were located around and founded Serdika (Bulgarian: Сердика, Latin: Ulpia Serdica, Greek: Σαρδῶν πόλις), now Sofia in Bulgaria,[121] which reflects their ethnonym. They would have established themselves in this area during the Celtic migrations at the end of the 4th century BC, though there is no evidence for their existence before the 1st century BC. Serdi are among traditional tribal names reported into the Roman era.[122] They were gradually Thracianized over the centuries but retained their Celtic character in material culture up to a late date.[when?][citation needed] According to other sources they may have been simply of Thracian origin,[123] according to others they may have become of mixed Thraco-Celtic origin. Further south, Celts settled in Thrace (Bulgaria), which they ruled for over a century, and Anatolia, where they settled as the Galatians (see also: Gallic Invasion of Greece). Despite their geographical isolation from the rest of the Celtic world, the Galatians maintained their Celtic language for at least 700 years. St Jerome, who visited Ancyra (modern-day Ankara) in 373 AD, likened their language to that of the Treveri of northern Gaul.[citation needed] For Venceslas Kruta, Galatia in central Turkey was an area of dense Celtic settlement.[citation needed] The Boii tribe gave their name to Bohemia, Bologna and possibly Bavaria, and Celtic artefacts and cemeteries have been discovered further east in what is now Poland and Slovakia. A Celtic coin (Biatec) from Bratislava's mint was displayed on the old Slovak 5-crown coin.[citation needed] As there is no archaeological evidence for large-scale invasions in some of the other areas, one current school of thought holds that Celtic language and culture spread to those areas by contact rather than invasion.[124] However, the Celtic invasions of Italy and the expedition in Greece and western Anatolia, are well documented in Greek and Latin history.[125][126] There are records of Celtic mercenaries in Egypt serving the Ptolemies. Thousands were employed in 283–246 BC and they were also in service around 186 BC. They attempted to overthrow Ptolemy II.[127] All living Celtic languages today belong to the Insular Celtic languages, derived from the Celtic languages spoken in Iron Age Britain and Ireland.[128] They separated into a Goidelic and a Brittonic branch early on. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, the Insular Celts were made up of the Celtic Britons, the Gaels (or Scoti), and the Picts (or Caledonians).[citation needed] The renown of insular Celts has caused a popular belief that Celtic clans only lived in the British Isles.[129] Linguists have debated whether a Celtic language came to the British Isles and then split, or whether the two branches arrived separately. The older view was that Celtic influence in the Isles was the result of successive migrations or invasions from the European mainland by diverse Celtic-speaking peoples over several centuries, accounting for the P-Celtic vs. Q-Celtic isogloss. This view has been challenged by the hypothesis that the islands' Celtic languages form an Insular Celtic dialect group.[130] In the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars often dated the \"arrival\" of Celtic culture in Britain (via an invasion model) to the 6th century BC, corresponding to archaeological evidence of Hallstatt influence and the appearance of chariot burials in what is now England. Cunliffe and Koch propose in their newer 'Celtic from the West' theory that Celtic languages reached the Isles earlier, with the Bell Beaker culture c.2500 BC, or even before this.[131][132] More recently, a major archaeogenetics study uncovered a migration into southern Britain in the Bronze Age from 1300 to 800 BC.[133] The newcomers were genetically most similar to ancient individuals from Gaul.[133] From 1000 BC, their genetic marker swiftly spread through southern Britain,[134] but not northern Britain.[133] The authors see this as a \"plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain\".[133] There was much less immigration during the Iron Age, so it is likely that Celtic reached Britain before then.[133] Cunliffe suggests that a branch of Celtic was already spoken in Britain, and the Bronze Age migration introduced the Brittonic branch.[135] Like many Celtic peoples on the mainland, the Insular Celts followed an Ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. Some of the southern British tribes had strong links with Gaul and Belgica, and minted their own coins. During the Roman occupation of Britain, a Romano-British culture emerged in the southeast. The Britons and Picts in the north, and the Gaels of Ireland, remained outside the empire. During the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 400s AD, there was significant Anglo-Saxon settlement of eastern and southern Britain, and some Gaelic settlement of its western coast. During this time, some Britons migrated to the Armorican peninsula, where their culture became dominant. Meanwhile, much of northern Britain (Scotland) became Gaelic. By the 10th century AD, the Insular Celtic peoples had diversified into the Brittonic-speaking Welsh (in Wales), Cornish (in Cornwall), Bretons (in Brittany) and Cumbrians (in the Old North); and the Gaelic-speaking Irish (in Ireland), Scots (in Scotland) and Manx (on the Isle of Man).[citation needed] Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Celtae or Κελτοί (Keltoi),[5][8][9] leading some scholars to question the use of the term 'Celt' for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] The first historical account of the islands was by the Greek geographer Pytheas, who sailed around what he called the \"Pretannikai nesoi\" (the \"Pretannic isles\") around 310–306 BC.[136] In general, classical writers referred to the Britons as Pretannoi (in Greek) or Britanni (in Latin).[137] Strabo, writing in Roman times, distinguished between the Celts and Britons.[138] However, Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Celts of Gaul in customs and religion.[11] Under Caesar the Romans conquered Celtic Gaul, and from Claudius onward the Roman empire absorbed parts of Britain. Roman local government of these regions closely mirrored pre-Roman tribal boundaries, and archaeological finds suggest native involvement in local government.[citation needed] The native peoples under Roman rule became Romanised and keen to adopt Roman ways. Celtic art had already incorporated classical influences, and surviving Gallo-Roman pieces interpret classical subjects or keep faith with old traditions despite a Roman overlay.[citation needed] The Roman occupation of Gaul, and to a lesser extent of Britain, led to Roman-Celtic syncretism. In the case of the continental Celts, this eventually resulted in a language shift to Vulgar Latin, while the Insular Celts retained their language.[citation needed] There was also considerable cultural influence exerted by Gaul on Rome, particularly in military matters and horsemanship, as the Gauls often served in the Roman cavalry. The Romans adopted the Celtic cavalry sword, the spatha, and Epona, the Celtic horse goddess.[139][140] To the extent that sources are available, they depict a pre-Christian Iron Age Celtic social structure based formally on class and kingship, although this may only have been a particular late phase of organisation in Celtic societies. Patron-client relationships similar to those of Roman society are also described by Caesar and others in the Gaul of the 1st century BC.[citation needed] In the main, the evidence is of tribes being led by kings, although some argue that there is also evidence of oligarchical republican forms of government eventually emerging in areas which had close contact with Rome. Most descriptions of Celtic societies portray them as being divided into three groups: a warrior aristocracy; an intellectual class including professions such as druid, poet, and jurist; and everyone else. In historical times, the offices of high and low kings in Ireland and Scotland were filled by election under the system of tanistry, which eventually came into conflict with the feudal principle of primogeniture in which succession goes to the first-born son.[citation needed] Little is known of family structure among the Celts. Patterns of settlement varied from decentralised to urban. The popular stereotype of non-urbanised societies settled in hillforts and duns,[141] drawn from Britain and Ireland (there are about 3,000 hill forts known in Britain)[142] contrasts with the urban settlements present in the core Hallstatt and La Tène areas, with the many significant oppida of Gaul late in the first millennium BC, and with the towns of Gallia Cisalpina.[citation needed] Slavery, as practised by the Celts, was very likely similar to the better documented practice in ancient Greece and Rome.[143] Slaves were acquired from war, raids, and penal and debt servitude.[143] Slavery was hereditary,[144] though manumission was possible. The Old Irish and Welsh words for 'slave', cacht and caeth respectively, are cognate with Latin captus 'captive' suggesting that the slave trade was an early means of contact between Latin and Celtic societies.[143] In the Middle Ages, slavery was especially prevalent in the Celtic countries.[145] Manumissions were discouraged by law and the word for 'female slave', cumal, was used as a general unit of value in Ireland.[146] There are only very limited records from pre-Christian times written in Celtic languages. These are mostly inscriptions in the Roman and sometimes Greek alphabets. The ogham script, an Early Medieval alphabet, was mostly used in early Christian times in Ireland and Scotland (but also in Wales and England), and was only used for ceremonial purposes such as inscriptions on gravestones. The available evidence is of a strong oral tradition, such as that preserved by bards in Ireland, and eventually recorded by monasteries. Celtic art also produced a great deal of intricate and beautiful metalwork, examples of which have been preserved by their distinctive burial rites.[147] In some regards the Atlantic Celts were conservative: for example, they still used chariots in combat long after they had been reduced to ceremonial roles by the Greeks and Romans. However, despite being outdated, Celtic chariot tactics were able to repel the invasions of Britain attempted by Julius Caesar.[148] According to Diodorus Siculus: The Gauls are tall of body with rippling muscles and white of skin and their hair is blond, and not only naturally so for they also make it their practice by artificial means to increase the distinguishing colour which nature has given it. For they are always washing their hair in limewater and they pull it back from the forehead to the nape of the neck, with the result that their appearance is like that of Satyrs and Pans since the treatment of their hair makes it so heavy and coarse that it differs in no respect from the mane of horses. Some of them shave the beard but others let it grow a little; and the nobles shave their cheeks but they let the moustache grow until it covers the mouth. During the later Iron Age the Gauls generally wore long-sleeved shirts or tunics and long trousers (called braccae by the Romans).[149] Clothes were made of wool or linen, with some silk being used by the rich. Cloaks were worn in the winter. Brooches[150] and armlets were used, but the most famous item of jewellery was the torc, a neck collar of metal, sometimes gold. The horned Waterloo Helmet in the British Museum, which long set the standard for modern images of Celtic warriors, is in fact a unique survival, and may have been a piece for ceremonial rather than military wear.[151] Archaeological evidence suggests that the pre-Roman Celtic societies were linked to the network of overland trade routes that spanned Eurasia. Archaeologists have discovered large prehistoric trackways crossing bogs in Ireland and Germany. Due to their substantial nature, these are believed to have been created for wheeled transport as part of an extensive roadway system that facilitated trade.[152] The territory held by the Celts contained tin, lead, iron, silver and gold.[153] Celtic smiths and metalworkers created weapons and jewellery for international trade, particularly with the Romans.[154] The myth that the Celtic monetary system consisted of wholly barter is a common one, but is in part false. The monetary system was complex and is still not understood (much like the late Roman coinages), and due to the absence of large numbers of coin items, it is assumed that \"proto-money\" was used. This included bronze items made from the early La Tène period and onwards, which were often in the shape of axeheads, rings, or bells. Due to the large number of these present in some burials, it is thought they had a relatively high monetary value, and could be used for \"day to day\" purchases. Low-value coinages of potin, a bronze alloy with high tin content, were minted in most Celtic areas of the continent and in South-East Britain prior to the Roman conquest of these lands. Higher-value coinages, suitable for use in trade, were minted in gold, silver, and high-quality bronze. Gold coinage was much more common than silver coinage, despite being worth substantially more, as while there were around 100 mines in Southern Britain and Central France, silver was more rarely mined. This was due partly to the relative sparsity of mines and the amount of effort needed for extraction compared to the profit gained. As the Roman civilisation grew in importance and expanded its trade with the Celtic world, silver and bronze coinage became more common. This coincided with a major increase in gold production in Celtic areas to meet the Roman demand, due to the high value Romans put on the metal. The large number of gold mines in France is thought to be a major reason why Caesar invaded.[155] Very few reliable sources exist regarding Celtic views on gender roles, though some archaeological evidence suggests their views may have differed from those of the Greco-Roman world, which tended to be less egalitarian.[156][157] Some Iron Age burials in northeastern Gaul suggest women may have had roles in warfare during the earlier La Tène period, but the evidence is far from conclusive.[158] Celtic individuals buried with both female jewellery and weaponry have been found, such as the Vix Grave in northeastern Gaul, and there are questions about the gender of some individuals buried with weaponry. However, it has been suggested that the weapons indicate high social rank rather than masculinity.[159] Most written accounts of the Ancient Celts are from the Romans and Greeks, though it is not clear how accurate these are. Roman historians Ammianus Marcellinus and Tacitus mentioned Celtic women inciting, participating in, and leading battles.[160] Plutarch reports that Celtic women acted as ambassadors to avoid a war among Celtic chiefdoms in the Po valley during the 4th century BC.[161] Posidonius' anthropological comments on the Celts had common themes, primarily primitivism, extreme ferocity, cruel sacrificial practices, and the strength and courage of their women.[162] Cassius Dio suggests there was great sexual freedom among women in Celtic Britain:[163] ... a very witty remark is reported to have been made by the wife of Argentocoxus, a Caledonian, to Julia Augusta. When the empress was jesting with her, after the treaty, about the free intercourse of her sex with men in Britain, she replied: \"We fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way than do you Roman women; for we consort openly with the best men, whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest\". Such was the retort of the British woman. Barry Cunliffe writes that such references are \"likely to be ill-observed\" and meant to portray the Celts as outlandish \"barbarians\".[164] Historian Lisa Bitel argues the descriptions of Celtic women warriors are not credible. She says some Roman and Greek writers wanted to show that the barbarian Celts lived in \"an upside-down world ... and a standard ingredient in such a world was the manly warrior woman\".[165] The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote in his Politics that the Celts of southeastern Europe approved of male homosexuality. Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote in his Bibliotheca historica that although Gaulish women were beautiful, the men had \"little to do with them\" and it was a custom for men to sleep on animal skins with two younger males. He further claimed that \"the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused\". His claim was later repeated by Greco-Roman writers Athenaeus and Ammianus.[166] H. David Rankin, in Celts and the Classical World, suggests some of these claims refer to bonding rituals in warrior groups, which required abstinence from women at certain times,[167] and says it probably reflects \"the warlike character of early contacts between the Celts and the Greeks\".[168] Under Brehon Law, which was written down in early Medieval Ireland after conversion to Christianity, a woman had the right to divorce her husband and gain his property if he was unable to perform his marital duties due to impotence, obesity, homosexual inclination or preference for other women.[169][170][failed verification] Celtic art is generally used by art historians to refer to art of the La Tène period across Europe, while the Early Medieval art of Britain and Ireland, that is what \"Celtic art\" evokes for much of the general public, is called Insular art in art history. Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence. Energetic circular forms, triskeles and spirals are characteristic. Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from Pictish stones and the Insular high crosses, large monumental sculpture, even with decorative carving, is very rare; possibly it was originally common in wood. Celts were also able to create developed musical instruments such as the carnyces, these famous war trumpets used before the battle to frighten the enemy, as the best preserved found in Tintignac (Gaul) in 2004 and which were decorated with a boar head or a snake head.[171] The interlace patterns that are often regarded as typical of \"Celtic art\" were characteristic of the whole of the British Isles, a style referred to as Insular art, or Hiberno-Saxon art. This artistic style incorporated elements of La Tène, Late Roman, and, most importantly, animal Style II of Germanic Migration Period art. The style was taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and illuminated manuscripts. Equally, the forms used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: Gospel books like the Book of Kells and Book of Lindisfarne, chalices like the Ardagh Chalice and Derrynaflan Chalice, and penannular brooches like the Tara Brooch and Roscrea Brooch. These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the Viking attacks sharply set back cultural life.[citation needed] In contrast the less well known but often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other \"foreign\" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic. After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially Ancient Roman pottery, of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including figurines of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalised styles. Roman Britain also took more interest in enamel than most of the Empire, and its development of champlevé technique was probably important to the later Medieval art of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom of Insular decoration was an important element. Rising nationalism brought Celtic revivals from the 19th century.[citation needed] The Coligny calendar, which was found in 1897 in Coligny, Ain, was engraved on a bronze tablet, preserved in 73 fragments, that originally was 1.48 metres (4 feet 10 inches) wide and 0.9 metres (2 feet 11 inches) high (Lambert p. 111). Based on the style of lettering and the accompanying objects, it probably dates to the end of the 2nd century.[172] It is written in Latin inscriptional capitals, and is in Gaulish. The restored tablet contains 16 vertical columns, with 62 months distributed over 5 years.[citation needed] French archaeologist J. Monard speculated that it was recorded by druids wishing to preserve their tradition of timekeeping in a time when the Julian calendar was imposed throughout the Roman Empire. However, the general form of the calendar suggests the public peg calendars (or parapegmata) found throughout the Greek and Roman world.[173] Tribal warfare appears to have been a regular feature of Celtic societies. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for economic advantage, and in some instances to conquer territory.[citation needed] The Celts were described by classical writers such as Strabo, Livy, Pausanias, and Florus as fighting like \"wild beasts\", and as hordes. Dionysius said that their:[174] [175] manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in military science. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of wild boars, throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target, as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all. Polybius (2.33) indicates that the principal Celtic weapon was a long bladed sword which was used for hacking edgewise rather than stabbing. Celtic warriors are described by Polybius and Plutarch as frequently having to cease fighting in order to straighten their sword blades. This claim has been questioned by some archaeologists, who note that Noric steel, steel produced in Celtic Noricum, was famous in the Roman Empire period and was used to equip the Roman military.[176][177] However, Radomir Pleiner, in The Celtic Sword (1993) argues that \"the metallographic evidence shows that Polybius was right up to a point\", as around one third of surviving swords from the period might well have behaved as he describes.[178] In addition to these long bladed slashing swords, spears and specialized javelins were also used.[179] Polybius also asserts that certain of the Celts fought naked: \"The appearance of these naked warriors was a terrifying spectacle, for they were all men of splendid physique and in the prime of life.\"[180] According to Livy, this was also true of the Celts of Asia Minor.[181] Celts had a reputation as head hunters.[182] Paul Jacobsthal says: \"Amongst the Celts the human head was venerated above all else, since the head was to the Celt the soul, centre of the emotions as well as of life itself, a symbol of divinity and of the powers of the other-world.\"[183] Writing in the first century BC, Greek historians Posidonius and Diodorus Siculus said Celtic warriors cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle, hung them from the necks of their horses, then nailed them up outside their homes.[182] Strabo wrote in the same century that Celts embalmed the heads of their most esteemed enemies in cedar oil and put them on display.[182] Roman historian Livy wrote that the Boii beheaded a defeated Roman general after the Battle of Silva Litana, covered his skull in gold, and used it as a ritual cup.[182] Archaeologists have found evidence that heads were embalmed and displayed by the southern Gauls.[184][185] In another example, at the southern Gaulish site of Entremont, there stood a pillar carved with skulls, within which were niches where human skulls were kept, nailed into position.[186] Roquepertuse nearby has similar carved heads and skull niches. Many lone carved heads have been found in Celtic regions, some with two or three faces.[187] Examples include the Mšecké Žehrovice Head and the Corleck Head. Severed heads are a common motif in Insular Celtic myths, and there are many tales in which 'living heads' preside over feasts or speak prophecies.[182][187] The beheading game is a motif in Irish myth and Arthurian legend, most famously in the tale Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, where the Green Knight picks up his own severed head after Gawain has struck it off. There are also many legends in Celtic regions of saints who carry their own severed heads. In Irish myth, the severed heads of warriors are called the mast or nuts of the goddess Macha.[188] Like other European Iron Age societies, the Celts practised a polytheistic religion and believed in an afterlife.[189][190][unreliable source] Celtic religion varied by region and over time, but had \"broad structural similarities\",[189] and there was \"a basic religious homogeneity\" among the Celtic peoples.[191] Because the ancient Celts did not have writing, evidence about their religion is gleaned from archaeology, Greco-Roman accounts, and literature from the early Christian period.[192] The names of over two hundred Celtic deities have survived (see list of Celtic deities), although it is likely that many of these were alternative names, regional names or titles for the same deity.[189] Some deities were venerated only in one region, but others were more widely known.[189] According to Miranda Aldhouse-Green, the Celts were also animists, believing that every part of the natural world had a spirit.[192] The Celts seem to have had a father god, who was often a god of the tribe and of the dead (Toutatis probably being one name for him); and a mother goddess who was associated with the land, earth and fertility[193] (Dea Matrona probably being one name for her). The mother goddess could also take the form of a war goddess as protectress of her tribe and its land.[193] There also seems to have been a male celestial god—identified with Taranis—associated with thunder, the wheel, and the bull.[193] There were gods of skill and craft, such as the pan-regional god Lugus, and the smith god Gobannos.[193] Celtic healing deities were often associated with sacred springs,[193] such as Sirona and Borvo. Other pan-regional deities include the horned god Cernunnos, the horse and fertility goddess Epona, the divine son Maponos, as well as Belenos, Ogmios, and Sucellos.[189][192] Caesar says the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[189] Triplicity is a common theme in Celtic cosmology, and a number of deities were seen as threefold,[194] for example the Three Mothers.[195] Celtic religious ceremonies were overseen by priests known as druids, who also served as judges, teachers, and lore-keepers. Other classes of druids performed sacrifices for the perceived benefit of the community.[196] There is evidence that ancient Celtic peoples sacrificed animals, almost always livestock or working animals. It appears some were offered wholly to the gods (by burying or burning), while some were shared between gods and humans (part eaten and part offered).[197] There is also some evidence that ancient Celts sacrificed humans, and some Greco-Roman sources claim the Gauls sacrificed criminals by burning them in a wicker man.[198] The Romans said the Celts held ceremonies in sacred groves and other natural shrines, called nemetons.[189] Some Celtic peoples built temples or ritual enclosures of varying shapes (such as the Romano-Celtic temple and viereckschanze), though they also maintained shrines at natural sites.[189] Celtic peoples often made votive offerings: treasured items deposited in water and wetlands, or in ritual shafts and wells, often in the same place over generations.[189] Modern clootie wells might be a continuation of this.[199] Most surviving Celtic mythology belongs to the Insular Celtic peoples: Irish mythology has the largest written body of myths, followed by Welsh mythology. These were written down in the early Middle Ages, mainly by Christian scribes. The supernatural race called the Tuatha Dé Danann are believed to represent the main Celtic gods of Ireland. Their traditional rivals are the Fomóire, whom they defeat in the Battle of Mag Tuired.[200] Barry Cunliffe says the underlying structure in Irish myth was a dualism between the male tribal god and the female goddess of the land.[189] The Dagda seems to have been the chief god and the Morrígan his consort, each of whom had other names.[189] One common motif is the sovereignty goddess, who represents the land and bestows sovereignty on a king by marrying him. The goddess Brigid was linked with nature as well as poetry, healing and smithing.[194] Some figures in medieval Insular Celtic myth have ancient continental parallels: Irish Lugh and Welsh Lleu are cognate with Lugus, Goibniu and Gofannon with Gobannos, Macán and Mabon with Maponos, while Macha and Rhiannon may be counterparts of Epona.[201] In Insular Celtic myth, the Otherworld is a parallel realm where the gods dwell. Some mythical heroes visit it by entering ancient burial mounds or caves, by going under water or across the western sea, or after being offered a silver apple branch by an Otherworld resident.[202] Irish myth says that the spirits of the dead travel to the house of Donn (Tech Duinn), a legendary ancestor; this echoes Caesar's comment that the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[189] Insular Celtic peoples celebrated four seasonal festivals, known to the Gaels as Beltaine (1 May), Lughnasa (1 August), Samhain (1 November) and Imbolc (1 February).[189] The Roman invasion of Gaul brought a great deal of Celtic peoples into the Roman Empire. Roman culture had a profound effect on the Celtic tribes which came under the empire's control. Roman influence led to many changes in Celtic religion, the most noticeable of which was the weakening of the druid class, especially religiously; the druids were to eventually disappear altogether. Romano-Celtic deities also began to appear: these deities often had both Roman and Celtic attributes, combined the names of Roman and Celtic deities, or included couples with one Roman and one Celtic deity. Other changes included the adaptation of the Jupiter Column, a sacred column set up in many Celtic regions of the empire, primarily in northern and eastern Gaul. Another major change in religious practice was the use of stone monuments to represent gods and goddesses. The Celts had probably only created wooden cult images (including monuments carved into trees, which were known as sacred poles) before the Roman conquest.[195] While the regions under Roman rule adopted Christianity along with the rest of the Roman empire, unconquered areas of Ireland and Scotland began to move from Celtic polytheism to Christianity in the 5th century. Ireland was converted by missionaries from Britain, such as Saint Patrick. Later missionaries from Ireland were a major source of missionary work in Scotland, Anglo-Saxon parts of Britain, and central Europe (see Hiberno-Scottish mission). Celtic Christianity, the forms of Christianity that took hold in Britain and Ireland at this time, had for some centuries only limited and intermittent contact with Rome and continental Christianity, as well as some contacts with Coptic Christianity. Some elements of Celtic Christianity developed, or retained, features that made them distinct from the rest of Western Christianity, most famously their conservative method of calculating the date of Easter. In 664, the Synod of Whitby began to resolve these differences, mostly by adopting the current Roman practices, which the Gregorian Mission from Rome had introduced to Anglo-Saxon England.[citation needed] Genetic studies on the limited amount of material available suggest continuity between Iron Age people from areas considered Celtic and the earlier Bell Beaker culture of Bronze Age Western Europe.[206][207][208] Like the Bell Beakers, ancient Celts carried a substantial amount of Western Steppe Herders ancestry, which is derived from Yamnaya pastoralists who expanded westwards from the Pontic–Caspian steppe during the late Neolithic and the early Bronze Age and associated with the initial spread of Indo-European languages.[209] This ancestry was particularly prevalent among Celts of Northwest Europe.[208] Examined individuals overwhelmingly carry types of the paternal haplogroup R-M269,[203][204][205] while the maternal haplogroups H and U are frequent.[210][211] These lineages are associated with steppe ancestry.[203][210] The spread of Celts into Iberia and the emergence of the Celtiberians is associated with an increase in north-central European ancestry in Iberia, and may be connected to the expansion of the Urnfield culture.[212] The paternal haplogroup haplogroup I2a1a1a has been detected among Celtiberians.[213] There appears to have been significant gene flow among Celtic peoples of Western Europe during the Iron Age.[214][208] While the Gauls of southern France display genetic links with the Celtiberians, the Gauls of northern France display links with Great Britain and Sweden.[215] Modern populations of Western Europe, particularly those who still speak Celtic languages, display substantial genetic continuity with the Iron Age populations of the same areas.[216][217][218] Geography Organisations",

                "title": "Pronunciation of Celtic: Why are there two ways? | Merriam-Webster",
                "content": "Celtic refers to Irish culture and heritage, along with the historical people who migrated from the British Isles throughout much of Europe. While the early pronunciation was with an /s/ sound, reflecting its nearest origin in French, the modern standard is a hard \"c\" sound like /k/. This is because language historians desired the word to better reflect its Greek and Classical Latin origins. The soft \"c\" sound is usually reserved for sports teams now, like the Boston Celtics. Be it in the pub or in the halls of academia, whenever the topic of Irish culture, language, music, literature—basically, anything Irish—is brought up, the words Celt and Celtic are bound to be heard. In modern-day English, those words are commonly used in reference to the Irish people and their widely-accepted traditions (of course everybody is Irish on St. Patrick's Day; the Celtic cross or knot is a popular tattoo; the Claddagh ring makes a nice gift). The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The etymology of the noun Celt—from which the adjective Celtic is derived—is straightforward. It's a 16th-century borrowing of the French word Celte, which itself is from Latin Celta, the singular of Celtae, which is the name for a member of an early Indo-European people from antiquity who spread over much of Europe from the British Isles and Spain to Asia Minor. The Latin name is derived from Greek Keltoi, and both the Latin and Greek words referred to the Gauls, the Celtic people who occupied the region that is now France and Belgium. See? Straightforward. With that history laid out, we're wondering how you pronounced all the capital 'c' and 'k' words, especially if you're unfamiliar with French, Latin, Greek, and even English Celt and Celtic, for that matter. The question: is the 'c' sounded \\s\\ or \\k\\? Following its French and Latin predecessors, early pronunciation of Celt was actually \\SELT\\. (In French and Latin, the 'c' is pronounced \\s\\, as in the last name of the French painter Paul Cézanne and in Latin century.) The pronunciation \\KELT\\ started being heard as early as the 18th century, which, in time, ushered in the variant spelling Kelt. The variants were introduced by language and history academics who believed that the pronunciation of Celt should reflect the initial \\k\\ sound in the ancient Greek Keltoi and the Classical Latin Celtae. (It wasn't until the Middle Ages that the letter 'c' in Latin began being pronounced before vowels as the combination \\ts\\—prior, it was pronounced \\k\\; English speakers subsequently reduced the Latin 'c' to a simple \\s\\.) Outside of academia, the variant Kelt never caught on, and it is rarely if ever used today; however, the \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic has since flourished. Another influence on pronouncing Celt and Celtic with a soft 'c' is English's phonetic rule for 'c' when followed by 'e' (or 'i,' as in circus or Cicero), which says that, in such cases, the 'c' is usually pronounced as \\s\\. Think cell, cereal, ceiling, and dance. Nevertheless, English speakers, especially those who wanted to sound knowledgeable about things Celtic, grew to prefer the hard 'c' pronunciation, which harkened back to the words' ancient roots. From the 18th century onward, more and more people began sounding the words with an initial \\k\\. By the mid-20th century, \\k\\ became the norm, which is fitting since the pronunciation is in line with that of the Celtic family of languages that include Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Breton, and the now-extinct (or, depending on who you talk to, nearly extinct) languages Manx and Cornish. Apparently, people appreciated the ethnic pronunciation. This shift in the pronunciation of Celt is fully evinced when comparing H. W. Fowler's 1926 Dictionary of Modern English with Robert Burchfield's 1996 revised edition. Here's what Fowler had to say about Celt(ic): \"The spelling C-, & the pronunciation s-, are the established ones, & no useful purpose seems to be served by the substitution of k-.\" Decades later, Burchfield observes a different trend: \"Except for the football club Celtic (in Glasgow), which is pronounced [SEL-tik], both Celt and Celtic are pronounced with initial \\k\\ in standard English.\" Burchfield is referring to the Scottish Celtic Football Club, founded in 1887. In America, there is basketball's Boston Celtics, founded in 1946, whose name is also pronounced with an initial \\s\\. The European away support that Celtic enjoys is phenomenal. Few clubs have a fanbase that travels in such numbers or makes as much noise, all the more remarkable when you consider the poor record that the club has away from home in recent times.— Liam Kelly, The Celtic Star, 20 Feb. 2020 Aside from this use of the initial soft 'c' in sports teams' names, Celtic with a hard 'c' is the standard; however, you might still sometimes hear the 'c' softly sounded by those who are uninitiated in the history and etymology of Celt and Celtic as well as those who are unfamiliar with the words and resort to the phonetic rules of English. (And, as happens so often in English, those phonetic rules let them down.) See Definitions and Examples » Get Word of the Day daily email! Learn a new word every day.

Whether you’re sad it’s over or happy to say “sayonara” to 2024, chances are good that you may have a few errands, returns or after-Christmas shopping to cross off your to-do list this New Year’s. Or perhaps you've got a gift card burning a hole in your wallet or simply need to stock on groceries or other essentials before returning to work. Regardless, you may be wondering what Walmart’s New Year’s hours are this year. Given the holidays are a seriously busy time, it can be difficult to keep up with various stores' open and close times since so many of them have special or adjusted hours throughout the season. Unsurprisingly, many retailers have modified hours on New Year's Eve or are closed on New Year’s Day given that it’s a federal holiday. If you’re curious which stores are open on New Year’s (and which ones are closed) we’ve got a full list for you to check out right here. But what about Walmart? Fortunately, TODAY.com spoke to a Walmart spokesperson to get all the details, and here’s what you need to know about Walmart’s New Year’s Eve and New Year's Day hours to help start the new year off on the right foot. New Year’s Eve falls on Tuesday, Dec. 31, this year. In the final hours of 2024, Walmart will be open for business as usual on New Year's Eve during normal hours. So, if you need last-minute ingredients for your New Year’s cocktails or toothpicks for appetizers, you'll have plenty of time to pick up everything you need. As always, since hours may vary from store to store, confirm your local store hours before heading out the door. Walmart was closed on both Thanksgiving and Christmas this year to allow their employees to enjoy a day off. But what about New Year’s Day 2025? While some other major retailers like Costco and Aldi will be closed in observance of the holiday, Walmart will be open. According to a spokesperson, “All stores will operate during normal business hours.” However, since different store locations have varying open and close times, you should definitely take a minute to confirm your local store hours before heading out the door. To make it easy, find a Walmart near you using the store locator, which we’ve conveniently added right here. Sarah Lemire is a lifestyle and entertainment reporter for TODAY based in New York City.

                "title": "Brad Pitt - Wikipedia",
                "content": "William Bradley Pitt (born December 18, 1963) is an American actor and film producer. He is the recipient of various accolades, including two Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award. One of the most influential celebrities, Pitt appeared on Forbes' annual Celebrity 100 list from 2006 to 2008, and the Time 100 list in 2007. Pitt first gained recognition as a cowboy hitchhiker in the Ridley Scott road film Thelma & Louise (1991). Pitt emerged as a star taking on leading man roles in films such as the drama A River Runs Through It (1992), the western Legends of the Fall (1994), the horror film Interview with the Vampire (1994), and the crime thriller Seven (1995). Pitt found greater commercial success starring in Steven Soderbergh's heist film Ocean's Eleven (2001), and reprised his role in its sequels. He cemented his leading man status starring in blockbusters such as the historical epic Troy (2004), the romantic crime film Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), the horror film World War Z (2013), and the action film Bullet Train (2022). Pitt won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for playing a stuntman in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019). He was Oscar-nominated for his roles in the science fiction drama 12 Monkeys (1995), the fantasy romance The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and the sports drama Moneyball (2011). He also starred in acclaimed films such as Fight Club (1999), Babel (2006), The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), Burn After Reading (2008), Inglourious Basterds (2009), The Tree of Life (2011), and The Big Short (2015). In 2001, Pitt co-founded the production company Plan B Entertainment.[3] As a producer he won the Academy Award for Best Picture for 12 Years a Slave (2013) and was nominated for Moneyball (2011) and The Big Short (2015). Pitt was named People's Sexiest Man Alive in 1995 and 2000. William Bradley Pitt was born on December 18, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to William Alvin Pitt, the proprietor of a trucking company, and Jane Etta (née Hillhouse), a school counselor.[4] The family soon moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he lived together with his younger siblings, Douglas Pitt (b. 1966) and Julie (née Pitt) Neal (b. 1969).[5] Born into a conservative Christian household,[6][7] he was raised as Southern Baptist and later \"oscillate[d] between agnosticism and atheism.\"[8] He later reconciled his belief in spirituality.[9] Pitt has described Springfield as \"Mark Twain country, Jesse James country,\" having grown up with \"a lot of hills, a lot of lakes.\"[10] Pitt attended Kickapoo High School, where he was a member of the golf, swimming, and tennis teams.[11] He participated in the school's Key and Forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals.[12] Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising.[13] As graduation approached, Pitt did not feel ready to settle down. He loved films—\"a portal into different worlds for me\"—and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided to go to where they were made.[14][15] Two weeks short of completing the coursework for a degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs.[14] He has named Gary Oldman, Sean Penn, and Mickey Rourke as his early acting heroes.[16] While struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles, Pitt took lessons from acting coach Roy London.[12][17] His acting career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films No Way Out (1987), No Man's Land (1987) and Less than Zero (1987).[12][18] In May 1987, he made his television debut in a two-episode role on the NBC soap opera Another World.[19] In November of the same year, Pitt had a guest appearance on the CBS sitcom Trial and Error[20][21] and the ABC sitcom Growing Pains.[22] He appeared in four episodes of the CBS primetime series Dallas between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy, the boyfriend of Jenna Wade's daughter Charlotte (played by Shalane McCall).[23] Later in 1988, Pitt made a guest appearance on the Fox police drama 21 Jump Street.[24] In the same year, the Yugoslavian–U.S. co-production The Dark Side of the Sun (1988) was his first leading film role, starring as a young American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition. The film was shelved at the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997.[12] Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy Happy Together; the second a featured role in the horror film Cutting Class, the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters.[22] He made guest appearances on television series Head of the Class, Freddy's Nightmares, Thirtysomething, and (for a second time) Growing Pains.[25] Pitt was cast as Billy Canton, a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway (played by Juliette Lewis) in the 1990 NBC television movie Too Young to Die?, the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"Pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp, he's really scary.\"[26] The same year, Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama Glory Days and took a supporting role in the HBO television film The Image.[27] His next appearance came in the 1991 film Across the Tracks; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by Rick Schroder.[28] The same year he featured in a Levi's jeans TV commercial based around the song \"20th Century Boy\" which played in the background.[29] After years of supporting roles in film and frequent television guest appearances, Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in Ridley Scott's 1991 road film Thelma & Louise.[27] He played J.D., a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma (Geena Davis). His love scene with Davis has been cited as the event that defined Pitt as a sex symbol.[22][30] After Thelma & Louise, Pitt starred in the 1991 film Johnny Suede, a low-budget picture about an aspiring rock star,[31] and the 1992 live-action/animated fantasy film Cool World,[22] although neither furthered his career, having poor reviews and box office performance.[32][33] Pitt took on the role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film A River Runs Through It, directed by Robert Redford.[34] His portrayal of the character was described by People's Janet Mock as a career-making performance,[35] proving that Pitt could be more than a \"cowboy-hatted hunk.\"[36] He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film[5] and thought it was one of his \"weakest performances ... It's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for.\"[5] Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew. He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying \"when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better.\"[35][36] In 1993, Pitt reunited with Juliette Lewis for the road film Kalifornia. He played Early Grayce, a serial killer and the abusive husband of Lewis' character, in a performance described by Peter Travers of Rolling Stone as \"outstanding, all boyish charm and then a snort that exudes pure menace.\"[37] Pitt also garnered attention for a brief appearance in the cult hit True Romance as a stoner named Floyd, providing comic relief to the action film.[38] He capped the year by winning a ShoWest Award for Male Star of Tomorrow.[39] In 1994, Pitt portrayed the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac in the horror film Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles, based on Anne Rice's 1976 novel of the same name.[40] He was part of an ensemble cast that included Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Slater, and Antonio Banderas.[40] Despite his winning two MTV Movie Awards at the 1995 ceremony,[41] his performance was poorly received. According to the Dallas Observer, \"Brad Pitt [...] is a large part of the problem [in the film]. When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy side [...] he's a joy to watch. But there's nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring Louis.\"[42] Following the release of Interview with the Vampire, Pitt starred in Legends of the Fall (1994),[43] based on a novel by the same name by Jim Harrison, set in the American West during the first four decades of the twentieth century. Portraying Tristan Ludlow, son of Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) a Cornish immigrant,[44] Pitt received his first Golden Globe Award nomination, in the Best Actor category.[45] Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas co-starred as Pitt's brothers. Although the film's reception was mixed,[46] many film critics praised Pitt's performance. Janet Maslin of The New York Times said, \"Pitt's diffident mix of acting and attitude works to such heartthrob perfection it's a shame the film's superficiality gets in his way.\"[47] The Deseret News predicted that Legends of the Fall would solidify Pitt's reputation as a lead actor.[48] In 1995, Pitt starred alongside Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey in the crime thriller Seven, playing a detective on the trail of a serial killer who preys on people he considers guilty of the Seven Deadly Sins.[49] Pitt called it a great movie and declared the part would expand his acting horizons.[50] He expressed his intent to move on from \"this 'pretty boy' thing [...] and play someone with flaws.\"[51] His performance was critically well received, with Variety saying that it was screen acting at its best, further remarking on Pitt's ability to turn in a \"determined, energetic, creditable job\" as the detective.[52] Seven earned $327 million at the international box office.[32] Following the success of Seven, Pitt played psychotic anarchist Jeffrey Goines in Terry Gilliam's 1995 science fiction film 12 Monkeys. The movie received predominantly positive reviews, with Pitt praised in particular. Janet Maslin of The New York Times called Twelve Monkeys \"fierce and disturbing\" and remarked on Pitt's \"startlingly frenzied performance\", concluding that he \"electrifies Jeffrey with a weird magnetism that becomes important later in the film.\"[53] He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film[45] and received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.[54] The following year, he appeared in the legal drama Sleepers (1996), based on Lorenzo Carcaterra's novel of the same name.[55] The film received mixed reviews.[56] In the 1997 film The Devil's Own Pitt starred, opposite Harrison Ford, as Irish Republican Army terrorist Rory Devany,[57] a role for which he was required to learn an Irish accent.[58] Critical opinion was divided on his accent; \"Pitt finds the right tone of moral ambiguity, but at times his Irish brogue is too convincing – it's hard to understand what he's saying\", wrote the San Francisco Chronicle.[59] The Charleston Gazette opined that it had favored Pitt's accent over the movie.[60] The Devil's Own grossed $140 million worldwide.[32] Later that year, he led as Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer in the Jean-Jacques Annaud film Seven Years in Tibet.[61] Pitt trained for months for the role, which demanded significant mountain climbing and trekking practice, including rock climbing in California and the European Alps with his co-star David Thewlis.[62] Pitt had the lead role in 1998's fantasy romance film Meet Joe Black. He portrayed a personification of death inhabiting the body of a young man to learn what it is like to be human.[63] The film received mixed reviews, and many were critical of Pitt's performance. According to Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, Pitt was unable to \"make an audience believe that he knows all the mysteries of death and eternity.\"[64] Roger Ebert remarked, \"Pitt is a fine actor, but this performance is a miscalculation.\"[65] In 1999, Pitt portrayed Tyler Durden in Fight Club,[66][67] a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, directed by David Fincher.[68] Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling.[69] To look the part, Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended.[70] While promoting Fight Club, Pitt said that the film explored not taking one's aggressions out on someone else but to \"have an experience, take a punch more and see how you come out on the other end.\"[71] Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival.[72] Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole,[73][74] Pitt's performance was widely praised. Paul Clinton of CNN noted the risky yet successful nature of the film,[75] while Variety remarked upon Pitt's ability to be \"cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than [...] his breakthrough role in Thelma and Louise\".[76] In spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, Fight Club became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000.[77] Pitt was cast as an Irish Traveller boxer with a barely intelligible accent in Guy Ritchie's 2000 gangster film Snatch.[78] Several reviewers were critical of Snatch; however, most praised Pitt.[79] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said Pitt was \"ideally cast as an Irishman whose accent is so thick even Brits can't understand him\", going on to say that, before Snatch, Pitt had been \"shackled by roles that called for brooding introspection, but recently he has found his calling in black comic outrageousness and flashy extroversion;\"[80] while Amy Taubin of The Village Voice claimed that \"Pitt gets maximum comic mileage out of a one-joke role\".[81] The following year Pitt starred opposite Julia Roberts in the romantic comedy The Mexican,[82] a film that garnered a range of reviews[83] but enjoyed box office success.[32] Pitt's next role, in 2001's $143 million-grossing Cold War thriller Spy Game,[32] was as Tom Bishop, an operative of the CIA's Special Activities Division, mentored by Robert Redford's character.[84] Mark Holcomb of Salon.com enjoyed the film, although he noted that neither Pitt nor Redford provided \"much of an emotional connection for the audience\".[85] On November 22, 2001, Pitt made a guest appearance in the eighth season of the television series Friends, playing a man with a grudge against Rachel Green, played by Jennifer Aniston, to whom Pitt was married at the time.[86] For this performance he was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.[87] In December 2001, Pitt played Rusty Ryan in the heist film Ocean's Eleven, a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack original. He joined an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy García, and Julia Roberts.[88] Well received by critics, Ocean's Eleven was highly successful at the box office, earning $450 million worldwide.[32] Pitt appeared in two episodes of MTV's reality series Jackass in February 2002, first running through the streets of Los Angeles with several cast members in gorilla suits,[89] and in a subsequent episode participating in his own staged abduction.[90] In the same year, Pitt had a cameo role in George Clooney's directorial debut Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.[91] He took on his first voice-acting roles in 2003, speaking as the titular character of the DreamWorks animated film Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas[92] and playing Boomhauer's brother, Patch, in an episode of the animated television series King of the Hill.[93] Pitt had two major film roles in 2004, starring as Achilles in Troy, and reprising his role, Rusty Ryan, in the sequel Ocean's Twelve. He spent six months sword training before the filming of Troy, based on the Iliad.[94] An on-set injury to his Achilles tendon delayed production on the picture for several weeks.[95] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post stated that Pitt excelled at such a demanding role.[96] Troy was the first film produced by Plan B Entertainment, a film production company he had founded two years earlier with Jennifer Aniston and Brad Grey, CEO of Paramount Pictures.[97] Ocean's Twelve earned $362 million worldwide,[32] and Pitt and Clooney's dynamic was described by CNN's Paul Clinton as \"the best male chemistry since Paul Newman and Robert Redford.\"[98] In 2005, Pitt starred as John Smith in the Doug Liman-directed action comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which a bored married couple discover that each is an assassin sent to kill the other. The feature received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who played his character's wife Jane Smith. The Star Tribune noted that \"while the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry\".[99] Mr. & Mrs. Smith earned $478 million worldwide, making it one of the biggest hits of 2005.[100] For his next film, Pitt starred opposite Cate Blanchett in Alejandro González Iñárritu's multi-narrative drama Babel (2006).[101] Pitt's performance was critically well-received, and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said that he was credible and gave the film visibility.[102] Pitt later said he regarded taking the part as one of the best decisions of his career.[103] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival[104] and was later featured at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.[105] Babel received seven Academy and Golden Globe award nominations, winning the Best Drama Golden Globe, and earned Pitt a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe.[45] That same year, Pitt's company Plan B Entertainment produced The Departed, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Pitt was credited on-screen as a producer; however, only Graham King was ruled eligible for the Oscar win.[106] Reprising his role as Rusty Ryan in a third picture, Pitt starred in 2007's Ocean's Thirteen.[107] While less lucrative than the first two films, this sequel earned $311 million at the international box office.[32] Pitt's next film role was as American outlaw Jesse James in the 2007 Western drama The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, adapted from Ron Hansen's 1983 novel of the same name.[108] Directed by Andrew Dominik and produced by Pitt's company Plan B Entertainment, the film premiered at the 2007 Venice Film Festival,[109] with Pitt playing a \"scary and charismatic\" role, according to Lewis Beale of Film Journal International,[110] and earning Pitt the Volpi Cup award for Best Actor at the 64th Venice International Film Festival.[111] He eventually collected the award one year later at the 2008 festival.[112] As of January 2019, it was his own favorite of his films.[113] Pitt's next appearance was in the 2008 black comedy Burn After Reading, his first collaboration with the Coen brothers. The film received a positive reception from critics, with The Guardian calling it \"a tightly wound, slickly plotted spy comedy\",[114] noting that Pitt's performance was one of the funniest.[114] He was later cast as Benjamin Button, the lead in David Fincher's 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, a loosely adapted version of a 1921 short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The story follows a man who is born an octogenarian and ages in reverse,[115] with Pitt's \"sensitive\" performance making Benjamin Button a \"timeless masterpiece\", according to Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun.[116] The performance earned Pitt his first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination,[117] as well as a fourth Golden Globe and second Academy Award nomination,[45] all in the category for Best Actor. The film received thirteen Academy Award nominations, and grossed $329 million at the box office worldwide.[32] Pitt's next leading role came in 2009 with the Quentin Tarantino-directed war film Inglourious Basterds, which premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.[118] Pitt played Lieutenant Aldo Raine, an American resistance fighter battling Nazis in German-occupied France.[119] The film was a box office hit, taking $311 million worldwide,[32] and garnered generally favorable reviews.[120] The film received multiple awards and nominations, including eight Academy Award nominations and seven MTV Movie Award nominations, including Best Male Performance for Pitt.[121][122] He next voiced the superhero character Metro Man in the 2010 animated feature Megamind.[123] Pitt produced and appeared in Terrence Malick's experimental drama The Tree of Life, co-starring Sean Penn, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.[124] In a performance that attracted strong praise, he portrayed the Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane in the drama Moneyball, which is based on the 2003 book of the same name written by Michael Lewis.[125] Moneyball received six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Actor for Pitt.[126] His next role was as mob hitman Jackie Cogan in Andrew Dominik's 2012 Killing Them Softly, based on the novel Cogan's Trade by George V. Higgins.[127] In 2013, Pitt starred in World War Z, a thriller about a zombie apocalypse, based on Max Brooks's novel of the same name. Pitt also produced the film.[128] World War Z grossed $540 million at the box office worldwide,[32] becoming Pitt's highest grossing picture.[129] Next in 2013, he produced, and played a small role in, 12 Years a Slave, a historical drama based on the autobiography of Solomon Northup.[130] The film received critical acclaim[131] and was nominated for nine Academy Awards, winning three, including Best Picture.[132] Also in 2013, Pitt had a supporting role in Ridley Scott's The Counselor.[133] Plan B Entertainment landed its first television series on the 2013–2014 schedule, as their joint venture with ABC Studios, the sci-fi/fantasy drama Resurrection, was picked up by ABC.[134] Pitt starred in Fury, a World War II film directed and written by David Ayer, and co-starring Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, Michael Peña, and Jason Isaacs.[135][136][137] The film was released on October 17, 2014.[135] By the end of its run, Fury proved to be a commercial and critical success; it grossed more than $211 million worldwide[32] and received highly positive reviews from critics.[138] In 2015, Pitt starred opposite his wife, Jolie, in her third directorial effort, By the Sea, a romantic drama about a marriage in crisis, based on her screenplay. The film was their first collaboration since 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Pitt's next role came with the biographical comedy-drama The Big Short, which he also produced and also co-starred alongside Christian Bale, Steve Carell, and Ryan Gosling. The film was a commercial and critical success. It went on to gross over $102 million worldwide[139] and received positive reviews from critics.[140][141] The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, earning Pitt his third Academy Award nomination as producer. In 2016, Pitt starred in Robert Zemeckis's romantic thriller Allied, in which he plays an assassin who falls in love with a French spy (played by Marion Cotillard) during a mission to kill a German official in World War II.[142][143] In 2017, he starred in the Netflix satirical war comedy War Machine,[144] which he also produced.[145] Pitt played a recurring role as a weatherman on the late-night talk show The Jim Jefferies Show throughout 2017.[146] A 2017 sequel to World War Z was in announced in 2016,[147] before the film was briefly delayed, then confirmed to be directed by David Fincher, and then ultimately shelved due to budget issues.[148][149] Pitt starred as Cliff Booth, a stunt double, opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, in Quentin Tarantino's 2019 film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, reuniting with DiCaprio after The Departed, which Pitt produced and DiCaprio starred in.[150] For his performance in the film, he received awards for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, BAFTA Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards, and Critics' Choice Movie Awards.[151] This is the second Academy Award for Brad Pitt, his first that he received for acting.[152] In 2019, he also starred in James Gray's deep space epic Ad Astra, in which he played Roy McBride, a space engineer searching the galaxy for his father.[153] Pitt's performance was praised as one of his career-best turn,[154][155] delivering a performance \"that weaponizes passivity into a lethal form of self-defense\".[156] In 2020, Pitt portrayed Dr. Anthony Fauci in the cold open on Saturday Night Live, earning him a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series nomination.[157][158] In 2021, Pitt entered the recording business by creating a company with French record producer Damien Quintard. Set in Pitt's Chateau Miraval in South of France, Miraval Studios will re-open in 2022 after two decades of inactivity. The previous version of the studio was one of the most iconic studios in the world, producing the records for Pink Floyd, the Cranberries, AC/DC, Sade and Muse, among others.[159] In 2022, Pitt starred in Bullet Train, directed by David Leitch,[160] and reunited with his Once Upon a Time in Hollywood co-star Margot Robbie in Babylon, directed by Damien Chazelle.[161] On January 5, 2022, he signed on to star in and produce a racing film on Formula One titled F1, directed by Joseph Kosinski,[162] for which he will earn $30 million.[163] He reteamed with George Clooney in Wolfs, a comedy-thriller written and directed by Jon Watts, which was released in September 2024.[164] Over his career Pitt has received numerous awards including two Academy Awards (as a producer and actor), two BAFTA Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. Over his career he has been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the following performances: Pitt visited the University of Missouri campus in October 2004 to encourage students to vote in the 2004 U.S. presidential election,[165] in which he supported John Kerry.[165][166] Later in October, he publicly supported the principle of public funding for embryonic stem-cell research. \"We have to make sure that we open up these avenues so that our best and our brightest can go find these cures that they believe they will find\", he said.[167] In support of this he endorsed Proposition 71, a California ballot initiative intended to provide state government funding for stem-cell research.[168] Pitt supports One Campaign, an organization aimed at combating AIDS and poverty in the developing world.[169][170] He narrated the 2005 PBS public television series Rx for Survival: A Global Health Challenge, which discusses current global health issues.[171] The following year Pitt and Jolie flew to Haiti, where they visited a school supported by Yéle Haïti, a charity founded by Haitian-born hip hop musician Wyclef Jean.[172] In May 2007, Pitt and Jolie donated $1 million to three organizations in Chad and Sudan dedicated to those affected by the crisis in the Darfur region.[173] Along with Clooney, Damon, Don Cheadle, David Pressman, and Jerry Weintraub, Pitt is one of the founders of Not On Our Watch, an organization that focuses global attention on stopping \"mass atrocities\".[174] Pitt has a sustained interest in architecture,[175] even taking time away from film to study computer-aided design at the Los Angeles offices of renowned architect Frank Gehry.[176] He narrated e2 design, a PBS television series focused on worldwide efforts to build environmentally friendly structures through sustainable architecture and design.[177] In 2000, he co-authored an architectural book on the Blacker House with the architects Thomas A. Heinz and Randell Makinson.[178] In 2006, he founded the Make It Right Foundation, organizing housing professionals in New Orleans to finance and construct 150 sustainable, affordable new houses in New Orleans's Ninth Ward following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina.[179][180] The project involves 13 architectural firms and the environmental organization Global Green USA, with several of the firms donating their services.[181][182] Pitt and philanthropist Steve Bing have each committed $5 million in donations.[183] The first six homes were completed in October 2008,[184] and in September 2009 Pitt received an award in recognition of the project from the U.S. Green Building Council, a non-profit trade organization that promotes sustainability in how buildings are designed, built and operated.[185][186] Pitt met with U.S. President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi in March 2009 to promote his concept of green housing as a national model and to discuss federal funding possibilities.[187] In September 2006, Pitt and Jolie established a charitable organization, the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, to aid humanitarian causes around the world.[188] The foundation made initial donations of $1 million each to Global Action for Children and Doctors Without Borders,[189] followed by an October 2006 donation of $100,000 to the Daniel Pearl Foundation, an organization created in memory of the late American journalist Daniel Pearl.[190] According to federal filings, Pitt and Jolie invested $8.5 million into the foundation in 2006; it gave away $2.4 million in 2006[191] and $3.4 million in 2007.[192] In June 2009, the Jolie-Pitt Foundation donated $1 million to a U.N. refugee agency to help Pakistanis displaced by fighting between troops and Taliban militants.[193] In January 2010, the foundation donated $1 million to Doctors Without Borders for emergency medical assistance to help victims of the Haiti earthquake.[194][195] Pitt is a supporter of same-sex marriage.[196] In an October 2006 interview with Esquire, Pitt said that he would marry Jolie when everyone in America is legally able to marry.[197] In September 2008, he donated $100,000 to the campaign against California's 2008 ballot proposition Proposition 8, an initiative to overturn the state Supreme Court decision that had legalized same-sex marriage.[198] In March 2012, Pitt was featured in a performance of Dustin Lance Black's play, 8 – a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California's Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage – as Judge Vaughn Walker.[199] In September 2012, Pitt reaffirmed his support for Obama, saying, \"I am an Obama supporter and I'm backing his U.S. election campaign.\"[200] In October 2020, he narrated an advertisement for Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign.[201] From the late 1980s to early 1990s, Pitt was romantically involved with several of his co-stars, including Shalane McCall (Dallas),[202] Robin Givens (Head of the Class),[203] Jill Schoelen (Cutting Class),[203] Geena Davis (Thelma & Louise),[204] and Juliette Lewis (Too Young to Die? and Kalifornia).[35] McCall and Lewis were respectively 15 and 16 when Pitt started dating them.[205][206] Subsequently, Pitt had a much-publicized romance and engagement to his Seven co-star, Gwyneth Paltrow, whom he dated from 1994 to 1997.[203] Pitt met actress Jennifer Aniston in 1998; they married in a private wedding ceremony in Malibu on July 29, 2000.[207] In January 2005, Pitt and Aniston announced they had decided to separate. Two months later, Aniston filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.[208] Pitt and Aniston's divorce was finalized by the Los Angeles Superior Court on October 2, 2005.[208] Despite media reports that Pitt and Aniston had an acrimonious relationship, Pitt said in a February 2009 interview that he and Aniston \"check in with each other\", adding that they were both big parts of each other's lives.[209] During Pitt's divorce proceedings, his involvement with his Mr. & Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie attracted media attention. Jolie and Pitt stated that they fell in love on the set[210][211] and that there was no infidelity.[210] In April 2005, one month after Aniston filed for divorce, a set of paparazzi photographs emerged showing Pitt, Jolie, and her son Maddox at a beach in Kenya; the press interpreted the pictures as evidence of a relationship between Pitt and Jolie. Throughout 2005, the two were seen together with increasing frequency, and the entertainment media dubbed the couple \"Brangelina\".[212] On January 11, 2006, Jolie confirmed to People that she was pregnant with Pitt's child, thereby publicly acknowledging their relationship for the first time.[213] Pitt and Jolie announced their engagement in April 2012 after seven years together.[214] They were legally married on August 14, 2014, and had their wedding in a private ceremony at the Château Miraval, France on August 23, 2014.[215] On September 19, 2016, Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt, citing irreconcilable differences.[216] On April 12, 2019, the divorce became legal.[217] In 2022, he began dating Ines de Ramon (b. 1992), a jewelry designer.[218] In July 2005, Pitt accompanied Jolie to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where she adopted her second child, a girl.[219][220] On December 3, 2005, Pitt was in the process of becoming the adoptive father of Jolie's daughter, and Jolie's first adopted child, a boy.[221] On January 19, 2006, a California judge granted Jolie's request to change the children's surnames from \"Jolie\" to \"Jolie-Pitt\".[222] The adoptions were finalized soon after.[223] Jolie gave birth to their daughter in Swakopmund, Namibia, on May 27, 2006. Pitt confirmed that their newborn daughter would qualify for a Namibian passport.[224] The couple sold the first pictures of their daughter through the distributor Getty Images; the North American rights were purchased by People for over $4.1 million, while Hello! obtained the British rights for approximately $3.5 million. The proceeds from the sale were donated to charities serving African children.[225] Madame Tussauds in New York unveiled a wax figure of the two-month-old; it marked the first time an infant had been honoured with a statue in the museum.[226] On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a 3-year-old boy from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[227] Pitt adopted the boy in the United States on February 21, 2008.[228] At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins.[229] She gave birth to son and daughter on July 12, 2008 in Nice, France.[230] The rights for the first images of the twins were jointly sold to People and Hello! for $14 million—the most expensive celebrity pictures ever taken.[231][232] The couple donated the proceeds to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[231][233] Since Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt on September 19, 2016, they have been embroiled in a custody battle over their children. Jolie had full custody until May 2021 when Pitt was granted joint custody, over four and a half years after proceedings began.[234] However, in July, Los Angeles superior court judge John W. Ouderkirk was removed from the case due to concerns over his impartiality as he did not sufficiently disclose business relationships with Pitt's lawyers. This resulted in the custody arrangement reverting to a previous November 2018 agreement where Jolie has primary physical custody while Pitt has \"custodial time\" with their minor children.[235][236] In September 2016, the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services investigated Pitt for child abuse following an incident on a plane, where Pitt was accused by an anonymous person of being \"verbally abusive\" and \"physical\" towards one of his children.[237] Pitt was not criminally charged for the incident by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, or by the FBI.[238] In 2022, Jolie filed a countersuit against Pitt during a legal battle over their formerly co-owned vineyard. Jolie's lawyers stated that during negotiations, Pitt had asked Jolie to sign \"a nondisclosure agreement prohibiting her from speaking outside of court about his abuse of her and their children.\"[239] Her complaint stated that he grabbed and shook her during the plane ride, strangled one of their children, and struck another in the face, among other allegations.[239] In September 2016, Pitt got sober and began attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.[240] In December 2019, he wrote an article for Interview in which he talked with his Legends of the Fall and Meet Joe Black costar and fellow recovering alcoholic Anthony Hopkins about their experiences with addiction and recovery.[241] Pitt credits fellow actor Bradley Cooper with helping him in his sobriety.[242] Pitt has admitted to using cannabis in the late 1990s as a way to deal with his increasing fame.[243][244] According to Pitt: \"I was hiding out from the celebrity thing; I was smoking way too much dope; I was sitting on the couch and just turning into a doughnut.\"[243][244][245] He reduced his cannabis use and focused on his work after a trip to Morocco, where he witnessed extreme poverty and suffering.[243][244] In 2022, Pitt said that he had struggled for years to recognize people's faces due to prosopagnosia (face blindness).[246] In a 2013 interview, he said that his inability to recognize people's faces had become so severe that he often wanted to stay home.[247] Formally, however, Pitt has not been diagnosed with prosopagnosia.[246][248] Pitt has an interest in art, learned pottery,[249] and has created sculptures. Nine of his sculptures were exhibited together with works by musician Nick Cave and artist Thomas Houseago at the Sara Hildén Art Museum in Tampere, Finland in 2022–2023.[250][251] Pitt has been frequently cited as one of the most attractive actors of all time and has been described as a sex symbol by many sources, including Empire, who named him one of the 25 sexiest stars in film history in 1995.[12][252][253] The same year, he was named People's Sexiest Man Alive, an accolade he received again in 2000.[252][254] Pitt appeared on Forbes' annual Celebrity 100 list of the 100 most powerful celebrities from 2006 to 2008 placing at numbers 20, 5 and 10, respectively.[255][256][257] In 2007, he appeared on the Time 100 list, a compilation of the 100 most influential people in the world, as selected annually by Time magazine.[258] The magazine credited Pitt for using \"his star power to get people to look [to where] cameras don't usually catch\".[258] He was again included on the Time 100 in 2009, this time in the \"Builders and Titans\" list.[259] Beginning in 2005, Pitt's relationship with Angelina Jolie became one of the world's most reported celebrity stories. After Jolie was confirmed to be pregnant in early 2006, the intense media hype surrounding the couple reached what Reuters, in a story titled \"The Brangelina fever,\" called \"the point of insanity\".[260] To avoid media attention, the couple flew to Namibia for the birth of their daughter, which was described by a paparazzi blog as \"the most anticipated baby since Jesus Christ.\"[261] Similarly, intense media interest greeted the announcement of Jolie's second pregnancy two years later; for the two weeks Jolie spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade to report on the birth.[262] In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Pitt, together with Jolie, were found to be the favorite celebrity endorsers for brands and products worldwide.[263] Pitt has appeared in several television commercials. For the U.S. market, he starred in a Heineken commercial aired during the 2005 Super Bowl; it was directed by David Fincher, who had directed Pitt in Seven, Fight Club, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.[264] Other commercial appearances came in television spots including Acura Integra, in which he was featured opposite Russian model Tatiana Sorokko,[265] as well as SoftBank, and Edwin Jeans.[266] On June 2, 2015, the minor planet 29132 Bradpitt was named in his honor.[267]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Brad Pitt (born December 18, 1963, Shawnee, Oklahoma, U.S.) is an American actor known for his portrayal of unconventional characters. After gaining attention for his role in Thelma & Louise (1991), Pitt channeled his magnetism as a leading man in such movies as A River Runs Through It (1992) and Legends of the Fall (1994) but avoided being typecast by assuming unorthodox roles in 12 Monkeys (1995) and Fight Club (1999). Pitt won an Academy Award for his performance in Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood (2019). Pitt grew up in Springfield, Missouri, and attended (1983–87) the University of Missouri before dropping out just short of graduation to move to California and pursue an acting career. After playing minor television and movie roles, Pitt captured the public’s attention as a charming scoundrel in the film Thelma & Louise. He followed up with such movies as A River Runs Through It, Interview with the Vampire, and Legends of the Fall (1994). Pitt then starred as a police detective in the gritty thriller Se7en (1995) and as a demented malcontent in the fantasy 12 Monkeys (1995), for which he won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Oscar. Pitt deliberately played against type as Austrian mountain climber Heinrich Harrer in Seven Years in Tibet (1997), an Irish Republican Army terrorist in The Devil’s Own (1997), a modern-day personification of death in Meet Joe Black (1998), and an underground boxer in Fight Club (1999). In 2000 Pitt married actress Jennifer Aniston. The following year he starred in Ocean’s Eleven, a comedy caper about con artists. The film was a major success and led to the sequels Ocean’s Twelve (2004) and Ocean’s Thirteen (2007). In 2004 Pitt portrayed the Greek warrior Achilles in Troy. The action comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) paired Pitt with actress Angelina Jolie, with whom he became romantically involved. Pitt continued to lend his talents to films covering a wide range of subject matter, including Babel (2006), a film that traces the intersecting lives of characters from divergent backgrounds, and the period western The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007). Pitt further demonstrated his versatility in 2008, portraying a dim-witted would-be blackmailer in the Coen brothers’ Burn After Reading and a man who ages backward in the poignant fantasy The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. His chameleonic turn in the latter film earned him an Academy Award nomination for best actor. In 2009 Pitt starred in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds, a World War II drama about a group of Jewish American soldiers trained to kill Nazis in German-occupied France. The following year Pitt provided the voice of the superhero rival of the titular villain in the animated film Megamind. In Terrence Malick’s impressionistic drama The Tree of Life (2011), he played a domineering father in 1950s Texas. Pitt later scored another best actor Oscar nomination, for his performance as real-life general manager Billy Beane in the baseball drama Moneyball (2011). The film chronicles how Beane assembled successful teams with the Oakland Athletics by using statistics to acquire cheaper, less-well-known players. Pitt subsequently starred as a mob enforcer in the crime drama Killing Them Softly (2012) and as a former United Nations investigator fighting to contain a zombie pandemic in the thriller World War Z (2013). Pitt had supporting roles in 12 Years a Slave (2013)—which was based on the true story of Solomon Northup, a free person of color who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the mid-19th century—and in the crime drama The Counselor (2013). In Fury (2014) he played an American army sergeant commanding the remnants of a decimated battalion during the last days of World War II. The following year Pitt reteamed with Jolie, this time in By the Sea, a marital drama she also wrote and directed. He then portrayed a morally grounded former investment banker in the black comedy The Big Short (2015), about the 2008 financial crisis. In the World War II thriller Allied (2016), Pitt starred as a Canadian intelligence officer whose wife (Marion Cotillard) might be a German spy. In 2017 he portrayed a four-star general in War Machine, a military satire that was released on Netflix. Pitt later reteamed with Tarantino in Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood (2019), playing the stunt double of a washed-up actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) in 1969 Los Angeles. For his performance, Pitt earned both an Oscar and a Golden Globe Award for best supporting actor. Also in 2019 he starred as an astronaut searching the solar system for his missing father (played by Tommy Lee Jones) in the futuristic drama Ad Astra. Pitt’s credits from 2022 include the action-romance The Lost City, in which he had a memorable cameo, and Bullet Train, about a group of assassins on a high-speed train. That year he also costarred with Margot Robbie in Damien Chazelle’s Babylon, a dramedy set in Hollywood during the 1920s. In 2024 Pitt and Clooney reunited for Wolfs, an action comedy in which they played rival fixers who are forced to work together. In addition to acting, Pitt headed his own film-production company, Plan B Entertainment. The company partnered with several others to produce 12 Years a Slave, and Pitt won an Academy Award for his producing role when that film was named best picture. Pitt’s involvement with Jolie and his 2005 divorce from Aniston were intensely scrutinized by the tabloid press. In 2006 Pitt adopted Jolie’s two children, Maddox and Zahara, whom she had adopted from Cambodia and Ethiopia, respectively. The couple had their first biological child, Shiloh, in May 2006. The next year they adopted a boy, Pax, from Vietnam, and in 2008 they added biological twins, Knox and Vivienne, to their family. Pitt and Jolie married in 2014, but two years later Jolie filed for divorce. The couple often used their celebrity status as a platform for speaking out on behalf of a number of humanitarian causes. Pitt cofounded and was actively involved in Not on Our Watch, a campaign that directed resources to developing countries in crisis, notably the Sudanese province of Darfur. In 2006 he established the Make It Right Foundation, a multimillion-dollar project to construct environmentally friendly homes in New Orleans for people displaced by Hurricane Katrina. The undertaking attracted numerous high-profile architects, but it was plagued by construction issues that resulted in several legal disputes. Notably, in 2015 the foundation sued the wood supplier after a number of completed homes began rotting; the suit was settled out of court. Three years later homeowners filed a class-action lawsuit against the foundation, alleging poor construction; in 2022 Make It Right agreed to pay the plaintiffs $20.5 million. Pitt was also interested in art, and in 2022 he exhibited a number of sculptures at a museum in Finland. His “brutally honest” works included a miniature house assembled from tree bark and tape.",

We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. Brad Pitt has returned to the big screen with pal George Clooney in the action-comedy Wolfs. The 60-year-old Pitt portrays Nick, a professional fixer, who is forced to work with his rival in covering up a high-profile crime despite both men preferring to act alone. Wolfs first premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival, where it received a 5-minute ovation. After a week-long run in select theaters September 20, the movie began streaming on Apple TV+ September 27. Wolfs marks the first time Pitt has shared the screen with Clooney in 16 years, with the pair last working together in the 2008 movie Burn After Reading. Pitt told Deadline the new movie was the perfect project for the two actors to reunite. “We kind of figured there’s gotta be a good reason to get back in a film together, something we feel like we could build upon what we’ve done before,” he said. “But also, I gotta say, as I get older, working with the people that I just really enjoy spending time with has really become important to me.” A Wolfs sequel is already in the works. Academy Award–winning actor Brad Pitt is one of the most recognizable stars in Hollywood since his rise in the 1990s. His major movie roles have included Ocean’s Eleven, Troy, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Moneyball, and Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood, for which he won an Oscar. Initially cast in many pretty boy roles, Pitt first proved his willingness to take on grittier roles in the 1999 cult classic Fight Club and began earning more serious award consideration following his 2006 performance in Babel. The Midwest native has also proved to be a successful movie producer, backing the Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave among many others. Pitt is also known for his high-profile marriages with fellow actors Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. His current girlfriend is fashion executive Ines de Ramon. FULL NAME: William Bradley PittBORN: December 18, 1963BIRTHPLACE: Shawnee, OklahomaSPOUSES: Jennifer Aniston (2000-2005) and Angelina Jolie (2014-2019)CHILDREN: Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox, and VivienneASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius Brad Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt on December 18, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma. The eldest of three children in a devoutly Southern Baptist family, Brad grew up in Springfield, Missouri, with his siblings Doug and Julie. His father, Bill Pitt, owned a trucking company, and his mother, Jane Pitt, was a family counselor. As a student at Kickapoo High School, Brad participated in school musicals but originally wanted to be an advertising art director. He studied journalism at the University of Missouri in pursuit of that goal, but a quieter aspiration that was the product of his childhood love of movies—to become an actor—began to grow louder. His dreams finally seemed tangible his last semester at university when he realized, “I can leave.” On a whim, Brad dropped out of college just two credits shy of a degree, packed up his Datsun, and headed west to Los Angeles. Brad told his parents he intended to enroll in the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, but instead spent the next several months driving a limousine. He chauffeured strippers from one bachelor party to the next and delivered refrigerators while trying to break into the Los Angeles acting scene. He joined an acting class and, shortly after, accompanied a classmate as her scene partner on an audition with an agent. In a twist of fate, the agent signed Brad instead of his partner. After weathering only seven months in Los Angeles, Pitt had secured an agent and regular acting work. Pitt’s first acting jobs came in television. The 5-foot-11 actor appeared in episodes of Dallas, the daytime soap Another World, the sitcom Growing Pains, and in 1990’s short-lived Fox series Glory Days. In 1989, Pitt played Billy Canton, the drug-addicted pimp of a teenage runaway (played by Juliette Lewis) in the NBC made-for-television movie Too Young to Die. His big-screen debut was in 1989’s horror movie Cutting Class with Donovan Leitch. Pitt then played a teen track star in Sandy Tung’s Across the Tracks (1990). It was a well-timed bit part in a controversial Hollywood film that pushed Pitt to the brink of stardom. Pitt’s performance as a renegade, sugar-tongued hitchhiker who gets picked up by Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon’s characters in Thelma & Louise (1991) grabbed universal attention despite only a few minutes’ worth of screen time in the Ridley Scott–directed movie. Pitt’s combination of charming bad-boy charisma and sensual playfulness—particularly in a fiery love scene with Davis—made him a genuine sex symbol. The young actor’s next few movies failed to boost his acting credibility and establish him as more than just a pretty face in Hollywood. But in fall 1992, the Hollywood sunshine set the golden boy alight once more in Robert Redford’s film A River Runs Through It, based on Norman McLean’s autobiography. For his first major movie role, Pitt played Paul McLean, the gambling, fly-fishing younger brother of Craig Sheffer’s Norman. Redford later admitted he didn’t choose Pitt on the strength of his audition but rather because “[he] had an inner conflict that was very interesting to me.” Pitt delivered a sparkling performance, skillfully depicting Paul’s dangerous footing between overwhelming charm and reckless self-destructiveness. In 1993, Pitt reteamed with then-girlfriend Juliette Lewis in Dominic Sela’s Kalifornia. Pitt played Early Grayce, a man who goes on a cross-country killing spree with his girlfriend. Many reviewers deemed the movie self-indulgently violent and nihilistic, and it didn’t do well at the box office, either. Pitt and Lewis broke up soon after filming, creating a publicity disaster. Pitt proceeded to lighten his repertoire with a comedic performance as Floyd, a burnt-out hippie in True Romance (1993), but his next major role came in the adaptation of Anne Rice’s Interview With the Vampire (1994), alongside Tom Cruise and a young Kirsten Dunst. Rice initially expressed outrage at the casting choices, finding the two boyish, all-American movie stars too rough for the homoerotic overtones of the tale. “It’s like casting Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer,” she reportedly complained. However, after seeing the end result, Rice retracted her initial statements and filmed a short spot for the video version that endorsed the movie. Film critic Caryn James of The New York Times noted, “the power of the film depends on Mr. Pitt’s rich and deeply affecting performance. Low-key and serene, he makes Louis convincing as a bereaved father, lover, even son.” Pitt’s next few efforts secured his place as a Hollywood staple even as many critics found his roles lacking in dimension. In 1994’s Legends of the Fall, an epic family melodrama, Pitt played the stereotypical romantic hero Tristan who had long, golden locks and a penchant for alternately selfish and self-sacrificing gestures. The actor earned his first Golden Globe nomination for the performance. The next year, Pitt took an abruptly gritty turn as a detective on the trail of a serial killer in David Fincher’s disturbing and gory thriller Seven. Morgan Freeman played Pitt’s onscreen partner as Kevin Spacey and Gwyneth Paltrow tackled other roles. At the end of 1995, Pitt starred as a mental patient in Terry Gilliam’s psychological thriller 12 Monkeys. The actor won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in a Movie and earned his first Oscar nod. Pitt followed with another dark thriller, Sleepers (1996), then Devil’s Own (1997) with Harrison Ford before heading to Argentina to film Seven Years in Tibet (1997), an ambitious $70 million project that was met with mixed reviews. His next film, the three-hour Meet Joe Black, co-starring Anthony Hopkins, found Pitt playing a very comely version of death and didn’t inspire high praise. In 1999, after a brief hiatus from the Hollywood hot list, Pitt reteamed with Seven director David Fincher to make Fight Club. The cult classic, also starring Edward Norton, presented an uninhibited Pitt in the disturbing role of Tyler Durden, leader of the titular fight club that serves as a bloody diversion for young professional men. Next up for Pitt was the British crime-caper Snatch (2000), co-starring Benicio Del Toro and directed by Guy Ritchie. The year 2001 was busy for the actor. In addition to submitting an Emmy-nominated guest appearance on Friends, Pitt starred with Julia Roberts in the romantic comedy The Mexican, teamed with Robert Redford again in the thriller Spy Game, and joined an A-list ensemble cast—including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, and Roberts—in Steven Soderbergh’s remake of Ocean’s Eleven. The heist movie was the fifth highest-grossing film of 2001 worldwide and spurred three sequels. Pitt returned for Ocean’s Twelve (2004) and Ocean’s Thirteen (2007), both popular yet slightly less successful entries in the franchise. (Sandra Bullock led the largely female cast of Ocean’s Eight in 2018.) The same year as Ocean’s Twelve, Pitt starred in the blockbuster epic Troy (2004), based on The Iliad by Homer. He portrayed the Greek hero Achilles and led a cast that included Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom. Troy made just shy of $500 million at the global box office. In 2005, Pitt starred opposite Angelina Jolie in another blockbuster, the action flick Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Showcasing a married couple who both secretly work as spies, the movie earned more than $478 million worldwide. The two actors soon became a real-life couple. Mr. and Mrs. Smith was later adapted into a TV show by Donald Glover. The critically acclaimed drama Babel (2006) earned Pitt his third Golden Globe nomination, as the movie itself was an Oscar contender for Best Picture. The actor moved on to less serious fare in Burn After Reading (2008), a FBI comedic thriller directed by the Joel and Ethan Coen that earned two Golden Globe nominations. Pitt took on arguably his most fantastical lead role to date in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), an Academy Award–wining movie based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The movie saw Pitt reunite with director David Fincher and Babel co-star Cate Blanchett. Pitt portrayed the title character who is born as a 70-year-old man, ages in reverse, and falls in love with Blanchett’s character, Daisy. His lauded performance earned Pitt multiple award nominations, including a nod for Best Actor at the Oscars. In 2009, Pitt starred in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds followed by the award-winning The Tree of Life, with Sean Penn and Jessica Chastain, two years later. But his big role for 2011 revolved around a baseball diamond. The movie star was the lead player in Moneyball, a baseball dramedy based on the identically titled 2003 nonfiction book by Michael Lewis. The story follows the travails of Oakland A’s general manager Billy Beane, who Pitt portrayed, and his quest to reshape his team. Pitt also helped produced Moneyball, which earned six Academy Award nominations that included Best Picture and Best Actor for Pitt. In 2013, Pitt won acclaim for his performance as Gerry Lane in the zombie-apocalyptic thriller World War Z and also appeared as a supporting character in The Counselor. Rave reviews piled up for his work on another 2013 movie, 12 Years a Slave. The Steve McQueen–directed film tells the true story of free Black musician Solomon Northup, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is kidnapped and sold into slavery. Pitt appeared as a Canadian carpenter who greatly aids Northup. The cast also included Benedict Cumberbatch, Lupita Nyong’o, Michael Fassbender, and Quvenzhané Wallis. For his work as a producer, Pitt won his first Oscar when 12 Years a Slave was named Best Picture in March 2014. He shared the accolade with McQueen and their fellow producers. “I know I speak for everyone standing behind me that it has been an absolute privilege to work on Solomon’s story,” Pitt said during his acceptance speech. “And we all get to stand up here tonight because of one man who brought us all together to tell that story and that is the indomitable Mr. Steve McQueen.” That August, Pitt also collected his first Emmy Award for executive producing The Normal Heart (2014). The HBO film, starring Mark Ruffalo as a gay man in 1980s New York City at the start of the HIV/AIDS crisis, was named Outstanding Television Movie. After starring as an army sergeant in the World War II action-drama Fury (2014), Pitt’s next project was with his then-wife Angelina Jolie. The couple co-starred in the art house outing By the Sea (2015), which Jolie wrote and directed. Pitt then worked on another movie inspired by a best-selling Michael Lewis book. The Big Short (2015) focused on the housing market bubble that fueled the 2008 financial collapse and a group of men who’d predicted the turmoil to come. Pitt’s role as Ben Rickert was part of that bunch, and he additionally served as a producer of the Oscar-nominated film that competed for Best Picture. Other cast members included Steve Carell, Christian Bale, and Ryan Gosling. Pitt returned to a World War II–era period piece in the 2016 romantic thriller Allied, with co-star Marion Cotillard, then continued on a military theme with 2017’s War Machine. His character in the satirical movie was based on former U.S. General Stanley McChrystal. With Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood (2019), Pitt finally scored a long-elusive Academy Award for acting. The movie, directed by Quentin Tarantino, had an all-star cast that placed Pitt in the company of Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie, Emile Hirsch, Margaret Qualley, Austin Butler, and Al Pacino. Pitt’s supporting role as Cliff Booth led to his second Golden Globe and a moment of reflection during his Oscar acceptance speech: Before 2019 was over, Pitt also headlined the sci-fi adventure Ad Astra. In 2022, Pitt made a cameo appearance in The Lost City, starred in Bullet Train as an unlucky assassin who wants his gigs to go more peacefully, and headlined Babylon as movie star Jack Conrad in a story about people trying to make it big in 1920s Hollywood. He competed for the Best Supporting Actor in a Movie trophy at the subsequent Golden Globes but didn’t win. Pitt’s new movie is the action comedy Wolfs, in which he plays a professional fixer who is forced to work with his rival (played by George Clooney) despite both men being lone wolves. The movie premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival ahead of a limited theatrical run and its Apple TV+ streaming release in September. A Wolfs sequel has already been confirmed. In 2025, Pitt is set to star in the sports action film F1 as a Formula 1 race car driver. He has also announced plans to produce both a movie and a docuseries about the Isle of Man TT motorcycle race. As of August 2024, Pitt has an estimated net worth of $400 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. He earns a minimum of $20 million per movie, making him one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood. His largest upfront salary was for his new movie Wolfs; he was paid $35 million. In addition to acting, Pitt co-founded a production company in 2001 with his then-wife Jennifer Aniston and then-manager Brad Grey. Plan B Entertainment has produced many successful and award-winning movies such as The Departed (2006), 12 Years a Slave (2013), Women Talking (2022), and Wolfs (2024). Pitt assumed sole ownership of Plan B in 2005 following his and Aniston’s divorce and sold a major stake in the company in 2022. The deal was reportedly worth hundreds of millions of dollars but less than $500 million. As one of Hollywood’s most recognizable stars since the 1990s, Pitt’s romantic relationships have been closely watched. The actor has been part of several high-profile couples over the years, including his marriages to fellow actors Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. Pitt is currently dating fashion executive Ines de Ramon as he continues divorce proceedings from Jolie. After being tied to a handful of women in the 1980s, including actor Christina Applegate, Pitt began a four-year relationship with actor Juliette Lewis in 1989. The two met on the set of Too Young To Die? and became close despite their 10-year age difference. Lewis was just 17 when they first met. She and Pitt also shared the screen in 1993’s Kalifornia, but their breakup after filming caused headaches during the movie’s promotion campaign. Pitt moved on with another co-star, Gwyneth Paltrow. Then a relatively unknown actor, she and Pitt appeared as a married couple in Seven. In real life, both claimed it was “love at first sight” after meeting on the movie’s set around early 1995. Pitt and Paltrow stayed together for two and a half years and were one of Hollywood’s most admired couples. Then, in 1997, after a seven-month engagement, the couple split for unknown reasons. Pitt next started dating Friends star Jennifer Aniston in 1998, with the couple announcing their engagement just one year later. Pitt and Aniston got married in September 2000 in a lavish beachside ceremony in Malibu, California. In 2001, Pitt guest starred in an episode of Friends and the following year, the pair co-founded the production company Plan B Entertainment. After five years of marriage, Pitt and Aniston announced their separation in January 2005, divorcing in October of that year. Following their divorce, the Troy actor became the sole owner of Plan B Entertainment. In 2007, Pitt maintained he still had a “deep friendship” with Aniston. Soon after his separation from Jennifer Aniston, Pitt began dating Angelina Jolie. Jolie later revealed the two developed feelings for each other on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005). The relationship quickly became serious. In 2005, Pitt began adoption paperwork for Jolie’s two kids at the time, Maddox and Zahara. Over the next three years, the couple added four more children to their family: Shiloh, Pax, and twins Knox and Vivienne. The children all had the hyphenated last name Jolie-Pitt. (Shiloh is in the process of dropping Pitt from her last name.) Six kids and seven years later, Pitt and Jolie became engaged in 2012 and tied the knot in a private ceremony on August 23, 2014, in France. However, the union only lasted a small fraction of their time together as a couple. In September 2016, Jolie filed for divorce and requested sole custody of their children. The drama surrounding their ongoing, contentious split has played out the media. Jolie was said to be in danger of losing custody in June 2018 due to her insistence on keeping the children from seeing their father. That August, Jolie filed court documents that claimed her estranged husband had “paid no meaningful child support since separation.” Pitt’s legal team followed with their own filing that they asserted the actor had paid more than $1.3 million in bills for the family and helped Jolie buy her current home through an $8 million loan. A judge ruled Pitt and Jolie legally single in April 2019, though the former couple’s divorce has yet to be fully finalized. In October 2022, Jolie filed a complaint alleging that Pitt was physically abusive to her and their six children during a 2016 plane ride, which led to their divorce. Jolie said he “choked one of the children and struck another in the face” and grabbed her “by the head and shook her.” She also stated Pitt poured alcohol all over her and the kids. Two years later, in April 2024, Jolie issued a new legal filing claiming that Pitt’s abuse started long before the 2016 incident. Pitt started dating Swiss luxury jewelry executive Ines de Ramon in late 2022. The couple was first spotted together that November before attending the Babylon movie premiere a month later. Pitt and his girlfriend reportedly moved in together in February 2024 and made their first red carpet appearance at the Venice Film Festival in September. Pitt is a father to six adopted and biological children who he shares with his ex-wife Angelina Jolie. From oldest to youngest, they are Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox, and Vivienne. Soon after he and Jolie began their relationship, Pitt filed paperwork in 2005 to adopt Maddox, born in 2001, and Zahara, born in 2005. Next, the couple had a daughter who they named Shiloh in May 2006. Their brood grew again in 2007 with the adoption of 3-year-old Pax, who was born in 2003. Then, in July 2008, Jolie had fraternal twins: a son named Knox and a daughter named Vivienne. Although Jolie sought full custody of their kids, Pitt was awarded joint custody of the children in May 2021. That ruling was overturned months later due to a legal technicality, then in October 2022, Jolie said in a court filing that Pitt had been physically and verbally abusive on a plane ride six years earlier. Amid the ongoing divorce, Pitt’s children have distanced themselves from him, with Zahara, Shiloh, and Vivienne choosing to adopt their mother’s last name. Shiloh began the official process to change her last name from Jolie-Pitt to just Jolie in May 2024. In a now deleted Instagram story, Pitt’s son Pax reportedly had some choice words for him on Father’s Day in 2020, calling the actor a “terrible and despicable person.” The Biography.com staff is a team of people-obsessed and news-hungry editors with decades of collective experience.

Notre Dame is one of three schools that competes as an Independent at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) level; however, they play five games a year against opponents from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), of which Notre Dame is a member in all other sports except ice hockey.[5] The Fighting Irish are among the most prestigious college football teams of all time. Since their inaugural season in 1887, Notre Dame has claimed 11 national championships, including 8 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll.[6] Seven Notre Dame players have won the Heisman Trophy. Notre Dame has 948 official victories, with an additional 21 having been vacated by the NCAA in 2016 for self-reported academic misconduct.[7] Notre Dame has had 22 undefeated seasons including 12 perfect seasons.[8] Notre Dame home games have been televised by NBC since 1991.[9][10] Football did not have an auspicious beginning at the University of Notre Dame. In their inaugural game on November 23, 1887, the Irish lost to Michigan by a score of 8–0.[11] Their first win came in the final game of the 1888 season when the Irish defeated Harvard Prep School of Chicago by a score of 20–0.[12] At the end of the 1888 season, they had a record of 1–3 with all three losses being at the hands of Michigan. Between 1887 and 1899, Notre Dame compiled a record of 31 wins, 15 losses, and 4 ties against a diverse variety of opponents ranging from local high school teams to other universities.[13] In 1894, James L. Morrison was hired as Notre Dame's first head football coach.[14] Notre Dame took a significant step toward respectability, prominence, and stability when they hired Morrison.[15] He wrote an acquaintance after his first day on the job: \"I arrived here [Notre Dame] this morning and found about as green a set of football players that ever donned a uniform... They want to smoke, and when I told them that they would have to run and get up some wind, they thought I was rubbing it in on them. \"One big, strong cuss remarked that it was too much like work. Well, maybe you think I didn't give him hell! I bet you a hundred no one ever makes a remark like that again.\"[15] In 1908, the win over Franklin saw end Fay Wood catch the first touchdown pass in Notre Dame history.[16] Notre Dame continued its success near the turn of the century and achieved their first victory over Michigan in 1909 by the score of 11–3, after which Michigan refused to play Notre Dame again for 33 years. By the end of the 1912 season they had amassed a record of 108 wins, 31 losses, and 13 ties.[17] Jesse Harper became head coach in 1913, coaching for five years until retiring in 1917.[18] During his tenure, the Irish began playing only intercollegiate games and posted a record of 34 wins, five losses, and one tie.[19] This period would also mark the beginning of the rivalry with Army and the continuation of rivalry with Michigan State.[20][21] In an effort to gain respect for a regionally successful but small-time Midwestern football program, Harper scheduled games in his first season with national powerhouses Texas, Penn State, and Army.[22] That year, Notre Dame burst into the national consciousness and helped to transform the collegiate game in a single contest. On November 1, 1913, the Notre Dame squad stunned the Black Knights of the Hudson 35–13 in a game played at West Point.[23] Led by quarterback Gus Dorais and end Knute Rockne, the Notre Dame team attacked the Cadets with an offense that featured both the expected powerful running game but also long and accurate downfield forward passes from Dorais to Rockne. This game has been miscredited as the invention of the forward pass.[24] Prior to this contest, receivers would come to a full stop and wait on the ball to come to them, but in this contest, Dorais threw to Rockne in stride, changing the forward pass from a seldom-used play into the dominant ball-moving strategy that it is today.[24][23] Irish assistant Knute Rockne became head coach in 1918.[25] During his 13 years, the Irish won three national championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925,[26] and produced players such as George Gipp and the \"Four Horsemen\".[27] Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran a 7–2–2 scheme.[28][29] Rockne took over in the war-torn season of 1918[30] He made his coaching debut on September 28, 1918, against Case Tech in Cleveland, Ohio, and earned a 26–6 victory.[31] Leonard Bahan, George Gipp, and Curly Lambeau were in the backfield.[32][33] With Gipp, Rockne had an ideal handler of the forward pass.[34][35] The Irish posted a 3–1–2 record for the season, losing only to the Michigan Agricultural Aggies. The 1919 team had Rockne handle the line and Gus Dorais handle the backfield.[36] The Irish went undefeated and were one of four teams to be selected for the national championship, although Notre Dame does not claim it.[37][38] Gipp died at age 25 on December 14, 1920,[39] just two weeks after Walter Camp elected him as Notre Dame's first All-American.[40][39] Gipp likely contracted strep throat and pneumonia while giving punting lessons after his final game on November 20 against Northwestern.[40] Since antibiotics were not available in the 1920s, treatment options for such infections were limited and they could be fatal even to young, healthy individuals.[41] Rockne was speaking to Gipp on his hospital bed when he was purported to have delivered the famous \"Win one for the Gipper\" line.[42][39][43][44][45] John Mohardt led the 1921 Notre Dame team to a 10–1 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns.[46] Grantland Rice wrote that \"Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space\" and noted that the 1921 Notre Dame team \"was the first team we know of to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game.\"[47] Mohardt had both Eddie Anderson and Roger Kiley at end to receive his passes.[48][49] The national champion 1924 team included the \"Four Horsemen\" backfield of Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Jim Crowley, and Elmer Layden.[50][51] The line was known as the \"Seven Mules\".[52] The Irish capped an undefeated, 10–0 season with a victory over Stanford in the Rose Bowl.[26] The 1926 team beat Army and was led by Christie Flanagan,[53][54] but was undone by a loss to Carnegie Tech in the penultimate game of the season. In this game, Rockne made what an Associated Press writer called \"one of the greatest coaching blunders in history\" by traveling to Chicago for the Army–Navy Game to \"write newspaper articles about it, as well as select an All-America football team.\" Carnegie Tech used the coach's absence as motivation for a 19–0 win; the upset likely cost the Irish a chance for a national title.[55] The 1928 team lost to national champion Georgia Tech.[56] \"I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man–Peter Pund,\" said Rockne. \"Nobody could stop him. I counted 20 scoring plays that this man ruined.\"[57] Among the events that occurred during Rockne's tenure none may be more famous than the Rockne's \"Win one for the Gipper\" speech.[58] Army came into the 1928 matchup undefeated and was the clear favorite.[59] Notre Dame, on the other hand, was having their worst season under Rockne's leadership and entered the game with a 4–2 record.[59] At the end of the half Army was leading and looked to be in command of the game. Rockne entered the locker room and gave his account of Gipp's final words: \"I've got to go, Rock. It's all right. I'm not afraid. Some time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are going wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go in there with all they've got and win just one for the Gipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Rock. But I'll know about it, and I'll be happy.\"[60] The speech inspired the team and they went on to upset Army and win the game 12–6.[61] The 1929 and 1930 teams both went undefeated,[62][63] winning national championships,[64][65] and the 1930 team was led by the likes of Frank Carideo, Joe Savoldi, Marchy Schwartz and Marty Brill.[65] It featured the first and only example of all four members of a backfield being named to an All-American team during the same season. The 1929 team played all of its games on the road while the new Notre Dame Stadium was being built.[66] In 1930, \"Jumping Joe\" Savoldi scored the first Notre Dame touchdown in the new stadium on a 98-yard kickoff return.[67] Savoldi is also known as \"the first hero in the lore of Notre Dame's Stadium\" based on scoring three touchdowns in the official stadium dedication game against Navy the following week.[68] Rockne coached his last game on December 14, 1930, when he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New York City.[69][70] The game raised funds for the Mayor's Relief Committee for the unemployed and needy of the city.[71] 50,000 fans turned out to see the reunited \"Four Horsemen\" along with players from Rockne's other championship teams take the field against the pros.[72] On March 31, 1931, Rockne died at age 43 in the crash of a Transcontinental & Western Air airliner in Kansas; he was on his way to help in the production of the film The Spirit of Notre Dame.[73][74][75] The crash site is located in a remote expanse of Kansas known as the Flint Hills and now features a Rockne Memorial.[76] As Notre Dame's head coach from 1918 to 1930, Rockne posted what has remained for decades the all-time highest winning percentage (.881) for a football coach in the NCAA's flagship FBS division.[77][78] During his 13-year tenure as head coach of the Fighting Irish, Rockne collected 105 victories, 12 losses, 5 ties and 3 national championships.[79][80] Rockne also coached Notre Dame to 5 undefeated and untied seasons.[79][80] Through game broadcasts during the Golden Age of Radio, Notre Dame football gained a nationwide following of \"subway alumni\", Catholics who became fans whether or not they attended the university.[81] Former Saint Louis head coach Heartley \"Hunk\" Anderson was promoted from assistant coach and took the helm of the Irish after Knute Rockne's death, leading them to a record of 16 wins, nine losses, and two ties.[82] Anderson was a former Irish player under Rockne and was serving as an assistant coach at the time of Rockne's death. Notre Dame finished 6–2–1 in 1931.[83] The Irish lost a heartbreaker by a score of 16–14 to USC on November 21 that snapped the program's 26-game unbeaten streak.[84] 1933 was a tough year for the Irish as they finished with a 3–5–2 record, the first losing season for the program since 1888. ND suffered a four-game losing streak, failing to score a point in all four losses to Carnegie Tech, Pittsburgh, Navy, and Purdue.[85] Anderson resigned as Irish head coach after the 1933 season to accept the position of head football coach at NC State.[86] Anderson was replaced by Elmer Layden, who was one of Rockne's \"Four Horsemen\" in the 1920s. After graduating, Layden played professional football for one year and then began a coaching career.[87] Layden's 1935 squad posted one of the greatest wins in school history by rallying to defeat Ohio State by a score of 18–13 in a game billed as the \"Game of the Century\".[88][89] His 1938 team finished 8–1, losing only to USC in the season finale.[90] This loss cost them a possible consensus national championship, but the team was named national champion by the Dickinson System.[91] Like Rockne before him, Layden was a goodwill ambassador for Notre Dame during his time as head coach.[92][93] He was able to schedule a home-and-home series with Michigan after meeting with Fielding H. Yost, healing a rift between the two schools.[94] The two teams had not met since 1909, when, after eight straight losses to the Wolverines, the Irish posted their first win.[95][96] They were scheduled to meet again in 1910, but Michigan canceled the game and refused to play the Irish again.[96] By the time they met again in 1943, Layden had left Notre Dame and Frank Leahy had taken his place.[96] The Irish posted a record of 47 wins, 13 losses, and three ties in seven years under Layden,[97] the most successful record of a Notre Dame coach not to win a national championship.[98] He left Notre Dame after the 1940 season to become Commissioner of the National Football League.[98][87] Boston College head coach Frank Leahy was hired by Notre Dame to take over for Layden in 1941 and was another former Irish player who played during the Rockne era. After graduating from Notre Dame, Leahy held several coaching positions, including line coach of the Seven Blocks of Granite of Fordham University that helped that team win all but two of their games between 1935 and 1937.[99] He then coached the Boston College Eagles to a win in the 1941 Sugar Bowl and a share of the national championship.[100][101] His move to Notre Dame began a new period of gridiron success for the Irish and ensured Leahy's place among the winningest coaches in the history of college football.[102] Leahy coached the team for 11 seasons from 1941 to 1943 and 1946 to 1953.[99] After finishing in the AP top 10 each of his first two seasons, Leahy's 1943 team went 9–1 and captured Notre Dame's fourth national championship (and first since the advent of the AP Poll). Quarterback Angelo Bertelli became Notre Dame's first Heisman Trophy winner. From 1944 to 1945, Leahy served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was honorably discharged as a captain.[103] Edward McKeever, Leahy's assistant coach, became interim head coach when Leahy left for the Navy.[104] During 1944, his one year at the helm, the Irish managed 8 wins and 2 losses.[105] McKeever left Notre Dame in 1945 to take over as head coach of Cornell.[106] For the 1945 season, he was replaced by Hugh Devore, who led the Irish to a 7–2–1 record.[107] Upon Leahy's return in 1946 and due to his status as a veteran himself, the Irish heavily recruited returning veterans who were often much older than incoming freshmen. Largely thanks to this influx of talent, Notre Dame went four consecutive seasons after World War II without losing a game, winning the 1946, 1947, and 1949 national championships in the process.[108] The 1946 game against Army, ending in a 0–0 tie, pitted two of the greatest teams of all time against each other and included three consecutive Heisman Trophy winners (Army's Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis and Notre Dame's Johnny Lujack, who quarterbacked the 1946 and 1947 Irish). The 1948 team missed out on a national championship due only to a 14–14 tie at USC in the final game of the season. In 1949, Notre Dame went unbeaten and untied for the second time in three seasons behind Heisman Trophy-winning end Leon Hart, who would later be selected first overall in the 1950 NFL Draft. A fifth national championship was lost because of a 1953 tie against Iowa, in a game that featured 1953 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lattner[109] that caused a minor scandal at the time, when it appeared that some Irish players had faked injuries to stop the clock, leading some to nickname those players the \"Fainting Irish\".[110][111][112] Leahy retired in 1954 reportedly due to health issues.[113] Perhaps the best example of this occurred during the Georgia Tech game in 1953. Leahy fell ill during the game, which led to him collapsing during halftime.[114][self-published source] The situation was so dire that a priest was called in to give Leahy Catholic last rites.[115] However, Leahy recovered, and the consequent diagnosis was that he was suffering from nervous tension and pancreatitis.[116] Leahy has the second highest winning percentage (.864) of any college coach in history. He led the Irish to a record of 87 wins, 11 losses, and nine ties including 39 consecutive games without a loss (37–0–2), four national championships, and six undefeated seasons.[102][117] The departure of Frank Leahy ushered in a downward slope in Notre Dame's performance.[118] 25-year old assistant coach Terry Brennan was hired as Frank Leahy's successor as the Notre Dame head coach in 1954 and would stay until 1958. Brennan was a former player under Leahy. Before joining the Irish, he had coached the Mount Carmel High School team in Chicago.[119] His first two seasons the Irish were ranked fourth and ninth respectively in the AP poll, with a loss to Purdue the only blemish on the 1954 team's schedule.[119][120] It was the 1956 season that began to darken Brennan's reputation, for it became one of the most dismal in the team's history and saw them finish the season with a mere two wins, including losses to Michigan State, Oklahoma, and Iowa.[121] One bright spot in the 1956 season was the awarding of the Heisman Trophy to Paul Hornung, who would go on to a legendary NFL career with the Green Bay Packers. Hornung is the only Heisman winner to win the award while playing for a team that had a losing record.[122] The Irish would recover the following season, posting a record of 7–3[123] and including in their wins a stunning upset of Oklahoma, in Norman, Oklahoma, that ended the Sooners' still-standing record of 47 consecutive wins.[124] In Brennan's final season, though, the Irish finished 6–4,[125] leading to Brennan's firing in mid-December.[126] Brennan's tenure can only be properly framed with the understanding that in a time of zero scholarship limitations in college football, Notre Dame's administration inexplicably began a process of de-emphasizing football, severely cutting scholarships and hindering Brennan from building a roster of any meaningful depth.[127] He departed with a total of 32 wins and 18 losses.[128] Former San Francisco, Chicago Cardinals and Washington Redskins head coach Joe Kuharich took the head coaching position at Notre Dame in 1959, realizing a longtime ambition to return to his alma mater.[129][130] He had earlier been courted by Notre Dame after the 1956 season, after the Irish finished 2–8, but before he had a chance to accept an offer, Terry Brennan was given a reprieve.[131] Kuharich brought a professional touch to Irish football, putting shamrocks on the players' helmets and shoulder stripes on their jerseys.[131][132] However, his tenure became one of the worst stretches in program history, including a school-record eight-game losing streak in 1960, a year in which the Irish finished 2–8.[133] The consensus opinion was that Kuharich never made the adjustment from pro football to college football, attempting to use complicated pro coaching techniques with collegiate players, and never adapted to the limited substitution rules in effect at the time, having big, immobile linemen playing both ways in an era where smaller, quicker players were preferred. He often said, \"You win some and you lose some\", and seemed perfectly content finishing 5–5 every year. This did not sit well with the Irish faithful, who expected Notre Dame to beat everybody.[134] When the pressure of winning became too much to bear, Kuharich resigned in the spring of 1963 and assumed the post of supervisor of NFL officials.[131] Because it was so late in the spring, the freshman team's coach Hugh Devore was named head coach for the 1963 season while the search for a permanent replacement was being conducted.[135] Kuharich compiled a 17–23 record over four non-winning seasons and remains to this day the only coach ever to have an overall losing record at Notre Dame. Despite his unsuccessful tenure, Kuharich remains the only Irish coach to post back-to-back shutouts over their greatest rival, the USC Trojans, in 1960 (17–0) and 1961 (30–0).[136] In 1964, Ara Parseghian left his job as the Northwestern head football coach when he was hired to take over the coaching duties at Notre Dame.[137] He immediately brought the team back to a level of success in Irish football history that was comparable only to Rockne and Leahy. These three coaches have an 80% or greater winning percentage while at Notre Dame – Rockne at .881, Leahy at .864, and Parseghian at .836. Parseghian's teams never won fewer than seven nor lost more than three games during the ten-game regular seasons of the era.[138] In his first year, the Irish improved their record to 9–1 behind Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback John Huarte, but they lost any hope for a national championship in the last game of the season at USC when Craig Fertig connected with a touchdown pass to Rod Sherman.[139] Parseghian earned coach of the year honors from the American Football Coaches Association, the Football Writers Association, and The Sporting News, as well as several others, and a cover story in Time magazine.[140][141] The 1966 team did finish unbeaten, finishing #1 in the AP Poll and winning the national championship in the process. The Irish had six shutout wins, each by 30 or more points. This includes a season-ending 51-0 win at #10 USC, the largest margin of victory by either side in the rivalry's history. This season is most remembered for a 10–10 tie at #2 Michigan State in the \"Game of the Century\" in which the injury-plagued Irish played for a tie rather than risking a loss.[142] It was under Parseghian as well that Notre Dame lifted its 40-plus year-old \"no bowl games\" policy,[143] beginning with the season of 1969, after which the Irish played the #1 Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl Classic, losing in the final minutes in a closely contested game.[144] The following year, Parseghian's 9–1 squad[145] ended Texas' Southwest Conference record 30-game winning streak in the Cotton Bowl.[144] In 1971, Cliff Brown became the first African-American quarterback to start a game for the program.[146] The Irish returned to glory by winning Parseghian's second national championship in 1973, sweeping through their regular-season schedule 10–0 and defeating #1 Alabama 24-23 in the Sugar Bowl by taking advantage of a fourth-quarter missed extra point by the Crimson Tide. Due to health issues, Parseghian was forced to retire from coaching after another bowl win over Alabama to conclude the 1974 season.[147] During Parseghian's eleven-year career, the Irish amassed a record of 95–17–4 and captured two national championships. The Irish finished in the AP Top 10 nine times and never ranked lower than #14 at the end of a season. Parseghian was also named coach of the year by several selectors in his national championship years of 1966 and 1973 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980.[148][149] Dan Devine was hired to take over as head coach upon Parseghian's retirement from Notre Dame in 1975.[150] Devine was already a highly successful coach and had led Arizona State, Missouri, and the NFL's Green Bay Packers.[150] Devine had been a leading candidate for the head coaching job at Notre Dame in 1964, when Ara Parseghian was hired.[151] When approached for the job following Parseghian's resignation, Devine accepted immediately, joking that it was probably the shortest job interview in history.[152] When he arrived at Notre Dame he already had a college coaching record of 120 wins, 40 losses, and eight ties and had led his teams to victory in four bowl games.[153] At Notre Dame he would lead the Irish to 53 wins, 16 losses, and a tie as well as three bowl victories.[153] His lasting achievement came midway through this run, when the 1977 Notre Dame team won the national championship, led by junior quarterback Joe Montana.[154] Before the game against USC, played at home on October 22, Devine changed the team's jerseys from navy blue & white to kelly green & gold, later known as the \"green jersey game\", resulting in a 49–19 victory over the Trojans.[155] The Irish continued to wear green for the rest of Devine's tenure at the school.[155] The championship season climaxed with a 38–10 win in the 1978 Cotton Bowl Classic over previously top-ranked Texas, led by Heisman Trophy winner Earl Campbell.[156] The win vaulted the Irish from fifth to first in the polls. The following season, the Irish lost their first two games including a shocking 3–0 loss to Missouri in South Bend, but would recover to finish the regular season 8–3 and earn a berth in the Cotton Bowl against Houston. The Irish used three Montana touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) to recover from a 22-point deficit in the fourth quarter and win 35–34, the largest fourth-quarter comeback in college football history at the time. The game became known as the \"Chicken Soup Game\" after Montana ate a bowl of chicken soup at halftime while battling the flu.[157] The 1979 and 1980 Irish did not live up to the standards set by earlier Devine teams, although the former season did see Vagas Ferguson set the single-season program rushing record (1,437 yards) that still stands today. Because he had the unenviable task of following a legend, Devine came under heavy scrutiny while at Notre Dame and it was felt that he was never fully embraced by the Notre Dame community, despite winning a national championship.[158] After a 5–2 start in his first season, rumors of incompetence were circulated and that Devine would be dismissed and replaced by Don Shula or even Ara Parseghian (who went so far as to say he would not return to Notre Dame under any circumstances).[159] Even on the day of the 1977 USC game, \"Dump Devine\" bumper stickers were being sold outside Notre Dame Stadium.[159] On August 15, 1980, Devine announced that he would be leaving Notre Dame at the end of season, saying he wanted to be able to spend more time with his wife.[158] Gerry Faust was a surprise choice when hired to replace Devine in 1981.[160] Prior to Notre Dame, Faust had been one of the more successful high school football coaches in the country. As coach of Moeller High School in Cincinnati he amassed a 174–17–2 record over 19 seasons.[161] Many of his players had gone on to play for Notre Dame; indeed, when he arrived in South Bend, he was reunited with nine of his former players from Moeller. Despite his success in the high school ranks, Faust's success at Notre Dame was mixed. In his first season, the Irish finished 5–6.[162] In Faust's second season, Notre Dame improved slightly to 6–4–1.[163] The most successful years under Faust were the 1983 and 1984 campaigns where the Irish finished 7–5 and made trips to the Liberty Bowl and Aloha Bowl respectively.[164][165] His final record at Notre Dame was 30–26–1.[166] To avoid being fired, Faust resigned at the end of the 1985 season.[167][168] He announced his resignation prior to the final game of the year, where Notre Dame suffered a humiliating 58–7 loss at Miami; Allen Pinkett scored the Irish TD. Faust proceeded to take over as head coach at Akron.[169] Lou Holtz had 17 years of head coaching experience by the time he was hired to lead the Irish.[170] He had previously been head coach of William & Mary, North Carolina State, the NFL's New York Jets, Arkansas, and Minnesota.[170] In contrast to Faust, Holtz was well known as a master motivator and a strict disciplinarian.[171][172] The tone was set with Holtz's first meeting with his team as Irish head coach in 1986, immediately demanding his players sit up straight in their chairs and look him in the eye as he spoke.[173] Holtz began in 1986 where his predecessor left off in 1985, finishing with an identical record of 5–6.[174] However, unlike the 1985 squad, which was generally outcoached and outplayed, Holtz's 1986 edition was competitive in nearly every game, losing five out of those six games by a combined total of 14 points. That would be his only losing season as he posted a record of 95–24–2 over the next ten seasons adding up to a 100–30–2 record overall.[175][176] In 1987, Holtz led the Irish to an 8–4 record.[177] Notre Dame's best player was star wide receiver Tim Brown, who would win the Heisman Trophy that season and is Notre Dame's seventh and most recent Heisman winner.[178][179] The 1988 campaign began with high hopes, as former Notre Dame coaches Rockne, Leahy, Parseghian, and Devine all won their first national championship in their third season with the program. The Irish defeated their first five opponents, ascending to the #4 ranking in the lead-up to a visit from the reigning national champion Miami Hurricanes. In a game which became known as Catholics vs. Convicts due to a popular T-shirt design on Notre Dame's campus, the Irish upset the Hurricanes 31–30 when Pat Terrell knocked down Steve Walsh's two-point conversion attempt with no time on the clock. When star players Ricky Watters and Tony Brooks showed up late for dinner right before the then top-ranked Irish played second-ranked USC in the final regular season game of 1988,[180] in a controversial move, Holtz took his 10–0 Irish squad to Los Angeles without them.[181] His move was vindicated when the Irish defeated USC anyway.[182] Holtz was named national coach of the year,[170] and a win over No. 3 West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl captured the Irish's 11th-all time national championship.[183] 1988 remains Notre Dame's most recent undefeated season and national championship.[184][185] In 1989, Holtz led the Irish to a 12–1 record. The Irish began the season in the Kickoff Classic game in East Rutherford, New Jersey, against Virginia.[186] The Irish won by a score of 36–13 and ascended to the #1 spot in the AP Poll.[187] Next, top-ranked Notre Dame defeated #2 Michigan by a score of 24–19.[188] After nine more consecutive victories to begin the season 11–0, the Irish would lose to #7 Miami in the final week of the season, ending Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak.[189] Holtz would lead the Irish to a victory in the Orange Bowl over #1 Colorado to end the season, finishing #2 in the AP poll behind Miami.[190] After beginning the 1990 season with a #1 ranking and a victory over #4 Michigan by a score of 28–24 and two more wins for a 3–0 start, the Irish took their first loss of the season, losing to Stanford by a score of 36–31. The Irish would ascend back to #1 on the strength of a home win over #2 Miami, a game that saw the end of the series between the two until 2010.[191] However, late-season losses to Penn State and Colorado in the Orange Bowl would eliminate the Irish from national championship contention.[192] The 1991 Fighting Irish began the season 8-1, but lost back-to-back games for the first time since 1987 when they again lost to Penn State. The Irish would receive a berth in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, where they defeated Florida by a score of 39–28.[193][194] In 1992, Notre Dame finished 10–1–1. After defeating Northwestern to start the season,[195] the Fighting Irish tied #5 Michigan, their first tie of the Holtz era.[196] This season saw the Irish's largest win in history against Purdue, a 48–0 win at Notre Dame Stadium, and a 28–3 Cotton Bowl against previously unbeaten #4 Texas A&M.[197][198] The Irish enjoyed another successful season in 1993, finishing the season at 11–1. After scoring 27 points in wins over Northwestern and #2 Michigan to start the season, the Irish defeated their next six opponents to enter a matchup with undefeated #1 Florida State 8–0 and ranked just behind the Seminoles at #2. For the first time, ESPN's College GameDay decided to make a visit to campus to host the show live on Saturday morning.[199] In a classic, the Irish defeated the Seminoles 31–24, ascending to the #1 ranking a day later. However, a loss to #17 Boston College on a game-winning field goal as time expired by a score of 41–39 ended the Irish's national championship aspirations.[200] The Irish would face a rematch with #6 Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl to finish the season, a game the Irish won by a score of 24–21.[201][202] Controversially, Notre Dame finished #2 in the AP poll behind a team in Florida State it had beaten. In 1994, Holtz led Notre Dame to a 6–5–1 record, the Irish's worst record since Holtz's first season in 1986.[203] The team lost three of four games midseason to drop out of the rankings for the first time since 1986. The Irish would improve to 9–3 in 1995, but lost to #8 Florida State in the Orange Bowl.[204][205] Lou Holtz's final season at Notre Dame in 1996 resulted in an 8–3 record. The season notably saw Notre Dame's first participation in the Emerald Isle Classic in Ireland, a 54–27 win over Navy, and an overtime loss to USC, snapping the Irish's 13-game non-losing streak against the Trojans.[206][207] Holtz's option offense, which helped catapult Notre Dame to many victories in the late 1980s and early 1990s, also helped rack up impressive recruiting classes. During the 1989 season, Holtz had the following future NFL players on offense: QB Rick Mirer, RB Ricky Watters, RB Anthony Johnson, RB Rodney Culver RB Dorsey Levens, and WR Raghib Ismail. In 1990, he added RB Jeff Burris (who would later move to safety), FB Jerome Bettis and TE Irv Smith. 1991 saw the additions of RB Reggie Brooks and FB Ray Zellars. 1992 saw the addition of WR Derrick Mayes. For 1993, he added FB Marc Edwards. In 1995, he added RB Autry Denson. From the 1987–1995 NFL Drafts, there were a total of 65 Notre Dame players selected.[208] Overall, Holtz took Notre Dame to one undefeated season, nine consecutive New Year's Day bowl games, and top 10 finishes in the AP poll in five seasons,[209] as well as overseeing the majority of the longest winning streak against USC in program history (11 games). Holtz retired from Notre Dame following the 1996 season,[210] but would unretire in 1999 to accept the head coaching position at South Carolina where he would serve until the completion of the 2004 season.[211][212] Bob Davie, who had been Holtz's defensive coordinator from 1994 to 1996, was promoted to head coach when Holtz retired.[213] Davie, who turned down a head coaching offer from Purdue to accept the Irish's head coaching position,[214] was a well-respected defensive mind who had also served as defensive coordinator at Tulane and Texas A&M.[215] Davie had also filled in as head coach for one game during the 1995 season when Lou Holtz was dealing with a health issue.[216] One of his first major decisions was to fire long-time offensive line coach Joe Moore, who then successfully sued the university for age discrimination.[217] On Davie's watch, the team suffered three bowl game losses (1997 Independence Bowl,[218] 1999 Gator Bowl,[219] and 2001 Fiesta Bowl),[220] and it failed to qualify for a bowl game in two others (1999 and 2001). The highlight of Davie's tenure was a 36–20 upset win in 1998 over #5 Michigan, the defending national champions.[221][222] On December 17, 1999, Notre Dame was placed on probation by the NCAA. The association's Committee on Infractions found two series of violations. The New York Times reported \"the main one involved the actions of a booster, Kimberly Dunbar, who lavished gifts on football players with money she later pleaded guilty to embezzling.\" In the second series of events, a football player was accused of trying to sell several complimentary game tickets and of using others as repayment of a loan. The player was also said \"to have been romantically involved with a woman (not Dunbar), a part-time tutor at the university, who wrote a term paper for another player for a small fee and provided players with meals, lodging and gifts.\"[223] The Dunbar violation began while Lou Holtz was head coach: \"According to the NCAA committee report, Dunbar, the woman at the center of the more serious violations, had become romantically involved with several Notre Dame football players from June 1995 to January 1998 and had a child with one, Jarvis Edison.\"[223] Notre Dame was placed on probation for two years and lost one of its 85 football scholarships each year in what the Times termed \"minor\" penalties.[223][224] Davie nearly defeated top-ranked Nebraska in 2000, with the Irish comeback bid falling short in overtime 27–24.[225] The aforementioned 2001 Fiesta Bowl was Notre Dame's first invitation to the Bowl Championship Series. The Irish lost by 32 points to Oregon State,[226] but would finish No. 15 in the AP Poll, Davie's highest ranking as head coach. Despite Davie's rocky tenure, new athletic director Kevin White gave the coach a contract extension following the 2000 season,[227] then saw the team start 0–3 in 2001 – the first such start in school history.[228] Disappointed by the on-field results, coupled with the Joe Moore and Kim Dunbar scandals, the administration decided to dismiss Davie after the 2001 season.[229] His final record at Notre Dame was 35–25.[230] On December 9, 2001, Notre Dame hired George O'Leary, the head coach at Georgia Tech, to replace Davie.[231] However, while researching a story on O'Leary, New Hampshire Union Leader reporter Jim Fennell uncovered misrepresentations in O'Leary's resume that had influenced the administration's decision to hire him.[232] The resulting media scandal embarrassed Notre Dame officials and tainted O'Leary; he resigned five days later, before coaching a single practice, recruiting a single player, or hiring a single assistant coach.[233] O'Leary's tenure is the shortest of any head coach in FBS history.[234] O'Leary would go on to become the head football coach at the University of Central Florida.[235] Once again in need of a new head coach, the school turned to Tyrone Willingham, the head coach at Stanford.[236] Willingham's hiring made him the first African American head coach in Notre Dame football history.[237] Bringing a feeling of change and excitement to campus, Willingham led the 2002 squad to a 10–2 regular season record, including an 8–0 start with wins over #7 Michigan and #11 Florida State, and a #4 ranking. This great early start, however, would be the lone highlight of Willingham's tenure, as Notre Dame finished the year with a loss to Boston College, then lopsided losses to USC and North Carolina State in the Gator Bowl.[238] The program faltered over the next two seasons under Willingham, compiling an 11–12 record.[239] During this time, Notre Dame lost a game by at least 30 points on five occasions. Furthermore, Willingham's 2004 recruiting class was judged by analysts to be the worst at Notre Dame in more than two decades.[240] Citing Notre Dame's third consecutive four-touchdown loss to arch-rival USC[241] compounded by another year of subpar recruiting efforts, the Willingham era ended on November 30, 2004 (after the conclusion of the 2004 season) when the university chose to terminate him and pay out the remainder of Willingham's six-year contract.[242] After Willingham's firing, Notre Dame initially pursued Utah head coach Urban Meyer, who had been an Irish assistant from 1996 to 2000 and had a clause in his Utah contract that stated he could take the Notre Dame head coaching job without paying a buyout.[243][244] After Meyer accepted the Florida head coaching position and turned down the Irish,[245] Charlie Weis left the NFL's New England Patriots, where he won three Super Bowls as offensive coordinator,[246] to become head football coach for the Irish beginning with the 2005 season.[247] A first-time head coach when he was hired by Notre Dame,[248] Weis was officially introduced on December 12, 2004.[249] Weis' hiring as the Irish's 30th head football coach made him the first Notre Dame graduate to hold the football head coaching position on a full-fledged basis since Joe Kuharich.[250] Weis signed a six-year contract worth about $2 million annually excluding incentives.[251][252][253] To kick off his inaugural season, Weis led the Irish to back-to-back road wins over ranked teams, the first time that had been done by a Notre Dame coach since Knute Rockne. On September 25, Weis and the Irish traveled to Seattle to face Washington and former head coach Tyrone Willingham, who was hired by the Huskies to be their head coach two weeks after getting fired at Notre Dame.[254] The Irish won by a score of 36–17.[255] Entering the rivalry game with USC, defending national champions and owners of a 27-game winning streak, the Irish had risen to #9 in the AP Poll. In one of the most famous games in the rivalry's history, USC defeated Notre Dame 34–31. The game is most remembered for Trojan running back and eventual Heisman winner Reggie Bush, who had already scored three touchdowns that day, illegally pushing quarterback Matt Leinart into the end zone on the final play of the game, in a play now known as the \"Bush Push\". The Irish won their remaining five games to earn an appearance in the Fiesta Bowl. There, they were defeated by the Ohio State Buckeyes 34–20[256] to finish the season 9–3 and #9 in the AP poll, their highest final ranking since 1993. Quarterback Brady Quinn broke numerous team passing records that season and became a top Heisman Trophy contender.[257] Wide receiver Jeff Samardzija was the team's leading receiver and also broke Notre Dame's single-season records for receiving yards and touchdowns.[258] During the 2005 season, Notre Dame signed Weis to a big raise and ten-year contract extension that was set to keep the coach in South Bend through the 2015 season.[259][260] Weis and the Irish went into the 2006 season with a No. 2 preseason ranking in the ESPN/Coaches Poll.[261] They finished the regular season with a 10–2 record, losing only to Michigan and USC. Notre Dame accepted a bid to the 2007 Sugar Bowl, losing to LSU 41–14. This marked their ninth consecutive postseason loss, the longest drought in NCAA history.[262] As a result, Notre Dame dropped to #17 in the final rankings.[263][264] In the wake of a graduating class that sent eleven players to the NFL,[265] the 2007 season included various negative milestones: the most losses in a single year (9);[266] two of the ten worst losses in program history (38–0 losses to both Michigan[267] and USC);[268] and the first 6-game losing streak for home games.[269] The Naval Academy recorded their first win over the Irish since 1963, breaking Notre Dame's NCAA-record 43-game win streak.[270] In 2008, the Irish started 4–1, but completed the regular season with a 6–6 record,[271] including a 24–23 home loss to Syracuse, the first time that Notre Dame had fallen to an eight-loss team.[272] Quarterback Jimmy Clausen was the team's star player, completing over 60% of his passes.[273][274] Despite speculation the university might fire Weis, it was announced he would remain head coach.[275] Weis's Notre Dame squad ended the season breaking the Irish's NCAA bowl losing streak by beating Hawaii, 49–21, in the Hawaii Bowl.[276] Weis entered the 2009 season with the expectation from the Notre Dame administration that his team would be in position to compete for a BCS Bowl berth.[277] Notre Dame started the first part of the season 4–2, with close losses to Michigan and USC. Sitting at 6–2, however, Notre Dame lost to Navy for the second time in three years,[278] which became the first loss in a four-game losing streak to finish the season. Quarterback Jimmy Clausen and wide receiver Golden Tate would forgo their senior seasons and enter the NFL Draft.[279] Weis was fired on November 30, 2009.[280] According to Weis' buyout, he was to be paid $6 million then $2.05 million annually until the contract ran out in December 2015 for a total of about $19 million.[281] During that time, Weis made more money annually not to coach the Irish than his successor, Brian Kelly, made to coach the team.[282] On December 10, 2009, Cincinnati head coach Brian Kelly became the 31st head coach of the Fighting Irish after leading the Bearcats to a 12–0 record and BCS bowl-game berth, but he left the team before the bowl game.[283][284] Kelly's hiring surprised very few as he was a northern Irish Catholic who was considered one of college football's rising stars.[285] In his first season, Kelly led the Fighting Irish to an 8–5 record.[286] Tragedy struck early in the season when Declan Sullivan, a junior working for the athletic department, died while filming a practice on a scissor lift in dangerously high winds.[287] Dayne Crist started the season at quarterback but was injured for a second consecutive year, this time in the Tulsa game, which the Irish lost.[288] Kelly turned to freshman quarterback Tommy Rees, who led the Irish to victories in the last three games against #15 Utah, Army in Yankee Stadium, and breaking an eight-year losing streak to USC in the LA Coliseum. Kelly guided the Irish to a 33–17 win over Miami (FL) in the 2010 Sun Bowl to finish 2010 with an 8–5 record.[289] With senior wideout Michael Floyd returning for his senior season and an outstanding recruiting class that included several highly touted defensive linemen,[290] Kelly and the Irish looked to improve on their 8–5 record from the prior year. However, an early season upset to a Skip Holtz-led South Florida team and a last-second loss to Michigan in Ann Arbor, games in which the Irish committed 10 total turnovers, left the Irish at 0–2 to start the season. The Irish bounced back to beat #15 Michigan State and had two 4-game winning streaks, with the only loss during that stretch coming at the hands of USC.[291] The Irish also broke Navy's 2-game winning streak over Notre Dame. Notre Dame lost 18–14 to Florida State in the 2011 Champs Sports Bowl, concluding the 2011 campaign with an 8–5 record overall, identical to the 2010 season.[292] In the team's losses, multiple turnovers from the quarterback position were often the culprit, and as a whole turnovers at critical times in the game often derailed potential Irish comebacks. On September 12, 2012, during the football program's 125th season, Notre Dame announced that it would leave the Big East Conference for the Atlantic Coast Conference, excluding the football and hockey programs.[293] This move became official on July 1, 2013. While the Fighting Irish football team remained an FBS independent, it agreed to play five games per season against ACC teams starting with the 2014 football season. In return, Notre Dame became eligible to participate in the ACC's sub-BCS level bowl arrangements.[294] The 2012 season was another entry in historic third seasons for Notre Dame head coaches. The Irish began the season 7–0, including wins over ranked rivals in Michigan State, Michigan, and Stanford. The game against the Cardinal required a goal-line stand against running back Stepfan Taylor in overtime to preserve the win for the Irish.[295] The season's signature win came at #8 Oklahoma with ESPN's College GameDay in town. On November 18, after a loss by #1 Oregon, Notre Dame became ranked #1 in the nation in both the AP and Coaches' polls after reaching 11–0 during the regular season for the first time since 1993, also ranking #1 in the BCS standings for the first time in the 14-year history of the selection system.[296] After defeating USC on November 24,[297] Notre Dame concluded its first 12–0 regular season, and the Irish were soon formally named to appear in the BCS National Championship Game for the first time. In that game, on January 7, 2013, the Irish lost to Alabama 42–14.[298] The strength of the 2012 Fighting Irish was its defense, captained by senior leader Manti Te'o, who broke the school record for interceptions by a linebacker with 7 and finished second to Johnny Manziel in Heisman Trophy voting. Coming off the previous year's national title game appearance, the Fighting Irish were dealt a blow when 2012 starting quarterback, Everett Golson, was suspended from the University due to an academic violation.[299] Senior Tommy Rees then took over. Notre Dame's 2013 season ended with a record of 9–4,[300] a victory over Rutgers in the Pinstripe Bowl, and a #20 AP poll ranking.[301][302] The 2014 season started off with 6 straight victories and a #5 national ranking heading into a showdown with #2 Florida State in Tallahassee, Florida. FSU won that game 31–27, on a controversial offensive pass interference call that brought back a last-second Notre Dame touchdown. The Fighting Irish bounced back with a win against Navy before dropping their final 4 games of the season. They did win the Music City Bowl by defeating the LSU Tigers and finished the season at an 8–5 record.[303] The 2015 Fighting Irish began its season with another new offensive coordinator, Mike Sanford Jr.[304] Led for most of the year by sophomore quarterback DeShone Kizer, the Irish had fourteen plays of over 50 yards during the season, which was a school record, including two touchdowns of over 90 yards (a 91-yard touchdown run by C. J. Prosise and a 98-yard touchdown run by Josh Adams). The Irish only had two in the previous 126 years of Notre Dame football. They finished the regular season averaging 34 points per game, including a 62-point effort against UMass, the most points in a game since 1996. The Irish began the season 10–1 and were in position for a College Football Playoff appearance, but lost a last-second game to Stanford to finish with a 10–2 record and a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.[305] Star linebacker Jaylon Smith was injured early in the game which became a loss to Ohio State.[306] The 2016 season ended with a 4–8 record, Brian Kelly's worst win–loss record at Notre Dame. The tone for the season was set early, with a heartbreaking double overtime loss to Texas in the season opener.[307] Just 4 games into the season, Brian Kelly fired defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder.[308] At the end of the season, starting quarterback DeShone Kizer declared for the NFL Draft[309] and backup quarterback Malik Zaire announced he would be transferring in the winter after graduation.[310][311] Amidst speculation that Kelly's job was in jeopardy and that Kelly was looking to leave Notre Dame, athletics director Jack Swarbrick announced that Kelly would return for the 2017 season.[312] The 2017 season was one of Kelly's strongest seasons at ND. An early one-point loss to #2 Georgia was the only blemish on an 8-1 start, keyed by a 49-14 blowout over rival USC. The tough running of running back Josh Adams behind an experienced and talented offensive line, which included future top-10 picks Quenton Nelson and Mike McGlinchey and won the Joe Moore Award as the best offensive line in that nation, allowed Notre Dame to string together 6 consecutive 20+ point victories. However, when #3 Notre Dame visited #7 Miami in South Florida on November 7, an embarrassing 41-8 loss effectively ended the Irish hopes of a playoff run. They ended the season with a win over LSU in the Music City Bowl.[313] The Irish opened the 2018 season at home against Michigan and won, 24–17.[314] After benching quarterback Brandon Wimbush in favor of Ian Book, the Irish then won the remainder of their regular season games, including victories over #7 Stanford, #24 Virginia Tech, #12 Syracuse, and Northwestern.[315] This led to Notre Dame's first undefeated regular season since 2012.[316] They were ranked #3 in the nation by the College Football Playoff committee and selected to play in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Cotton Bowl against Clemson.[317] Notre Dame's undefeated streak came to an end after losing to the eventual national champions 30–3 to finish the season at 12–1.[318] Kelly was named AP Coach of the Year and Home Depot Coach of the Year for the 2018 season.[319][320] Kelly and the Fighting Irish started off the 2019 season with a #9 ranking in the AP Poll. Notre Dame won their first two games before dropping a 23–17 result to #3 Georgia. Notre Dame won their next three games before dropping a 45–14 game to #19 Michigan. Notre Dame closed out the regular season with victories in their last five games, followed by a win in the Camping World Bowl 33–9 over Iowa State.[321] In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the cancellation of regular season scheduled games, Notre Dame joined the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in football for a single season in 2020 and played a full slate of conference matches.[322] The Irish won all ten of their games, including a mid-season contest against perennial conference power and top-ranked Clemson. The Fighting Irish defeated the Tigers 47–40 in double overtime. However, Clemson defeated the Irish in a rematch in the ACC Championship Game 34–10. Notre Dame qualified for the College Football Playoff as the #4 seed.[323] In the College Football Playoff Semifinals against Alabama at the Rose Bowl, Notre Dame lost 31–14 to finish with a 10–2 record.[324] In what would become Kelly's final season as head coach in 2021, the Fighting Irish were ranked #9 to begin the season, but struggled in their first two games, beating Florida State 41–38 and Toledo 32–29. Following a 24–13 loss to #7 Cincinnati, Kelly helped lead the Fighting Irish to a seven-game winning streak to finish the regular season 11–1 and earn a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.[325] On November 29, 2021, Kelly resigned as Notre Dame head coach to accept a ten-year, $95 million contract offer to become head coach at LSU.[326] In so doing, Kelly became the first Irish head coach since Thomas A. Barry in 1907 to leave Notre Dame for another coaching job.[327] Kelly left the Irish as the program's all-time winningest head coach.[328][329] On December 3, 2021, Notre Dame's defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman was promoted to the head coaching position to replace Brian Kelly, becoming the 32nd head coach in program history.[330][331] The second African American head coach in the history of the Irish football program, Freeman signed a five-year contract worth $4 million annually excluding incentives.[332][333][334] Freeman took control immediately, coaching the Irish in their Fiesta Bowl loss to Oklahoma State.[335][336] Freeman opened the 2022 season with losses to Ohio State (his alma mater) and Marshall, thus becoming first head coach in Notre Dame history to start his tenure with three losses.[337] He gained his first win the following week against the California.[338][339] Freeman's Irish would go on to finish the regular season ranked 19th with a record of 8-4, including an upset win over No. 5 Clemson.[340][341] They were awarded a berth in the Gator Bowl where they defeated South Carolina 45–38.[342][343] For the 2023 season, Freeman guided the Notre Dame program to a 10-win season. Safety Xavier Watts received the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for college football's best defensive player and the team earned victories over #17 Duke, #10 USC and #19 Oregon State in the Sun Bowl. Notre Dame finished the year ranked #14 in the final AP Top 25. Freeman and the Fighting Irish held their first home game of the 2024 season against the Northern Illinois Huskies as the #5 ranked team in the AP Top 25 and as a 28.5-point favorite to win. They fell to the Huskies 16-14, throwing two interceptions and giving up two blocked field goals. It was the second early-season home loss for the Irish against a heavy underdog in three years (following the 2022 loss to Marshall), was the first-ever win by a Mid-American Conference football program against a top 5 team, the first-ever Huskie win against a top 10 team, and one of the largest point-spread upsets in modern college football.[344] The Irish went on to complete the regular season 11-1 and will host a home game in the first year of the expanded college football playoffs. Notre Dame's 11 claimed national championships are: Following its appearance in the 1925 Rose Bowl, Notre Dame did not play in a post-season game for 44 consecutive years (1925–1968), including after many of the team's most successful seasons from the Rockne era in the 1920s and the Leahy era in the 1940s. The university's stated reasons for its self-imposed hiatus were that bowl games were \"glorified exhibitions\" that played no part in national championship selections and that they extended the season too far to the detriment of players' academic progress.[351] Notre Dame has made 874 appearances in the Associated Press poll over 71 seasons. Notre Dame has spent 591 weeks in the Top 10, 318 weeks in the Top 5, and 98 weeks at No. 1.[352] Notre Dame has finished the year ranked in the final Associated Press poll of the season 56 times: Notre Dame has participated in eleven \"No. 1 vs No. 2\" matchups since the AP poll began in 1936.[369] They have a record of 5–3–2 in such games, with a 4–1–1 record as the No. 1 team in such matchups. Here's a list of such games: Notre Dame has played in many regular season games that have been widely regarded by both the media[370] and sports historians[371] as historic or famous games. Notre Dame has played in many games labeled \"Game of the Century\" as well as several No. 1 vs No. 2 matchups.[372] Notre Dame has also played in several bowl games considered by many sportswriters to be among the best bowl games played:[384][385] Notre Dame's all-time record after the 2023 season stands at 948 wins, 338 losses, and 42 ties. † George O'Leary did not coach a single practice or game, resigning five days after being hired for misrepresenting his academic credentials.‡ Kent Baer served as interim head coach for one game at the 2004 Insight Bowl after Tyrone Willingham was fired. Notre Dame has made 41 bowl game appearances, winning 20 and losing 21, with one game vacated.[387] After an initial appearance in a postseason contest in the 1925 Rose Bowl, the Fighting Irish refused to participate in bowl games for more than four decades;[388] Sports Illustrated's Dan Jenkins speculated that Notre Dame might have gone to as many as twenty bowl games during the self-imposed forty-five-year hiatus.[388] From 1994 to the 2006 football seasons, Notre Dame lost 9 consecutive bowl games, tied with Northwestern for the most in NCAA history. That streak ended with a 49–21 win over Hawaii in the 2008 Hawaii Bowl. In the process, Notre Dame scored its highest point total in postseason play. The record of 9 consecutive bowl losses was later tied by Northwestern in 2011, then that streak was snapped a year later. Currently, the Fighting Irish are in a skid with winless 0-8 record in BCS/Playoff games and 0-10 in their last 10 major bowl games. Notre Dame's last major bowl win came against Texas A&M in the 1994 Cotton Bowl. Between 2009 and 2016, and resuming again in 2018, Notre Dame has hosted an annual off-site home football game known as the Shamrock Series. The series promotes Notre Dame's athletic and academic brand, and has brought the Fighting Irish to San Antonio, New York, Greater Washington, D.C., Chicago, Indianapolis, Boston and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Notre Dame has yet to lose a game in the Shamrock Series with a record of 11-0 (including the later-vacated win over Arizona State in the 2013 season). Prior to the 2012 season, Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick announced at a news conference of plans to continue the series through 2016. He confirmed after his news conference that New York is expected to fall in that rotation and then continue to be the one consistently repeating venue for Shamrock Series games. The Shamrock Series was not held in 2017, but resumed in 2018. One of the unique aspects of the Shamrock Series is its inclusion of academic and other non-football activities in the area of that year's host city the days and hours leading up to the game, which include pep rallies, drummers' circles, and academic lectures.[389][390][391] The Shamrock Series held in Las Vegas was the largest crowd for a college athletic event in Nevada history.[392] Seven Notre Dame football players have won the Heisman Trophy, which ties them with the University of Oklahoma for the second most by any university. (Ohio State also has seven trophies that were won by only six players, while USC has the most winners with eight). Heisman voting:[394] 50 former Notre Dame players and 6 coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, located in Atlanta, Georgia.[364] Notre Dame leads all universities in players inducted. Notre Dame's home jersey is navy blue with white numerals, gold outlining, and a small interlocking \"ND\" logo on each sleeve. The away jersey is white with navy numerals, gold outlining, and the interlocking \"ND\" on the sleeves. These uniforms were introduced by Lou Holtz in 1986 and retained during the tenures of Bob Davie (1997-2001) and Tyrone Willingham (2002–04). In 2005, Charlie Weis removed the interlocking \"ND\" from the sleeves, replacing it with the player's number, the first time the Irish had worn \"TV numbers\" since 1986, when they were located on the shoulders. These jerseys remained throughout Weis' tenure. When Brian Kelly succeeded Weis in 2010, the interlocking \"ND\" returned to the sleeves, and it has remained since. The Irish traditionally have not worn player names on their jerseys during regular season games, but they were included during the coaching tenures of Dan Devine (1975–80) and Gerry Faust (1981-85). When Notre Dame appeared in the 1970 Cotton Bowl Classic, its first bowl game in 45 years, Ara Parseghian had player names placed on the backs of the jerseys, a tradition which was retained for four other bowl appearances under Parseghian. Holtz, Davie, Willingham and Weis (in the 2006 Fiesta Bowl and 2007 Sugar Bowl) did not adhere to this tradition for bowl games they coached, but it returned under Weis for the 2008 Hawaii Bowl and has been continued by Kelly and Marcus Freeman. Notre Dame's helmets are solid gold with gray facemasks, the gold being emblematic of the University's famed \"Golden Dome\". Notre Dame's tradition for the team's student managers to spray-paint the team's helmets prior to each game ended in 2011 when the football equipment staff, along with Notre Dame Athletics Director Jack Swarbrick and head coach Brian Kelly outsourced the painting process to Hydro Graphics Inc. During Gerry Faust's tenure (1981–85), Notre Dame's blue jerseys switched from the traditional navy (although Notre Dame wore green jerseys full-time between the 1977 game vs. USC and the end of the 1980 season) to royal blue with gold and white stripes on the sleeves (they also wore a green jersey with sleeve stripes for the 1983 game vs. USC). The navy blue jerseys returned for the 1984 season (the Irish wore a redesigned white jersey during the 1983 Liberty Bowl without sleeve stripes and navy blue names and numbers which was carried over to 1984). No uniform numbers have been retired by Notre Dame. Upon being issued a number, each player is given a card that lists some of the more famous players who have worn that particular number. Number 3 is perhaps the most famous number in Irish football history, having been worn by Ralph Guglielmi, George Izo, Daryle Lamonica, Coley O'Brien, Joe Montana, Michael Floyd, Rick Mirer and Ron Powlus, among others.[425] Number 5 is also notable, as it is the only number to be worn by one of the Four Horsemen (Elmer Layden) a Heisman Trophy Winner (Paul Hornung) and a National Title winning Quarterback (Terry Hanratty).[425] Number 7 has been worn by such Irish greats as 1964 Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte, 1970 Heisman runner-up Joe Theismann, Steve Beuerlein, Jimmy Clausen and Jarious Jackson.[425] In 2011, both Michigan and Notre Dame wore throwback uniforms in their game against each other. For each Shamrock Series game, Notre Dame wears specially-designed helmets, jerseys, and pants. Champion supplied football jerseys for Notre Dame for over 50 years until the Irish switched to Adidas in 2001. On July 1, 2014, the Notre Dame athletic department began wearing uniforms and footwear supplied by Under Armour. Over the years, Notre Dame has occasionally worn green instead of blue as its home jersey, sometimes adopting the jersey for an entire season – or more – at a time. Notre Dame is confirmed to have worn green as far back as 1926 against Penn State, and in 1942 they officially became an alternate color for the team.[426] Currently, Notre Dame reserves its green jerseys for special occasions. Sometimes on such occasions, the Irish will take the field for warmups dressed in blue, only to switch to green when they go back to the locker room before kickoff. This tradition was started by Dan Devine in 1977 before the USC game. Notre Dame has also been known to switch jerseys at halftime, as during the 1985 USC game and in the loss to Nile Kinnick-led Iowa in 1939, although this was to help avoid confusion between their navy uniforms and Iowa's black ones. The current design of the jersey is kelly green with gold numbers and white outlining. For the 2006 Army game, Coach Charlie Weis broke out the green jerseys as a reward to his senior players and in an attempt to end the string of losses by the Irish when wearing green. Notre Dame wore throwback green jerseys in 2007 against USC in honor of the 30th anniversary of the 1977 National Championship team but lost the game 38-0.[427] As of 2023, Notre Dame's record in green is 42-15-1, going back to 1975.[426] On at least one occasion (1992 Sugar Bowl) Notre Dame has worn an away variant of the jersey, a white jersey with green numbers. Notre Dame Stadium is the home football stadium for the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. Located on the southeast part of the university's campus in Notre Dame, Indiana and with a seating capacity of 77,622, Notre Dame Stadium is one of the most renowned venues in college football.[428] The Sporting News ranks Notre Dame Stadium as #2 on its list of \"College Football Cathedrals\".[429] and the stadium experience evokes a more traditional feel. Notre Dame Stadium is used for football-related activities and for Commencement (since 2010). Notre Dame Stadium had no permanent lighting until the expansion project in 1997. NBC paid for the lighting as they have televised all Notre Dame home football games since 1991. On April 12, 2014, it was announced during the annual Blue-Gold Spring Game that a FieldTurf synthetic surface would replace the grass field after the 2014 Commencement Weekend. In November 2014 the University of Notre Dame embarked on a $400 million stadium expansion called the Crossroads Campus Project, which was completed in time for the 2017 season. Cartier Field was the original playing field of the Fighting Irish. In 1930, it was replaced by Notre Dame Stadium, due to the growing popularity of ND football. Known by fans as \"The Gug\" (pronounced \"goog\"), The Guglielmino Athletics Complex is Notre Dame's football headquarters. The Gug houses the offices for all team staff members, an auditorium, a weight room, a training room, the equipment room, the practice locker room, a brand new napping room, and various other spaces for the football team to utilize. The complex was underwritten by Don F. Guglielmino and his family. The indoor practice facility has a synthetic turf field and a video board at midfield for replay and graphics. On the second level of the facility, there is a 1,600-square-foot recruiting lounge. In all, the facility totals 111,400 square feet, and the ceiling is 95 feet at its peak. Notre Dame has rivalries with several universities. Although the Fighting Irish competes as an Independent, they play a national schedule that includes annual or otherwise regularly scheduled rivalry games. Army, Boston College, Michigan, Michigan State, Navy, Northwestern, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Stanford, and USC are among Notre Dame's rivals. Notre Dame and the Miami Hurricanes first met during the 1955 college football season.[430] They met three times during the 1960s (1960, 1965, and 1967) and proceeded to play each other annually from 1971 to 1990 (except in 1986). Notre Dame consistently dominated the series in the 1970s, but in the 1980s, Miami began to dominate as the once docile rivalry intensified significantly. Both teams were national contenders in the later part of the decade, and both teams cost each other at least one national championship. Hostilities were fueled when the Hurricanes routed the Fighting Irish in the 1985 season finale 58–7, with Miami widely accused of running up the score in the second half. The rivalry gained national attention and both teams played their most famous games from 1988 to 1990. The game known as Catholics vs. Convicts in South Bend was won by the Fighting Irish 31–30. The following year, Miami ended Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak with a 27–10 victory. The rivalry ended after the Fighting Irish dashed #2 Miami's hopes for a repeat national championship with a 29–20 victory in South Bend. Notre Dame dropped Miami from its schedule due to the intensified rivalry. The two teams are next scheduled to meet during a yet to specified date during the 2025 season. They also will play each other in yet to be scheduled dates in the 2031, 2032, 2034, and 2037 seasons.[431] The first meeting between Notre Dame and Michigan was in 1887, the first official football game in Notre Dame's history.[432] The two schools have met 44 times in total, the latest matchup in 2019. Through the 2021 season, the two schools are both in the top five in all-time Division I winning percentage, with Notre Dame fourth and Michigan third Meeting for the first time in 1897, Notre Dame and Michigan State play for the Megaphone Trophy. The two schools played in 64 out of 70 seasons from 1948 to 2017, but have not met since. Their next scheduled game is in 2026.[433] Notable games in the series include the 1966 \"Game of the Century\". Through the 2023 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 48–28–1 and the trophy series 33–27–1.[434] Navy and Notre Dame played 93 games without interruption from 1927 to 2019. Notre Dame had a 43-game win streak during this time frame, the longest streak by one team over another in Division I-A football, which ended in 2007.[435] While the 2020 contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the series resumed in 2021. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the series 83–13–1.[436] USC is Notre Dame's primary rival, and the schools compete annually for the Jeweled Shillelagh. The rivalry has produced 39 national championships,[437]: 113–118 15 Heisman Trophy winners,[438] and 184 Consensus All-Americans through the 2021 season.[439] It is considered one of the most prominent rivalries in college football,[440][441][442][443] and has been called the greatest rivalry not dictated by conference affiliation or geography.[444] The teams have played each other annually since 1926, except from 1943 to 1945 and 2020. Notable games in the series include the 1977 \"Green Jersey\" game and the 2005 \"Bush Push\" game. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 50–37–5 and the trophy series 35–30–3.[445] Due to its long and storied history, Notre Dame football boasts many traditions unique to Notre Dame. Some of these are: Since the NFL began drafting players in 1936, 495 Notre Dame football players have been selected by NFL teams. Additionally, Notre Dame has had 65 players selected in the first round of the NFL draft, including five overall number one picks. Of the 46 Super Bowls competed, as of 2012, only 14 teams have won the event without an Irish player on the roster.[457] Looking at both participating team rosters, there have only been five Super Bowls that did not feature at least one former Notre Dame player on either team's roster – Denver vs. Atlanta, 1999; Dallas vs. Buffalo, 1994; Washington vs. Denver, 1988; Dallas vs. Denver, 1978; and Baltimore vs. Dallas, 1971.[457] Eleven former players have won multiple Super Bowls: Mark Bavaro, Rocky Bleier, Nick Buoniconti, Eric Dorsey, Dave Duerson, David Givens, Terry Hanratty, Bob Kuechenberg, Joe Montana, Steve Sylvester and Justin Tuck.[457] 13 former Notre Dame players, plus 1 non-player alumnus, have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, tying it for first with USC among all college football programs.[458][459] *McNally graduated from St. John's (MN), but started his career at Notre Dame and is listed as a hall of famer under both schools in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[460] The Fighting Irish are the only team, professional or collegiate, to have all their games broadcast nationally on the radio and their home games on television.[462] Notre Dame famously left the College Football Association, a consortium that administered television broadcast rights on behalf of over 64 schools, in 1990, in order to establish its own broadcasting deal with NBC. From 1968 to 2007, Westwood One served as the official radio partner for the Irish, broadcasting their games for 40 consecutive years.[463] Until the 2006 Air Force game, Notre Dame had a record 169 consecutive games broadcast nationally on either NBC, ABC, ESPN, or CBS.[464] The 2006 ND vs. Air Force game was broadcast on CSTV, a college sports channel owned by CBS who had an exclusive contract with the Mountain West Conference, of which Air Force is a member. Radio rights to the Fighting Irish are held by Skyview Networks, who began distributing the broadcasts as part of a multi-sport arrangement in 2020.[465] NBC has been televising Notre Dame Home football games since the 1991 season.[9] In addition to TV broadcasts, NBC also maintains several dedicated websites to ND football and Notre Dame Central,[466] which provides complete coverage, full game replays and commentary of the Notre Dame team. NBC's television contract with Notre Dame was renewed in April 2013 and was set to continue through the 2025 football season,[467] before another contract renewal was made in 2023. NBC is now set to be the home of Notre Dame football through the 2029 season. It also aired football games on NBC's streaming service Peacock started in the 2021 season, with the home opener on September 11, 2021, against Toledo aired exclusively on the streaming service.[468][469] Internationally Sky Sports has been covering Notre Dame Football home games in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Germany since 2018 as a result of Comcast's takeover of Sky Although the Notre Dame football program is not a full member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), it has an agreement to play an average of five ACC schools per season. In return Notre Dame has access to the non-College Football Playoff ACC bowl line-up.[470][471] Notre Dame utilizes a format of six home games in South Bend, five away games, and one major metropolitan area neutral site \"Shamrock Series\" home game for scheduling.[389] This includes preserving traditional yearly rivalries with USC, Stanford, and Navy,[472] five rotating ACC opponents (two away ACC games will coincide in even years with away games at Navy and three away ACC games will coincide in odd years with home games against Navy),[473] two home and home series (one home game and one away game), one one-time opponent home game, and the traveling \"Shamrock Series\" home game.[474][475] TBA: 1 additional ACC away game will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC home game and 1 additional non-ACC home game will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 3 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 3 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 4 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 5 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 5 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled.",

                "title": "Bret Bielema - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Bret Arnold Bielema (/ˈbiːləmɑː/; born January 13, 1970) is an American football coach. He is the head football coach at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, a position he has held since the 2021 season. Bielema served as the head football coach at the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 2006 to 2012, achieving a 68–24 record and taking them to three straight Rose Bowl Games, although they lost each time. He was the head football coach at University of Arkansas from 2013 to 2017, tallying a mark of 29–34. Bielema was an assistant coach in the National Football League (NFL) for three seasons, in 2018 and 2019 with the New England Patriots and in 2020 with the New York Giants. Bielema attended Prophetstown High School in Prophetstown, Illinois.[1] He played tight end and linebacker in high school. Bielema walked on as a defensive lineman at the University of Iowa under coach Hayden Fry, playing from 1989 to 1992.[2] Bielema lettered four years, earned a scholarship and served as team captain his senior season.[3] Bielema was part of the 1990 Iowa team that won a share of the Big Ten title.[4] In his senior season, after Iowa beat Iowa State 21–7, Bielema approached Iowa State head coach Jim Walden for a post-game handshake and said \"You’re a big prick. It’s been a pleasure kicking your ass the last five years\" (Iowa State had never beaten Iowa during Bielema's tenure with the team). The moment caused considerable stir, with University of Iowa officials reprimanding Bielema and sending an official letter of apology to Walden.[5] Bielema graduated from Iowa with a bachelor's degree in marketing. After going undrafted in the 1993 NFL draft, Bielema signed as a free agent with the Seattle Seahawks, but was cut during the summer.[6] In 1994 he played for the Milwaukee Mustangs, a team in the Arena Football League.[7] Bielema returned to Iowa in 1994 to begin his coaching career under Fry as a graduate assistant.[8] In 1996, he was promoted to linebackers coach, a role he would hold until 2001.[9] In 1998, Fry retired and was replaced by former Iowa offensive line coach Kirk Ferentz, who had briefly coached Bielema in offensive line sets during preparation for the 1988 Peach Bowl.[10] Bielema, one of the leading recruiters on Fry's staff, continued on the road recruiting during the coaching search. Ferentz retained only Bielema and quarterbacks coach Chuck Long from Fry's staff.[11] During his three years with Ferentz at Iowa, Bielema recruited several players, most from Florida, that would form part of the core of the 2002 Iowa team, including Heisman runner-up quarterback Brad Banks, wide receivers C. J. Jones and Maurice Brown, nose tackle Colin Cole, cornerback Antwan Allen, and linebackers Fred Barr and Abdul Hodge.[12][13] After the 2001 season, Bielema became co-defensive coordinator for the Kansas State Wildcats, coached by Bill Snyder, who had coached at Iowa with Fry for a decade. Bielema and Bob Elliott replaced Phil Bennett, who had left to become the head coach of the SMU Mustangs. Bielema coached the K-State defense for two seasons, helping the Wildcats win the 2003 Big XII Championship.[14][15] Bielema left Kansas State after the 2003 season to become the Wisconsin defensive coordinator under head coach Barry Alvarez, who had also coached at Iowa under Fry.[16] Bielema served as defensive coordinator for two seasons. In July 2005, Alvarez announced he would retire after the 2005 season and become the Badger athletic director. Alvarez also announced he had chosen Bielema as his successor, and would take over in 2006.[17] In his first season as head coach of the Badgers in 2006, Bielema's team ended the regular season 11–1 (7–1 in Big Ten Conference play).[18] With a 14–0 victory over San Diego State on September 16, 2006, Bielema became the third Wisconsin head coach to win the first three games of his career.[19] Later, with a 24–3 win over Purdue on October 21, Bielema tied the record for most wins by a first-year coach at Wisconsin with seven. The other two coaches to complete this feat were Philip King in 1896 and William Juneau in 1912.[20] A 30–24 victory over the Fighting Illini on October 28, Bielema became the first coach in Wisconsin history to win eight games in his first season.[20] He extended the record with his ninth victory on November 4, defeating the Penn State Nittany Lions, 13–3.[20] With a 24–21 victory over the Iowa Hawkeyes on November 11, Bielema became the first head coach in Big Ten history to win ten games in his first season.[21] With the 35–3 defeat of the University at Buffalo on November 18, 2006, Bielema became the first coach in school history to win 11 games in the regular season.[22] After a 17–14 victory over the Arkansas Razorbacks in the Capital One Bowl on January 1, 2007, he became the third coach in NCAA history to win 12 games in his rookie season, finishing 12–1.[23] He was named Big Ten Coach of the Year.[24] Bielema coached Wisconsin to victories in 17 of his first 18 games. That represents the third-best start to a head coaching career in Big Ten history. Michigan's Fielding H. Yost, who went 55–0–1 from 1901 to 1905.[25] He led Wisconsin to a 5–0 start in the 2007 season. He finished with a 9–4 record and #24 ranking in the final AP Poll.[26] In the 2008 season, the Badgers regressed to a 7–6 record, despite a 3–0 start.[27] Coming off of a disappointing 2008 campaign, Bielema helped lead the team to a 5–0 start to the 2009 season. The team finished #16 in the AP Poll with a 10–3 record, which was bookended by a 20–14 over the Miami Hurricanes in the Champs Sports Bowl.[28][29] On October 16, 2010, Bielema's Badgers defeated #1-ranked Ohio State, 31–18, in Madison.[30] It was Wisconsin's first victory over a #1-ranked team since 1981 when the Badgers upset Michigan.[31] The victory against the Buckeyes would be his only one as he was 1–5 against Ohio State.[32] The 2010 season ended with a loss to the TCU Horned Frogs in the Rose Bowl, 21–19.[33] The team finished with an 11–2 mark and a #7 ranking in the final AP Poll.[34] Bielema was named a finalist for the 2010 Bear Bryant Award which is given to college football's Coach of the Year. The other finalists were Chris Ault of Nevada, Gene Chizik of Auburn, Mark Dantonio of Michigan State, Jim Harbaugh of Stanford, Chip Kelly of Oregon, Gary Patterson of TCU, Bobby Petrino of Arkansas, and Mike Sherman of Texas A&M.[35] In the 2011 season, Bielema led the team to an 11–3 record and a #10 ranking in the final AP Poll.[36] Bielema is the only coach in Wisconsin history to lose consecutive Rose Bowls.[37] In the 2012 season, Bielema and the Badgers finished with 8–5 regular season record that culminated in a 70–31 victory over Nebraska in the Big Ten Championship Game.[38][39][40] On December 4, 2012, it was announced that Bielema was leaving Wisconsin to become the head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks.[41][42] He left partly to coach in the Southeastern Conference and partly because he felt that his assistant coaches were not being paid enough.[43] Bielema replaced John L. Smith, who had coached Arkansas to a 4–8 record during the 2012 season after Bobby Petrino had been fired eight months earlier.[44] Bielema's first season at Arkansas resulted in an overall record of 3–9, including 0–8 in the Southeastern Conference.[45] Bielema inherited a roster depleted of talent and lacking in development under Coach Smith. Bielema's starting quarterback also suffered a throwing shoulder injury, which limited his ability the entire season. It was the Razorbacks' worst SEC record since entering the conference in 1992 and their first winless in-conference season since 1942, when they were a member of the Southwest Conference.[46][47] Bielema's second season saw significant improvement, as Arkansas finished 7–6. Bielema won his first two SEC games in dominating fashion in November, beating #17 LSU by a score of 17–0 and #8 Ole Miss by a score of 30–0 to achieve bowl eligibility.[48][49] Though Arkansas lost its remaining conference game against Missouri, the Razorbacks were still the first unranked team in college football history to shut out two consecutive ranked opponents.[50][51] Bielema led Arkansas to a Texas Bowl victory in the postseason, defeating Texas handily, 31–7.[52] In Bielema's third season, the team suffered the loss of returning 1,190-yard starting running back Jonathan Williams before the season. Breaking in a new offensive coordinator and adjusting to losing three NFL drafted defensive players up front, the Razorbacks got off to a slow start, losing to Toledo and Texas Tech in the non-conference and started 2–4.[53][54] Bielema then caught fire in the second half of the season, going 5–1 over the final six games, losing the one game to Mississippi State on a missed field goal.[55] Bielema ended the year by defeating one of his former mentors, Bill Snyder, in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl, as Arkansas dispatched Kansas State, 45–23, to finish the season with a record of 8–5.[56][57] Bielema's fourth season was a topsy-turvy campaign that ended with two embarrassing defeats at the hands of Missouri in the regular season finale and Virginia Tech in the 2016 Belk Bowl.[58] The former saw his team blow a 17-point halftime lead and the latter was a 24-point blown halftime lead, which was the largest for Arkansas since at least 1952.[59] Beating Missouri would have resulted in Bret Bielema improving his regular season record every year at Arkansas. The losses led to the replacement of Defensive Coordinator Robb Smith with former Iowa State head coach Paul Rhoads, and other staff changes pointing to a change to a 3–4 defensive scheme.[60] Bielema was the highest paid state employee in Arkansas with a salary reported at $4,200,000.[61] Bielema's fifth season saw the program continue to regress, finishing 4–8 overall and going 1–7 in the SEC.[62] On November 24, 2017, Bielema was fired after five seasons as Arkansas's head coach following a 48–45 loss at home to the Missouri Tigers.[63] The Razorbacks twice led by 14, but lost both leads. After the game, Bielema told reporters that he had been told he was being fired while he was coming off the field.[64] According to Fox Sports' Bruce Feldman, school officials decided to announce the firing after the game so he could have a chance to address the team one last time before they headed home for Thanksgiving. The alternative would have been learning of the firing via social media or a group text message.[65] Prior to the 2018 NFL season, Bielema was hired by the New England Patriots as a defensive consultant to head coach Bill Belichick.[66] Bielema was promoted ahead of the 2019 season to defensive line coach.[67] He won his first Super Bowl title when the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII.[68] On January 21, 2020, the Giants hired Bielema as their outside linebackers coach and senior assistant under Joe Judge.[69] On December 19, 2020, Bielema was announced as the next head coach at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, succeeding Lovie Smith.[70] The school said Bielema would receive a six-year contract that paid $4.2 million the first year, with annual raises, based on performance and fulfilling media and other promotional obligations for the program throughout the contract.[71] The salary makes him the ninth-highest paid head coach among the fourteen members of the Big Ten Conference. Bielema won his first game with the Illini against the Nebraska Cornhuskers then went on a four-game losing streak to UTSA, Virginia, Maryland and Purdue. The streak ended with a win against Charlotte, but he lost the next week to Wisconsin, his former team. Following an off week, Bielema and the Fighting Illini upset 24.5-point favorite Penn State in Happy Valley, then ranked #7 in the AP Poll. The most notable part of this outcome was its nine overtime periods, which broke the FBS record for the most overtime periods in a game.[72] The Illini lost their next game to Rutgers before upsetting Minnesota, then ranked #20 in the College Football Playoff poll. Bielema did not travel with the team to Iowa having contracting COVID-19, and the Illini lost to the Hawkeyes with wide receivers coach George McDonald serving as acting head coach. After Bielema returned, he won his final game of the season at home against Northwestern. This marked the Illini's first win against the rival Wildcats since 2014. Bielema finished his first season at Illinois with an overall record of 5–7, and a Big Ten record of 4–5, which placed the Illini fifth in the Big Ten West Division.[73][74] Bielema's second season at Illinois began with a victory over Wyoming, a disappointing loss at Indiana, followed by six consecutive victories over Virginia, Chattanooga, at Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and at Nebraska, making the Illini record 7–1. Bielema and Illinois could not maintain their win streak, dropping their next three games to Michigan State, Purdue, and at Michigan. The Illini won their eighth game of the 2022 season by beating in-state rival Northwestern in Evanston to close out the regular season with a record of 8–4.[75] Illinois accepted an invitation to the 2023 ReliaQuest Bowl in Tampa on January 2, against the Mississippi State Bulldogs. Mississippi State, inspired by the untimely death of their head coach Mike Leach, beat Illinois 19–10 in the bowl.[76] This was Illinois' first bowl game since 2019 and their first winning season since 2011.[77] In the 2023 season, Bielema and the Fighting Illini finished with a 5–7 record.[78] Bielema grew up on an 80-acre hog farm near Prophetstown, Illinois with brothers Bart and Barry.[79] Each of the brothers competed in football, track, and wrestling.[80] Bielema married Jen Hielsberg on March 10, 2012, in Madison.[81][82] Their first daughter, Briella, was born in 2017. Their second daughter, Brexli, was born in 2019.[83] Arkansas sports radio personality Bo Mattingly debuted a series featuring Bielema entitled 'Being Bret Bielema' on February 25, 2016.[84] *Ohio State was the Big Ten Leaders Division champion, but third place Wisconsin represented the division in the Big Ten Championship Game due to the fact that Ohio State and second place Penn State were both ineligible from post-season play by the NCAA. ‡Bielema left for Arkansas before the bowl game and the ranking reflects the team's ranking at the time of Bielema's departure. # denotes interim head coach # denotes interim head coach # denotes interim head coach",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. South Carolina coach Shane Beamer had to be held back by team staff members after Illinois coach Bret Bielema taunted the Gamecocks during the third quarter of the Citrus Bowl, an eventual 21-17 Illinois win. The incident occurred when Bielema walked across the field to check on injured Illini defensive back Jaheim Clarke. Bielema then held up his arms in an apparent signaling of substitution, which caused Beamer to run onto the field incensed. Beamer had to be held back and could be seen telling the game's sideline reporter, \"you saw what he did.\" pic.twitter.com/DySr5iz34A Illinois had been taking advantage of late substitutions all game, forcing Beamer to burn two timeouts. The South Carolina coach was been visibly upset about the strategy, but it is legal. \"It's heated and competitive out there but in all my years of being around football, I've never seen an opposing coach come over to the opposing team's sideline and basically make a gesture toward the opposing head coach,\" Beamer told reporters after the game, continuing: \"I think his issue was when we threw the throw-back kickoff return, our kickoff returner did this, which most teams that's a signal that it's a touchback and we're not going to return the kick. You're allowed to do that as long as you don't do a waving motion. It's no different than on a punt. If the punt returner comes pointing to the ball that's bouncing on the ground, he's allowed to return it. If you're doing this, you're not allowed to return it. There was no waving of the arms, and I cleared it with the Big 12 officials before the game. I told them we were going to do it, making sure they were good with it, and they said, 'Yeah, just as long as he doesn't wave the arms.' I think he had an issue with that.\" Shane Beamer talking about Bret Bielema’s taunting.Said he’s never seen a head coach do something like that in all of his years coaching pic.twitter.com/jvPKFpoTN1 The post-game handshake between Beamer and Bielema was civil despite the in-game confrontation. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "Bret Bielema was named as the 26th Fighting Illini Head Football Coach in the history of the program in December 2020. A native of Prophetstown, Illinois, Bielema has 27 years of collegiate coaching experience and compiled a 16-year record of 124-80 (.608) as head coach at Wisconsin, Arkansas, and Illinois, prior to the Illini's Cheez-It Citrus Bowl appearance on Dec. 31. Bielema, who signed a six-year agreement in 2022 that will keep him at Illinois through 2028, has elevated Illinois to new heights during his first four seasons with 27 wins and 18 Big Ten victories. He has brought national relevance to the Fighting Illini program with continued appearances in the AP Top 25 and College Football Playoff rankings, two New Year’s Bowls, three national award finalists, and 11 NFL Draft picks since he arrived in 2021. In 16 years as a Power-4 head coach, Bielema has led 12 of his teams - including this year’s Illinois squad - to bowl games. This season, Illinois has been ranked by the CFP selection committee for a program-record four straight weeks, appeared in 11 AP Top 25 polls, and won nine or more regular season games for the eighth time in program history. Illinois will go for win #10 at the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl, which would tie a program record for wins in a season. Bielema is the first Illini coach to go to two bowl games in his first four seasons since Lou Tepper (1991-94), after guiding Illinois to the 2023 ReliaQuest Bowl, Illinois' first January bowl in 15 years, in just his second season in Champaign. The 2022 Illini won eight games, were ranked by the CFP committee for the first time in program history, reached as high as No. 14 in the AP poll, led the nation in scoring defense (12.8) for the first time in program history, and led the nation and set a school record in interceptions (24). Two Illini were national awards finalists in 2022 in RB Chase Brown (Doak Walker Award) and CB Devon Witherspoon (Paycom Jim Thorpe Award), representing the first time an Illini finished in the top three of either the Doak Walker Award or Thorpe Award. Witherspoon was also Illinois' first winner of the Big Ten's Tatum-Woodson Defensive Back of the Year, one of five Illini to be named an All-American, and one of 19 Illini to earn All-Big Ten honors, the most in program history. Illinois' five All-Americans included Witherspoon, who was the first Illini defensive back in history to be named a Consensus All-American, RB Chase Brown, DB Sydney Brown, DT Jer'Zhan Newton, and OL Alex Palczewski, who was the first Illini offensive tackle in history to earn a first team All-America honor. A year later in 2023, Newton became the program's next Consensus All-American and was a finalist for the Nagurski Trophy. Bielema has also turned Illinois into one of the top programs in producing NFL talent. Illinois is one of five schools with three or more players drafted in the first three rounds in both the 2023 and 2024 NFL Drafts, along with Alabama, Georgia, Michigan, and Penn State. Overall, Bielema has sent over 160 players to the NFL during his career as a head coach. After the success of the 2022 season, Illinois had one of its most impressive NFL Drafts in recent history. Witherspoon was selected #5 overall to become the highest-drafted defensive back in Illinois history, and fellow DBs Jartavius Martin (No. 47 overall, Washington) and Sydney Brown (No. 66 overall, Philadelphia) went in the second and third rounds, respectively. The Illini were the only team in the nation to have three defensive backs off the board in the first three rounds of the 2023 NFL Draft. RB Chase Brown (No. 163 overall, Cincinnati) was also selected in the fifth round, Bielema's 11th running back coached in college to make it to the NFL. The Illini followed up its success in the 2023 NFL Draft with four more selections in the 2024 NFL Draft. DT Jer'Zhan Newton (No. 36 overall, Washington) was the third-highest drafted defensive tackle in Illinois history, OL Isaiah Adams (No. 71 overall, Arizona) was the highest-drafted Illini offensive lineman since 2012, TE Tip Reiman (No. 82 overall, Arizona) was the second-highest drafted tight end in Illinois history, and WR Casey Washington (No. 187 overall, Atlanta) was the first Fighting Illini wide receiver drafted since 2012. Illinois is one of five schools with three or more players drafted in the first three rounds in the 2023 and 2024 NFL Drafts, along with Alabama, Georgia, Michigan, and Penn State. In Bielema’s first season in Champaign, Illinois went 5-7 overall with a 4-5 Big Ten record, including ranked road wins over #7 Penn State in the longest game in college football history (9 OT) and #20 Minnesota, the Illini's first-ever win over a College Football Playoff ranked opponent. Illinois' scoring defense (31st from 97th), third-down defense (31st from 89th), and total defense (52nd from 114th) all improved more than 50 spots in the national rankings from 2020. The Illini made massive gains in the Big Ten defensive rankings as well, jumping 9+ spots in scoring defense (4th from 14th), touchdowns allowed (t-3rd from 14th), yards allowed per game (5th from 14th), and passing yards allowed per game (1st from 10th). From 2006-12 Bielema was the head coach at Wisconsin, where he led the Badgers to three straight Big Ten championships (2010-12), six consecutive bowl games, and a 68-24 record (.739). Bielema then spent five seasons as head coach at Arkansas from 2013-17. After inheriting a depleted roster and enduring a difficult first season, he led the Razorbacks to three consecutive bowl games, including victories against Texas in 2014 and Kansas State in 2015. In Bielema's debut season at Wisconsin in 2006, the Badgers finished 12-1, including a victory in the Capital One Bowl against Arkansas. He was the first coach in Big Ten history to win 10 games in his first season, the first Wisconsin coach to win 11 games prior to a bowl game, and he became the third coach in NCAA history to win 12 games in his first season. Bielema won 17 of his first 18 games with the Badgers. The Badgers shared or won Big Ten championships three straight seasons from 2010-12, and he led Wisconsin to victories in the first two Big Ten championship games. Bielema's coaching pedigree and list of football mentors match that of any coach in the nation. He played for and coached under Hall-of-Famer Hayden Fry, helping the Hawkeyes share the 1990 Big Ten title with Illinois. After two years as a graduate assistant and six seasons as linebackers coach at Iowa, Bielema spent two years as Co-Defensive Coordinator at Kansas State under Hall-of-Famer Bill Snyder, helping the Wildcats win the 2003 Big 12 Championship. Two seasons later, he was named Defensive Coordinator at Wisconsin under Hall-of-Famer Barry Alvarez and moved into the head coaching role of the Badgers in 2006 when Alvarez retired. Bielema spent the previous three seasons before Illinois in the National Football League. His first two seasons in the NFL were with the New England Patriots as a consultant to six-time Super Bowl champion head coach Bill Belichick in 2018 and as the team's defensive line coach in 2019, when the Patriots won the AFC East with a 12-4 record and had the NFL's best defense. In Bielema's first season with the Patriots, New England went 11-5 and defeated the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII. He was the outside linebackers coach and senior assistant for the New York Giants during the 2020 season. Bielema was a defensive lineman at Iowa from 1989-92, when he was a four-time letterman under Fry. After joining the team as a walk-on, Bielema earned a scholarship after his first year, started as a junior, and was named a team captain for his senior season. Bielema graduated from Iowa in 1992 with a bachelor's degree in marketing. Following his graduation, Bielema signed a free-agent contract with the Seattle Seahawks and ended his playing career in 1994 as a member of the Milwaukee Mustangs of the Arena Football League. He and his wife, Jen, have two daughters, Briella Nicole and Brexli Nichole. Thanks for visiting !
