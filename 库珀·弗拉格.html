                <h2 class="article-title">Cooper Flagg - Wikipedia</h2>
                <p class="article-content">Cooper Flagg is a highly regarded American college basketball player currently playing for the Duke Blue Devils in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Born on December 21, 2006, in Newport, Maine, Flagg began his high school career at Nokomis Regional High School, where he made history as the first freshman to win the Maine Gatorade Player of the Year, averaging impressive stats including 20.5 points, 10 rebounds, and notable defensive numbers. He led Nokomis to a Class A state championship before transferring to Montverde Academy in Florida after his freshman year.

At Montverde, Flagg continued to excel, earning accolades such as MVP of the 2023 Hoophall Classic and being named a semifinalist for the Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award. He averaged 16.4 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 2.7 blocks in his senior year, leading his team to a perfect 34-0 record and a national title. Flagg was recognized as the top recruit in the 2024 class and received multiple national player of the year honors.

In October 2023, Flagg verbally committed to Duke University, signing his National Letter of Intent shortly after. He enrolled at Duke in June 2024 and made a strong debut in the 2024 season opener, scoring 18 points against Maine. Flagg's standout performance came on January 12, 2025, when he scored 42 points against Notre Dame, setting freshman scoring records for both Duke and the ACC.

Flagg has also represented the United States in international competition, playing for the under-17 team at the 2022 FIBA Under-17 Basketball World Cup, where he contributed to the team's gold medal victory and was named to the All-Tournament Team. He was honored as the 2022 USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year, becoming the youngest recipient of this award.

Off the court, Flagg comes from a basketball family; his mother played college basketball, and his father played at the junior college level. He has a fraternal twin brother, Ace, who is also pursuing a basketball career. Flagg has made headlines for his endorsement deals, including becoming the first men's college basketball player sponsored by Gatorade and signing a deal with New Balance.</p>
