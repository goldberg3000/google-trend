The tournament, which has staged its closing matches in Qatar this week, effectively replaces the FIFA Club World Cup, which will now take place in an expanded 32-team format next summer. The name is taken from the old annual showdown between the champions of Europe and South America staged between 1960 and 2004. Madrid won that competition three times in 1960, 1998 and 2002, losing the 1966 and 2000 finals. Liga MX side Pachuca denied us the traditional feel of a UEFA vs. CONMEBOL matchup by soundly beating Copa Libertadores winners Botafogo 3-0.

Salomon Rondon MORE: All the latest soccer news | Real Madrid news | Explaining how 'socios' own Real Madrid 84 mins: GOOOOAAAAAALLLLLL!!!! Vinicius (pen)!!!! In truth, it's not a great penalty from Vinicius and Moreno guesses correctly but there's just enough on the strike for it to squirm under the Pachuca goalkeeper. 83 mins: PENALTY TO REAL MADRID! Idrissi is penalised. That feels harsh. There might have been faint contact but Ceballos knew what he was doing and it's one of those that looks more like a penalty the more you watch it. 81 mins: Ceballos goes down looking for a penalty. The crowd boo but the referee could not have been less convinced. On the replay it looks like a dive but Valenzuela is going to the monitor. 80 mins: This is a little gem of a cameo from the magisterial Modric, who forces Sanchez into a last-ditch tackle. 75 mins: Double change for Pachuca, with Sanchez and Mena into the action in place of the industrious Rodriguez and Bautista. 74 mins: Modric orchestrates a fine Madrid attack, Bellingham finds another cute through-ball and Moreno has to deny Vinicius with his leg. 73 mins: Modric floats one a free-kick into the box but Moreno is out to claim. 70 mins: Rondon gets up to meet Montiel's cross and heads onto the roof of the net! 69 mins: Bellingham and Valverde work an attack to Vinicius, who drags his right-footed effort wide. Rodrygo is making way for Luka Modric, 39 years young. He will collect trophy 28 of his Madrid career unless something crazy happens over the closing minutes. 67 mins: Free-kick to Pachuca, fairly straight and north of 35 yards form goal. Rondon arrows a fine low strike that Courtois beats out of his bottom right corner. 64 mins: Some more sloppy playing out from Madrid. It goes unpunished but they've probably eased off too much since Rodrygo doubled the lead. 61 mins: Double change for Madrid as Ceballos and Diaz come on for Camavinga and Mbappe. 60 mins: Courtois does well to get down to Gonzalez's cross with the veteran striker Rondon poised to take advantage. 59 mins: Dreadful giveaway in midfield by Madrid, who scramble back and the Pachuca attack progresses to Rodriguez down the right but no further. 56 mins: THE GOAL STANDS! Referee Valenzuela explains over the stadium PA - a good innovation whenever it's used, in my opinion, that he did not believe Bellingham to be interfering. 55 mins: VAR REVIEW! Hang on, they're having a look at Rodrygo's goal. Bellingham was in an offside position, squatting down in front of the goalkeeper. The question now is whether or not the Englishman is deeper to be interfering with play. 53 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLL!!!!! Rodrygo!!!! A wonderful goal from the Brazil winger, who collects the ball in the D, twists and turns away from a couple of challenges and then curls a superb strike beyond Moreno from the edge of the box. 51 mins: Sharp effort from Deossa that deflects off Garcia and goes behind for a corner. Again, the delivery isn't great. Off we go again. Can Pachuca flip the script and deny Real Madrid their latest trophy? They've 45 minutes to turn the tide. Pachuca kept Madrid at bay and competed well for most of the opening 45 minutes. But Madrid threatened to run away with things in the minutes immediately after Mbappe's opening goal and they will fancy doing so when the action resumes. 45 mins: There'll be one added minute and Pachuca seem to have effectively weathered the storm that followed Mbappe's goal. 39 mins: Now Valverde gets into the box on the right-hand side and clatters over the near post. Halftime suddenly feels a long time away for Pachuca. 38 mins; The goal was Real Madrid's first short on target and Mbappe fancies another as he thuds a low drive wide from outside the box. 37 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLL!!!!! Kylian Mbappe!!!! Madrid's stars combine to break the deadlock. Bellingham cutely plays through Vinicius, who deftly dummies his way around Moreno and cuts back across goal for Mbappe to convert. 34 mins: Moreno is out sharply to make a fine close-range save from Rodrygo. Then the offside flag goes up. 29 mins: Pachuca surge up the other end and Gonzalez wins a corner, which is taken short. Bautista has a faintly ludicrous shot from about 35 yards that's miles off target. 28 mins: Madrid continue to knock at the door but Mbappe can't quite get the ball out of his feet and is crowded out. 22 mins: Fantastic sliding block from Micolta to deny Rodrygo. The Pachuca defender came out of nowhere then. Madrid can't make the corner count but this is starting to feel like a pretty taxing experience for their opponents. 16 mins: Quick VAR check after a coming together between Valverde and Deossa in the Madrid box. Nothing in that though, no need for a check on the screen. On we go. 14 mins: Rudiger pings a cross-field ball for Rodrygo, who wants a free-kick following Bryan Gonzalez's challenge. Nothing doing and that's a goal kick. 12 mins: Into the Pachuca area in a flash and Vinicius wins a corner. Played short by Rodrygo, doesn't really work but they get another go. Now Bellingham can't get to a near-post delivery. 11 mins: Pachuca are switching play effectively here, pushing Madrid back and they win another corner. Montiel's delivery is cleared and here come Vinicius and Mbappe... 7 mins: Oh, hello! Pachuca right-back Rodriguez is allowed to advance and slaps a low shot from just over 25 yards. Courtois scrambles to push it around the post and Madrid deal with the corner. 5 mins: A Madrid attack breaks down after Mbappe is penalised for handball. He reckons the ball hit his stomach and I dare say he has a point. Off we go. Real Madrid settle into some calm possession before Courtois launches it forward to no one in particular. 4 mins before kickoff: Here come the teams, entering the scene of the 2022 FIFA World Cup final. It means Kylian Mbappe is back at the scene of both an unforgettable hat-trick and probably his most crushing career disappointment. Lusail Stadium was heaving that night in 2022. Two years on, there are definitely more than a few seats going spare. 20 mins before kickoff: So, not to get all existential, why are we all here? Well, this competition basically fills the gap in the schedule (woe betide we have one of those) left by the FIFA Club World Cup, which will now take place as a 32-team expanded tournament next year to ensure we have no gaps in the schedule. Anyway, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup featured knockout games with the club champions from FIFA's six affiliated confederations. Real Madrid gained an automatic place in the final and Pachuca booked their spot by stunning Copa Libertadores winners Botafogo 3-0 in the 'Derby of the Americas' on December 11 before knocking out Al Ahly on penalties. The old Intercontinental Cup was played between the UEFA and CONMEBOL champions from 1960 to 2004, with Real Madrid prevailing on three occasions. 45 mins before kickoff: This is how Pachuca line up . It looks like that might be a narrow 4-4-2 diamond as they seek to starve Madrid of room in central areas. 🌪️ | Este es el #XITuzo con el que hoy salimos al campo a dejar la vida ante el Real Madrid por la Copa Intercontinental.🔥¡ADELANTE TUZOS!🔥#PachucaParaElMundo🤍💙 | #RealMadridPachuca pic.twitter.com/UvZkcGiMM2 1 hour before kickoff: Here's the confirmed Real Madrid team news. Aurelien Tchouameni gets the nod to start alongside Antonio Rudiger at centre-back.

This is a new competition... and an old competition. We'll explain everything in due course. The Intercontinental Cup final kicks off in Lusail, Qatar at 8 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: Ancelotti has named a strong squad for the trip to Lusail with the Italian hoping to lift a trophy to ease some pressure following a mixed start to the season. The main news focuses on a return to fitness for Kylian Mbappe after he missed the weekend 3-3 La Liga draw at Rayo Vallecano, with fellow France star Eduardo Camavinga also back. However, defensive quartet Ferland Mendy, Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao and David Alaba all remain sidelined. Real Madrid lineup (4-3-3, right to left): Courtois (GK) — Vazquez, Tchouameni Rudiger, Garcia — Valverde, Bellingham, Camavinga — Rodrygo, Mbappe, Vinicius Jr. Injured: Mendy (calf), Carvajal (knee), Militao (knee), Alaba (knee)Suspended: None Pachuca knocked out Copa Libertadores champions Botafogo in the quartefinals and beat Al Ahly on penalties in the semifinals. Despite the quick turnaround between games, they could stick with an unchanged lineup, including former Premier League striker Salomon Rondon. Pachuca predicted lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Moreno (GK) — Rodriguez, Cabral, Micolta, B. Gonzalez — Avalos, Pedraza — A. Gonzalez, Gutierrez, Idrissi — Rondon Injured: Barreto (knee)Suspended: None Here's how to watch this FIFA Intercontinental Cup match across selected areas of the world's major regions: Dom is the senior content producer for Sporting News UK.

Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid enters the match as firm favorites, aiming to secure their ninth Intercontinental title. Fresh off their Champions League triumph in June. The team last claimed this prestigious honor in 2023 and is eager to extend their legacy. Pachuca's route to the final has been marked by resilience and determination.

Pachuca (4-2-3-1): Moreno; Luis Rodríguez, Barreto, Micolta, Bryan González; Montiel, Peraza; Idrissi, Bautista, Deossa, Rondón. Lineups are announced and players are warming up. Mbappe starts as the attacking trident is back. Tchouaméni remains in the center of the defense. Real Madrid's squad is bolstered by the return of Kylian Mbappe, who missed their recent 3-3 draw with Rayo Vallecano due to a thigh injury. Alongside Vinicius Junior, the duo forms a lethal attacking partnership that could prove too much for Pachuca to handle. Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo, and Federico Valverde add depth to an already star-studded lineup. However, Madrid's defensive options remain limited. With season-ending injuries to Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, and Ferland Mendy, Carlo Ancelotti has had to rely on Aurelien Tchouameni and Antonio Rudiger as makeshift center-backs. David Alaba's recent return to training provides a glimmer of hope, but he has not been included in the squad for this trip. Real Madrid possible starting XI: Courtois; Vazquez, Tchouameni, Rudiger, Garcia; Valverde, Camavinga, Bellingham; Rodrygo, Mbappe, Vinicius Jr Pachuca possible starting XI: Moreno; Rodriguez, Cabral, Micolta, Gonzalez; Montiel, Pedraza, Deossa, Bautista, Idrissi; Rondon For fans in the United Kingdom, Real Madrid vs Pachuca can be seen on DAZN UK.

                "content": "Sport | Football Real Madrid vs Pachuca LIVE! Real Madrid are in Qatar this evening to contest the final of the 2024 Intercontinental Cup against Mexican giants Pachuca. Kylian Mbappe starts alongside Vinicius Jr at the Lusail Stadium after injury, boosting the Champions League holders after Saturday’s six-goal draw at Rayo Vallecano that saw the title holders drop to third in LaLiga. Carlo Ancelotti is out to secure the 15th major trophy of his Madrid career that would see him move clear of Miguel Munoz as the club’s most successful manager ever. But Los Blancos could face a tough test against Pachuca, who won the Concacaf Champions Cup earlier this year and eased past Copa Libertadores winners Botafogo in a Derby of the Americas shock last week before then holding their nerve in a Challenger Cup penalty shootout triumph that followed a goalless draw with CAF Champions League holders Al Ahly. Both sides are bidding to become the first winners of this inaugural trophy in a competition that is similar to the old format of the Club World Cup, which has been significantly revamped and expanded and moved to the summer. Follow Real Madrid vs Pachuca in the Intercontinental Cup final live below! Real Madrid vs Pachuca latest news Live updates 84 mins: Not a great penalty by any means from Vinicius Jr, who goes low and almost down the middle. Moreno gets his hand on it, but can’t keep it out. Game, set and match, Real Madrid. 83 mins: After another long look at the replays, the referee does award the spot-kick. Vinicius Jr to step up and set the seal on Real Madrid’s fifth major trophy win of 2024... 81 mins: Lovely little flick from Lucas Vazquez to bamboozle Idrissi, who looks to trip the Spaniard inside the box. Referee Jesus Valenzuela says no penalty initially as play goes on, but Real Madrid are incensed. The VAR will send him to check the monitor again... 78 mins: Brahim Diaz tried his luck a few moments ago, but could not hit the target to put this game firmly to bed for Real Madrid. Bellingham still largely running the show here, with Modric eyeing a chance to get on the scoresheet late off the bench. 74 mins: A double change from Pachuca now as Uruguayan head coach Guillermo Almada looks to his bench for the first time tonight - slightly surprising given the scoreline, time remaining and their tiring exploits in Qatar already this week. Carlos Sanchez and Angel Mena replace Luis Rodriguez and Bautista. 72 mins: Wonderful football from Real Madrid as Bellingham combines brilliantly inside the box with Vinicius Jr, who can’t lift the ball over Moreno. Brahim Diaz’s dangerous low ball into the six-yard box is then hacked clear. 70 mins: What a chance for Pachuca! Rondon soars high above Tchouameni to connect with Montiel’s enticing cross and whistle a header narrowly over the crossbar with Courtois at full stretch. So close. 68 mins: Valverde tees us Vinicius Jr for a low shot that is dragged wide of the far post. Madrid are claiming a deflection and a corner, but a goal kick is given. Luka Modric is coming on for Los Blancos in place of Rodrygo. Both Madrid goalscorers now off. 66 mins: This is a positive little spell from Pachuca now and Rondon’s powerful low free-kick from range is tipped away by Courtois. 63 mins: Rondon gives up a foul as he tries to hit back for Pachuca. An eerily quiet atmosphere inside the Lusail Stadium rather gives this the feel of a pre-season game. A far cry from the unforgettable 2022 World Cup final held at the same venue.

                "content": "Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Two pilots were killed when a small plane crashed into an abandoned building near Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu on Tuesday afternoon, unleashing flames and black smoke. A Kamaka Air Cessna 208 was conducting a training flight when it crashed into the building around 3:15 p.m. local time Tuesday, Ed Sniffen, the director of Hawaii’s Department of Transportation, told reporters. “It’s not a charter flight, it was a training flight,” Sniffen said. “Two souls were on board. Both perished.” The building, owned by the Department of Transportation, was vacant. Sniffen noted that the pilots, according to witnesses, avoided “quite a bit of structures, including our fuel farm, to minimize the impacts.” The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration are investigating the cause of the crash. Audio transmissions from Kamaka Air 689 revealed the air traffic control tower asked, “You’re turning right, correct?” And a pilot on board responded, “We’re out of control here,” Hawaii News Now reported. Witnesses reported seeing the small plane flying low then hearing a loud boom, followed by plumes of smoke. “I was sitting at my desk and all of a sudden, I saw a small plane fly past my office window, which is on the seventh floor. And I went, ‘Oh, he’s really, really low,’ and he started banking and going back towards the airport, and then I heard a loud bang,” witness Nancy Timko told Hawaii News Now. Firefighters responded and were able to contain the fire to the exterior portion of the building. Honolulu Fire Chief Sheldon Hao said the Cessna had hit an exterior stairwell area. He said the debris field was no more than 50 feet. Kamaka Air said in a statement Tuesday: “It is with heavy hearts that Kamaka Air confirms the loss of two members of the Kamaka Air family in an accident at 3:13 this afternoon.” The company, which conducts air cargo flights and charter services, did not disclose the names of the pilots on board. Daniel K. Inouye International Airport facilities were operational after the crash, but Ualena and Aolele Streets near the wreckage were closed. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said in a statement: “Jaime’s and my hearts go out to the pilot and passenger and their families as well as to all who have experienced this traumatic event.” “Our Department of Transportation team will provide all necessary support to federal officials, whose job it will be to investigate this incident and determine a cause, which may not be known for some time,” he added. The building hit in the crash had been slated for demolishment before the crash, and will be demolished soon, Sniffen said.

Two people were on board a Kamaka Air Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft when it crashed shortly after take off from Honolulu International Airport at 3 p.m. HST on Tuesday. The aircraft hit a vacant, state-owned building on Aolele Street, just outside the airport, that is due for demolition. There have been no reports of any ground injuries. The two deceased have not yet been formally identified, but according to a report by Hawaii News Now, the pair were conducting pilot training when the crash took place. While the cause of the crash is yet to be confirmed, the news outlet reported that one of those on board told air traffic control that the plane was \"out of control.\" Witness Nancy Timko, who works near to the crash site, told Hawaii News Now: \"I was sitting at my desk and all of a sudden, I saw a small plane fly past my office window, which is on the seventh floor. And I went, 'Oh, he's really, really low,' and he started banking and going back towards the airport, and then I heard a loud bang.\" Kamaka Air is a cargo company that transports goods throughout the state. Operations at Honolulu Airport, which serves some 21 million passengers every year, were not impacted. David Hinderland, Kamaka Air CEO: \"It is with heavy hearts that Kamaka Air confirms the loss of two members of the Kamaka Air family in an accident at 3:13 this afternoon near the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport. We are not releasing the names of the pilots until family members have had a chance to process this tragedy, and we hope the media will give them the same consideration.\" Department of Transportation Director Edwin Sniffen: \"HFD (Honolulu Fire Department) and [Honolulu Emergency Services] responded to the scene very quickly to make sure that they put out the fire, clear the debris and cleared the building to ensure there was nobody inside that got hurt. The great thing is, [the] building was abandoned... so nobody was inside at the time.\" Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi: \"I am deeply saddened by the tragic plane crash on Oahu this afternoon that claimed the lives of two employees of Kamaka Air.

        "Herschel Walker": [
            {
                "title": "Herschel Walker - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Herschel Junior Walker (born March 3, 1962) is an American politician, and former professional football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons. Off the field, he was the Republican nominee in the 2022 United States Senate election in Georgia, and is the presumptive nominee for United States Ambassador to the Bahamas in President-elect Donald Trump's second term.[4] Walker played college football at the University of Georgia, where he won the Heisman Trophy as a junior.[5] He spent the first three seasons of his professional career with the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League (USFL) and was the league's MVP during its final season in 1985. After the USFL folded, Walker joined the NFL with the Dallas Cowboys, earning consecutive Pro Bowl and second-team All-Pro honors from 1987 to 1988. In 1989, Walker was traded to the Minnesota Vikings, which is regarded as one of the most lopsided trades in NFL history and credited with establishing the Cowboys' dynasty of the 1990s. He was later a member of the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants before retiring with the Cowboys. Walker was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999. Outside of football, Walker was a member of the United States' bobsleigh team at the 1992 Winter Olympics and pursued business ventures in food processing. From 2019 to 2020, he served as a co-chair on the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition under President Donald Trump. Walker launched his first political campaign in Georgia's 2022 Senate election, which he lost to Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock.[6] On December 18, 2024 President-elect Trump announced that Walker would be nominated to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas.[7] Walker was born in Augusta, Georgia, to Willis and Christine Walker. He was raised in Wrightsville, Georgia.[8] He was one of seven children. Walker said that as a child, he was overweight and had a stutter.[9][10] Walker attended Johnson County High School in Wrightsville, where he played football, basketball, and competed in track. He played for the Johnson County Trojans high school football team from 1976 to 1979. In his senior year, he rushed for 3,167 yards, helping the Trojans win their first state championship.[11] He was awarded the inaugural Dial Award as 1979 national high school scholar-athlete of the year.[12] Walker also competed on the Trojans track and field team in events ranging from the 100-yard dash to the shot put.[13] He won the shot put, 100-yard dash, and 220-yard dash events at the Georgia High School Association T&F State Championships. He also anchored the 4×400 team to victory. [citation needed] In his 2008 autobiography, Walker wrote that he was the Beta Club president and class valedictorian at Johnson County High School.[14] In December 2021, Walker's Senate campaign website claimed he graduated as the valedictorian of the entire high school, but CNN found no evidence for this claim.[14] The claim on Walker's website was later removed and amended to state that Walker graduated high school \"top of his class\".[14] Starting in 2017, Walker has made the false claim that he had graduated from University of Georgia \"in the top 1% of his class\".[14] In fact, he did not graduate, and left college to join the USFL.[15] He did not return to complete his degree.[16][14] In December 2021, Walker's Senate campaign website deleted the assertions about his education after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution inquired about it, with Walker acknowledging in a statement that he left the university prior to graduation to play professional football.[17] Walker later falsely asserted he never said he graduated from the university.[16] Walker played running back and ran on the track and field team for the University of Georgia, where he was a three-time unanimous All-American (football and track), and winner of the 1982 Heisman Trophy and Maxwell Award.[18] He is the first NCAA player who played only three years to finish in the top 10 in rushing yards, a mark later tied by Jonathan Taylor.[citation needed] During his freshman season in 1980, Walker set the NCAA freshman rushing record which was later broken by Taylor. Walker finished third in Heisman voting. Walker was the first \"true freshman\" to become a first-team All-American.[19] As a freshman, he played a major role in helping Georgia go undefeated and win the de facto national championship with a victory over Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl. In 1999, Walker was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame.[18] Walker signed with the New Jersey Generals in 1983, owned by Oklahoma oil tycoon J. Walter Duncan, who after the 1983 season sold the team to Donald Trump.[20] Walker attracted only one major promotional offer, a joint project of McDonald's and Adidas. The Dallas Cowboys, aware of Walker's earlier interest in playing for them, acquired Walker's NFL rights by selecting him in the fifth round (114th overall) of the 1985 NFL draft.[21] In 1986, he was signed by the Cowboys and moved to fullback, so he could share backfield duties with Tony Dorsett, becoming the second Heisman backfield tandem in NFL history, after George Rogers and Earl Campbell teamed with the 1984 New Orleans Saints. This move created tension, as it would limit Dorsett's playing time, and because Walker's $5 million five-year contract exceeded his $4.5 million five-year contract.[citation needed] Walker rushed for the game-winning touchdown with a minute to play in the 31–28 victory against the New York Giants in the season opener. In the week 15 game against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had a franchise-record 292 yards of total offense, including the NFL's longest run of the year with an 84-yarder for a touchdown and an 84-yard touchdown reception.[22] In 1987, Walker complained to Cowboys management about being moved around between three different positions (running back, fullback, wide receiver) and that Dorsett had more carries. He would be the team's main running back, playing in 12 games (11 starts), while registering 891 rushing yards, 715 receiving yards, and 8 touchdowns. Dorsett played in 12 games (6 starts) and had two healthy DNP (Did Not Play), which would make him demand a trade that would send him to the Denver Broncos.[23] Walker established himself as an NFL running back in 1988, becoming a one-man offense, reaching his NFL career highs of 1,514 rushing yards and 505 receiving yards, while playing seven positions: halfback, fullback, tight end, H-back, wide receiver, both in the slot and as a flanker.[24] He became the 10th player in NFL history to amass more than 2,000 combined rushing and receiving yards in a season. In the process he achieved two consecutive Pro Bowls (1987 and 1988).[25][26] In 1989, the Cowboys traded Walker to the Minnesota Vikings for a total of five players (linebacker Jesse Solomon, defensive back Issiac Holt, running back Darrin Nelson, linebacker David Howard, defensive end Alex Stewart) and six future draft picks. The five players were tied to potential draft picks Minnesota would give Dallas if a player was cut (which led to Emmitt Smith, Russell Maryland, Kevin Smith, and Darren Woodson). Walker's trade to Minnesota was initially considered by many as supplying the Vikings with the \"missing piece\" for a Super Bowl run; however, over time, as the Cowboys' fortunes soared and the Vikings' waned, it became viewed as, perhaps, the most lopsided trade in NFL history.[27][28][29] From the moment he arrived in Minneapolis, \"Herschel Mania\" erupted. After a 2½ hour practice where he studied 12 offensive plays, Walker debuted against the Green Bay Packers. He received three standing ovations from the record Metrodome crowd of 62,075, producing a Vikings win after four successive losses and 14 of the prior 18 games with the Packers. Scout.com says, \"Walker was never used properly by the coaching brain trust.\"[30] \"Herschel the Turkey\", a mock honor given out by the Star Tribune newspaper to inept Minnesota sports personalities, is named for him.[31] After three seasons in Minnesota, the Philadelphia Eagles signed Walker in 1992 hoping he would help them reach the Super Bowl. That year, he rushed 267 times for 1,070 rushing yards and eight rushing touchdowns to go along with 38 receptions for 278 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns as the Eagles advanced to the Divisional Round before being eliminated.[32][33] In the 1993 season, Walker rushed 174 times for 746 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown. He was a significant part of the receiving game for the 8–8 Eagles with 75 receptions for 610 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns.[34][35] In 1994 he became the first NFL player to have one-play gains of 90 or more yards rushing, receiving and kick-returning in a single season. He spent three seasons in Philadelphia, leaving after the Eagles signed free agent Ricky Watters. The New York Giants signed Walker in 1995 to a three-year contract worth $4.8 million[36] as a third-down back. Walker led the Giants with 45 kick returns at 21.5 yards per return in 1995, his only season with the team.[37] In 1996, he rejoined the Dallas Cowboys as a kickoff return specialist and third-down back. He also played fullback, but primarily as a ball-handler instead of a blocker out of I-Form and pro-sets. Walker retired at the end of the 1997 season. In 1992, Walker competed in the Winter Olympics in Albertville, France as a member of the United States' bobsleigh team. Originally selected for the four-man team, he eventually competed as the brakeman (or pusher) in the two-man competition.[38][39] Walker and his teammate Brian Shimer placed seventh. In November 2007, Walker appeared on the HDNet show Inside MMA as a guest. He indicated he would take part in a mixed martial arts reality show in the near future (along with José Canseco) and that he would have an official MMA fight at the conclusion of the show.[40] In September 2009, it was announced that Walker had been signed by MMA promotion company Strikeforce to compete in their heavyweight division at the age of 47.[41] He began a 12-week training camp with trainer \"Crazy\" Bob Cook at the American Kickboxing Academy in October 2009 in San Jose, California.[42] In his MMA debut on January 30, 2010, Walker defeated Greg Nagy via technical knock-out due to strikes at Strikeforce: Miami.[43][44] In 2009, Walker was a contestant in the second season of the reality television show The Celebrity Apprentice. Strikeforce confirmed that Walker would face former WEC fighter Scott Carson when he made his second appearance in the Strikeforce cage.[45] Walker was forced off the Strikeforce card on December 4 due to a cut suffered in training that required seven stitches. They fought instead on January 29, 2011, and Walker defeated Carson via TKO (strikes) at 3:13 of round 1.[46] In 2014, Walker won season 3 of Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off. Walker has a fifth-degree black belt in taekwondo.[3] In 1984, Walker franchised a D'Lites fast food restaurant in Athens, Georgia.[47] In 2002, Walker created Renaissance Man Food Services, which distributes chicken products.[48] Originally, his producer was Sysco Corp. following a casual conversation with a Sysco vice president who asked him to provide some chicken-breading recipes from his mother.[49] He founded Savannah-based H. Walker Enterprises in 2002 as an umbrella company for most of his other business ventures, the largest of which was Renaissance Man Food Services.[50] Walker has a history of exaggerating the number of people employed by and the assets of his companies; the failure of several business enterprises led to creditors bringing lawsuits.[50][51] Walker touted Renaissance Man Food Services as one of the largest minority-owned meat processors in the nation, with $70 million in annual sales.[50][49] In subsequent deposition testimony in a lawsuit, however, Walker gave far lower figures, saying that his company averaged about $1.5 million in annual profits from 2008 and 2017.[51] Walker has touted Renaissance Man Food Services as a \"mini-Tyson Foods\", and also said that the company controlled multiple chicken processing plants.[50][52] However, in a 2018 declaration submitted in a legal case against his company, Walker acknowledged that the company did not actually own any chicken processing plants and instead partnered with plant owners to sell branded chicken products.[50] Walker's business associates later testified that Walker licensed his name to the chicken-related enterprise.[51] In 2009, Walker told the media that Renaissance Man Food Services had over 100 employees.[50] In 2018, Walker told the media that Renaissance Man Food Services had \"over 600 employees.\"[50][53] In 2020, Renaissance Man Food Services informed the U.S. government that it had eight employees.[50][51] The Atlanta Journal-Constitution suggested that Walker's overestimate of employees could \"refer to chicken processing jobs, which are not actually part of Walker's business\".[50] In April 2020, Renaissance Man Food Services applied for a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,[54] and the company ultimately received two PPP loans totaling $180,000 (of which $111,300 was forgiven).[50] On Twitter in April 2020, Walker mocked \"big companies\" that received PPP money, suggesting that they were \"giving back\" the money due to being \"ashamed\".[55] This was despite Walker being a board member of the Sotherly Hotel Group, owner of the Georgian Terrace Hotel and other hotels; the group received over $9 million of PPP loans in April 2020 while firing 90% of its hotel staff, according to company documents submitted to the U.S. government.[55] According to government records, Walker was paid $247,227 in total from Sotherly from 2016 to 2021.[55] Walker said that \"part of its corporate charter\" was to donate 15% of profits to charities. However, none of the four charities that Walker named as beneficiaries confirmed they actually received any donations.[56] In 2014, Walker appeared in a commercial paid for by the United States Chamber of Commerce supporting Jack Kingston's bid in the Republican primary election for the 2014 U.S. Senate election in Georgia.[57] In 2018, Walker endorsed Republican Brian Kemp in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election.[58] Walker supported Donald Trump in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections,[59] and spoke on Trump's behalf at the 2020 Republican National Convention.[60] In 2018, Trump appointed Walker to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition.[61] Trump reappointed him to another two year-term on December 17, 2020.[62] He was removed from the position in March 2022 by President Biden after he was asked to resign.[63] In 2020, Walker endorsed U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler.[64] In 2021, Donald Trump encouraged Walker to run for the U.S. Senate in Georgia.[65] Walker, a Texas resident, needed to re-establish residency in Georgia to do so.[66] Walker's contemplation of entering the race \"froze\" the Republican field because other prospective candidates for the nomination waited for his decision.[67][65] In July 2021, Fox News reported that some Georgia Republicans were not sure how effective a candidate Walker would be, citing the fact that his positions on issues of importance to Republican voters were unknown.[68] In August 2021, Walker announced his run for the Senate seat held by Democrat Raphael Warnock.[66] Walker began his campaign with high favorability ratings and support from self-identified moderate Republicans, and, in October 2021, was endorsed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a sign that the Republican establishment was lining up behind him.[69][70] In June 2022, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found Walker's claims about working in law enforcement were either false or unverifiable.[71] Walker has been named as an honorary deputy sheriff in Cobb County and Johnson County.[72] In 2019, Walker said he \"spent time at Quantico at the FBI training school\" and was \"an agent\" when, in reality, Walker lacked the bachelor's degree required for FBI training.[71] Previously, in 1989, Walker told the media that he \"had fun\" while attending an FBI school in Quantico for a week, speaking of an \"obstacle course and you shoot at targets\".[71] Many of Walker's statements on the campaign trail have been described as \"gaffes\"[73] or \"head-scratching at best\".[74] In an editorial for CNN, Chris Cillizza described Walker as a \"walking gaffe machine\", and disputed several statements Walker had made.[75] On October 5, 2022, Walker's campaign fired Taylor Crowe, his campaign political director, over suspicions that he leaked information to the media.[76] On October 14, 2022, Walker and his Democratic challenger, Raphael Warnock, faced off in their only debate for the Senate election.[77] The New York Times described Walker's demeanor throughout the debate as \"aggressive and persistent,\" with his frequent interruptions of Warnock and mocking of him for dodging questions.[78] Walker repeatedly tried to link Warnock with President Joe Biden, who carried a low approval rating.[79][80] During a portion of the debate focusing on crime, Walker revealed what appeared to be a law enforcement badge[a] to illustrate his closeness to law enforcement; he was admonished by the moderators since props were not allowed during the debate.[82] The Hill wrote Walker won a \"moral victory by avoiding disaster\" and \"more than avoided embarrassment.\"[83] In a mid-November 2022 campaign speech, Walker discussed watching a film about a vampire, whom he compared to Warnock with a \"black suit\". The film showed a person failing to defeat the vampire, said Walker, because of a lack of \"faith\". Walker made a call to \"have faith in our fellow brothers ... have faith in the elected officials ... that's the reason I'm here ... I'm that warrior that y'all have been looking for\". Also during that speech, Walker said: \"A werewolf can kill a vampire ... So, I don't want to be a vampire any more. I want to be a werewolf.\"[84][85][86] Since no candidate received a majority of the vote in the general election on November 8, 2022, he faced incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock in a runoff election on December 6, and lost. The final tally of votes was 51.40% for Warnock and 48.60% for Walker.[87][88] Walker conceded the election that night, stating: \"I'm not going to make any excuses now because we put up one heck of a fight. [...] I want you to continue to believe in this country, believe in our elected officials, and most of all, stay together\".[89] After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, Walker tweeted a video supporting Trump's efforts to overturn the election results.[65] Walker has spread many conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election.[90][91] Walker claimed that Biden \"didn't get 50 million\" votes; Biden indeed received over 80 million votes.[90] Walker alleged that there was \"country-wide election fraud\" without any evidence and urged Trump and \"true patriots\" to carry out \"a total cleansing\" to \"prosecute all the bad actors\".[90] He urged re-votes in the states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.[90] Walker also spread a conspiracy theory about the 2021 United States Capitol attack, suggesting it was a \"well-planned\" distraction from election fraud. In July 2022, when asked whether Joe Biden had fairly defeated Donald Trump in Georgia, Walker replied, \"I have no clue.\"[92] In the October debate with Warnock, when asked if Joe Biden was the winner of the 2020 election, Walker stated, \"President Biden won and Raphael Warnock won.\"[93] In May 2022, Walker stated he opposes abortion, and wants no exceptions to abortion bans. He also called for more money to promote adoption and to support single parents. \"You never know what a child is going to become. And I've seen some people, they've had some tough times, but I always said, 'No matter what, tough times make tough people.'\"[94][95] When asked about the impact of the issue on the November 2022 election, Walker described abortion rights as among the \"things that people are not concerned about\".[96] In September 2022, Walker endorsed legislation proposed by Senator Lindsey Graham that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy nationwide, except in cases of rape, incest, and threat to the life of the patient.[97] During his October debate with Raphael Warnock, Walker softened his position on abortion,[98] saying he supported the Georgia law allowing exceptions for rape and threats to the mother's life and health.[99] On October 3, 2022, The Daily Beast published allegations from a woman who said that Walker impregnated her and paid for her abortion in 2009 when they were dating.[100] The woman supported the allegation by producing images of a personal check from Walker, a get-well card with Walker's purported signature, and a $575 receipt for an abortion.[100][101] The Daily Beast said that it corroborated the story with a friend of the woman, who \"took care of her in the days after the procedure\".[102] Walker stated, \"I never asked anyone to get an abortion. I never paid for an abortion.\" When asked about the check, Walker said, \"I give money to people all the time, because I'm always helping people\".[102] Walker said he would sue The Daily Beast for defamation.[103][104] After Walker said on October 5 that he did not know the identity of the woman accusing him, The Daily Beast reported that the woman is the mother of one of Walker's children; she told The Daily Beast that she had another child with Walker years after the abortion, despite Walker stating that it was not a convenient time for him to have a child, a sentiment he also raised prior to the abortion.[105][106] Within a week of the original allegations' publication, The New York Times interviewed the same woman, as well as her friend, corroborating the reporting by The Daily Beast.[107] The woman additionally told The New York Times that she ended her relationship with Walker when he advised her to have a second abortion in 2011.[107] Family court records in New York confirm that Walker and the woman had a son, who was born in 2012.[107] On October 7, 2022, Walker acknowledged that his accuser was the mother of his son, and as to whether she had an abortion, Walker said: \"I'm not saying she did or didn't have one [an abortion]. I'm saying I don't know anything about that.\" He acknowledged the possibility of having given his accuser a 'get well' card and a check for other reasons, but said he could not remember doing so.[108] In an October 26, 2022, press conference organized by attorney Gloria Allred, a second woman, who has not identified herself, alleged she had been pressured by Walker to get an abortion in 1993 after a years-long extramarital relationship with him.[109][110] Walker denied the allegation, saying it was a \"lie\".[109] On November 22, Allred held another press conference, where the second woman also spoke, and audio recordings of Walker were shared.[111] The woman read out letters that she said Walker wrote, including one to her which stated: \"I'm sorry I have put you through all this stuff.\"[111] Allred read out a signed declaration of a friend of the second woman, which stated that the second woman originally said that she had a miscarriage, but the friend suspected that it was an abortion because the friend knew that Walker was married at the time and did not want to have a child with the second woman; years later, the second woman told the friend that Walker actually sent her to a clinic for an abortion.[111] Walker favors reducing federal regulations to boost business. He supports widespread tax cuts, building the Keystone Pipeline and increasing production of fossil fuels. He proposes to \"lower healthcare costs by increasing competitive market options\".[112] Walker supports putting closed oil fields back into production and rolling back oil-field regulations in order to reduce inflation.[92] When asked about the Green New Deal environmental program, Walker said that he opposed it because \"Since we don't control the air our good air decided to float over to China's bad air so when China gets our good air, their bad air got to move. So it moves over to our good air space. Then now we got we to clean that back up.\"[73] In August 2022, in response to questions about the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes funding to counteract climate change, Walker said, \"They continue to try to fool you that they are helping you out. But they're not\". Possibly referring to a provision that allocated $1.5 billion to the U.S. Forest Service's Urban and Community Forestry Program, Walker added, \"Because a lot of money, it's going to trees. Don't we have enough trees around here?\"[113] Walker told supporters at a November 2022 rally that America isn't \"ready for the green agenda. ... What we need to do is keep having those gas-guzzling cars. We got the good emissions under those cars\".[114] When asked in May 2022 on how to tackle gun violence, Walker said: \"Cain killed Abel and that's a problem that we have. What we need to do is look into how we can stop those things.\"[115] Walker then suggested \"getting a department that can look at young men that's looking at women, that's looking at their social media\", and also by \"putting money into the mental health field ... rather than departments that want to take away your rights.\"[115] When asked if he supported new gun laws in the wake of the Uvalde school shooting, Walker responded: \"What I like to do is see it and everything and stuff.\"[116] Walker opposes allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's sports events, stating in September 2022: \"Let's get men out of women's sports\".[117] Walker also discussed transgender children in general, stating, \"they're telling the young kids in school, you can be a boy tomorrow even if you're a girl... But I want the young kids to know you go to heaven. Jesus may not recognize you. Because he made you a boy. He made you a girl.\"[117] Asked about same-sex marriage, Walker said states should be free to decide the legality of same-sex marriage.[118] Walker supports Donald Trump's wall at the border with Mexico. He wants the United States to \"heavily invest\" in the military.[112] On December 17, 2024, Walker was named by President-elect Donald Trump as his presumptive nominee for the position of U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas.[119] Walker has lived in Westlake, Texas,[120] and in the Las Colinas area of Irving, Texas.[121] In August 2021, as he was preparing to run for U.S. Senate, Walker registered to vote in Georgia and listed his residence as Buckhead, Georgia; the property is owned by his wife Julie Blanchard.[122] However, in a January 2022 political campaign event, Walker said: \"I live in Texas … I was sitting in my home in Texas …\"[123] Tax records also show that Walker's primary residence for 2021 and 2022 is still registered as Tarrant County, Texas, where he continues to receive property tax breaks.[124][125] Walker married Cindy DeAngelis Grossman, whom he met in college, in 1983. They have a son, Christian, a social media influencer [126][127] After 19 years of marriage, Walker and Grossman divorced in 2002.[128] Julie Blanchard in 2012 said that she was Walker's fiancée; Walker married Blanchard in 2021.[129] Walker has two additional sons and a daughter whom he did not publicly acknowledge before his 2022 US Senate campaign; he did so in June 2022, one day after The Daily Beast reported on one of his additional sons.[130] Walker said that month, during a conference, that he \"never denied\" having four children.[131] The Daily Beast later reported that Walker had lied to his 2022 Senate campaign about how many children he had, while The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported \"allies to Walker\" stating that Walker had not been honest about how many children he had.[132][133] Walker said that he did not publicly acknowledge his children to prevent exposing them to unwanted attention, and criticized the claim that \"I hide my children because I don't discuss them with reporters to win a campaign\". Earlier during his Senate campaigning, Walker repeatedly discussed his relationship with eldest son Christian.[130][134] Prior to publicly acknowledging his other children, in a 2020 interview, Walker said that fatherless households were a \"major, major problem\" in African-American communities.[130] In October 2022, Walker's adult son Christian criticized Walker, stating, \"my favorite issue to talk about is father absence. Surprise! Because it affected me. ... He has four kids, four different women. Wasn't in the house raising one of them. He was out having sex with other women.\"[135][136][137] Also in October 2022, the mother of another of Walker's sons (born in 2012), said that Walker had seen his son \"maybe ... three times\", with Walker's parenting contributions mostly being court-ordered child support and sporadic gifts, while suggesting that the gifts were actually from Walker's fiancée/wife Julie Blanchard, and not from him.[107] In September 2001, when Walker and Grossman were estranged, an Irving, Texas, police report stated that police were called to Grossman's home by Walker's therapist due to Walker's visit there; Walker was \"volatile\", had a weapon, and was scaring Grossman.[138] The report stated that Walker \"talked about having a shoot-out with police\"; the therapist, Jerry Mungadze, defused the situation after speaking to Walker for at least half an hour. The report stated that police confiscated a SIG Sauer handgun from Walker's car, put his home on a \"caution list\" due to Walker's \"violent tendencies\", but did not arrest or charge Walker.[138] In a separate incident, Mungadze told the media that when he conducted a therapy session with Walker and Grossman, he called 911 because Walker \"threatened to kill\" all three of them, prompting the police to arrive; the result of the incident was Walker hitting a door, breaking his fist.[138] In filing for divorce in December 2001, Grossman accused him of \"physically abusive and extremely threatening behavior.\" After the divorce, she told the media that, during their marriage, Walker pointed a pistol at her head and said: \"I'm going to blow your f'ing brains out.\"[51][138] She also said he had used knives to threaten her.[139] In 2005, a restraining order was imposed on Walker regarding Grossman, after Grossman's sister stated in an affidavit that Walker told her \"unequivocally that he was going to shoot my sister Cindy and her [new] boyfriend in the head.\"[51] As a result, a temporary gun-owning ban was also issued to Walker by a judge.[51] Walker stated that he does not remember the assault or the threats and attributed his aberrant behavior with his wife and others to his dissociative identity disorder for which he was diagnosed in 2001.[139][51] In January 2012, a woman, Myka Dean, made a report to Irving, Texas, police that when she attempted to end a 20-year \"on-off\" relationship with Walker, he \"lost it\" and threatened to wait at her home to \"blow her head off\".[138] The responding police officer described this as \"extreme threats\".[138] Federal records show that Dean, as well as her mother and stepfather, were business partners of Walker's, for his company Renaissance Man Inc.[138] Dean died in 2019; Walker's 2022 political campaign stated that the allegations in the 2012 police report were false, and that Walker still had a good relationship with Dean's parents.[138] In October 2022, Walker's adult son Christian publicly accused Walker of having threatened to kill him and his mother.[140] He addressed Walker on Twitter, stating: \"You're not a 'family man' when you left us to bang a bunch of women, threatened to kill us, and had us move over 6 times in 6 months running from your violence ... how DARE YOU LIE and act as though you're some 'moral, Christian, upright man' ... You've lived a life of DESTROYING other peoples lives.\"[141][142][102] Soon after Christian made the allegations, Walker wrote on Twitter that he loved his son \"no matter what\".[141] In December 2022, The Daily Beast reported that Cheryl Parsa, an ex-girlfriend of Walker who lives in Dallas, had alleged that in 2005, during their relationship, she found Walker with another woman. According to Parsa, Walker got angry, put his hands on Parsa's neck and chest, and swung a fist at her.[143][144] Walker has spoken publicly about being diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder and has served as spokesperson for a mental health treatment program for veterans.[145] Walker says he wrote the 2008 book Breaking Free: My Life with Dissociative Identity Disorder[146] to help dispel myths about mental illness and to help others.[147] DID is among the most controversial of the dissociative disorders and among the most controversial disorders found in the DSM-5-TR, with many psychiatrists expressing doubts of its validity.[148][149][150] In the book, Walker wrote that he had a dozen distinct identities, or alters.[51] According to Walker, some of his alters did many good things, but other alters exhibited extreme and violent behavior, which Walker said he mostly could not remember.[139] A competitive alter caused him to play Russian roulette in 1991, as he saw \"mortality as the ultimate challenge\", he wrote.[51][139] He was formally diagnosed with the disorder in 2001, after he sought professional help for being tempted to murder a man who was late in delivering a car to him.[51] Walker attributed his divorce to his behavior caused by the disorder.[139] According to Walker's ex-wife, for the first 16 years of their marriage, Walker's alters were somehow controlled, and she had no idea that he had any disorder.[139] Grossman said that the situation greatly deteriorated once Walker was diagnosed, after which he began to exhibit either \"very sweet\" alters or \"very violent\" alters who looked \"evil\".[139] She said that in one situation where Walker exhibited two alters, she was in bed when he held a straight razor to her throat and repeatedly stated that he would kill her.[139] Walker did not deny Grossman's account, saying that he did not remember it, because blackouts were a symptom of the disorder.[139] While receiving treatment for dissociative identity disorder in May 2002, Walker was the subject of an Irving, Texas, police report made by a friend of Grossman, Walker's ex-wife.[138][151] She said that he followed her home and that she was \"very frightened\" of Walker, but did not want police to make contact with him as it would \"only make the problem worse.\"[138][151] She reported previously having a \"confrontation\" with Walker sometime around 2001, which was followed by Walker calling her to threaten her and \"having her house watched\".[138][151] On July 4, 2017, during Wrightsville's annual Fourth of July celebration and parade, Trojan Way, the street where Johnson County High School resides, was officially renamed Herschel Walker Drive.[152] In the 1980s, the American Academy of Achievement awarded Walker their Golden Plate Award for being an All-American Football Player.[153][154] NFL USFL NCAA",

                "content": "Herschel Walker is best known for his football exploits. He starred as a running back at the University of Georgia, where he won the Heisman Trophy in 1982. Walker would later be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999. Walker played professional football, originally for the New Jersey Generals of the US Football League, playing there for three years (1983-85) but later moved to the NFL where he started with the Dallas Cowboys. But in 1989 he was traded to the Minnesota Vikings, who gave up five players and six draft choices for him. He later played for the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants. In the NFL Walker recorded 8,225 rushing yards, 4,859 receiving yards, and 5,084 kickoff-return yards. Adding in his numbers from the USFL he had 13,787 rushing yards which would place him in the top 10 among all-time NFL running backs. Despite missing time because of the USFL career, he is still ranked in the top 10 all-time in the NFL in all-purpose yardage gained. Walker was known for his training regimen and his physical fitness. It did not include lifting weights, but he would often do 1,500 push-ups and 2,500 sit-ups daily. He also competed as a track athlete at Georgia, running 100 metres in 10.22 and in high school was Georgia State Champion as a sprinter and discus thrower. In 2007 Walker announced that he was going to begin a career in mixed martial arts with his first professional competition due to occur in 2010. His US Olympic bobsled appearance was a sidelight of an otherwise stellar sports and athletic career. He was recruited to compete in the sport because of his speed and strength which made him an excellent pusher. Athlete Olympic Results Content You may like",

                "content": "What It Takes is an audio podcast produced by the American Academy of Achievement featuring intimate, revealing conversations with influential leaders in the diverse fields of endeavor: public service, science and exploration, sports, technology, business, arts and humanities, and justice. Herschel Walker was born in Augusta, Georgia and grew up outside of Wrightsville, Georgia. For the first 11 years of his life, Herschel Walker showed little interest in sports; he preferred reading books and writing poetry. At age 12, however, he began a crash exercise program. Over the next year, he did 100,000 push-ups, 100,000 sit-ups and sprinted thousands of miles. In high school, Walker played football and basketball and competed in track and field. He scored a record-breaking 86 touchdowns as a running back and led his teams to state championships in both football and track while maintaining an A average. Herschel Walker participated in the 1980 Academy of Achievement program as the valedictorian of his class and the most sought-after high school football player in the nation. As a freshman at the University of Georgia, Herschel Walker ran for 1,616 yards, scoring 15 touchdowns, and setting an NCAA freshman rushing record. He led the Bulldogs to victory in 12 out of 12 games, including the national collegiate championship. Walker earned consensus All-American honors three consecutive years, set 10 NCAA records, 15 Southeastern Conference records, 30 Georgia all-time records, and capped a sensational college career by earning the coveted Heisman Trophy in his junior year. In 1983, Walker gave up his final year of collegiate eligibility and turned professional, joining the New Jersey Generals of the short-lived United States Football League. Walker dominated the league, earning Most Valuable Player honors and setting the single-season pro football rushing record (2,411 yards). Walker joined the Dallas Cowboys in 1986, where he led the entire NFL in rushing and earned All-Pro honors. Walker moved to the Minnesota Vikings as starting running back in 1989. In 1992, he joined the Philadelphia Eagles football team but returned to the Dallas Cowboys in 1996. He retired from the NFL in 1997. Walker was one of the top running backs in the pros. He finished his professional career with a total of 8,225 yards and 61 rushing touchdowns. He also caught 512 passes for 4,859 yards and 21 scores. Herschel Walker has worked with numerous charitable and educational organizations. In 1981, he became the first Academy of Achievement honor student to return to the annual program as a recipient of the Golden Plate Award. In 2002, he was voted into the College Football Hall of Fame and was selected as the second greatest player in college football history, just behind the legendary Red Grange. In a 2008 memoir, Breaking Free, Herschel Walker revealed that he had suffered for many years from dissociative identity disorder, a mental illness previously known as multiple personality disorder. Some of Walker’s alternative personalities, which came to the fore after he retired from professional football, expressed a turbulent, angry side of his nature he had previously suppressed. On occasion, he threatened his wife and others with physical violence, but later had no recollection of these events. As related in his memoir, he eventually recognized the nature of his problem, which may have been rooted in his childhood experience of bullying and ostracism, and sought professional treatment. With psychotherapy, the disorder can be treated, and Walker decided to make his affliction public, to advance understanding of the disorder and encourage others so afflicted to find the help they need. The passage of time has not dimmed the glory of Herschel Walker’s exploits on the football field. When college football celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2019, sports journalists compiled lists of the greatest players in each position in the history of the game, and Herschel Walker was invariably named as a top running back. The broadcast networks CBS Sports and ESPN each named Herschel Walker to its All-Time All-American Team, a definitive assembly of the greatest players in the history of the college game. In May 2022, Walker won the GOP nomination for Senate. He was the clear-and-away frontrunner in a race where he was supported by former President Donald Trump and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). In November 2022, Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock was able to defeat Republican Herschel Walker in the Georgia US Senate race. The campaign between Walker and Warnock made history as the first time two African Americans ran as the major party’s nominees for U.S. Senate from Georgia. “Strive to be the very best you can be. Run the race against yourself and not the guy in the other lane. The reason I say that is, as long as you give it 110 percent, you are going to succeed. But as long as you’re trying to beat the guy over there, you are worried about him, and you’re not worrying about how you’ve got to perform.” This philosophy made Herschel Walker one of the most phenomenal success stories in sports history. An unathletic child by his own account, Herschel Walker went on to set all-time football records at every level of play, from high school to the pros. Along the way, he maintained a high grade-point average and the inviolable self-respect first instilled in him by his parents. He earned the coveted Heisman Trophy in his junior year as a college athlete. The College Football Hall of Fame rated him as one of the two greatest players in the history of the college game, second only to the legendary Red Grange. Herschel Walker holds another distinction as the first student honoree of the Academy of Achievement to return as an adult professional recipient of the Academy’s Golden Plate Award. (The American Academy of Achievement interviewed Herschel Walker on June 28, 1991 in New York City, and on June 17, 1994 in Las Vegas, Nevada. The following transcript includes questions and answers from both Academy video interviews.) People see Herschel Walker today and they see this strong, confident champion athlete. But we gather that’s not how you always felt growing up. What were you like as a kid? Herschel Walker: Growing up, I was not that athletic and I had a speech impediment. So to be a person that was non-athletic, having a speech impediment, I had a lot of kids that made fun of me. I had a lot of teachers that didn’t take the time out to help me to overcome my shortcomings. So, I had parents that told me, “You’re not going to use that as an excuse. You’re not going to use that as an excuse not to at least try hard and to get good grades or to do whatever. You’re just going to have to work on your own.” And I’d sit in the mirror, day after day, night after night, saying, “She sells seashells by the seashore,” and all those tongue twisters and this and that. And I overcame the speech impediment and I became valedictorian of my class my senior year. All those teachers that didn’t want to take the time out to help me out, they decided they wanted to take the credit for it. But I had loving parents that, no matter what, they were not going to let me use excuses for anything. I graduated high school as the Beta Club president, which is a club that you have to have A’s to be a part of it. I was president of the Beta Club. I went into college with a very high grade point average because I knew the work ethics that it took. I knew that as long as you apply yourself — from what my parents have told me — as long as you apply yourself, you are going to succeed. Too many people today are afraid to step up at bat. They are afraid that life is going to throw them all kind of curve balls and this and that. And you know what is so strange is there is no one in professional baseball that is batting a thousand. I doubt there is anyone batting six hundred. There is no one probably batting even five hundred. But as long as you’re not afraid in life to step up and take on a challenge, you never know what is going to happen. And every challenge that I have been faced, I am going to step up and swing. Because one time I may hit a home run. And that home run is going to carry me a little bit farther. That’s what is so great to me about the Academy here. I’ve won so many awards in my life. I’ve won a lot of things. But I remember when I got the word about coming up here to the Academy as a student — I was getting so many scholarships all at first — and I really didn’t know what to think of it, until I got here and saw the other students here. And it made me proud to be a part of that. Besides your parents, you’ve mentioned a teacher or coach who helped you. Herschel Walker: There was a high school coach that believed in me. His name was Tom Jordan. And it was funny, I had two older brothers who were very athletic. Coach Jordan saw me and how clumsy — and I couldn’t run, couldn’t do anything. He just said to himself, “If his two brothers are great at sports, Herschel’s got to have something. He’s got to be good at something.” So he used to come pick me up at the Sunday school at the church, and on Saturdays, and make me go out to this track and he’d work out with me. He’d play with me and he made me feel good about myself. And he said, “Okay. You’re going to do your homework here. You’ve got to do this here.” And he was just like my parents, and he believed in me. He did teach me that, when they say what teacher you had, and I say a coach, most people say, “Oh geez, that’s just sports.” But that’s not. It’s that he was someone that was the role model — was the teacher — in my life. He always wanted a bass boat and he’s a big fisherman. It’s funny because he always wanted a bass boat, and growing up in Wrightsville, Georgia, I don’t have any money. I could barely rub two nickels together. And then, becoming a professional football player, I got him a bass boat. And I loved that because, for what he did for me, to put me in the position I’m in right now, you know, a bass boat isn’t enough. He means a great deal to me. You talked about exercising to build yourself up. What kind of exercise did you do? Herschel Walker: My parents didn’t have a lot of money. My high school didn’t have a lot of money to afford a lot of the expensive weights and, you know, all this stuff. They used that as an excuse. I started doing push-ups and sit-ups during commercials as I was watching TV — and started doing about, sometimes, 2,000 push-ups, 3,000 sit-ups, 1,500 pull-ups, 1,000 dips, and different things like that. I started creating different hand positions for all that, and then I learned that that could work you out. In the olden days, that’s what people used to do. People sit around now, saying, “Let me create this machine that will work this muscle here for someone, and I can make a billion dollars.” He don’t even use the machine, but he wants to create it so that he can make money off of it. But I’m doing it to work myself. I have a lot of people that write to me, saying, “Herschel, why don’t you come train me? I’ll pay you this, I’ll pay you that.” And I say, “No. Your body is different from my body. This may work good for you and not work good for me. It may work good for me and not so good for you. So for me to say I’m a trainer, I’ve first got to know you. I’ve got to know what your body is. I just can’t say, ‘This is going to be great for you.’ But I can say, ‘It will help you a little bit, but there may be another thing that you need to do that’ll be a little bit better.'” We read that another motivation you had was trying to beat your older sister in a foot race. Herschel Walker: My sister, she is a little bit over a year older. She was fast, and I was that chubby kid. And she was always beating me; she always beat me. I just felt that I couldn’t see a girl beating me all the time. And I said, “I’ve got to beat her. I’ve got to beat her.” And I just trained and trained, and every time I went up to race her, she beat me. Every time I went up, she beat me. And after you’ve been beat over ten times, sometimes people got a tendency of quitting. And I said, “No, I’m not going to quit. I’m not going to quit.” And I kept doing it until I got where I could beat her. And what was so strange about it is the first race that I ever beat her, I barely beat her. But I think that was the springboard. Once I saw I can do it, I said, “Uh-oh, now it’s a little different. Now I’m ready.” And I think that’s the way the mind works. Sometimes you may not think you can do it. You may not think you can do it, but as long as you’ve got that doubt, you’re never going to do it. I think that’s what happened. By me continuing to want to race — and continuing to want to race her — sometime you’ve got to win. You can take two little dogs. One can be a small dog, the other one is a small puppy, but it’s going to grow up to be this huge, 160-pound dog. And you can take this one 30-pound little dog that is an adult at the time, and this big dog, as he grows up, he is being dominated by this little dog. So he always grows up thinking this little dog can beat him. So he can get to his full size of 160 pounds, and this little dog still is only 30 pounds, but the big dog still thinks the little dog can beat him, so he is afraid of him because he doesn’t know any better. Sometimes that’s the way the mind is. If you continue to say you can’t do it, you are not going to do it. But sooner or later you got to swing that bat because you never know if you’re going to hit a home run. You’ve mentioned a race you ran in middle school that didn’t work out so well but taught you a lesson. Can you tell us about that? Herschel Walker: When I was in the seventh grade, I think, they have this race at the end of the school year, like a mile run. And I felt that if I can win that mile run, I’d have all these friends. People were going to come and talk to me because I won the mile. So about three weeks before the race — my father was a farmer, so he plowed this field — and I got out and went into training with my younger brother. We went out and we went into training so I could get ready to win this mile. For three weeks, I trained. The day came for the race and I got up there with this guy, Willie Jenkins. I remember his name and this other guy, Wells, who everybody predicted they were going to win that race. They were the most athletic kids in my class. And I got up there right with them to run this race, and we started running. I was feeling good. I was feeling great. I was in shape. No one knew I’d been training except my younger brother. So we were running around the track and about the second lap, something said, “Herschel, you’re not going to win.” I’m running and I’m thinking, “Okay, wait a minute.” Third lap, something said, “Herschel, you’re not going to win.” And I’m up front. There’s only like — I’m in second place. I’m right up front. I’m feeling good. I’m not even tired. And going into the last lap, something said, “Herschel, you’re not going to win. You’re not going to win this race. You better get out of it. You better get out of it.” So I started thinking, “Oh, geez, I’m not going to win, so how can I get out of this race without embarrassing myself?” And I’m like in second, whereas I probably could have won it if I had kept running. And I said, “Okay. What am I going to do? I’m going to pretend like I pulled a muscle.” So on the last curve, I walked off the field and grabbed my hamstring and pretended like I hurt my leg. And Willie Jenkins ended up winning this race and all day it bothered me. I remember going home and getting off the school bus. My younger brother ran up to me and said, “How did it go? How did it go?” And I said, “Well, I hurt my leg,” and I lied about it. He said, “Oh, you know, you’ll get them next time.” That made me feel so bad, because I lied, and I think the thing is I didn’t try. I said then, no matter whatever happened in my life from then on — I don’t care what happened — I’m going to give it everything I’ve got. It’s funny because I see so many people today that don’t want to try, and I say I don’t care what I ever do, I never give up at anything anymore. I don’t care what it is, you’ll never see me give up. People think I’m crazy because I do so many crazy things, but I think because of that race in my life, I’m what you call the renegade of professional sports. You know, I’ve done everything. I’ve done boxing, karate, dance, to just about anything. Now, I’m not going to say I’m the best at it, but I guarantee you, I give most people the run for their money at just about everything. What do you say to a kid who’s in high school and all he can think about is being an athlete? He doesn’t study; that’s all he thinks about. Herschel Walker: Being an athlete is being a competitor, not on the football field, but in life. And you’ve got to be able to compete in the classroom because you can always be president when you are 60, but when you turn 30, they’re going to say you’re too old for football. So knowledge can take you a long way; being an athlete can only take you a short little sprint. You want to study hard because then you’ve always got something. Like I say, it is so great to be able to understand something. To sit down with the president and understand what’s happening, and then to go sit out there on the street with anyone and still understand. That is beautiful to do that. Just to go out and run a touchdown is only great for that time. The next week, if you don’t do it, they don’t want you around no more. What’s the biggest challenge you’ve had to overcome? Herschel Walker: The hardest thing I’ve had to overcome in life? I think racism. That’s so difficult because I don’t think anyone can ever understand it. It’s not the point that people don’t want to understand it, but they don’t want to touch it. Like, “That’s a subject we can’t touch. Let’s get away from it.” But you know it’s there. And as long as it’s there, you’ve got to cope with it. With me, I’m always the type of person, if something is in front of me, let me deal with it. Let’s not push it under the rug or push it to the side because no matter what, it’s going to keep coming up. If you never deal with that dirt up under the carpet, it’s going to get larger and larger, and it’s going to keep coming up. Little bit by little, it’s going to seep from underneath that carpet. So you deal with it now. You’re going to try to get those piles out. I think that’s been the most difficult thing. I grew up in the South. My senior year was a very big racial — the tension in my hometown was a very big deal. It’s tough, but you’re knowing who you are, and you’re knowing that “No white’s no better than you are, Herschel. You’re no better than they are.” And I think the biggest thing to help me to overcome it is, when it’s all said and done, God is not going to have a list and say, “Oh, geez. You’re white, so you are going in. You’re black, you’re not,” or “You’re black, you’re coming in. You are white, you’re not.” God don’t care. My mother once told me — this is almost similar to it — I was going to church one Sunday, and I didn’t want to go. I was tired of going to church and stuff. And I hid my shoes. I didn’t want to go. It’s funny because I went in to my mother, and she said, “You ready to go to church?” And I said, “No, I can’t go.” She said, “Why?” I said, “I don’t have any shoes.” You know, you only had one pair of Sunday shoes. And I said, “I don’t have any shoes to go.” And she said, “No, you can come on and go,” and I said, “I don’t have any shoes.” She said, “God don’t care how you look.” I thought about it, and you know, that’s true. God don’t care how you look. He don’t care whether you are white, black, pink, as long as you’ve been a good person and you believe in Him. And I said, “That’s the key.” I think we are always putting things in categories. We’ve got to put someone in a category. He’s this, he’s that, he’s this. You know, that doesn’t matter, as long as he can do the job. I think that’s what counts. What did it take for you, Herschel Walker, to go from being the runt of the family to the winner of the Heisman Trophy? Herschel Walker: It takes a lot of hard work. I’m talking mentally, physically, it takes a lot of hard work. You’ve just got to dedicate yourself. I think that’s why I never let anyone read my poetry; I never let anyone see it. I don’t think they could ever understand it. When I speak about this, people think I’m absolutely crazy. I don’t drink. I’ve never tasted alcohol. I don’t smoke. I never did any of that, but I can get so high off my belief and my will, that it’s almost like you’re invincible. You know, I’m so high off God that, I don’t care what you do to me, you can never destroy me. What were your dreams as a young man? Herschel Walker: Well, coming from a small town is — it was tough really to dream big. You know, my biggest dream when I grew up in a small town in Georgia, my biggest dream was one day to be able to go to Atlanta, Georgia. You know, to be able to go to Atlanta, which, Atlanta was about two hours, forty-five minutes from my home. So, to dream about going to Atlanta was it, you know, and you’d think about that, you’d think about that. And I never dreamed about football. I never dreamed about being an actor because, you know, that was out of reach. Coming from a small town that was big in farming and also big in clothing factories, you don’t dream about being a professional football player or an actor. So you go to Atlanta, and you’re in the big city now, you know, you are there. And that was — that was the dream. And the majority of the people that I looked up to — not looked up to; I hate that. I don’t like that word. But the majority of the people that I was growing up with were going off into the military. So a lot of my classmates, you know, thought of going into the military. That was something more worthwhile that had a purpose. And you know, I was more of a kid that was always by himself. And I didn’t drink. I’m not a big partyer, so I love being by myself. So, by seeing that, then taking everything in, and putting it deep down inside of me, I realized then that, you know, the military has got a purpose. And you know, I just said I wanted to go into the military at that time. Let’s talk some more about your childhood. What was it like growing up in a small town in rural Georgia? Herschel Walker: I think growing up in a small town gave me a lot of values. It has helped me to mature as an individual as well as a person. I think as an individual because it helped me to have confidence in myself. I think today we have to help our youth to gain its confidence within themselves. People use so many excuses. Peer pressure was our biggest excuse. There’s no such thing as peer pressure. If you believe within yourself, there is no peer pressure because you believe what is right and what’s wrong. I think every individual know what’s right. You can take your most violent criminal, and you have a talk with him, and he will say, “I wanted to get caught because I knew what I was doing wasn’t right, but I couldn’t stop.” So I say there is no peer pressure if you believe within yourself. Growing up, I started developing confidence. I felt my parents helped me to believe in myself. I wasn’t the best-looking guy, I wasn’t the best athlete in the world, but they made me feel good about myself. “Herschel, you are somebody. You know, whether you are black, white, it doesn’t matter, you are a person, and God loves you.” So that made me feel good, so I was able to feel good about myself, growing up in a small town. And then again, there was a real hard work ethic. That’s what we need today. Young people, adults, we need good work ethics because nothing is going to come to you easy. We’ve got too much of a competitive world for anything to come easy to you. People are competing in everything. It doesn’t matter what it is. Football, that’s just athletics. But in the business world, doing everything — people are competing. So you’ve got to get those very good work ethics — and I think that helped me to develop good work ethics, in a small town. What kind of a kid were you? What were you like when you were growing up? Herschel Walker: I was a little different. I still say I’m a little different because my dreams are — success to me is not having the most money or having the biggest car or the biggest house. Success is just being happy. And I try so many different things. I do a lot of different things because I think God has helped me to love myself. I know who God is, and I love God. So I think — growing up as a kid, I used to write all the time. I was always by myself. It’s not that I wanted to be by myself, but when you live in a small town — we lived out in the country — there was no one around, so I was not going to use excuses and wander away from home going over to someone else’s. I sit at home, I write. Whatever I could get my hands on, I read, and I just was a different little kid, I think. Did you have favorite subjects in school? You said you liked to read and you liked to write. What did you like to read and what did you write about? Herschel Walker: My favorite subject probably was math. I love math. I think figures just intrigue me. I was really good at math. English probably was my worst subject, but I used to write a lot of poetry. I used to write poetry all the time. It’s a little different because I just can’t sit down and write. It’s something that just came to me. A lot of people say, “Herschel, maybe you’re writing because you’re depressed” or “You’re writing this…” and I say no. I say I write happy things. I write from life to death, write about space — just something that I’m thinking at the time. It’s not anything that I can think of right now. If I had to come up with something that just came to me, I think, growing up in a small town, I want knowledge. I still think today, knowledge is one of the keys. Because when you’re able to understand, life is a lot more beautiful then. And when you’re able to hear another language and understand it, it is literally more beautiful than just hearing it. When you’re able to see a painting up on the wall and understand what you are looking at, it is literally more beautiful. So I usually like to just read anything. I can remember getting a Sears catalog and reading about how this was done and where and stuff. I don’t know why in the world I’m reading about women’s dresses, how to make women’s dresses. I don’t think I’m ever going to become that. But just reading things. I was just intrigued by it. What did you read that had an influence on you? Herschel Walker: I’d usually read the Bible a lot. Read little short Bible stories. And today, whenever I give speeches, I bring up a few of those Bible stories because those are inspirations to me. The reason why? You have some people get up and they tell you their life story. Like a boxer who always comes out and says, “Well, I was never a tough guy, and this guy stole my bike.” Like Muhammad Ali: “So I went into boxing and the next thing I know, I’m the heavyweight champion.” You know, anyone could do that. I don’t mean anyone could do it, but anyone can do like one of those stories. But no one can die and come back alive again. It hasn’t been done. There is only one person that has done something like that. So that inspired me. I said, “Hey, this guy’s my hero. If he can do that, I’m going to believe in this guy here. And to see him — who can help the blind to see, people that are sick he can cure — so he became the guy that I looked up to. So I used to read anything. Whenever my parents or anyone started talking about religion or God, I eased over there and listened a little bit, because I said, “That’s knowledge.” And you know, I’m not a big guy that’s going to try to throw religion on anyone because that person has to be accountable for himself. I think that’s what we have to do in society today is to be accountable for yourself. I think we have the tendency to always want to live someone else’s life. We want to tell that person what to do, how to act, but yet we don’t go by that. And I think first if we learn to act, maybe we can help that other person. That’s the way I try to be brought up. Did you have a favorite poet or a favorite poem? Herschel Walker: No, I really didn’t. I never really had a favorite poem, and I never really had a favorite poet, per se. It’s not a poem; it’s something I read about the footprints in the sand. That has stuck in my mind so much, and I think about it with friends. God is walking along with you in the sand, and all of a sudden there is one set of footprints, and when you look back, and times are hard, and you ask God, “God, when things were going well, I look back and there were two sets of footprints in the sand, and now, where things were a little bit tougher, you left me. Why?” God says, “It’s not that I left you, it’s just that I’m carrying you.” That stuck in my mind because it is so strange how we sometimes just forget. I think growing up, I think today, it kept making me drive forward — just thinking about the people in my hometown that encouraged me, and the people that stood behind me, that helped me. And I say, “I’m not going to forget those people because they knew me before anything.” They knew me before anything, and they were right there with me. No matter what, they were right there, and they were cheering me on. They didn’t care whether Herschel ruined that 100-yard dash. But as long as Herschel went out and competed hard, they were proud of me. You first came to the Academy as a high school student — valedictorian of your class and the most sought-after high school football player in the country. What was that like? Herschel Walker: I was sort of embarrassed because coming from a small town, and this and that, and I’m seeing all these kids from all over the country and seeing what they’ve done, and they had a few whiz kids here that were in college. It made me proud just to be a part of it. I didn’t care if I was riding on the coattails, as I felt then. It just made me proud to be a part of it, where it inspired me, and I said, “Herschel, you can get better. Why don’t you get a little bit better because the Academy means something.” The Academy of Achievement, that’s always there, it means something. It just made me real proud when I came up as a student, and it’s like, man, all these older kids here. I’ve been — as an individual, sometimes I think I’m the only one from a town that’s so small, if everyone breathed at the same time, you’d run out of oxygen. Man, there is nothing there! So it’s so strange when I came up to this place that has so many students that knew everything. I thought I knew everything! I thought my mother and father knew everything. Here is this little kid here that knows about trying to put together this sphere that can tell you when the speed of light — how fast is the speed of light, this and that — that was stunning to me. That was stunning. Where do your values come from? Is this from your family, from your parents? Herschel Walker: It definitely comes from my parents. My parents, growing up, they worked hard. Everyone in my family woke up early in the morning. I used to see my mother and my father go off to work and come back, and no matter what, they had time for the kids. They disciplined us; they’d do what was right. You knew what to do, and you knew what not to do. Whenever a child in the house — a kid in the house — went off to work, my parents made him be sure of himself that when he went he was going to work. He was not going there to clown around. He was not going there just to pass time away. He was going to work. He was not going to just try to make a dollar by sitting down. He was going to give everything he’s got. And I think because of that, that’s why I’m always going to give everything I’ve got because God is going to be proud of you then. There is no such word in my family as “lazy,” because there is no such thing. I think “lazy” or “I quit” is a bad word in the vocabulary. Who have been the most important people in your life? Herschel Walker: God is the only one. My parents. My wife. I don’t have a lot of friends. Because I’m always moving around, I don’t have a lot of friends. I don’t drink, so I don’t hang out in bars. But they’ve been very big in my life because they have helped to encourage me. Sometimes things get so tough, and all of a sudden you see people start easing away from you. They say to themselves, “Hey, I’ve got problems, and I don’t need to hear his problems, and I’m going to ease away.” But no matter what, I can call my parents any time of the night. I’m in Europe sometimes, and there is such a big time difference. I remember calling my mother; it was about 3:00 in the morning. I just wanted to talk. She was so happy for me to call. She is waking up and she is so happy for me to call. It sort of brings tears to your eyes because sometimes a boy grows up in his family and he’s not able to say, “I love you” and stuff. Over the last year or so is the first time I ever told my parents that. It’s so weird because I say you grow up and you don’t even say it, and the word is such a four-letter, short little word. And you just can’t even say, “I love you.” I started saying it, and it comes so easy now. If I don’t say it when I hang up the phone, I have to call her back and say, “Oh, I forgot to say, ‘I love you,’” and all that stuff. It’s so funny where now it comes so easy. You know, we are sometimes so macho, we forget who we are. That’s something I’m not going to do. I love to work. I love to learn new things. I love to see a lot of new things. I’m not a person that’s going to try to impress anyone because I think as long as I’m myself, you either like me or you don’t. But I can’t help that and there is nothing else I can do. Were there other people who served as role models or inspired you? Herschel Walker: I didn’t have role models like football players in my life when I was growing up. I never thought, “You can be a football player,” so I never watched it as a little kid. But what I did see was my mother and father getting up early in the morning, going to work and coming back late in the afternoon, and they never complained about it. I’d see my mother saying, “I love God,” and my father loving God. So they put that love on me and they threw all that on me to love God. So my role models in life would be my parents because they never complained about anything they’d ever done — and that was seven kids! My father has six sisters. He was the only boy, and when he was 12, his father was killed. So he took the responsibility to raise his six sisters. He never complained. He never said anything about it. That’s my role model in life. It’s strange because I never said anything to him about it. I was at Innsbruck, Austria one time, a long way away from home, and I started thinking. I said, “You know, I always tell my mother I love her but I never told my father that. And I said, “It is so funny because he means so much to me in my life,” and I just never said that. I happened to call him up. It took me a couple of days to get him because of the time difference. But when I called him up, I told him. My mother said, “You don’t know what that really meant to him.” Those are the people that I look up to in life that have given me this, and I think if I go out in life now and do something crazy, I’d embarrass them. I don’t care about embarrassing myself but to embarrass people that I love or to embarrass people that I’ve drawn so much from, I think it would destroy me worse than anything. We’ve read about this chubby kid, this runt of the family, who wasn’t much interested in sports when he was growing up. How did that chubby kid become Herschel Walker, All-American? Herschel Walker: I think dedication, hard work. I wanted to be an athlete because at that time being an athlete was considered cool. I was not cool. I was not the prince of the school or Mr. Big Man on Campus. I just wanted to be acknowledged. I wanted people to come up to me sometimes and say, “Hey, Herschel, how you doing?” rather than laughing at me because I couldn’t talk. So I just started training myself. We didn’t have weights, we didn’t have a lot of money, but if I could get any little book on the human body, I’d read about it, and I just started training myself. I liked the way I felt, you know. I felt good about myself, and I love that. That motivated me. Not just in sports but it motivated me in the classroom. It just made me feel good. What did it mean to you when you found out that you’d been awarded the Heisman Trophy as the best college football player in America? I never knew what the Heisman Trophy was. I was one of the first freshmen ever to be nominated for the Heisman. My sophomore year, they said I should have won, and in my junior year I ended up winning. I never knew what the Heisman Trophy was. I knew it meant something big, but I never really knew, and that I won it meant that I was the best college athlete. I was ashamed because there are so many good athletes out there, and for me to be singled out, I was sort of ashamed. But after I won the award, I said, “Now this is going to be an inspiration for me to stand out for all the guys that didn’t get a chance to win it.” To continue to go out there and work hard so they can say, “That’s the guy that won. He took it from me, and he deserved it.” I don’t want them saying, “Okay, , but I should have got it, because look what I’m doing now.” I think it’s an inspiration for me. When did you first know you wanted to play pro football? Herschel Walker: That’s a good question because I don’t think I knew that until the last minute. Until I was on a professional field playing a game is about the first time I ever knew that I was going to be paid to play football. When I grew up, I didn’t think you would get paid to play football. Who’s going to pay you to play football? And when I went to college, I went to college to really get my criminal justice degree. I wanted to be in the FBI. My dream, you know, as a little kid — kids dream to be a fireman or a policeman, and as they turn 15, they forget about that dream. Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to be in the FBI. So as I grew up, that was my dream. That’s all I wanted to do. When I got a chance to go to college, I was going for my criminal justice degree, and I wanted to go to law school and go into the FBI. I was playing football, and I never really thought it was going to be a reality until, my first day, I was out on the football field and I realized then that I was going to play football and not have a chance to really go into the FBI until later in my career. I don’t regret it. I think it’s been a blessing for me. What was it like going from college to the pros? Herschel Walker: That was exciting because I got better. I think that’s where you get better. And for me, I learned more. That’s the reason it’s exciting for me. As long as I can mature mentally, it’s really more exciting for me. I want to learn more, and going to professional football, it helped me to play guys that had been there a little bit longer. Whereas, “Herschel, you can be the fastest guy, you can be one of the strongest guys, but you’re not going to be better until you are a little bit wiser.” And I learned that. I learned different ways to do things that were a lot easier, didn’t take as much strength and as much speed, just took knowledge. I had that open mind to listen. Are you still learning? Herschel Walker: Oh, yes. I’m learning every day. I think when it gets to the point where I’m not learning, or where I’m just pushing myself, I’m giving it up. Because then I think I’m not going to perform well, I’m just going to be there. I don’t want to just be there. I don’t want to just show up. If you’re not going to show up and dance at the party, don’t go. It’s called a party, so you’ve got to have fun. And because I don’t drink, I reckon I’ve got to dance. For all those 15-year-olds who would love to ask you this question, can you describe what it is like to be out there on the field, before a full stadium, carrying the football? Herschel Walker: For me, it’s exciting. I don’t get nervous. Knock on wood. I don’t get nervous before a game, I get excited because this is an opportunity for me to go out there and show what the Lord has done for me. I’m so excited that the Lord has given me this ability. I’m so excited just to go out there, to put on those shoulder pads, put that helmet on, and then go out there and go with it. It’s funny because it’s not in my nature. I’m more low-key, but when I get ready to perform, I don’t care if there is no one in the stands. I want to go out there and play because I’m ready to go out there and get better. It’s like a high. When you’re running the ball sometimes, you can’t even see behind you, but you can feel a person there. It’s so wild that you can just feel things you don’t even have to see. You get the ball and everything opens up for you. It’s like everything is so slow, but yet you see it on film, and it happened so quick. You can tell how many cleats this guy has on his shoes, but yet it’s so quick you don’t know how in the world you counted. You can see this guy coming to tackle you; you can see his eyes. You can almost — if you had time, you could say what he’s thinking. Sometimes the guy is saying, “Oh, geez, how am I going to tackle this guy? Whether I’m going to hit him at the legs or whether I’ll try to jump on him and hold him.” You can see all this, yet when you see it on film, it all happened so quick. So it’s a real big high for me. Have you ever gone into the huddle and said, “Give me the ball. I want it”? Herschel Walker: No. I never really ask because I hope that the quarterback knows that I want the ball. I think he can look in my eyes and see that I want the ball. I’m not being selfish, but I want to play. If the clock is winding out and we are behind, then I want the ball. I think he can look in my eyes and say, “Hey, Herschel wants the ball. Let me see if I can get it to him.” I think some guys — all of them want the ball. If you’re a professional, you want the ball. That’s the type of team I want to be with. I want to be with guys that are not afraid to take that last shot. You have a lot of guys that are afraid to lose, but if you’re afraid to lose, you’re never going to win. Even in the fourth quarter, when you’ve carried the ball 30 times, you’re beaten up and dog-tired, do you still want the ball? Herschel Walker: Yes. That’s part of the game. That’s a part of the game, to go out and carry the ball. That’s a part of the game, to go out and catch the ball. You become mentally weak when you say, “I’m too tired to go on.” I’ve trained all week. How can I be tired? So I say, “You can’t get tired. There is not time to get tired. We don’t have enough time for you to get tired. You can get tired tomorrow.” What about teamwork? What about working with others? Herschel Walker: That’s important. Teamwork is very important — football, basketball, baseball, very important —because you’re as strong as your weakest link. I never knew what it meant until — I knew mentally what it means because there are 45 guys on the team. And I made this statement to my teammates, that if there is one guy that doesn’t believe that we can win, I don’t want to play with you because I don’t want your negative influence over the other 44. I don’t want a negative atmosphere around me. I want something positive. I don’t care if we’re losing, but I want something positive. I want you to believe we can win. Because once it happens, it’s going to happen big. I don’t want no one that you have to carry because sooner or later you’re going to get heavy. I can carry you a little ways, but sooner or later you’ve got to stand up and say, “I’ve got to carry myself the rest of the way.” Does that work in business as well? Herschel Walker: Oh, there is no doubt. If you’re running a business, and you got employees, and you’ve got one that doesn’t want to do anything but goof off, and the other ones are working hard and they’re carrying him, sooner or later he’s going to get heavy. He’s got to stand up — or she’s got to stand up —and be accounted for. If they can’t do that, you don’t need them around. You hate to say you’ll fire them, but you’ve got to make a change. They may not understand it, but that’s the way life is. This is a business; this is a football team. If you want it to be something else, you’re in the wrong line of business. You’re out there in the public eye. You’re a professional athlete. What do you think when you read about yourself in the sports pages? Herschel Walker: No, I never read an article about myself. Since I’ve been playing, I’ve never read anything about myself. I’m not a big sports page reader. I don’t read sports pages. One reason was, I don’t read about myself because I know myself better than the person that’s writing the article. I don’t read a lot of the sports because I think people sometimes either build it up, or you have this guy that hates sports that is going to write bad about it, so I figure I’m not going to read it because I’m not going to let him put an idea into my head. I think reporters do not realize that they do that. They will continue to say, “We are giving the news,” but you put an idea in someone’s head. They take an athlete, they build this athlete up — the kids look up to him and make him the best thing in the world — and this athlete makes one mistake, they write bad about him, saying he’s a bum, he’s this, he’s that. Then the next day, they build him back up again. So a kid may get that idea, and say, “Hey, I can do that. I can be great. I can be great, and I can make a mistake, and I’ll go down and come right back up.” That’s not the way life is. I think when you’re writing an article, I feel you’ve got to put what’s true. You can’t fabricate. You can’t just build it up. If you want to write for the National Enquirer, you do that, but if you are going to write for the people, let’s write. You’ve got to use the pen in the correct way. So that’s the reason why I don’t read a lot of sports stuff. Of all the things that you’ve done, what gives you the most satisfaction? Herschel Walker: Of all the things I’ve ever done? I think getting married. The reason I say that is I was a person that was always by myself a lot. I always wrote, and I think getting married gave me a best friend. It gave me a person that — she may not know all of Herschel — but she knows me better than anyone else. They always say you want to marry someone like your mother. I don’t want to say that my wife is like my mother, but my mother knows me, but then my mother says she doesn’t know me, where my wife says she knows me, and then she says she doesn’t. But it gave me a best friend, and someone that I can rely on, and I can act silly sometimes, and they are not going to judge me on that act. People sometimes judge you, but you have a right to be free a little bit. You have a right just to laugh and act up as long as it’s not in a bad way. You say you don’t read the sports pages. But growing up as an athlete, you’ve had to take criticism; you’ve been judged in one way or another. How do you deal with that? Herschel Walker: You can’t satisfy everybody. Growing up, I knew you can never satisfy everybody, so I’m not going to try to satisfy everybody. I’m going to go out and do the very best athletically on the field that I can, for my teammates, my friends, for me. If someone doesn’t like it, I can’t do anything else. When we try to satisfy everybody — you can’t satisfy everybody. That’s tough. That’s tough to do. And if you do it once, you’re going to be doing it all your life. I think I started out early not doing it. And I think today I am able to. Everyone else hated criticism. I can let it run off my back because if someone is criticizing, he’s not doing what they’re supposed to do. If we are running a race, and he’s thinking about, “Geez, Herschel is running with his knee not in the correct way,” sooner or later Herschel is going to be easing up in front of him because he’s not concentrating on what he’s supposed to do. Not speaking of the movie critics, but it’s so funny because they criticize so many movies, but yet a lot of the movies they criticize, I like. Who says that they are the people who decide about the movie? That’s the way I look at life. Like it or not, people look up to you. What kind of responsibility do you feel, as an athlete, as a very well-known and admired person? Herschel Walker: I don’t feel a big responsibility. The reason why? I think, as an adult, we all are role models because if little kids see an adult doing something, they think that it’s okay. For myself, I don’t feel responsibility. I think, no matter what, I’m going to do the very best I can do. I’m going to be the very best I can be because I think if a kid can see me doing that, he’s going to be the best he can be. That’s the way I am. I think we all should be like that because I say, “A role model? What is that? Something that inspires you to do better?” I think if we all do better, it will make this world better. So I don’t think it’s responsibility because I think if I didn’t do that, I’m cheating myself. And if I can be the best I can be, I’m helping someone else out anyway. Clearly, sports — football — is not the only thing you’re interested in. Herschel Walker: No, I’d love to be in the FBI. The FBI has always been a dream, even though I don’t think I’ll get a chance to do it. I’ve spent two weeks in Quantico, Virginia at the FBI training center. While I’m in Dallas, Texas now, I may go out with the FBI there and do a few things. I really enjoy that. That’s a lot of fun and I love that. I’m on the U.S. bobsledding team, so I do different things with that. I’m very big on martial arts; I love martial arts. I want to get into a movie with Chuck Norris and do martial arts movies. And I’ve danced with the ballet! So I do a lot of things because I think that’s what you’ve got to do. Life is almost like a tree for a 15-year-old, where, if you don’t know where you’re going to branch off to — but if you try to stay at just one thing — then you’re never going to blossom. The reason why is because you don’t know your talent. I never thought I was going to be a football player, but now I’m a football player. I’ve been a football player. I was able to go into the business world and do well. I was able to do this; I was able to do that. But yet, I think if I had said, “Okay, Herschel, you’re a basketball player. Stay with basketball,” I never would have done anything because I’m not. I can play, but I’m not a professional basketball player. So think, when you’re young, sometimes you’ve got to have an open mind. Take on other challenges. You may get into it, and you may like it a little bit more than you think. You’ve had a lot of great moments in your career. Can you tell us what some of the most exciting achievements were? Herschel Walker: My most exciting achievement has been on an Olympic team in bobsledding. One reason I say that is because there was a lot of controversy going on about whether I should have the chance to compete on an Olympic team. My problem with that is when you try for an Olympic team, I think they ask for the very best the United States has to offer. If those guys have been practicing for years and cannot beat me, who’s only been practicing for a few weeks, they do not deserve to be on the team. To have an opportunity to go and become the best pusher for the U.S., I think was my biggest accomplishment. And then, I think dancing in the Fort Worth Ballet. Ballet is probably the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. When I was asked to dance in the Fort Worth Ballet, I first declined, and then they asked me to come to the first rehearsal. So I went, and after being with professionals, I said, “I better decline because there’s no way I could do it.” And I stayed with it and I finally performed with them. People always said, “Why did you never say the Heisman Trophy?” Well, I never say the Heisman Trophy because, as a freshman, they said, “Herschel should have won the Heisman Trophy.” As a sophomore, they said, “Herschel should have won the Heisman Trophy.” As a junior, Herschel wins the Heisman Trophy, and I say “Herschel” in the third person because that’s what people say about me all of the time. But I feel my junior year, did I win the Heisman Trophy, or did they give it to me because they say, “He should have won it this year. He should have won it that year. So let’s give it to him now.” Even though I had a good year, I don’t know whether I won it because I deserved it — which I could have — or did I win it because they gave it to me? So I never say the Heisman Trophy, and people get upset with me about it, but I say, “I must tell the truth. My mother’s going to get upset with me.” There must be some football moments that stand out. Herschel Walker: Oh, football! I think winning the national championship as a freshman. I was a starter on a freshman team and won the national championship on a team that no one picked to do anything. It was funny because we were not picked and I watched from the year. I was on the cover of Sports Illustrated once and they had the college teams listed. University of Georgia was like number 16. So I have another one where the University of Georgia is number 11. And then I have another one where the University of Georgia is number one. So people never picked us to do anything, and all of a sudden, we end up winning the national championship and people were just, “That was amazing!” What that taught me was that it doesn’t matter what people think about you. It absolutely does not matter what people think about you. What matters is what you think about yourself because everybody on that team felt that we were the best team in college football. No one else outside that team felt that, but we all felt that way. So I learned then what matters most is what you feel about yourself, not what someone else feels about you. Is there any one moment in your athletic career that stands out for you? Herschel Walker: All of it means a great deal to me. It’s hard to say because all of it means so much. I don’t think I put one over the other. And this is for all the 15 years. Everything should be looked at in a positive way, whether it was something bad happening in your life, but it helped you to get better. Sometimes your parents say, “Don’t touch that. It’s hot.” But if you never touch it, you’re never going to know. So even though that was a negative response, it made a positive response in your mind because now you know not to touch it anymore. So mistakes should be taken as a training tool to help you to get better. I lost a brother, and I was so mad at God. I was mad at everyone, but it helped me to understand God a little bit more. Because God is never going to give me a burden I can’t handle. But I was being selfish. “Herschel, you are being selfish, and God is going to take care of your brother better than you could have done if he was here.” And I was being selfish. So that negative response came out to be positive because now I know God a little bit more. I know that “Herschel, you were selfish.” So now I know how to react the next go-around. Which personal characteristics do you think are most important for success, in any field? Herschel Walker: I think believing in yourself, being able to lay your head on your pillow at night and rest in peace, meaning you’ve given it your all. You’ve given everything you’ve got to give. Not worrying. You’ve got to believe that what you’re doing is right because there are some people who know what they’re doing is wrong, but they believe it so much they still do it. So you’ve got to believe what you’re doing is correct. You’ve got to believe in yourself. You have so many people that pray but yet they don’t do anything. It’s sort of like you can’t win the lottery unless you buy a ticket. You can’t hit a home run unless you take a swing at the ball. So you’ve got to be willing to work at it and believe in yourself. What kind of advice would you give to a young person who wants to go into professional sports? Herschel Walker: I think the most important thing is to, like I said, believe in yourself. Be willing to take chances. Be willing to work harder than your fellow man because in professional football, maybe only two percent — if that many — of guys coming out of college make a professional football team. Maybe even less of a percent of basketball players. So the chance that you’ll make it is very tough, so you’ve got to believe in yourself and work a little bit harder, because the guy right behind you is watching what you do, and he’s trying to work hard. Through hard work, good things you’re going to accomplish. But I always say education is so important because you can be president at 60. As a professional football player, they’re going to say you’re old at 32. They’re trying to get rid of you then. But you can be president at 60. Plus, athletes must realize in college, we’re starting out in high school because they need a foundation. I think high schools are not giving athletes the foundation to even prepare themselves for college. When they get to college, they’re not prepared for professional football. The reason why is, they have no study habits. A football player does not just go play the game. He must become a student of the game. They give you a playbook with 500 pages in training camp and say, “Learn this.” Most guys can’t learn it. Most guys do not make it. So they must have good study habits, and you get that through paying attention in school. I never said I was smart. I was valedictorian because I just paid attention. I went to school. I sat there and I just shut my mouth and I wrote down things and that was it. That’s all you’ve got to do is go to class. College — I hate to say “athlete” because there’s a lot of college students that just don’t go to class until the exam. Then they go and they try to cram. Well, you just go and pay attention. Somebody once said, “It’s better for them to think that you’re stupid by you saying nothing than for you to open your mouth and they know you’re stupid.” What would you say to a 15- or 16-year-old who comes to you seeking advice? Herschel Walker: Believe in yourself. Strive to be the very best you can be. Run the race against yourself and not the guy in the other lane. And the reason I say that is, as long as you give it 110 percent, you’re going to succeed. But as long as you’re trying to beat the guy over there, you’re worried about him, you’re not worrying about how you’ve got to perform. But believe in yourself, because I think that’s the very big key, and to work hard. To dream, it takes work. To have a nightmare takes nothing. I think if you’re going to dream, you got to be willing to work because then it can be possible. If you’re going to have a nightmare, you don’t have to do anything but just hide in the closet. I say dreams are possible through a lot of hard work. I know I talk a lot, but it’s funny because people pray sometimes. People pray, and yet they’re going to sit there with their hands out hoping God is going to drop money in their hands. It doesn’t work like that. If you’re going to pray, you’ve got to get out and do something. You can’t just sit in the bed. If you’re going to pray, you’ve got to make an effort. That’s the way it is. If you’re going to dream, you’ve got to make an effort to get out and do something. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us. Herschel Walker: Thank you.",

                "title": "Liz Cheney - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Elizabeth Lynne Cheney[1] (/ˈtʃeɪni/; born July 28, 1966)[2] is an American attorney and politician. She represented Wyoming's at-large congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2017 to 2023, and served as chair of the House Republican Conference—the third-highest position in the House Republican leadership—from 2019 to 2021. Cheney is known for her vocal opposition to Donald Trump.[3][4][5] As of March 2023, she is a professor of practice at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Cheney is the elder daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney and second lady Lynne Cheney. She held several positions in the U.S. State Department during the George W. Bush administration. She promoted regime change in Iran while chairing the Iran Syria Policy and Operations Group with Elliott Abrams. In 2009, Cheney and Bill Kristol founded Keep America Safe, a nonprofit organization concerned with national security issues that supported the Bush–Cheney administration's positions. In 2014 she was briefly a candidate for the U.S. Senate in Wyoming, challenging incumbent Mike Enzi before withdrawing. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2016, holding the same seat her father had held from 1979 to 1989.[6] Regarded as a leading ideological neoconservative[7][8][9] in the Bush–Cheney tradition as well as representative of the Republican establishment,[10] Cheney is known for her pro-business stances and hawkish foreign policy views.[11][12][13] She was once considered one of the leaders of the Republican Party's neoconservative wing,[7] and was critical of the foreign policy of the Donald Trump administration while consistently voting in favor of Trump's overall agenda.[14][15][16][17] Cheney supported the second impeachment of Donald Trump following the 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol.[18] Following her impeachment vote and criticism of Donald Trump, pro-Trump members of the House Republican Conference attempted to remove her from party leadership. In a second attempt, this time with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy supporting her removal, Cheney was removed from her position in May 2021.[19][20][21] In July 2021, Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Cheney to the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack. Two months later, she was made vice chair of the committee. As a consequence of her service on the Select Committee, Cheney's membership in the Wyoming Republican Party was revoked in November 2021.[22] She was censured by the Republican National Committee (RNC) in February 2022.[23] In 2022, Cheney lost renomination in Wyoming's Republican primary to Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman in a landslide, garnering just 28.9% of the vote.[24] Cheney has said that she intends to be \"the leader, one of the leaders, in a fight to help to restore\" the Republican Party.[25] She later endorsed and campaigned for Kamala Harris's unsuccessful run in the 2024 presidential election.[26][27] Elizabeth Lynne Cheney was born on July 28, 1966,[28] in Madison, Wisconsin.[29] She is the elder of two daughters of former vice president Dick Cheney and former second lady Lynne Cheney (née Vincent). At the time of her birth, her parents were studying at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Her younger sister, Mary Cheney, was also born in Madison. Cheney attended part of sixth and seventh grade in Casper, Wyoming, while her father campaigned for Congress. The family divided its time between Casper and Washington, D.C., in the 1970s through the 1980s, following her father's election to Congress.[30] In 1984 Cheney graduated from McLean High School in suburban Washington, D.C., where she was a cheerleader. She received her BA from Colorado College, her mother's alma mater, where she wrote a senior thesis entitled \"The Evolution of Presidential War Powers.\"[2] She received her JD from the University of Chicago Law School in 1996. While there, she also took courses in Middle Eastern history at the Oriental Institute.[31] Before attending law school, Cheney worked for the State Department for five years and the United States Agency for International Development between 1989 and 1993. After 1993, she took a job at Armitage Associates LLP, the consulting firm founded by Richard Armitage, then a former Defense Department official and later the deputy secretary of state.[32] After graduation from law school, Cheney practiced law at the law firm of White & Case and as an international law attorney and consultant at the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group. She was also special assistant to the deputy secretary of state for assistance to the former Soviet Union, and a USAID officer in U.S. embassies in Budapest and Warsaw.[33] In 2002, Cheney was appointed deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs,[34][35] a preexisting vacant post with an \"economic portfolio\", a mandate to promote investment in the region. Amid reports, including a New York Times op-ed piece by Paul Krugman,[36] that the job was created especially for her, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that she had come recommended by then-Secretary of State Colin Powell.[37][38] The Sunday Times reported that Cheney's appointment was \"the most intriguing sign that America is getting serious about Middle East reform\" and \"a measure of the seriousness with which the administration was taking Middle East programmes for literacy, education, and reform.\"[39] The appointment followed publicized policy divisions between the vice president's office and the State Department on Middle East policy. In that position, she was given control of the Middle East Partnership Initiative, designed to \"foster increased democracy and economic progress in a troubled region\". The program spent $29 million in 2002, increased to $129 million in the following year. Cheney's task was to channel money to prescreened groups, some of which were not identified publicly for fear of retaliations from extant governments they sought to undermine. For the budget year 2004, the project sought $145 million.[40][41] After two years, Cheney left her State Department post in 2003 to work for the Bush–Cheney 2004 reelection campaign. She participated in the campaign's \"W Stands for Women\" initiative to target female voters.[42] On February 14, 2005, she returned to the U.S. State Department and was appointed principal deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs and coordinator for broader Middle East and North Africa initiatives.[43][44] In this position, Cheney supported the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, C. David Welch, and coordinated multilateral efforts to promote and support democracy and expand education and economic opportunities in the Middle East and North Africa. Cheney oversaw the launch of two semi-independent foundations, the Fund of the Future (worth $100 million), to provide capital for small businesses, and the Foundation of the Future (worth $55 million), to promote freedom of the press and democracy.[45] In that capacity, Cheney endorsed a draft of a new Iraqi constitution.[46] Cheney also headed the Iran Syria Policy and Operations Group (ISOG), established in March 2006, a unit within the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. In April 2006, The New York Times published a story that was critical of Cheney's work, particularly with respect to Iran. The International Republican Institute, a grants program administered by Cheney's unit in collaboration with a Republican-affiliated foundation, received particular scrutiny.[47] Shortly before the ISOG group was dissolved, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice initiated a major effort to engage Iran and Syria in efforts to stabilize Iraq.[48] In June 2007 Cheney signed on as one of three national co-chairs of Fred Thompson's 2008 presidential campaign. The others were Spencer Abraham and George Allen. In a press release issued at the beginning of his campaign, Thompson said he was \"very pleased to announce that former senators Abraham and Allen, as well as Liz Cheney, will serve as co-chairs of my national leadership team\". He added: \"These distinguished individuals bring wise counsel and invaluable experience to my campaign leadership team, and they will play a critical role in helping spread my consistent conservative message across America.\"[49] After Thompson dropped out of the race, Cheney joined Mitt Romney's presidential campaign as a senior foreign policy advisor.[50] In October 2009, Liz Cheney, William Kristol, and Deborah Burlingame launched, as board members, the nonprofit 501(c)(4) organization Keep America Safe. The group's stated purpose is to \"provide information for concerned Americans about critical national security issues\".[51] It drew strong criticism from conservative lawyers, many of whom had worked for the Bush administration, after its campaign against \"The Al Qaeda 7\", seven Justice Department lawyers in the Obama administration who previously had worked as defense lawyers for Guantanamo detainees.[52] Shortly after, all information about the organization disappeared from the Internet.[53] In January 2012, Cheney was hired as a contributor for Fox News. She guest-hosted programs such as Hannity and Fox News Sunday.[54] The network terminated her contract in July 2013 after she started her 2014 bid for the Senate in Wyoming.[55] On July 16, 2013, Cheney launched a run for the Senate in 2014 from Wyoming as a Republican, challenging incumbent Republican senator Mike Enzi.[56] The National Republican Senatorial Committee said it would back Enzi, as was policy.[57] Cheney was expected to receive strong fundraising, but was subject to public perceptions of carpetbagging, having lived in Wyoming only a few years as a child before purchasing a home there in 2012.[58][59][60][61] When she launched her 2014 Senate campaign, she did it with a Facebook post geotagged to McLean, Virginia, her primary residence at the time.[62] During that campaign, The New Republic columnist Jon Ward wrote, \"she talked up her Wyoming roots and dressed in boots. But when I chatted with her at one stop, her jeans were so new that her hands were stained blue from touching them.\"[60] In the video she noted that the Cheney family first came to Wyoming in 1852.[58] Her father represented Wyoming in the House from 1979 to 1989.[58] In her first campaign appearance in Cheyenne, Cheney said, \"We have to not be afraid of being called obstructionists. Obstructing President Obama's policies and his agenda isn't actually obstruction; it's patriotism.\"[63] Cheney claimed that Obama had \"literally declared war\" on the First and Second amendments to the United States Constitution as well as the interests of Wyoming ranchers and energy workers who faced regulations from the United States Environmental Protection Agency.[63] Cheney's campaign was marred by criticism from her championing of \"hawkish\" foreign policy positions to a public spat with her sister over her opposition to same-sex marriage. Enzi's continuing popularity made it difficult for Cheney to make inroads with Wyoming Republicans. On January 6, 2014, Cheney withdrew from the race, citing family health issues.[64][65] After Wyoming congresswoman Cynthia Lummis retired in the fall of 2015, Cheney launched a campaign for her House seat on February 1, 2016. She was widely considered the front-runner, and a poll commissioned by the Casper Star-Tribune and Wyoming PBS showed her leading in the Republican primary – the real contest in this heavily Republican state.[66] She won a crowded Republican primary with 38% of the vote, and went on to win the general election. In the November 6 general election, Cheney was reelected to the House with 127,951 votes, defeating Democrat Greg Hunter (59,898 votes), Libertarian Richard Brubaker (6,918) and Constitution Party candidate Daniel Clyde Cummings (6,069). Cheney won 21 of 23 counties, losing Albany and Teton Counties to Hunter. On November 14, the Republican membership elected Cheney chair of the House Republican Conference for the 116th Congress. In this post, she was the third-ranking Republican in the chamber, behind Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise.[67] Cheney defeated Blake Stanley in the Republican primary with 73% of the vote, and Democrat Lynnette Grey Bull in the general election with 69% of the vote.[68] Cheney lost the August 16, 2022, Republican primary to pro-Trump candidate Harriet Hageman,[69] with 28.9% of the vote to Hageman's 66.3%. Her margin of defeat was the second-worst for a House incumbent in the last 60 years, behind that of South Carolina Republican Bob Inglis in a 2010 primary runoff.[70] Cheney was sworn into office on January 3, 2017. Donald Trump became president that same month, and an analysis by FiveThirtyEight found Cheney supported Trump's position in 92.9% of House votes.[71] She co-sponsored legislation that would end protection for gray wolves in the Endangered Species Act.[72] In May 2019, Cheney said that Peter Strzok and another FBI agent who sent personal text messages in which they disparaged various politicians (including Trump) sounded as if they were planning a \"coup\" and may be guilty of \"treason\".[73][74] In June 2019, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez compared the holding centers for illegal immigrants at the Mexico–United States border to \"concentration camps\". Cheney criticized her words, saying they showed \"disrespect\" for Holocaust victims.[75] Speaking as chairwoman at a House Republican Conference in August 2019, Cheney said that the successful litigation (Crow Tribe et al v. Zinke) by Native tribes and environmentalists to return the grizzly bear in Greater Yellowstone to the Endangered Species Act \"was not based on science or facts\" but motivated by plaintiffs' \"intent on destroying our Western way of life\". Her statements drew comments from indigenous tribal nations and environmentalists. Tribal nations hold the grizzly sacred, and environmentalists have voiced concerns about trophy hunts, livestock and logging interests, and the gas, coal, and oil extraction industries.[76][77] Cheney condemned the Turkish invasion of the Kurdish areas in Syria, which was made possible by Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. military forces that served as a buffer between Turkey and the Kurdish areas in Syria, saying, \"The U.S. is abandoning our ally the Kurds, who fought ISIS on the ground and helped protect the U.S. homeland. This decision aids America's adversaries, Russia, Iran, and Turkey, and paves the way for a resurgence of ISIS.\"[78] Cheney partly blamed the Democratic Party and the impeachment inquiry into Trump for Turkey's actions, saying, \"It was not an accident that the Turks chose this moment to roll across the border.\"[79][80] A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Cheney's claim about the impact of U.S. presidential impeachment proceedings on the invasion \"delusional\".[79] At a House Republican Conference in July 2020, some Republicans, including Jim Jordan of Ohio and Andy Biggs of Arizona, criticized Cheney for defending Dr. Fauci amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and for previously endorsing Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie's primary opponent.[81] In September 2020, Cheney asked the Justice Department to investigate environmental groups such as the NRDC, Sea Change, and the Sierra Club, saying that \"robust political and judicial activism – combined with the fact that these groups often espouse views that align with those of our adversaries – makes it all the more critical that the Department is aware of any potential foreign influence within or targeting these groups. I urge the Department to investigate Chinese and Russian attempts to influence environmental and energy policy in the United States\".[82] Beginning during his time as a Dublin, California city councilman, Eric Swalwell was targeted by a Chinese woman believed to be an undercover officer of China's Ministry of State Security. Swalwell's general relationship with a suspected Chinese agent has been characterized as problematic, particularly given his high-profile role as a member of the House Intelligence Committee.[83] Cheney signed a letter demanding Swalwell's removal from the House Intelligence Committee. She also said, \"the extent to which [the Chinese Communist Party] caused [COVID-19] to be spread around the world has really shone a spotlight on the nature of that regime, and has really focused the attention of not just people in the United States but our allies around the world on the threat that they pose and how important it is we protect ourselves by moving supply chains, by ending our dependence on the Chinese government\".[84][85] During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Cheney voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, but for the PPP Extension Act.[86][87][88] From 2017 to 2021, Cheney voted in line with Trump's position around 93% of the time, supporting him more consistently in House votes than many House Republican members, even his former chief of staff Mark Meadows.[89] In 2019, according to the New York Times, Cheney publicly feuded with Rand Paul over who was \"Trumpier\".[90] According to The Atlantic, she was a \"loyal Trumpist\" and helped build \"the party of Trump\" at that time.[91] The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution. Cheney voted against impeaching Trump on both articles during Trump's first impeachment on December 18, 2019.[92] On January 12, 2021, following the January 6 United States Capitol attack during the certification process for President-elect Joe Biden, Cheney said during Trump's second impeachment that she would vote to impeach Trump for his role in inciting the attack. Cheney said that Trump \"lit the flame\" of the riot and did nothing to stop it. Saying, \"there has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath\", she supported impeachment.[93][94] Nine other Republicans joined her in doing so on January 13.[95] She was then the third-ranking Republican in the House.[96] Jim Jordan (one of 139 House members, and 8 senators, who voted for — or supported — the objections to the Electoral College count) called for her removal from Republican Party leadership.[97] Andy Biggs took offense specifically with the wording of Cheney's remark, saying: \"She puts out a statement saying that what this president did is maybe one of the most heinous things in the history of the US presidency. Her words were used over and over again when the Democrats were making their speeches on the floor of the House. And they will be used again when the Senate opens up another bogus trial in the Senate. That is what the problem is.\"[98] Former president George W. Bush's spokesman said on January 30 that Bush supported Cheney's actions and intended to call his former vice president, Dick Cheney, to \"thank him for his daughter's service\".[99] Days later, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said, \"Liz Cheney is a leader with deep convictions and the courage to act on them. She is an important leader in our party and in our nation. I am grateful for her service and look forward to continuing to work with her on the crucial issues facing our nation\".[100] McConnell also condemned Trump supporters' \"loony lies\".[101] Senator Lindsey Graham said Cheney \"is one of the strongest and most reliable conservative voices in the Republican Party. She is a fiscal and social conservative, and no one works harder to ensure that our military is well prepared\".[102] Trump supporters were angered by Cheney's vote to impeach. On February 3, 2021, the House Republican Conference held a closed-door, secret-ballot vote on whether to remove her from her position in the Republican House leadership. She held her position by a 145–61 vote, with one member voting present. After the vote, Cheney said, \"we're not going to be divided and that we're not going to be in a situation where people can pick off any member of leadership\".[103][104] On February 6, the Wyoming Republican Party censured Cheney for her vote to impeach Trump.[105] Cheney responded, \"My vote to impeach was compelled by the oath I swore to the Constitution. Wyoming citizens know that this oath does not bend or yield to politics or partisanship. I will always fight for Wyoming values and stand up for our Western way of life.\"[105] She rejected the Wyoming party's demands that she step down and noted the censure incorrectly asserted that the Capitol attack was instigated by antifa and Black Lives Matter.[106][107] Cheney raised the possibility of a criminal investigation of Trump for provoking violence[108] and said he \"does not have a role as a leader of our party going forward\".[109][110] In April 2021, she said she would not vote for him if he were the Republican nominee for president in 2024.[111] In May 2021, she said: \"I will do everything I can to ensure that [Trump] never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office\" and \"we cannot let the former president drag us backward and make us complicit in his efforts to unravel our democracy.\"[112] In his first speech since the Capitol attack, Trump attacked the Bush administration for launching the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, and described Liz Cheney as a \"warmonger\" and \"a person that loves seeing our troops fighting\" for her support for the Bush administration's foreign policy.[113] In March 2021 former Republican speaker Paul Ryan stated his support for Cheney.[114] Salon wrote that although Cheney is \"arch-conservative\", she is \"now considered too liberal for some GOP extremists\".[115] Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said \"Liz Cheney is a solid conservative Republican\" who \"just stood up and told the truth\" in May 2021.[116] In March 2022, in an interview on Meet The Press, Cheney said she didn't regret her vote against impeaching Trump during his first impeachment for his role in the Trump–Ukraine scandal, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[117] In response to rising calls from House Republicans for her to be removed from her position as House Republican Conference chair after her ongoing criticism of Trump, Cheney wrote an opinion article, \"The GOP is at a turning point. History is watching us\", published in The Washington Post on May 5, 2021. In it, she reiterated her positions on adhering to the principles of the U.S. Constitution, upholding the law, and defending \"the basic principles that underpin and protect our freedom and our democratic process\".[118] Senator Joni Ernst criticized the GOP's efforts to remove Cheney from party leadership, comparing it to cancel culture.[119] On the eve of a House Republican vote to remove her, Cheney made an address on the House floor after her colleagues had left the chamber, saying in part: Today we face a threat America has never seen before. A former president, who provoked a violent attack on this Capitol in an effort to steal the election, has resumed his aggressive effort to convince Americans that the election was stolen from him. He risks inciting further violence. Millions of Americans have been misled by the former president. They have heard only his words, but not the truth, as he continues to undermine our democratic process, sowing seeds of doubt about whether democracy really works at all. I am a conservative Republican and the most conservative of conservative principles is reverence for the rule of law. The Electoral College has voted. More than sixty state and federal courts, including multiple judges he appointed, have rejected the former president's claims. The Department of Justice in his administration investigated the former president's claims of widespread fraud and found no evidence to support them. The election is over. That is the rule of law. That is our constitutional process. Those who refuse to accept the rulings of our courts are at war with the Constitution.[120][121] Cheney was formally removed by voice vote at a closed-door House Republican Conference meeting on May 12, 2021, and was replaced by Elise Stefanik.[19][122] Five GOP representatives requested a recorded vote, but McCarthy chose to decide the matter by voice vote.[123] As it was a voice vote conducted behind closed doors, it was unclear which lawmakers supported her ouster.[122] After her battles with Republican leadership, Cheney spent $58,000 on a private security detail.[124] On July 1, 2021, Cheney was appointed by House speaker Nancy Pelosi to the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.[125] Cheney served as vice chair of the committee.[126] While addressing the committee in June 2022, Cheney \"offered a stark message to members of her party who continue to support former president Donald Trump and downplay the events of Jan. 6. 'Tonight, I say this to my Republican colleagues who are defending the indefensible: There will come a day when Donald Trump is gone, but your dishonor will remain', she said\".[127] On November 13, 2021, the Wyoming GOP Central Committee voted 31–29 to no longer recognize Cheney as a member of the party. The resolution reiterated the general complaint for which it had censured her the previous February, saying that Cheney had never provided \"quantifiable and or undisputed evidence\" for why she had voted in favor of impeachment.[128] There had been similar votes by two Wyoming counties three months earlier to remove her from the party.[129] On February 4, 2022, the Republican National Committee called the events of January 6, 2021 \"legitimate political discourse\" and overwhelmingly voted to censure Cheney and Representative Adam Kinzinger by voice vote for taking part in the House investigation of the Capitol assault.[130] Cheney has described herself as a conservative Republican.[132] Lawrence R. Jacobs has said, \"Cheney is an arch-conservative. She's a hard-edged, small government, lower taxes figure and a leading voice on national defense.\"[133] Jake Bernstein argued that \"Liz Cheney is a true conservative in every sense of the word and she's only a moderate in relation to the radicalism that has seized the Republican party.\"[133] Politico called her the \"face of the anti-Trump GOP and a relic of the Republican Party before the dominance of Trump.\"[134] Cheney has several times been described as \"Republican royalty\".[135][136] The National Interest called her the \"heiress to a neoconservative throne\".[7] Salon called her \"arch-conservative\".[115] The Brookings Institution argued that Cheney has a long-term strategy to become the leader of the Republican Party in the post-Trump era, and that \"she's a real conservative—Democrats who like her opposition to Trump will never like her politics.\"[137] Conservative Republican John Bolton has described Cheney as \"a person of integrity and character\" who is involved in politics for philosophical reasons rather than self-interest, and who shares the determination of her father.[138] In May 2021, Cheney said that she intended to be \"the leader, one of the leaders, in a fight to help to restore our party\".[25] Following her primary defeat in August 2022, Cheney filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission creating a leadership political action committee (PAC) named The Great Task. The PAC's name comes from the Gettysburg Address: Lincoln spoke of the \"great task remaining before us\".[139] In September 2022, Cheney stated \"if [Donald Trump] is the nominee, I won't be a Republican.\"[140] The following May, The Great Task ran an ad in New Hampshire advising Republican primary voters not to support Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.[141] As recently as June 2023, Cheney declined to rule out a presidential bid in 2024.[142] Beginning in 2021, Cheney repeatedly expressed an openness to potentially running for president in 2024.[143][144][145] On September 4, 2024, Cheney told a group of students at Duke University that she would be voting for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, stating that, \"As a conservative and someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution ... I will be voting for Kamala Harris.”[146] During the 2022 midterm elections, Cheney said she would campaign against Republican candidates who denied or questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election.[147] Her political action committee, the Great Task, ran TV ads imploring Republican voters in Arizona to vote against Kari Lake and Mark Finchem, the Republican nominees for governor and secretary of state, respectively. (Both lost.)[148] In October 2022, she endorsed Democratic congresswoman Elissa Slotkin for reelection over Republican nominee Tom Barrett, a Michigan state senator who questioned the results of the 2020 election.[148] According to Cheney, her endorsement of Slotkin was her first ever of a Democrat.[149] Cheney also expressed support for Ohio Democrat Tim Ryan in his U.S. Senate campaign against Republican JD Vance; Vance supported false claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.[150] Cheney also endorsed Democratic congresswomen Abigail Spanberger over her Republican opponent, Yesli Vega, who Cheney said promoted conspiracy theories.[151] On December 5, 2023, Cheney released a memoir, titled Oath and Honor: A Memoir and a Warning, in which she recounted her experience before, during, and after January 6, as well as her time serving as Vice Chair of the January 6th Committee, and admonished many of her Republican colleagues, including former House speaker Kevin McCarthy and current speaker Mike Johnson.[152] The book quickly sold out and became a bestseller.[153] In a speech at the Democracy Summit at Dartmouth College on Friday, January 5, Cheney urged voters to reject Donald Trump as the Republican presidential nominee in the 2024 election, saying, “Show the world that we will defeat the plague of cowardice sweeping through the Republican Party.”[154] The next day, Cheney posted a tweet, criticizing comments by Trump on the American Civil War, in which he said, \"I'm so attracted to seeing it, so many mistakes were made...There was something that could've been negotiated.\"[155] Cheney wrote, \"Question for members of the GOP—the party of Lincoln—who have endorsed Donald Trump: How can you possibly defend this?\"[156] On April 22, 2024, Cheney published an essay in The New York Times urging the Supreme Court of the United States to quickly decide on presidential immunity to allow the legal proceedings of former President Trump to overturn the 2020 election to proceed in a timely manner.[157] In September 2024, Cheney said in an interview with Madison, Wisconsin's The Capital Times that Trump has \"so corrupted\" the Republican Party during his nine years there that it's causing the Republican Party to die and possibly become unsalvageable and that traditional conservatives such as herself may have to start a new conservative party to revive pre-Trump style conservatism.[158] Cheney has supported bills to further restrict opioids in the face of the opioid epidemic.[159] She voted against the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act of 2019/2020 (H.R. 3884), which, among other things, would have removed cannabis from the list of scheduled substances regulated by the Controlled Substances Act and establish a process to expunge criminal convictions for cannabis.[160][161] Cheney has largely been considered a neoconservative and an interventionist.[9] She opposed proposals to withdraw from Afghanistan.[162] Cheney has criticized what she has called the \"Putin wing\" of the Republican Party.[163][164] When working in the United States Department of State as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, Cheney supported the Iraq War, as promoted by her father, Dick Cheney.[165][better source needed] According to Mother Jones, Cheney insists \"that one of the main lies of the Bush-Cheney fraudulent case for war—that there had been a significant connection between al-Qaeda and Iraq—was true.\"[166] New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd has commented that Cheney used \"her patronage perch in the State Department during the Bush-Cheney years ... [and] bolstered her father's trumped-up case for an invasion of Iraq\" while cheering \"on her dad as he spread fear, propaganda and warped intelligence\".[167] Cheney is a strong supporter of Israel and has expressed support for Israeli plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank.[168] She signed a letter to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that reaffirms \"the unshakeable alliance between the United States and Israel\".[169] In 2015, Cheney and her father expressed opposition to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, saying that it would \"lead to a nuclear-armed Iran\".[170] On June 21, 2019, after Trump called off military strikes against Iran for allegedly downing an American drone, Cheney compared Trump not attacking Iran to Barack Obama not attacking Syria in 2013.[171] On September 18, 2019, she called for the United States to consider a \"proportional military response\" against Iran after it was attacking oil bases in the Saudi regions of Abqaiq and Khurais.[172] On June 17, 2021, Cheney was one of 160 House Republicans to vote against repealing the 2002 AUMF, which granted the Bush administration the authority to wage war with Iraq. She said that repealing the resolution \"would send a message of weakness to our adversaries and allies alike\".[173] Cheney opposes the no-first-use nuclear policy. After the second round of the 2020 Democratic Party presidential debates, Cheney criticized Elizabeth Warren when she advocated the policy.[174][175] Cheney voted to include provisions to draft women in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022.[176] Cheney has supported the use of torture. In 2009, she defended the use of waterboarding during the George W. Bush administration, comparing it to SERE training.[177][178][179] In 2014, she criticized President Barack Obama after he said, \"we tortured some folks\".[180] Also that year, she criticized Nancy Pelosi for calling out her father for his support of using torture.[181] In 2018, when U.S. senator John McCain criticized CIA director nominee Gina Haspel, Cheney again defended the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, saying that they \"saved lives, prevented attacks, and produced intel that led to Osama bin Laden\". Cheney's remarks were criticized by Meghan McCain, who responded that her father—who was tortured as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War—\"doesn't need torture explained to him\".[182] On September 26, 2021, during an interview with Lesley Stahl on 60 Minutes, Cheney reaffirmed her support for waterboarding, saying that it is not torture.[183] Cheney was one of 35 Republicans who joined all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol.[184][185][186] Before the vote, she was one of few Republican lawmakers who openly expressed support for the commission.[187] On October 21, 2021, Cheney was one of nine House Republicans who voted to hold Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress.[188] In 2013, during her Senate bid, Cheney voiced her opposition to same-sex marriage.[189] This caused a public falling-out with her sister, Mary Cheney, who is gay and wrote in a Facebook post, \"Either [y]ou think all families should be treated equally or you don't. Liz's position is to treat my family as second class citizens.\"[190][a] Mary declared she would not support Liz's 2014 Senate candidacy.[192] The family spat becoming a focus of media attention was cited as one of the reasons Cheney ended her Senate campaign.[193] On September 26, 2021, during an interview with Lesley Stahl on 60 Minutes, Cheney expressed regret for not supporting same-sex marriage.[183] She was one of 47 Republicans to vote for the Respect for Marriage Act of 2022, which would codify same-sex marriage into federal law, and passed the House, 267–157.[194] In 2022, Cheney voted for H.R. 8373 (\"The Right to Contraception Act\"), a bill designed to protect access to contraceptives and health care providers' ability to provide contraceptives and information about contraception.[195] Cheney, stating she had, \"always been strongly pro-life\" spoke in praise of the Supreme Court's overturn of Roe v. Wade as part of their Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling.[196] Cheney's opposition to abortion has earned her a 0% approval rating from the Planned Parenthood action fund, and a 93% approval rating from the National Right to Life Committee.[197] Bud Goodall in 2010 called Cheney a \"conspiracy propagandist\".[198] In 2009, Cheney refused to denounce adherents of Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories (birtherism) on Larry King Live, saying that the birtherism movement existed because \"people are uncomfortable with a president who is reluctant to defend the nation overseas\".[199][200] According to Mother Jones, the Obama citizenship conspiracy theory was an \"odious lie that Liz Cheney also defended\".[166] In 2009, Cheney gave the keynote address at a dinner hosted by the Center for Security Policy, an anti-Muslim think tank deemed a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center[201][202] and known for promoting the false claim that Obama is a Muslim.[203] Cheney has denounced the far-right conspiracy theory QAnon, saying, \"QAnon is a dangerous lunacy that should have no place in American politics\".[204] On September 4, 2024, Liz Cheney announced at Duke University that she is supporting Kamala Harris for president. \"And as a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this, and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris\" she said. On September 6, 2024, her father Dick Cheney announced that he is supporting Kamala Harris and the Democratic ticket for president of the United States and that Trump is a \"threat to our republic\" and a \"coward\" and that \"he tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.\" In response, Donald Trump texted on his Trump Social platform that \"Dick Cheney is an irrelevant RINO, along with his daughter\".[205][206] At an Arizona rally on November 1, 2024, Trump called Cheney a \"war hawk\" and said \"Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK? Let's see how she feels about it, you know when the guns are trained on her face. They're all war hawks when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, 'Oh, gee, well let's send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy.'\" Cheney responded by saying, \"This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death.\"[207][208] Following Trump's remarks, Kris Mayes, the Arizona Attorney General, launched an investigation into whether Trump's statement qualified as a prosecutable death threat under Arizona law.[209] Kamala Harris' campaign welcomed Cheney's support, a move criticized by Ilhan Omar, The Nation, and Newsweek as ineffective due to her bipartisan unpopularity.[210][211][212][213] Cheney was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50, a list of notable entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists, and creators older than age 50.[214] She was also included in the 2021 Time 100, Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[215] On April 22, 2022, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation named Cheney a Profile in Courage Award recipient for \"defending democracy\". The foundation said that Cheney had been a \"consistent and courageous voice in defense of democracy\" and that she had \"refused to take the politically expedient course that most of her party embraced.\"[216] The award was presented in person on May 22.[217] Cheney was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws from Dartmouth College in June 9, 2024.[218] Cheney is a United Methodist.[219] She is married to Philip Perry, a partner at Latham & Watkins. They were married in Wyoming in 1993. They have five children.[220] In 2012, Cheney moved to Wyoming.[221]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Liz Cheney (born July 28, 1966, Madison, Wisconsin, U.S.) is an American attorney and Republican politician who served as the congresswoman from Wyoming in the U.S. House of Representatives (2017–23). The daughter of Lynne Vincent Cheney and Dick Cheney, Liz Cheney was born in Madison, Wisconsin, where her parents were enrolled in graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin. The family moved to the Washington, D.C., area in 1968 and settled there, when Dick Cheney served as a congressional fellow and then went on to hold various positions in government service over the next several years. In 1977 the Cheneys moved to Wyoming, where both parents had grown up. The next year, Dick Cheney was elected to serve as Wyoming’s congressman (1979–89), and the family returned to the D.C. area, settling in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., while also continuing to spend time in Wyoming. Liz Cheney attended McLean High School, graduating in 1984, and went on to attend Colorado College, earning a bachelor’s degree in 1988; while there, she met her future husband, Philip Perry. After college Cheney worked for the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State, and Armitage Associates, LLP, a consulting firm. She enrolled in the University of Chicago Law School, from which she graduated in 1996, and went on to practice law at White & Case law firm in Washington, D.C. Cheney’s father served as vice president of the United States in 2001–09 under Pres. George W. Bush, and she was very active in her father’s campaigns for the 2000 and 2004 elections. Meanwhile, in 2002 she had returned to work at the State Department, serving first as deputy assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs and then as principal deputy assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs. After leaving the State Department, in 2009 she cofounded Keep America Safe, an organization that was vocal in its opposition to the national security policies of Pres. Barack Obama; the group was criticized for some of its attacks. Cheney, Perry, and their five children moved to Wyoming in 2012. The next year she announced that she was seeking the Republican nomination for one of Wyoming’s Senate seats in the 2014 election. Her challenge to a popular incumbent, Sen. Mike Enzi, was not well received, and she was called a carpetbagger, which she tried to refute by highlighting her family’s deep roots in the state. Notably, during her campaign she stated that she was not in favor of same-sex marriage, which sparked a public dispute with her sister, Mary Cheney—a lesbian—and Mary Cheney’s wife. (In September 2021 Liz Cheney reversed her stance on same-sex marriage and said she was wrong to have opposed it). Liz Cheney’s campaign came to an end in January 2014, when, citing serious health challenges in her family, she dropped out of the race. A year before the 2016 elections, the representative for Wyoming’s lone House seat announced that she would not be running for reelection, and in early 2016 Liz Cheney announced her campaign for the seat. She was successful, easily beating out several challengers in the Republican primary and then winning in the November general election. Cheney was sworn into the 115th Congress on January 3, 2017. She was reelected in 2018 and 2020. During her time in Congress, Cheney served on the House Rules Committee, Natural Resources Committee, and Armed Services Committee. In 2018 she was elected chair of the House Republican Conference, effective 2019, making her the third-ranking Republican in the House. Cheney largely voted in step with the agenda of the Republican president, Donald Trump (2017–21), and, when the House held a vote to impeach him in 2019, she voted against the two articles of impeachment. Cheney’s support of Trump changed drastically after the November 2020 election, which the president falsely claimed was rigged and that he had actually won, and after the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, that occurred after President Trump gave a speech in which he encouraged a large crowd of his supporters to march to the Capitol and violently resist Congress’s certification of Joe Biden’s victory over him in the November 2020 presidential election. Cheney was vocal in her criticism of Trump’s actions that day and of his false claims about the election. In the ensuing impeachment proceedings later that month, she voted in favor of the article of impeachment. Her vote to impeach and her continued outspoken criticism of Trump—she famously said that “there has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution”—put her at odds with the majority of her Republican colleagues. She successfully fended off calls for her to be removed from her position of Republican Conference chair in February, but in May she was stripped of the post. In July 2021 Cheney was selected by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to serve on the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol; she was one of only two Republicans to serve on the committee. She was named vice chair of the committee in September. Her embrace of the committee’s work to investigate the January 6 attack, as well as her continued criticism of Trump’s false claims that he won the 2020 election, led the Wyoming Republican Party to declare in November 2021 that it would no longer recognize her as a member of the party; it had previously censured her in February after she voted to impeach Trump. Undaunted, in May 2022 Cheney announced that she was running for reelection. The next month, the Select Committee’s televised hearings began, with Cheney taking a prominent role in the proceedings. Cheney’s unrelenting repudiation of Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, her vote to impeach Trump, and her significant role in the January 6 attack investigation and hearings made her very unpopular with most of her Wyoming constituents, who overwhelmingly supported Trump. As such, she was expected to lose in the Republican primary election, held on August 16, 2022. She was soundly defeated by Harriet Hageman, a candidate who fully embraced Trump’s false election claims and had the support of the former president as well as the Republican Party leadership. As Cheney conceded the election that night, she condemned the election denialism movement in the Republican Party and reaffirmed her resolve to put country over party and to fight for the survival of America’s democracy. Her term in Congress ended in January 2023. Cheney wrote three books with her father: her father’s autobiography, My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir (2011); Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America (2015); and Heart: An American Medical Odyssey (2013), which was also written with her father’s heart surgeon. In 2023 she published Oath and Honor: A Memoir and a Warning, her account of the January 6th attack, the events that led up to it, and the aftermath.",

She has been one of the most conservative members within the Republican Conference. After the election, however, when President Trump falsely claimed that the election was stolen, she repeatedly called on the President to respect the rulings of the courts and his oath of office, and to publicly support the peaceful transfer of power. When the President instead rejected the lawful, certified outcome of the election, she broke with most in her party, urged fidelity to the Constitution, and stood her ground with honor and conviction. She stood against the lawlessness and violence of January 6th, and voted to impeach President Trump, concluding: \"The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.” Cheney received numerous death threats after casting her vote in favor of impeachment, and yet refused to take the politically expedient course that most of her party embraced. Because she would not remain silent or ignore the events of January 6th, Cheney's congressional colleagues stripped her of her leadership position in the GOP caucus. She served as the Vice Chair of the Select Committee investigating the January 6 insurrection, and remains a consistent and courageous voice in defense of democracy. The John F.

                "content": "In recent weeks and months, dozens of prominent security and military officials and Republican politicians have come out against Donald Trump, declaring him a security threat, unfit for office, and, in some cases, a fascist. Way out in front of this movement was Liz Cheney. Up until 2021, she was the third-ranking Republican in Congress, but after the January 6th insurrection she voted to impeach Trump. She then served as vice-chair of the House Select Committee on the January 6th attack. She must have expected it would cost her the midterms and her seat in Congress, which ended up being the case when Wyoming voters rejected her in 2022. Since then, Cheney has gone further, campaigning forcefully on behalf of Vice-President Harris. David Remnick spoke with Cheney last week at The New Yorker Festival, shortly after Jeff Bezos, owner of the Washington Post, blocked its planned endorsement of Harris. “It absolutely proves the danger of Donald Trump,” Cheney said. “When you have Jeff Bezos apparently afraid to issue an endorsement for the only candidate in the race who’s a stable, responsible adult, because he fears Donald Trump, that tells you why we have to work so hard to make sure that Donald Trump isn’t elected,” Cheney told Remnick. “And I cancelled my subscription to the Washington Post.” Animation Copyright © 2024 Apple Inc.

                "content": "Adam McCalvy Addressing his crowded outfield on Tuesday, Cubs president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer told reporters that, “We’re not done yet.” And he wasn’t kidding. Hours after Hoyer uttered those words about last week’s addition of three-time All-Star Kyle Tucker, Chicago traded one of its surplus outfielders, former National League MVP Cody Bellinger, to the Yankees along with cash for right-hander Cody Poteet. It was one of two trades on Tuesday for the Cubs, who also shipped catcher Matt Thaiss to the White Sox for cash. Chicago had just acquired Thaiss from the Angels in November for cash, but he was forced down the depth chart when the Cubs signed catcher Carson Kelly to a two-year deal. TRADE DETAILSCubs receive: RHP Cody PoteetYankees receive: OF/1B Cody Bellinger, $5 million TRADE DETAILSCubs receive: CashWhite Sox receive: C Matt Thaiss Besides adding pitching depth in Poteet, a 30-year-old who has a 3.80 ERA in 83 Major League innings for the Marlins and Yankees since 2021, the Cubs cleared some excess from their depth chart by moving Bellinger, who’d long been rumored to be available in a trade. The Cubs already had Ian Happ in left field, Pete Crow-Armstrong in center and Bellinger and Seiya Suzuki in right before Tucker arrived last week. The designated hitter provides some flexibility, but only to a point. So Bellinger was moved to New York with two years and $52.5 million left on his three-year contract with the Cubs, which has opt outs following each season. Bellinger already exercised his $27.5 million player option in November to stick with the Cubs, and has another player option for 2026 at $25 million with a $5 million buyout. According to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, the Blue Jays also showed interest in trading for Bellinger, helping the Cubs move him while reportedly paying down only $5 million of what he’s still owed. Bellinger, 29, revived his career with the Cubs in 2023, when he hit .307/.356/.525 with 26 home runs, 97 RBIs and 20 stolen bases. He re-signed with Chicago but didn’t deliver the same kind of season in ‘24, when his OPS slipped to .751, down 130 points from the year before. The Cubs, meanwhile, went 83-79 under new manager Craig Counsell. So Hoyer went into the offseason seeking star power and found it in a trade for Tucker -- who is coming off four straight seasons north of four wins above replacement with the Astros -- even if that deal left Chicago with too many outfielders. “There's a finite number of ways that we can really improve as a team, especially on a position player side,” Hoyer said of adding Tucker. “Because in order to get a player that's better than our internal replacement level, you have to go fairly high. We have a lot of good players. We're very balanced, and so there's just not that many players out there that were available that we felt like, ‘OK, this player clearly makes us a better team. He provides something we don't have.’ And obviously, Tucker provides that.” Poteet, Miami’s fourth-round pick in 2015, has experience both as a starter and a reliever in the Majors, but he’s been mostly a starting pitcher in the Minors, compiling a 3.76 ERA over parts of nine seasons with a modest 7.4 strikeouts per nine innings. He was sidelined for much of last season by a triceps injury and went 3-0 with a 3.40 ERA in 13 starts between Double-A and Triple-A in the Minors, and 3-0 with a 2.22 ERA in five games (four starts) in the Majors for New York.",

                "content": "NEW YORK — The New York Yankees agreed to acquire outfielder Cody Bellinger from the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday for right-hander Cody Poteet, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the trade had not been announced. Chicago will send the Yankees $5 million as part of the trade, the person said. The 29-year-old Bellinger, whose father Clay helped the Yankees win World Series titles in 1999 and 2000, is owed $27.5 million in 2025 under the first of two player options as part of an $80 million, three-year contract. The two-time All-Star also has a $25 million player option for 2026 with a $5 million buyout that would be payable in equal installments on Jan. 15, 2026, and Jan. 15, 2027. Bellinger batted .266 with 18 homers and 78 RBIs in 130 games this year. He was on the injured list from April 24 to May 7 with a broken right rib. He drove in 33 runs in his last 39 games of the season, but Chicago finished with an 83-79 record. Bellinger, who plays first base and center field, made his major league debut in 2017 and spent his first six seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was the NL MVP in 2019, batting .305 with 47 homers and 115 RBIs in 156 games. He also helped LA win the World Series in 2020. He was cut by the Dodgers in November 2022 and signed a $17.5 million, one-year deal with Chicago a month later. He regained his form with the Cubs, hitting a career-best .307 with 26 homers, 97 RBIs and 20 steals in 130 games last season year. Bellinger is a .259 hitter with 196 homers and 597 RBIs in 1,005 games. He turns 30 in July. Poteet, 30, made his major league debut with Miami in 2021, had Tommy John surgery on Aug. 17, 2022, returned to the mound with Kansas City's Triple-A Omaha farm team on Sept. 23, 2023, was released by the Royals and signed with the Yankees last January. He went 3-0 with a 2.22 ERA in four starts and one relief appearance during a season in which he was sidelined between June 12 and Sept. 25 by a strained right triceps.

                "content": "Forgot your password? By Matthew Trueblood In a move necessary because of the Cubs' acquisition of Kyle Tucker from the Houston Astros, the team has dealt outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger to the New York Yankees. In order to add Kyle Tucker's projected arbitration salary (in excess of $15 million) and maintain the payroll flexibility they need to further supplement the roster thereafter, the Cubs needed to offload the hefty contract of Cody Bellinger. After acquiring Tucker Friday afternoon, the team sent Bellinger and cash to the New York Yankees, in exchange for right-handed swingman Cody Poteet. Poteet, 30, is an interesting pickup. He has four years of remaining team control and can still be optioned to the minors, which is welcome flexibility. He has five pitches, though his soft stuff—sweeper, curveball, changeup—is a little better than his four-seamer or sinker. He only throws about 93 miles per hour, and the slot and the movement are fairly vanilla. He doesn't strike out a lot of hitters. He's a fairly fungible arm, but a clearly usable one, and he can cover multiple innings—even as a three- or four-inning long man or spot starter. Poteet would probably be a more known quantity, if not for a string of brutal injuries. The second half of his 2021 season was pulverized by a knee issue. He underwent Tommy John surgery in mid-2022 and missed all of 2023, and in 2024, he spent about half the season on the shelf with a triceps strain. That's why the Cubs (like most teams would) now view him mostly as a reliever, rather than because he's unable to start from a skills perspective. It's also why he was available in this deal. He has real upside; he's just not reliably available. Sending out Bellinger is as much about accommodating the personnel as about money, but without question, it's about both. The team is very unlikely to spend up to the competitive balance tax threshold, according to multiple sources, which means that clearing a hefty chunk of the $30 million they owed Bellinger for 2025 was important if they were to make a big splash elsewhere on the roster. This move ensures that they'll have that flexibility. The team can now turn its attention back to free-agent targets like Kirby Yates and Kyle Finnegan, but they might not be done making significant trades, either. On Friday, the Cubs and Yankees were talking about starting pitching prospect Will Warren as compensation for Bellinger, but as the sides haggled, the Cubs became increasingly resistant to sending the amount of money the Yankees demanded to consummate that version of the deal. In the end, they'll send just $5 million to New York. Getting Poteet while clearing so much money from their books lets the Cubs pivot more flexibly toward their next set of acquisitions, including (but not limited to) another starting pitcher. Losing Bellinger's high-contact, occasionally powerful bat from the lineup will lightly sting, but the team was left-handed enough as it was, especially after bringing in Tucker—who is a marked upgrade from Bellinger. The real risk embraced in this trade is tied to Pete Crow-Armstrong, who is now operating without a net as he enters his first full, unfettered season as the team's center fielder. Non-tendering Mike Tauchman and trading Bellinger are clear messages about the faith the Cubs have in their young defensive whiz and his offensive upside, but right now, they also leave the team staring at a choice between Kevin Alcántara and Alexander Canario as the backup center fielders. In all likelihood, the team will try to land one more accomplished center fielder (albeit on the cheap), so they have some measure of insurance against regression or injury for Crow-Armstrong. Bellinger and the Cubs were largely good for each other; the rest of the club's roster-building just wasn't good enough to fully capitalize on what he brought to the table. He also struggled to stay healthy, twice running into outfield walls and ending up injured in the process of making good catches. He probably didn't belong in center field anymore, anyway, so when he opted back in after the season, this immediately popped onto the team's radar. Getting Poteet and significant salary relief for Bellinger is another win, especially because the Cubs have clearer utility for him than they had for Wesneski. It's a smaller, secondary trade in the shadow of a true blockbuster, but this one, too, has a chance to make the Cubs substantially better, by giving them more spending power this winter and bringing in a controllable arm who could become a fixture.

They also hold the NFL records for the most enshrinees in the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the most retired jersey numbers. The Bears' NFL championships and overall victories are second behind the Green Bay Packers,[11][12][13] with whom they have a long-standing rivalry.[14] The franchise was founded in Decatur, Illinois, on September 20, 1919,[15][16][17] became professional on September 17, 1920, and moved to Chicago in 1921.[18][19] It is one of two remaining franchises from the NFL founding in 1920, along with the Arizona Cardinals, which began in Chicago. The team played home games at Wrigley Field on Chicago's North Side through the 1970 season; playing since then at Soldier Field on the Near South Side, adjacent to Lake Michigan. The team headquarters, Halas Hall, is in the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, Illinois. The Bears practice at adjoining facilities there during the season, and began hosting training camp at Halas Hall in 2020 after major renovations. In March of 1920 a man telephoned me ... George Chamberlain and he was general superintendent of the A.E. Staley Company ... In 1919, [the company's Fellowship Club] had formed a football team. It had done well against other local teams but Mr. Staley wanted to build it into a team that could compete successfully with the best semi-professional and industrial teams in the country ... Mr. Chamberlain asked if I would like to come to Decatur and work for the Staley Company. Originally named the Decatur Staleys, the club was established by the A. E. Staley food starch company of Decatur, Illinois as a company team. This was the typical start for several early professional football franchises. The team played independently in 1919, winning the Central Illinois Championship.[20] The company hired George Halas and Edward \"Dutch\" Sternaman in 1920 to run the team. The 1920 Decatur Staleys season[21] was their inaugural regular season completed in the newly formed American Professional Football Association (later renamed the National Football League (NFL) in 1922). Full control of the team was turned over to Halas and Sternaman in 1921.[22] Official team and league records cite Halas as the founder as he took over the team in 1920 when it became a charter member of the NFL.[23] The team moved to Chicago in 1921, where the club was renamed the Chicago Staleys; Under an agreement reached by Halas and Sternaman with Staley, they received US$5,000 to keep the name \"Staleys\" for the 1921 season.[24] In 1922, Halas changed the team name from the Staleys to the Bears.[25] The team moved into Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs baseball franchise. As with several early NFL franchises, the Bears derived their nickname from their city's baseball team (bears' young are called \"cubs\").[26] Halas liked the bright orange-and-blue colors of his alma mater, the University of Illinois, and the Bears adopted those colors as their own, albeit in a darker shade of each (the blue is Pantone 5395, navy blue, and the orange is Pantone 1665, similar to burnt orange).[27][28] The Staleys/Bears dominated the league in the early years. Their rivalry with the Chicago Cardinals, the oldest in the NFL (and a crosstown rival from 1920 to 1959), was key in four out of the first six league titles. During the league's first six years, the Bears lost twice to the Canton Bulldogs (who took two league titles over that span), and split with their crosstown rival Cardinals (going 4–4–2 against each other over that span), but no other team in the league defeated the Bears more than a single time. During that span, the Bears posted 34 shutouts. The Bears' rivalry with the Green Bay Packers is one of the oldest and most storied in American professional sports, dating back to 1921 (the Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL in 1921). In one infamous incident that year, Halas got the Packers expelled from the league in order to prevent their signing a particular player, and then graciously got them re-admitted after the Bears had closed the deal with that player.[29] The franchise was an early success under Halas, capturing the NFL Championship in 1921 and remaining competitive throughout the decade. In 1924 the Bears claimed the Championship after defeating the Cleveland Bulldogs on December 7, even putting the title \"World's Champions\" on their 1924 team photo. But the NFL had ruled that games after November 30 did not count towards league standings, and the Bears had to settle for second place behind Cleveland.[30] Their only losing season came in 1929. During the 1920s the club was responsible for triggering the NFL's long-standing rule that a player could not be signed until his college's senior class had graduated. The NFL took that action as a consequence of the Bears' aggressive signing of famous University of Illinois player Red Grange within a day of his final game as a collegian.[31] Despite much of the on-field success, the Bears were a team in trouble. They faced the problem of increased operating costs and flatlined attendance. The Bears would only draw roughly 5,000–6,000 fans a game, while a University of Chicago game would draw 40,000–50,000 fans a game. By adding top college football draw Red Grange to the roster, the Bears knew that they found something to draw more fans to their games. C.C. Pyle was able to secure a $2,000 per game contract for Grange, and in one of the first games, the Bears defeated the Green Bay Packers, 21–0. However, Grange remained on the sidelines while learning the team's plays from Bears quarterback Joey Sternaman. Later in 1925, The Bears would go on a barnstorming tour, showing off the best football player of the day. 75,000 people paid to see Grange lead the Bears to a 17–7 victory over the Los Angeles Tigers, who were a quickly put together team of West Coast college all-stars. After a loss to San Francisco, the Bears cruised to a 60–3 over a semi-pro team called the Portland All Stars.[32] Any hopes that Grange would lead the Bears to glory in 1926 were quickly dashed. A failed contract talk led to Grange bolting to the AFL's New York Yankees, owned by Pyle. The Bears also lost star quarterback Joey Sternaman, who joined the Chicago Bulls of the AFL. The Bears replaced Grange with Paddy Driscoll, a star football player in his own right. The Bears used the money made from the Grange barn-storming tour to sign the man that replaced him. Grange split his time between making movies and playing football. However, the time was not right to have two competing pro football leagues, and the AFL folded after only one season. Grange would return to the Bears.[32] After the financial losses of the 1932 Championship season, Halas' partner Dutch Sternaman left the organization. Halas maintained full control of the Bears until his death in 1983. He also coached the team off-and-on for forty seasons, an NFL record. In the 1932 \"Unofficial\" NFL Championship, the Bears defeated the Portsmouth Spartans in the first NFL playoff game.[33] Due to blizzard conditions in Chicago, the game was played at Chicago Stadium,[33][34] marking it as the first indoor American football game. The success of the playoff game led the NFL to institute a championship game. In the first NFL Championship, the Bears played against the New York Giants, defeating them 23–21. The teams met again in the 1934 NFL Championship where the Giants, wearing sneakers[35] defeated the Bears 30–13 on a cold, icy day at the Polo Grounds. From 1940 to 1947, quarterback Sid Luckman led the Bears to victories in four out of the five NFL Championship Games in which they appeared. The team acquired the University of Chicago's discarded nickname \"Monsters of the Midway\" and their famous helmet wishbone-C, as well as a newly penned theme song that declared them \"The Pride and Joy of Illinois\". One famous victory during that period was their 73–0 victory over the favored Washington Redskins at Griffith Stadium in the 1940 NFL Championship Game;[36] the score is still an NFL record for lopsided results.[37] The secret behind the one-sided outcome was the introduction of a new offensive formation by Halas. The T-formation, as Halas named it, involved two running backs instead of the traditional one in the backfield. Luckman established himself as one of the franchise's most elite quarterbacks. Between 1939 and 1950, he set the Bears' passing records for most career touchdowns, yards, and completions. Many of Luckman's records stood for decades before they were eclipsed by Jay Cutler in 2014.[38] Cutler then went on to break Luckman's franchise record for most career passing touchdowns a year later in 2015.[39] After declining throughout the 1950s, the team rebounded in 1963 to capture its eighth NFL Championship, which would be its last until 1985.[40] The late 1960s and early-1970s produced notable players like Dick Butkus, Gale Sayers, and Brian Piccolo,[41] who died of embryonal carcinoma in 1970. The American television network ABC aired a movie about Piccolo in 1971 entitled Brian's Song, starring James Caan and Billy Dee Williams in the roles of Piccolo and Sayers respectively; Jack Warden won an Emmy Award for his performance as Halas. The movie was later released for theater screenings after first being shown on television. Despite Hall of Fame careers, Butkus and Sayers would also have their careers cut short due to injuries, hamstringing the Bears of this era. Halas retired as coach in 1967 and spent the rest of his days in the front office.[42] He became the only person to be involved with the NFL throughout the first 60 years of its existence. He was also a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's first induction class in 1963.[43] As the only living founder of the NFL at the February 1970 merger between the NFL and the American Football League, the owners honored Halas by electing him the first President of the National Football Conference, a position that he held until his death in 1983. In his honor, the NFL named the NFC Championship trophy as the George Halas Memorial Trophy.[44] After the merger, the Bears finished the 1970 season last place in their division, a repeat of their placing in the 1969 season.[45] In 1975, the Bears drafted Walter Payton from Jackson State University with their first pick.[46] He won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award in the 1977–78 season.[47][48] Payton would go on to eclipse Jim Brown's NFL career rushing record in 1984 before retiring in 1987, and would hold the mark until 2002, when Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys surpassed it.[49] Payton's career and personality would capture the hearts of Bear fans, who called him \"Sweetness\".[50] He died from a rare form of liver cancer in 1999 at the age of 45.[51] On November 1, 1983, a day after the death of George Halas, his oldest daughter, Virginia McCaskey, took over as the majority owner of the team.[52] Her husband, Ed McCaskey, succeeded her father as the chairman of the board.[53] Their son Michael became the third president in team history.[54] Mrs. McCaskey holds the honorary title of \"secretary of the board of directors\", but has been called the glue that holds the franchise together.[55] Mrs. McCaskey's reign as the owner of the Bears was not planned, as her father originally earmarked her brother, George \"Mugs\" Halas Jr. as the heir apparent to the franchise. However, he died of a severe heart attack in 1979.[56] Her impact on the team is well-noted as her own family has dubbed her \"The First Lady of Sports\", and the Chicago Sun-Times has listed her as one of Chicago's most powerful women.[57] Mike Ditka, a tight end for the Bears from 1961 to 1966, was hired to coach the team by George Halas in 1982.[58] His gritty personality earned him the nickname \"Iron Mike\".[59] The team reached the NFC Championship game, losing to the San Francisco 49ers 23–0, in 1984.[60] In the 1985 season the fire in the Bears–Packers rivalry was re-lit when Ditka used 315-pound defensive tackle \"Refrigerator\" Perry as a running back in a touchdown play at Lambeau Field, against the Packers.[61] The Bears won their ninth NFL Championship, first since the AFL-NFL merger, in Super Bowl XX after the 1985 season in which they dominated the NFL with their then-revolutionary 46 defense and a cast of characters that recorded the novelty rap song \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\".[62][63] The season was notable in that the Bears had only one loss, the \"unlucky 13th\" game of the season, a Monday night affair in which they were defeated by the Miami Dolphins.[64] At the time, much was made of the fact that the 1972 Dolphins were the only franchise in history to have had an undefeated season and post-season. The Dolphins came close to setting up a rematch in the Super Bowl, but lost to the New England Patriots in the AFC title game. \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\" was videotaped the day after that Monday night loss in Miami.[65] After the 1985 championship season, the Bears remained competitive throughout the 1980s but failed to return to the Super Bowl under Ditka. Throughout the remainder of his tenure, Ditka led the Bears to five more postseason berths, getting as far as the NFC Championship in the 1988 season.[66] Between the firing of Ditka and the hiring of Lovie Smith, the Bears had two head coaches, Dave Wannstedt and Dick Jauron.[67][68][69] While both head coaches led the team to the playoffs once (Wannstedt in 1994 and Jauron in 2001), neither was able to accumulate a winning record or bring the Bears back to the Super Bowl. Therefore, the 1990s was largely considered to be a disappointment.[70] Before the Bears hired Jauron in January 1999, Dave McGinnis (Arizona's defensive coordinator, and a former Bears assistant under Ditka and Wannstedt) backed out of taking the head coaching position. The Bears scheduled a press conference to announce the hiring before McGinnis agreed to contract terms.[71] Soon after Jauron's hiring, Mrs. McCaskey fired her son Michael as president, replacing him with Ted Phillips and promoting Michael to chairman of the board.[55] Phillips became the first man outside of the Halas-McCaskey family to run the team.[72] From 1997 to 2000, the Bears suffered four consecutive last place finishes within the division.[73][74][75][76] In the 2001 season, Jim Miller took over as the primary starting quarterback and helped lead the Bears to a resurgent 13–3 record and division title.[77] The 2001 team did not see any postseason success as they fell 33–19 to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Divisional Round.[78] The 2002 season saw a setback as the team went 4–12.[79] The team improved to a 7–9 record in 2003 but still missed the postseason.[80] Jauron was fired following the end of the 2003 season.[81] Lovie Smith, hired on January 15, 2004, is the third post-Ditka head coach. Joining the Bears as a rookie head coach, Smith brought the highly successful Tampa 2 defensive scheme with him to Chicago. Before his second season with the Bears, the team rehired their former offensive coordinator and then Illinois head coach Ron Turner to improve the Bears' struggling offense.[82] In 2005, the Bears won their division and reached the playoffs for the first time in four years. Their previous playoff berth was earned by winning the NFC Central in 2001. The Bears improved upon their success the following season, by clinching their second consecutive NFC North title during Week 13 of the 2006 season, winning their first playoff game since 1995, and earning a trip to Super Bowl XLI.[83] However, they fell short of the championship, losing 29–17 to the Indianapolis Colts. Following the 2006 season, the club decided to give Smith a contract extension through 2011, at roughly $5 million per year. This comes a season after being the lowest-paid head coach in the National Football League.[84] The club has played in over a thousand games since becoming a charter member of the NFL in 1920. Through the 2010 season, they led the NFL in overall franchise wins with 704 and had an overall record of 704–512–42 (going 687–494–42 during the regular season and 17–18 in the playoffs).[85] On November 18, 2010, the Bears recorded franchise win number 700 in a win against the Miami Dolphins.[86] The Bears made one of the biggest trades in franchise history, acquiring Pro Bowl quarterback Jay Cutler from the Denver Broncos in exchange for Kyle Orton and draft picks on April 2, 2009.[87] After a disappointing 2009 campaign with the team going 7–9,[88] Mike Martz was hired as the team's offensive coordinator on February 1, 2010.[89] On March 5, 2010, the Bears signed defensive end Julius Peppers, running back Chester Taylor, and tight end Brandon Manumaleuna, spending over $100 million on the first day of free agency.[90] Also during the 2010 offseason, Michael McCaskey was replaced by brother George McCaskey as chairman of the Bears.[91] With a 38–34 win against the New York Jets, the Bears clinched the No. 2 seed and a first-round bye for the 2010–11 NFL playoffs. In their first Playoff game since Super Bowl XLI, The Bears defeated the No. 4 seed Seattle Seahawks 35–24 in the Divisional Round. The Bears reached the NFC Championship Game, where they played Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field – only the second playoff meeting between the two storied rivals, the only other game played in 1941.[92] The Bears lost the game, 21–14.[93] The team started the 2011 season strong with a 7–3 record,[94] and running back Matt Forté led the NFL in total yards from scrimmage. Eventually, quarterback Jay Cutler fractured his thumb, and Forté also was lost for the season against the Kansas City Chiefs after spraining his MCL, and the Bears, with Caleb Hanie playing, lost five straight before winning against the Minnesota Vikings with Josh McCown starting over Hanie. At season's end, general manager Jerry Angelo was fired, and former Chiefs director of scouting and former Bears scout Phil Emery was brought in.[95][96] Offensive coordinator Mike Martz resigned, and eventually retired, and was replaced by offensive line coach Mike Tice.[97][98] The Bears made another notable move by trading for Miami Dolphins receiver and Pro Bowl MVP Brandon Marshall.[99] The Bears became the first team in NFL history to return six interceptions for touchdowns in the first seven games of the season, with another pick-six by Brian Urlacher in Week 9 bringing Chicago two behind the record set by the 1961 San Diego Chargers.[100] However, the Bears missed the playoffs with a record of 10–6 (after starting the season 7–1, the first team to start with the record and miss the playoffs since the 1996 Washington Redskins),[101] and Smith was fired on December 31.[102] Then-CFL head coach and former NFL journeyman Marc Trestman was hired to succeed Smith after an exhaustive search that included at least 13 known candidates.[103][104] On March 20, 2013, Brian Urlacher's 13-year tenure with the Bears ended when both sides failed to agree on a contract.[105] The Trestman era began on September 8 with a 24–21 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, making Trestman the fourth head coach in Bears history to win in his coaching debut, after George Halas (1920), Neill Armstrong (1978) and Dick Jauron (1999).[106] The Bears ended the 2013 season 8–8, barely missing the playoffs after losing in the final week of the season to the Packers.[107] Despite having a second-ranked offense that set numerous franchise records,[108] the defense greatly worsened as it set franchise worsts in categories like yards allowed (6,313).[109] The following season was a disaster for the Bears, with the offense regressing to finish outside the top 20 in scoring.[110] The team also allowed 50-point games in two straight weeks against the Patriots and Packers, including a franchise-high 42 points and NFL-record six touchdowns allowed in the first half against the latter,[111][112] to become the first team since the 1923 Rochester Jeffersons to allow at least 50 points in consecutive games.[113] The Bears ended the year 5–11 and last in the NFC North.[114] Trestman and Emery were fired after the season ended.[115] The Bears hired Ryan Pace of the New Orleans Saints to be their new general manager on January 8, 2015.[116] On January 16, 2015, John Fox accepted a four-year deal to become head coach.[117] In Fox's first season as head coach, the Bears saw improvements from 2014; after USA Today projected the Bears to win three games,[118] they doubled that total and finished the season with a 6–10 record, including a Thanksgiving win over the Packers at Lambeau Field.[119] However, during the 2016 season, the Bears regressed heavily, compiling a 3–13 record (their worst since the NFL's change to 16-game seasons in 1978). The season included several injuries to starters and secondary players, including Jay Cutler, who only played five games as a result of two separate injuries.[120] Backup quarterback Brian Hoyer started the next three games before a broken arm put him out for the season. He was replaced by Matt Barkley, who made his first career start with the Bears.[121][122] None of the three quarterbacks returned for the 2017 season.[123][124][125] In the 2017 NFL draft, the team selected quarterback Mitchell Trubisky with the second-overall pick,[126] who sat behind newly signed quarterback Mike Glennon for the first four games before taking over.[127] The Bears ended the season 5–11 and again finished last in the NFC North.[128] On January 1, 2018, Fox was fired, ending his tenure in Chicago with a 14–34 record.[129] The Bears hired Matt Nagy from the Kansas City Chiefs as their new head coach in January 2018.[130] General manager Ryan Pace signed receivers Taylor Gabriel, Allen Robinson, and Trey Burton in the offseason to complement second-year quarterback Mitchell Trubisky.[131] The Bears also acquired linebacker Khalil Mack in a block-blockbuster trade from the Oakland Raiders to further bolster their defense, sending a package of draft picks that includes 2019 and 2020 1st round draft picks in exchange.[132] Nagy's Bears clinched the NFC North on December 16, 2018, for the first time since 2010 with a 24–17 victory over the Green Bay Packers.[133] The Bears finished the 2018 season with a 12–4 record.[134] They lost to the defending Super Bowl Champions Philadelphia Eagles in the wild-card round of the playoffs after Cody Parkey's game-winning field goal attempt was partially tipped and hit the uprights in the final seconds of the game, a play coined the \"Double Doink\".[135][136] Despite the first-round exit, Nagy was named Coach of the Year by the Pro Football Writers Association and Associated Press.[137][138] He was the first Bears coach to be given the AP award since Lovie Smith in 2005 and the fifth in team history.[139] In 2019, the team regressed to an 8–8 record, though Nagy's combined 20 wins in 2018 and 2019 were the most by a Bears head coach in his first two seasons.[140] During the year, renovations to Halas Hall were completed, allowing the team to move Training Camp from Ward Field on the campus of Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais, Illinois to Lake Forest for 2020.[141][142] The Bears opened the 2020 season with a 5–1 record. However, they lost their next six games. The Bears won three of their last four games to finish the season with an 8–8 record. Despite their finish, the Bears qualified for the 2020–21 NFL playoffs, which was expanded to include one additional wildcard team from each conference.[143] The New Orleans Saints defeated the Bears in the opening round of the playoffs, 21–9.[144] The team did not re-sign Trubisky after the 2020 season and instead allowed him to become a free agent.[145] Prior to the 2021 season, the Bears traded up in the 2021 NFL draft to select quarterback Justin Fields 11th overall.[146] The team also signed veteran quarterback Andy Dalton in free agency.[147] Dalton was initially declared the Bears starting quarterback, but Fields won the position after Dalton was injured.[148] The Bears finished the season with a 6–11 record and missed the playoffs.[149] Nagy and general manager Ryan Pace were fired after the season's conclusion.[149] Nagy posted a 34–33 record over four seasons with two playoff berths, while Pace compiled a 48–65 record over seven seasons.[149] On January 25, 2022, the Bears hired Ryan Poles as their general manager.[8] The team hired Matt Eberflus as the franchise's 17th head coach two days later.[150] The Bears struggled throughout the 2022 season, which included a franchise-record 10-game losing streak.[151] They finished with an NFL worst 3–14 record, which secured the team the first overall pick in the 2023 NFL draft.[151] The Bears traded the first overall pick to the Carolina Panthers in exchange for wide receiver D. J. Moore and multiple draft picks.[152] The Bears opened the 2023 season with a 0–4 record, extending the team losing streak to 14 (longest in team history; dating back to the 2022 season).[153] The team bounced back by winning five of their last eight games, but finished with a 7–10 record, placing last in the NFC North for the second consecutive season. However, the team acquired the first overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft, which was part of their previous trade with the Panthers, who finished the 2023 season with worst record in the NFL.[154] The first overall pick was used on USC quarterback Caleb Williams.[155] The Bears fired Eberflus on November 29, with five games remaining in the 2024 NFL season.[156] Eberflus, who a posted a 14–32 overall record with the Bears, was the first head coach in team history to be fired before the end of the season.[157] The team is primarily owned by the heirs of George Halas. His daughter, Virginia Halas McCaskey (holds 22.6% of the team shares), is the principal owner and votes on behalf of her 11 children and two nephews (who each own 3.8%) as well as the Brizzolara family (who own 8.33%), which amounts to an 80.33% ownership stake, allowing her to control the team.[158] Former chairman and CEO of Aon Corp. Pat Ryan (17.67%)[159] and former Aon director Andrew J. McKenna's estate (2%) own the remainder 19.67% of the club.[55] Ryan is also a board member.[7] The McCaskey family has right of first refusal on stock sale, while Ryan's block has second refusal rights.[159] In 2020, Forbes magazine reported that the franchise is worth $3.525 billion, making it the seventh richest franchise in the NFL.[160] Chicago is the third largest media market in the United States.[161] In a Crain's Chicago Business article, one businessman described his wishes for the team to maximize its potential. In 2009, Yahoo! Sports listed the McCaskeys as the third worst owner in the NFL, stating \"[T]hey get less for what they've got than any team in our league.\"[162] The club was founded by A. E. Staley Manufacturing Company owner Augustus Eugene Staley in 1919 and was owned by the company until 1921. In 1921, Staley felt he could no longer afford the expensive burden of pro-football and transferred team ownership to Halas and paid him $5,000 for a sponsorship deal that kept the Staleys name for one more year.[163] Halas than added Edward \"Dutch\" Sternaman as a second owner. On January 28, 1922, the Bears were incorporated at an NFL meeting, as \"a new league team\" after its name change.[164][165] At season's end, the two competed with agent Bill Harley for ownership of the Staleys, after he negotiated a contract that was to give his brother Chic Harley and himself one-third ownership of the team as part of his contract. However, Halas and Sternaman claimed that the contract was voided when a physical revealed health impairments resultant from Harley's time in the war. The other league owners agreed to nullify the deal in favor of the Halas/Sternaman partnership by an 8–2 vote.[165] In addition, Halas and Sternaman offered a share of the team to Paddy Driscoll, but the move was blocked by the owners in the NFL's June meeting, after the Chicago Cardinals (Driscoll's team) activated the league's reserve clause.[165] In 1931, Sternaman offered to sell his stake to Halas for $38,000 to focus on his other businesses. Halas’ purchase agreement with Sternaman was to be paid off in installments, and stipulated that if Halas defaulted on any of the payments, ownership of the team reverted to Sternaman. Halas raised the initial funding by selling an 8.33% ownership stake to Ralph Brizzolara,[166] as well as $5,000 of shares to Jim McMillen, and George Trafton's mother, who paid $20,000 (Halas later bought her out for $40,000).[167] Charles Bidwill purchased $5,000 in stock in 1933 (which was later bought off of his widow Violet for $50,000 in 1949[168]) and he also arranged a bank loan for the remaining $5,000 needed to pay off Sternaman: \"But it was a mighty close call. As I remember, I finally got all the money together at 11:10 a.m. on the day the final note came due. Forfeit time was 12 o’clock noon.\" Halas remained the club's president and principal owner until his death on October 31, 1983. Halas' children, George \"Mugs\" Halas Jr. and Virginia McCaskey acquired stock in the team through prior gifts and sales. After Mugs' death in 1979, Halas Sr. owned a 49.35% interest in the Bears, Mugs' estate owned a 19.67% interest, while Virginia McCaskey, Jim Finks (3.5%, which he later relinquished when he resigned as the team GM[169]), Charles Brizzolara, Robert and Carol Brizzolara in joint tenancy, and Nancy Lorenz owned the remaining outstanding shares. In 1981, the shareholders merged the Bears with a newly formed Delaware-incorporated organization, the Chicago Bears Football Club, Inc..[170] In 1987, Mugs' estate executor wanted to sell his ownership stake and challenged the legality of a 1981 corporate reorganization and the other owners' right of first refusal,[171] while his heirs, Christine and Stephen Halas, wanted to keep their father's stake, asking a Cook County Probate Court judge not to allow the sale.[172] Ultimately they failed to block the Chicago Bears from buying their father's 19.67% ownership stake of the team, which sold for $17.5 million in 1988.[173] Bears then-president Michael McCaskey called the purchase a \"terrific financial burden\", and the team would later sell the stake to Chicago-area businessmen Andrew McKenna and Patrick Ryan for a then-undisclosed sum[b] in 1990.[174] At the time it was also speculated that they invested to help the Bears lobby lawmakers for a domed stadium.[175] In 2017, the NFL approved a sale of shares from Mugs' children (unreported whom or how much) to the McCaskey family for an undisclosed sum.[176] The team has major sponsorship deals with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Miller Brewing Company, PNC Financial Services, United Airlines, Verizon, Xfinity, and Proven IT.[177][178] The team was the first in the NFL to have a presenting sponsor, with the 2004 season advertised as \"Bears Football presented by BankOne\". Additionally, the Bears have an agreement with WFLD (the Fox owned-and-operated station in Chicago) to broadcast pre-season football games.[179] The club has had few official logos throughout their history. When the team was known as the Decatur Staleys in 1920, they used A. E. Staley's logo as football was intended to help promote the company.[180] The first Chicago Bears logo was introduced in 1940, depicting a black bear running with a football. The next logo, introduced in 1946, featured a navy blue bear on top of a football. In 1962, the Bears introduced their trademark \"wishbone-C\" logo for the first time.[181] Initially white with a black outline, the logo is similar to the \"C\" long worn on the Cincinnati Reds' baseball caps, and very closely resembles the University of Chicago Maroons' \"C\" logo introduced in 1898. The change in the Bears' logo was due to the addition of logos on helmets, which professional football teams began adding in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 2023, the Bears made their primary logo the orange bear head, which was previously their secondary logo since 1999.[3] Despite demoting the \"C\" to a secondary logo, the team will still retain it on their helmets and at the home field's 50-yard line.[182] Before the 2003 season, the team had two unofficial mascots named \"Rocky\" and \"Bearman\". \"Rocky\" was a man who donned a #1 Bears jersey, carried a megaphone, and started chants all over Soldier Field during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, in a fashion similar to Fireman Ed. The identity of \"Rocky\" is unknown, but he presumably lives in northwestern Indiana.[183] Don Wachter, also known as \"Bearman\", is a season ticket holder who decided in 1995 that he could also assist the team by cheerleading, similar to Rocky. The club allowed him to run across the field with a large Bears flag during player introductions and each team score (a role more recently done by the Bears 4th Phase and Bears captains). In 1996, he donned his \"costume\" of face paint, bear head and arms, and a number 46 jersey. \"Bearman\" was forced to stop wearing his costume with the introduction of Staley Da Bear in 2003, but in 2005 Wachter was allowed in costume again.[183] Staley Da Bear is an anthropomorphic bear with a customized No. 00 jersey, with blue and orange eyes, synonymous with the team's main colors.[184] His name is eponymous to starch processing company A. E. Staley, who founded the Bears' franchise. Like Rocky and Bearman, he entertains Bears fans, but like other NFL mascots, and mascots in general, Staley also visits charity events, parties,[185][186] Chicago Rush AFL games, and other Bears-related events, as well as taking part in games with his \"furballs\" against youth football teams at halftime.[187][188] The team had a cheerleading squad called the Chicago Honey Bears beginning in 1976. However, Bears owner Virginia Halas McCaskey terminated them after the 1985 season.[183] The squad's uniforms changed three times: from 1976 to 1979, the uniform was a white bodysuit with navy blue sleeves; from 1980 to 1984 it was a white bodysuit with orange sleeves and the navy was moved to the trim, and for the squad's final season in 1985, the uniform was redesigned with an orange sequin vest.[189] Since 1998, the Bears have partnered with 'A Safe Place,' a domestic violence shelter in Waukegan, Illinois.[190] In June 2017, existing and former Bears employees helped renovate the shelter by ripping up carpet, painting walls, demolishing a kitchen and building a fence.[190] The Bears have also provided financial support throughout the years. The Green Bay Packers are the Bears' biggest rivals since their team's inception in 1920. The Green Bay Packers currently have the lead at 103–95–6,[191] and the teams have met twice in the postseason. The Bears won the 1941 meeting, 33–14, and eventually defeated the New York Giants in the 1941 NFL Championship Game, and the Packers won the 2011 meeting, 21–14, en route to a Super Bowl XLV win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.[192] The teams' first meeting was a victory for the Bears (known as the Staleys at the time) in 1921 in a shutout, 20–0. The Packers claimed their first win over the Bears in 1925, 14–10. The 1924 matchup (which ended in a 3–0 win for Chicago) was notable for featuring the first-ever ejection of players in a game in NFL history, as Frank Hanny of the Bears and Walter Voss of the Packers were ejected for punching each other.[193] The rivalry also featured one of the last successful fair catch kicks in 1968, when Bears kicker Mac Percival kicked the game-winning field goal.[194] The Detroit Lions and Bears have faced off since the Lions' inception in 1930, when they were known as the Portsmouth Spartans, with the Spartans winning, 7–6, and Chicago winning the second meeting, 14–6. Since then, the Bears have led the series, 99–74–5.[195] The rivalry grew in 1932, when the Bears and Spartans met in the first-ever postseason game in NFL history, with the Bears winning the game 9–0. The game also was known as the first pro \"indoor football\" game, as the game took place in indoor Chicago Stadium due to a blizzard at the time. The game also started the forward pass.[196] Chicago and Minnesota took each other on in the Vikings' inaugural game, with the Vikings defeating the Bears in a 37–13 rout, and Minnesota currently holds the series lead 60–54–2.[197] The oldest continuing matchup in the NFL belongs to the Bears and the Arizona Cardinals.[198] It began as intense intra-city rivalry between the Bears and the Chicago Cardinals, which the Bears were leading 47–19–6 through 1959, when the Cardinals moved to St. Louis. The rivalry's importance waned further after the Cardinals moved to the Phoenix metropolitan area in 1988. The Bears lead the all-time series 59–28–6.[199] The teams have yet to meet in the playoffs.[200][201][202][203] The Bears and the New York Giants squared off in six NFL championship games, more than any common match-up in either the NFL championship game or Super Bowl. The Bears won four of the six championship games, which included the Sneakers Game that the Giants won in the 1934 NFL Championship Game. The two teams also met in the 1985 and 1990 playoffs, splitting each meeting en route to a Super Bowl championship (Bears in Super Bowl XX, Giants in Super Bowl XXV). As of the 2023 season, the Bears lead the all-time series 36–25–2.[204][205] The Bears and San Francisco 49ers were regular foes while both played in the Western Conference. The rilvary grow during the 1980s, as both teams were constant playoff contenders in the NFC. The 49ers currently holds the series lead 35-33-1 and 3–0 in the playoffs.[206][207] Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and 49ers play at least once every four years.[208] The Bears holds historic rivalry with its former NFC Central foe Tampa Bay Buccaneers. as of the 2023 season, Chicago currently holds the series lead 40–22.[209][210] Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and Bucs play at least once every four years.[208] Although the teams never played in the same division, the Bears and the Washington Commanders have a historically significant rivalry, dating back to 1932, when the Commanders were located in Boston and were known as the Braves. The rivalry started to heat up in 1937, when Washington drafted quarterback Sammy Baugh and both teams were often met in the NFL Championship Game.[211] The most memorable game from that era was in 1940, when the Bears set a record by defeating the Commanders 73-0 in the NFL Championship game, to this day, the largest margin of victory in league history.[212][36] The series regained steam in the 1980s, when both teams were fighting for the NFC supremacy.[213] Washington holds a slight edge in the all-time series 27-25-1 (2–1 in the playoffs and 2–2 in championship games).[214] Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and Commanders play at least once every four years.[208] The Cleveland/Los Angeles/St. Louis Rams and the Bears played in the same division the 1937 NFL season to the 1969 NFL season (with the 1958 game attracting 100,470 fans, the largest in Bears history[215]), while the two franchises continue to play annually until the 1980 NFL season.[216] From 1995 to 2015 the two teams were part of the Chicago-St. Louis rivalries in the major professional leagues.[217] As of the 2023 season, Chicago currently holds the series lead 54–39–3 (1–1 in the playoffs). It is the Rams' longest-running, non-division series.[218] Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and Rams play at least once every four years.[208] The AFC member Miami Dolphins and the Bears met less than 15 times but most of them were memorable.[219] The most notable was the 1985 shootout at Monday Night, as Miami handing Chicago their first, and only, regular-season loss for the year, while keeping the 1972 Dolphins as the only perfect team in NFL history.[220] As of the 2023 season, Miami currently holds the series lead 10–4.[221] Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the teams play at least once every four years.[208] Chicago had a fierce instate rivalry with the Rock Island Independents in the league first decade, with the Bears winning the series 8–1–4.[222][223] The Canton/Cleveland Bulldogs and the Staleys/Bears rivalry was between the two NFL's powerhouses in the 1920s, with games usually attracting the most fans,[224] and the outcome often decided the fate of NFL Championship (1921–1924).[225] The rivalry grow after the 1921 season, when the Staleys star Guy Chamberlin joined the Bulldogs and led them to three consecutive championships, including a tiebreaker win over the Bears in 1924.[165][226][227] Chicago won the series 4–3.[228][229] Soldier Field, located on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, is the home of the Bears. The Bears moved to Soldier Field in 1971 after outgrowing Wrigley Field, the team's home for 50 years.[230] After the AFL-NFL Merger, the league preferred their teams to play in stadiums that could hold at least 50,000 fans. Even with portable bleachers that the team set up at Wrigley, the stadium could still only hold 46,000.[231] At first, the Bears were supposed to play at Dyche Stadium (later called Ryan Field), but Northwestern University's residential neighbors objected, and the agreement was cancelled. The original home of the Bears was Staley Field at Decatur, Illinois, when the team was known as the Decatur Staleys, before they moved to Chicago in 1921. Soldier Field's playing surface was changed from natural grass to astroturf before the 1971 season, and then back to natural grass in time for the start of the 1988 season. Throughout its history, Soldier Field's field maintenance has been done by the Chicago Park District (the municipal entity from which the Bears lease the field) by disparate district employees, rather than a permanent team-employed grounds crew, generating some controversy among players for its rough surface.[232] This arrangement caused disagreements with the city throughout the years, with the Bears attempting to agree on a new stadium since 1986.[233] The stadium was the site of the infamous Fog Bowl playoff game between the Bears and Philadelphia Eagles.[234] In 2002, the stadium was closed and rebuilt with only the exterior wall being preserved. It was closed on Sunday, January 20, 2002, the day after the Bears lost in the playoffs. It reopened on September 27, 2003, after a complete rebuild (the second in the stadium's history).[231] Many fans refer to the rebuilt stadium as \"New Soldier Field\".[235] During the 2002 season, the Bears played their home games at the University of Illinois' Memorial Stadium in Champaign, where they went 3–5. Multiple critics have negative views of the new stadium, believing that its structure has made it more of an eyesore than a landmark; some have dubbed it the \"Mistake on the Lake\".[236] Soldier Field was stripped of its National Historic Landmark designation on February 17, 2006.[237] In the 2005 season, the Bears won the NFC North Division and the No. 2 Seed in the NFC Playoffs, entitling them to play at least one home game in the postseason. The team hosted (and lost) their divisional round match on January 15, 2006, against the Carolina Panthers. This was the first playoff game at Soldier Field since the stadium reopened. The stadium's end zones and midfield were unpainted until the 1982 season. The design sported on the field included the bolded word \"Chicago\" rendered in Highway Gothic in both end zones. In 1983, the end zone design returned, with the addition of a large wishbone \"C\" Bears logo painted at midfield. These field markings remained unchanged until the 1996 season. In 1996 the midfield wishbone \"C\" was changed to a large blue Bears head, and the end zone design were painted with \"Bears\" in cursive. This design remained until the 1999 season, when the artwork was returned to the classic \"Chicago\" and \"C\". In the new Soldier Field, the artwork was tweaked with the word \"Chicago\" bolded in one end zone and the other having \"Bears\".[238] In June 2021, the Bears submitted a bid to purchase the Arlington International Racecourse in Arlington Heights, Illinois from Churchill Downs.[239] Despite negotiations between the city of Chicago to upgrade Soldier Field again, the Bears entered into an agreement with Churchill Downs to purchase the Arlington International Racecourse in September 2021 for $197.2 million. The sale of the property which includes 326 acres of space for potential development closed on February 15, 2023.[240][241] As of 2024, the Bears have shifted their focus to the parking area south of Soldier Field on Museum Campus.[242][243] On April 24, 2024, the Bears revealed plans for a $4.7 billion domed lakefront stadium development.[244][245] From its inception until 1930 the Staleys/Bears conducted their summer training camp in their home stadiums: Staley Field (Decatur, Illinois) and later Cubs' Park (Chicago).[246] In 1930 they first moved to Mills Stadium in Chicago and from 1931 to 1934 to Loyola University Chicago, Logan Square Baseball Park, Notre Dame University and Lane Tech College Prep High School, respectively.[247] In 1935 they began to conduct training camps at a prominent location, when they started practicing at St. John's Northwestern Military Academy (Delafield, Wisconsin) for a decade.[141] In 1944 they moved to St. Joseph's College in Rensselaer, Indiana and stayed there for 30 years. This location was the place of the famous automobile accident on July 27, 1964 that killed Bears players Willie Galimore and Bo Farrington, after Galimore's Volkswagen left the road on a curve and rolled, a few miles from the team's training camp.[248][249][250] From 1975 to 1984 they conducted their summer training camp in Lake Forest College, at the original Halas Hall (the practice and front office facility for the Bears from 1977 until 1997).[251] The practice field was later renamed Farwell Field and serves as the main field for Foresters football and soccer. From 1984 to 2001, the Bears held pre-season training camp in Ralph E. Davis Pioneer Stadium at University of Wisconsin–Platteville. They were considered a member of the \"Cheese League\" that in 1999 consisted of the Green Bay Packers, New Orleans Saints and Kansas City Chiefs, with each team practicing at a different university in Wisconsin.[252] In 2001, the Illinois General Assembly asked the Bears to move to an Illinois practice facility in order to raise funds for remodeling Soldier Field. Before the Bears left, they donated $250,000 to UW–Platteville for a new computer lab, which was named \"The Bears Den\".[253] On June 16, 2014, the stadium was damaged by a tornado and the Bears donated $50,000 to the school relief fund.[254] From 2002 to 2019, the Bears held their summer training camp at Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais. Although the Bears had an agreement to continue practicing there through 2022,[255] they moved the camp permanently into the recently renovated Halas Hall in 2020.[142] The team headquarters, Halas Hall, named after founder George Halas, is in the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, Illinois. The Bears practice at adjoining facilities during the season. The location is 4 miles (6.4 km) west of the original Halas Hall which had opened in 1977, and it was named after George Halas Jr., who died unexpectedly in 1979. It was located at Lake Forest College and contained 2 practice fields (one regulation-size outdoor field as well as a 70-yard practice field) and front office facilities,[256] which is used by the Foresters Athletics Department.[257] The 38-acre complex opened on March 3, 1997, and was expanded in 2013 and 2018.[258][259] The team also has a 11,000 square feet (1,000 m2) corporate office in downtown Chicago, located at 123 N. Wacker Dr,[260] for sales, corporate partnerships and events departments employees.[261] While the Super Bowl XX champion Bears were a fixture of mainstream American pop culture in the 1980s, the Bears made a prior mark with the 1971 American TV movie Brian's Song starring Billy Dee Williams as Gale Sayers and James Caan as Brian Piccolo.[262][263] The film told of how Piccolo helped Sayers recover from a devastating knee injury to return to his status as one of the league's best players, and how Sayers in turn helped the Piccolo family through Brian's fatal illness.[264][265] A 2001 remake of the movie for ABC starred Sean Maher as Piccolo and Mekhi Phifer as Sayers.[266] The 1985 team is also remembered for recording the song \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\", which reached number forty-one on the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for a Grammy Award.[267] The music video for the song depicts the team rapping that they are \"not here to start no trouble\" but instead \"just here to do the Super Bowl Shuffle\". The team took a risk by recording and releasing the song before the playoffs had even begun, but were able to avoid embarrassment by going on to win Super Bowl XX by a then-record margin of 46–10. That game was one of the most-watched television events in history according to the Nielsen ratings system; the game had a rating of 48.3, ranking it seventh in all-time television history.[268] In addition to the \"Super Bowl Shuffle\"[269] rap song, the Bears' success in the 1980s – and especially the personality of head coach Mike Ditka – inspired a recurring sketch on the American sketch comedy program Saturday Night Live, called \"Bill Swerski's Superfans\". The sketch featured Cheers co-star George Wendt, a Chicago native, as host of a radio talk-show (similar in tone to WGN radio's \"The Sportswriters\"), with co-panelists Carl Wollarski (Robert Smigel), Pat Arnold (Mike Myers) and Todd O'Connor (Chris Farley). To hear them tell it, \"Da Bears\" and Coach Ditka could do no wrong. The sketch stopped after Ditka was fired in 1993. The sketch usually showed the panelists chugging beer and eating lots of Polish sausage, and often featured Todd getting so agitated about what was happening with the Bears that he suffered a heart attack, but quickly recovered (through self-administered CPR). The sketch also features the cast predicting unrealistic blowout victories for Bears games.[270] Da Super Fan sketch has not been brought back by SNL, with the exception of a single appearance by Horatio Sanz as a Super Fan for the Cubs on \"Weekend Update\" in 2003. Outside of SNL, George Wendt reprised his role of Swerski in the opening promo of Super Bowl XL on ABC. On TV shows based in Chicago such as The Bob Newhart Show, Married... with Children, Family Matters, Still Standing, According to Jim, Early Edition and The Bernie Mac Show, the main characters are all Bears fans, and have worn Bears' jerseys and T-shirts on some occasions. Some episodes even show them watching Bears games. Roseanne is another TV show based in Illinois (albeit not in Chicago itself) to feature the Bears as the consensus household favorite, as 'Dan Connor' John Goodman is seen wearing Bears hats in several episodes. That '70s Show featured several Bears references, as it was based in Wisconsin, home of the Packers. On one episode while the gang is at a Bears vs. Packers game, Eric comes to the seat in a Walter Payton jersey and is booed by the surrounding Packers fans. In an episode of the Disney Channel show Shake It Up, based in Chicago, recurring character Dina Garcia (Ainsley Bailey) sold scalped Chicago Bears tickets. More recently, Modern Family character Cameron Tucker has been shown as a Bears fan. In an episode of the Disney Channel show \"I Didn't Do It\", based in Chicago, Lindy Watson (Olivia Holt) and Logan Watson (Austin North) try to get a football signed by NFL Hall of Famer Dick Butkus after destroying their fathers Butkus signed ball, Alshon Jeffery also makes a cameo appearance as well.[271] Ditka's success and popularity in Chicago has led him to land analyst roles on various American football pregame shows. Ditka worked for both the NFL on NBC and CBS's The NFL Today, and he currently works on ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown and provided Friday night analysis on the Bears on WBBM-TV's 2 on Football with former WBBM-TV sports director Mark Malone.[272] He is also the color analyst for all local broadcasts of Bears preseason games. Ditka also co-starred himself alongside actor Will Ferrell in the 2005 comedy film Kicking & Screaming.[273] Also, Ditka, Dick Butkus, Walter Payton, Jim McMahon, William \"Refrigerator\" Perry and Brian Urlacher are among Bears figures known for their appearances in TV commercials. Urlacher, whose jersey was among the league's best-selling in 2002, was featured on Nike commercials with former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick.[274][275] In the 1961 Hanna-Barbera animated short \"Rah Rah Bear\", Yogi Bear helps the Bears beat the New York Giants.[276] The Bears were later depicted in an episode of the 1985 cartoon version of the NBC sitcom Punky Brewster, where the Bears are playing the Green Bay Packers.[277][278] Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) from the National Lampoon's Vacation series appears in some scenes wearing a navy blue with burnt orange scripting Chicago Bears ball cap. He wears the same Chicago Bears cap throughout all four Vacation movies.[279] Currently, WMVP (1000 AM) broadcast Bears games with Jeff Joniak doing the play-by-play, along with color commentator Tom Thayer, who played for the Bears from 1985 to 1992.[280][281][282] Over the years, many Bears play-by-play broadcasters have included play-by-play announcers Jack Brickhouse, Joe McConnell and Wayne Larrivee, and color commentators Hub Arkush, Dick Butkus, Jim Hart and Irv Kupcinet. Spanish radio station WLEY-FM aired the Bears games from 2012 to 2014. Since 2015, WRTO and WVIV-FM air Bears games in Spanish.[283] Preseason games air on WFLD (channel 32).[284] The announcers are Adam Amin (play-by-play), Jim Miller (color commentary) and Lou Canellis (sideline reporter). WFLD also carries the majority of the team's regular season games through the NFL on Fox. Any Bears home games against AFC teams are aired on the CBS O&O station, WBBM-TV, which was the Bears' unofficial \"home\" station from 1956 until Fox won the NFC rights in 1995. Sunday Night games are broadcast on WMAQ-TV, the NBC O&O station, with ESPN Monday Night Football games airing either on ESPN or WLS-TV, the ABC affiliate. Patrick Mannelly holds the record for the most seasons in a Bears uniform with 16.[285] On the other hand, Steve McMichael holds the record for most consecutive games played by a Bear with 191;[285] he accomplished the feat from 1981 to 1993. In second place is Payton, who played 186 games from 1975 to 1987 at running back, a position considered to be conducive to injury, only missing one game in a span of 13 seasons. Kicker Robbie Gould became the Bears' all-time scoring leader in Week 5 of 2015 season[286] overtaking placekicker Kevin Butler who previously held the club record[285] for scoring the most points in his ten-year Bear career. He scored 1,116 points as the Bears kicker from 1985 to 1995. He is followed by running back Walter Payton, with 750 points. Payton holds the team record for career rushing yards with 16,726.[285] That was an NFL record until Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys broke it in 2002. Former Bears running back Matt Forte, who started playing for the Bears in 2008, is the closest to Payton's record with 6,985 yards. Forte also holds the team's single season record for rookies in rushing attempts, rushing yards and receptions. Mark Bortz holds the record for most Bear playoff appearances, with 13 between 1983 and 1994, and is followed by Kevin Butler, Dennis Gentry, Dan Hampton, Jay Hilgenberg, Steve McMichael, Ron Rivera, Mike Singletary, and Keith Van Horne, who have each played in 12 playoff games. The 1940 Chicago Bears team holds the record for the biggest margin of victory in an NFL game, including both playoff and regular season games, with a 73–0 victory over the Washington Redskins in the 1940 NFL Championship Game.[212] The largest home victory for the Bears came in a 61–7 result against the Green Bay Packers in 1980. The largest defeat in club history was a 52–0 loss against the Baltimore Colts in 1964. The club recorded undefeated regular seasons in 1934 and 1942; unlike the 1972 Miami Dolphins, however, they did not win the championship game in either season. In 1934, the club completed a 13–0 record but were defeated by the New York Giants, and in 1942 the club completed an 11–0 record but were defeated by the Redskins. Had the Bears won either championship, the club would have completed a championship three-peat – a feat completed only by the Packers (twice), although no team has done it since the AFL-NFL merger.[287] Halas holds the team record for coaching the most seasons with 40 and for having the most career victories of 324. Halas' victories record stood until Don Shula surpassed Halas in 1993. Ditka is the closest Bears coach to Halas, with 112 career victories. No other Bears coach has recorded over 100 victories with the team.[285] During the 2006 season, return specialist Devin Hester set several kick return records. He currently holds the franchise record for most return yards with 2,261.[288] He had six touchdown returns, setting a record for most returns in a single season.[289] In 2007, he recorded another six touchdown season from returns. One of the most notable of these returns came on November 12, 2006, when he returned a missed field goal for a 108-yard touchdown.[290] The record tied former teammate Nathan Vasher's previous record, which was set almost a year earlier.[291] Hester set a Super Bowl record as the first player to return an opening kick of a Super Bowl for a touchdown.[292] On December 20, 2010, Hester set an NFL record for most touchdowns on a punt or kickoff return with his 14th career return coming against the Minnesota Vikings. In 2011, Hester broke the record for the most punt returns against the Carolina Panthers. In 2012, Charles Tillman set the record for most forced fumbles in a single game with four against the Tennessee Titans.[293] Against the Titans, Chicago became the first team in league history to score a touchdown pass, a touchdown run, an interception return for a touchdown, and a blocked kick/punt for a score in the same quarter.[294] Tillman and teammate Lance Briggs became the first pair in NFL history to return an interception for a touchdown in consecutive games against the Jacksonville Jaguars and Dallas Cowboys.[295] This is a partial list of the Bears' last five completed seasons. For the full season-by-season franchise results, see List of Chicago Bears seasons.[296] Note: The Finish, Wins, Losses, and Ties columns list regular season results and exclude any postseason play. As of January 8, 2023 Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 9 reserve, 16 practice squad (+1 exempt) In the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the Bears have the most enshrined primary members with 32;[302] the club also has had eight Hall of Famers spend a minor portion of their career with the franchise.[303] Founder, owner, head coach, and player George Halas, halfback Bronko Nagurski, and Red Grange were a part of the original class of inductees in 1963. The franchise saw 14 individuals inducted into the Hall of Fame from 1963 to 1967. Offensive tackle Jim Covert and defensive end Ed Sprinkle are the most recent Chicago Bear inductees, both being inducted as seniors as part of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's centennial class of 2020.[304] In 2023 Chuck Howley, who only played minor portion of his career with the Bears, was elected as a Seniors candidate.[305] In addition, Ray Bray was enshrined in Helms Athletic Foundation Pro Football Hall of Fame, which was established in 1950 and preceded the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He's the only Bears member from the Helms Athletic Foundation hall to not be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame was founded in 1979 and honors sports greats associated with the Chicago metropolitan area.[306] As of 2023, there are 59 honorees enshrined in the hall with connection to the Bears.[307] The Bears have retired 14 uniform numbers, which is the most in the NFL, and ranks fourth behind the basketball Boston Celtics (23), baseball New York Yankees (21), and hockey Montreal Canadiens (15) for the most in major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.[308] The Bears retired Mike Ditka's number 89 jersey on December 9, 2013.[309] It is the last number that the Bears retired.[310] In honor of the team's centennial anniversary, on May 20, 2019, the Chicago Bears unveiled the Top 100 players in franchise history, as voted on by Hall of Fame writers Don Pierson and Dan Pompei, two of the most famous journalists that have ever covered the club in their long history.[311] At the time of the publish, the list included 27 Pro Football Hall of Famers, while two more inductees would join in the 2020 Centennial class (Jim Covert and Ed Sprinkle). Among the 100 Greatest, four active players made the list, including safety Eddie Jackson (96), defensive lineman Akiem Hicks (75), offensive lineman Kyle Long (74) and Khalil Mack (60), who had only played only one season with the team at the time of the unveiling of the list. Long would retire the following year. On a later date, Chicagobears.com released a list titled \"Top 10: Best of the rest\" that featured the \"top 10 snubs\" from the centennial list. The players include (in a following order): Alex Brown, Thomas Jones, Dave Whitsell, Curtis Conway, Tim Jennings, Leslie Frazier, Roberto Garza, Marty Booker, Nathan Vasher and William Perry.[312] Pompei would later say that the last two players who didn't make the list were Brown and Frazier.[313] 𝙝𝙤𝙛 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee. 𝐟 Pro Football Hall of Fame finalist. HAF Helms Athletic Foundation Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee.[c] vg PFRA Hall of Very Good inductee.[314] During the week of June 3, 2019, the All-Time Team was announced in parts each day starting with the All-Time defensive players,[315] followed by the All-Time specialists[316] and then the All-Time offensive players.[317] Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Larry Mayer of the Chicagobears.com would later state, that according to the voters \"if they had included a long-snapper on the team it would have been Patrick Mannelly\".[318] * As a Chicago Bear → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The NFL, contrary to the four other major sports leagues in North America, don't have a formal farm system (beside the short lived Association of Professional Football Leagues), and over the years some teams had \"independent\" minor affiliates throughout their existence. The Bears, along with the New York Giants, were at the forefront of those endeavors when in 1939 Halas purchased the American Association's Newark Tornadoes and renamed them the \"Bears\".[319] Halas stocked the team with talent that did not make the Chicago roster, and used the club to incubate talent and for easy return for injured players, thus making it pro football's first true farm team.[320] Newark's most notable names included Joe Zeller as coach and Gene Ronzani (that year Chicago also assigned Sid Luckman to Newark playoff game, which the Bears won 13–6, to win the Southern Division title). This practice continued sporadically until 1972, and ended with the collapse of several minor leagues along with the NFL labor disputes in the 1970s.[321] Other notable players assigned includes: George Gulyanics, Ed Ecker, Lloyd Reese, Raymond Schumacher, Jack Karwales and Doug McEnulty. †= Never played in the league",

                "title": "Memphis vs West Virginia highlights: Frisco Bowl score, results",
                "content": "There was scoring left and right, but it was Memphis that emerged as the winners of the 2024 Frisco Bowl, beating West Virginia 42-37 in a highlight-filled game. Memphis started the game hot with 17-straight points to start the night, and it paved the way for the victory as West Virginia was forced to play catch-up. While the Mountaineers were able to pick it up, the Tigers made sure to respond each time and kept West Virginia from pulling off the comeback. West Virginia had a chance to take the lead late, but a Memphis interception sealed it. Both sides combined for 1,008 total yards. Quarterback Seth Henigan has stayed at Memphis the past four seasons, breaking plenty of school records and helping the Tigers become a contender in the American Athletic Conference. He ended his college career in great fashion with 294 yards on 18-for-26 passing and 54 yards on the ground in his 50th start. There were hopes of being the Group of Five representative in the College Football Playoff, and while it didn’t happen, Memphis still finished with 11 wins – its most since 2019 – and has back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time in school history. On the other side, West Virginia finishes the season 6-7 and will begin its preparations for Rich Rodriguez’s second stint in Morgantown. Memphis almost gave West Virginia a last-second chance, but video review seals it for the Tigers. With 17 seconds left and at the Memphis 37-yard line, West Virginia's Garrett Greene threw a pass that was intercepted by Memphis' Elijah Herring. However, instead of going immediately down, Herring ran around a bit, and just as he was going down, the ball was punched out of his hands and recovered by the Mountaineers. The play went to video review, and officials determined Herring slid, giving himself up, before the ball came out, meaning Memphis held on to the ball. The Tigers then took a knee to finish the game. With under five minutes to go, West Virginia isn't done yet. Needing a touchdown, West Virginia went 75 yards on 12 plays in six-and-a-half minutes to make it a one-score game again. C.J. Donaldson Jr. had another 1-yard run to punch it in for the touchdown, his second score of the day. The running back has 22 carries for 83 yards and two catches for 11 yards. Now the Mountaineers need to get a stop in order to keep the chance of winning alive. A long pass helped set up a Memphis touchdown and pushes the lead back to two scores. On the first play following West Virginia's touchdown, Seth Henigan found Demeer Blankumsee on the go route and he stumbled just outside of the goal line for an 89-yard strike. On the next play, Brandon Thomas punched it in for the touchdown. West Virginia needed to convert a fourth down play, and it resulted in six points. After starting at their own 10-yard line, the Mountaineers went down the field and got all the way inside the Memphis 5-yard line. On third-and-goal, a completed pass ended right at the 1-yard line and the Mountaineers were faced with a decision. The offense stayed on the field, and it was a success with C.J. Donaldson Jr. just getting over the goal line. It's now a one-score game in Frisco. It remains a double-digit lead for Memphis heading into the final quarter. West Virginia has had to play catch-up for much of the game, and the defense finally made a stop in the third quarter to force a punt. The Mountaineers will start the fourth quarter with the ball and will try to claw back in this one. The West Virginia offense is doing all it can to stay in the game with its own touchdown on its first possession of the second half. It was a methodical drive down the field with Garrett Greene finding Hudson Clement in the end zone for the receiver's second touchdown on the night. The extra point was no good after the Mountaineers kicking unit couldn't get the snap down. The offense has picked up right where it left off with Memphis getting right back in the end zone to start the third quarter. The Tigers went 75 yards on eight plays to extend the lead, punctuated with a 3-yard run by Mario Anderson. It was all offense in the second quarter for both sides with 35 combined points scored in the frame and Memphis holding an 11-point lead. The Tigers got out to a fast start with a 17-0 lead, but West Virginia's offense woke up midway through the second quarter and wasted no time cutting the deficit. West Virginia kicker Michael Hayes made an 46-yard field goal as time expired in the first half. Both teams combined for 503 total yards in the first half and Memphis will get the ball out of halftime. Offense can't be stopped in Frisco. Memphis responded with a quick touchdown before halftime to give it a two-touchdown lead just before the break. The Tigers moved 75 yards in five plays and 47 seconds to add its second touchdown of the second quarter. Seth Henigan found Demeer Blankumsee in the corner of the endzone for an 18-yard touchdown pass, and the two Tigers connected again on the two-point conversion. When no one was open, Garrett Greene decided to take it to the house. The Mountaineers quarterback scrambled to the right and turned on the jets on the way to the endzone to close the deficit to six points. It's the 28th career touchdown for Greene, and the longest rushing touchdown for West Virginia this season. Kicker Tristian Vandenberg knocked in his second field goal of the night with a 42-yard kick through the uprights. Hudson Clement extended as far as he could to haul in a spectacular catch in the endzone and get West Virginia back in the game. The sophomore receiver was able to haul the catch and get a leg in bounds before stepping out. All Memphis needed was one play on the drive to strengthen its lead as Greg Desrosiers Jr. took it 46 yards to the house to make it a three-score game. Memphis made it a two-score lead to open the second quarter with a 34-yard field goal from Tristian Vandenberg. The score came off a West Virginia fumble. So far it's been all Memphis after 15 minutes as the West Virginia offense has struggled to do much early. The Mountaineers have generated just 28 yards of offense and just one first down in three drives. They gave Memphis good field position midway through the first frame that led to a Tigers touchdown. On the following drive, West Virginia's C.J. Donaldson Jr. fumbled the ball that set Memphis up on the Mountaineers' side of the field. Memphis took advantage of good field position to get in the end zone for the first score of the game. It was a mixture of the run and the pass that helped Memphis go 45 yards down the field, with quarterback Seth Henigan coming up big on a third down play with a 23-yard scramble to get inside the 5. On the next play, Henigan dumped it off to Mario Anderson Jr. and the running back leaped across the goal line for a 4-yard touchdown pass. The kickoff for the Scooter's Coffee Frisco Bowl game between the No. 23 Memphis Tigers and the West Virginia Mountaineers at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas, is Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET. The Scooter's Coffee Frisco Bowl game between the No. 23 Memphis Tigers and the West Virginia Mountaineers will be televised nationally on ESPN. Live streaming is available on Fubo, which has a free trial. The Memphis Tigers are the favorites to defeat the West Virginia Mountaineers in the Frisco Bowl, according to the BetMGM college football odds on Tuesday afternoon. Wallach writes, \"The Tigers defense has been vulnerable at times, especially against big plays with an explosive rush and pass rate outside the top 100, but the team can feast on Greene’s shaky decision making. In a game that is being lined as a coin flip, there are plenty of reasons to side with the small favorite to cap its season with a win.\" Burke writes, \"The Tigers defense has given up a lot of points this season, but West Virginia doesn’t have the tempo or the potency of an AAC offense. QB Garrett Greene had a 13/11 TD/INT ratio and the Tigers were tied for ninth with 24 takeaways. They are also an opportunistic defense with 14 fumble recoveries. WVU only lost four fumbles during the season. But, as a defense, they only had 11 takeaways, so Memphis may very well carry the edge in the turnover margin department.\" The Athletic's team unanimously picked Memphis to win, one of only six unanimous predictions, alongside Notre Dame to beat Indiana, James Madison to beat Western Kentucky, Pitt to beat Toledo, Kansas State to beat Rutgers, and Syracuse to beat Washington State. Nate Duffett writes, \"Memphis' explosive offense should be too much for West Virginia in this game.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. FRISCO, Texas (AP) Seth Henigan had quite a homecoming for his final game as a four-year starter for Memphis, tying the American Athletic Conference career record with his 104th touchdown pass and leading the 25th-ranked Tigers to one more victory. Henigan threw for 294 yards and two touchdowns, and was one yard short of another score, as the Tigers held on for a 42-37 win over West Virginia in the Frisco Bowl on Tuesday night. They got 11 wins for only the second time in 109 years of Memphis football. “It's meant the world to me, and just to be able to go out with the win, I feel like that's a good way to cap off a pretty good career,” Henigan said. “And having stayed at the same university four years, I hope that's a testament to who I am, and about the people around me.” The only current four-year FBS starting quarterback to do that all with the same school, Henigan's 50th game for the Tigers (11-2) came just over 20 miles from his hometown of Denton, Texas. He completed 18 of 26 passes, including an 89-yard catch-and-run in the fourth quarter when DeMeer Blankumsee was tripped up at the 1. Even though Henigan knew that would have pushed him one past the 104 touchdowns that Clayton Tune had for Houston from 2018-22, he handed off to Brandon Thomas for a 1-yard touchdown on the next play. Even when he had a run-pass option. “I'm just happy that we came out with a win,” Henigan said. West Virginia (6-7) had scored on six consecutive possessions (four touchdowns) before one more chance in the final minute after the Tigers missed a 50-yard field goal. But the Mountaineers’ final push ended when Elijah Herring had an interception. “The ebbs and flows of a football game. We did what we needed to, we found a way,” said fifth-year coach Ryan Silverfield, now 4-0 in the bowl games the Tigers have played. “That’s kind of the mantra all season. Just leave no doubt, find a way.” Sitting at the podium afterward, Silverfield said he was savoring his final few minutes with Henigan as his quarterback. “He's meant everything,” Silverfield said. “For him to stay loyal to this place, he is a rare breed.\" Garrett Greene was 29-of-40 passing for 328 yards with two TD passes to Hudson Clement, and also ran for 95 yards and a score for West Virginia. Clement finished with 11 catches for 166 yards, and CJ Donaldson ran for 83 yards and two TDs. The Mountaineers played five days after Rich Rodriguez was re-hired for a second stint as head coach at his alma mater 17 years after he left. He was at the game while offensive coordinator Chad Scott served as the interim head coach. “We didn’t start out as fast as we wanted to play, and the guys never wavered,” Scott said. “They were resilient and responded. It didn’t work out for us in the end.” Memphis never trailed, going ahead 7-0 on Henigan’s first TD pass about 10 minutes into the game, a 4-yard underhand scoop to Mario Anderson on the next play after the quarterback had a 23-yard run. His AAC record-matching score was an 18-yarder to Blankumsee with 55 seconds left in the first half for a 28-14 lead. Henigan finished as the Memphis career leader with 14,266 yards, 104 touchdowns and 1,147 completions. All of those records were previously held by Brady White, the quarterback he succeeded for the Tigers. West Virginia trailed 17-0 early in the second quarter after Greene had a fourth-down incompletion and Greg Desrosiers ran 46 yards for a Memphis TD on the next play. The Mountaineers then scored on six consecutive possessions, and outgained Memphis 534 total yards to 474. Memphis scored at least 20 points in its 40th consecutive game since November 2021, by far the nation's longest active streak. Next on the list is Miami's 16 games in a row. ... The Tigers already had consecutive 10-win seasons for the first time. The only other time they had more wins was when going 12-2 in 2019. Rodriguez opens his second stint as West Virginia's head coach at home against FCS team Robert Morris on Aug. 30. His last game with the Mountaineers was a 13-9 loss to Pittsburgh in a regular-season finale on Dec. 1, 2007 that cost them a chance to play in the BCS national championship game. He then left for Michigan. Memphis has won its last eight games in its home stadium, starting with a win over Big 12 team Iowa State in the 2023 Liberty Bowl. Their 2025 opener is there against FCS team Chattanooga on Aug. 30. --- Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

                "content": "Vanuatu (English: /ˌvɑːnuˈɑːtuː/ ⓘ VAH-noo-AH-too or /vænˈwɑːtuː/ van-WAH-too; Bislama and French pronunciation [vanuatu]), officially the Republic of Vanuatu (French: République de Vanuatu; Bislama: Ripablik blong Vanuatu), is an island country in Melanesia located in the South Pacific Ocean. The archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is 1,750 km (1,090 mi) east of northern Australia, 540 km (340 mi) northeast of New Caledonia, east of New Guinea, southeast of Solomon Islands, and west of Fiji. Vanuatu was first inhabited by Melanesian people. The first Europeans to visit the islands were a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator Fernandes de Queirós, who arrived on the largest island, Espíritu Santo, in 1606. Queirós claimed the archipelago for Spain, as part of the colonial Spanish East Indies and named it La Austrialia del Espíritu Santo. In the 1880s, France and the United Kingdom claimed parts of the archipelago, and in 1906, they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the New Hebrides through an Anglo-French condominium. An independence movement arose in the 1970s, and the Republic of Vanuatu was founded in 1980. Since independence, the country has become a member of the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, and the Pacific Islands Forum. Vanuatu's name derives from the word vanua (\"land\" or \"home\"),[9] which occurs in several Austronesian languages,[a] combined with the word tu, meaning \"to stand\" (from Proto-Oceanic *tuqur).[10] Together, the two words convey the independent status of the country.[11] The history of Vanuatu before European colonisation is mostly obscure because of the lack of written sources up to that point, and because only limited archaeological work has been conducted; Vanuatu's volatile geology and climate is also likely to have destroyed or hidden many prehistoric sites.[12] Archaeological evidence gathered since the 1980s supports the theory that the Vanuatuan islands were first settled about 3,000 years ago, in the period roughly between 1100 BCE and 700 BCE.[12][13] These were almost certainly people of the Lapita culture. The formerly widespread idea that Vanuatu might have been only marginally affected by this culture was rendered obsolete by the evidence uncovered in recent decades at numerous sites on most of the islands in the archipelago, ranging from the Banks Islands in the north to Aneityum in the south.[12] Notable Lapita sites include Teouma on Éfaté, Uripiv, and Vao off the coast of Malakula, and Makue on Aore. Several ancient burial sites have been excavated, most notably Teouma on Éfaté, which has a large ancient cemetery containing the remains of 94 individuals.[12] There are also sites – on Éfaté and on the adjacent islands of Lelepa and Eretoka – associated with the 16th–17th century chief or chiefs called Roy Mata. (This may be a title held by different men over several generations.) Roy Mata is said to have united local clans and instituted and presided over an era of peace.[14][15] The stories about Roy Mata come from local oral tradition and are consistent with centuries-old evidence uncovered at archaeological sites.[15] The Lapita sites became Vanuatu's first UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008.[16][17] The immediate origins of the Lapita lie to the northwest, in the Solomon Islands archipelago and the Bismarck Archipelago of Papua New Guinea,[12] though DNA studies of a 3,000-year-old skeleton found near Port Vila in 2016 indicates that some may have arrived directly from the Philippines and/or Taiwan, pausing only briefly en route.[18] They brought with them crops such as yam, taro, and banana, as well as domesticated animals such as pigs and chickens.[12] Their arrival is coincident with the extinction of several species, such as the land crocodile (Mekosuchus kalpokasi), land tortoise (Meiolania damelipi) and various flightless bird species.[12] Lapita settlements reached as far east as Tonga and Samoa at their greatest extent.[12] Over time, the Lapita culture lost much of its early unity; as such, it became increasingly fragmented, the precise reasons for which are unclear. Over the centuries, pottery, settlement and burial practices in Vanuatu all evolved in a more localised direction, with long-distance trade and migration patterns contracting.[12] Nevertheless, some limited long-distance trade did continue, with similar cultural practices and late-period items also being found in Fiji, New Caledonia, the Bismarcks and the Solomons.[12] Finds in central and southern Vanuatu, such as distinctive adzes, also indicate some trade connections with, and possibly population movements of, Polynesian peoples to the east.[12][14] Over time, it is thought that the Lapita either mixed with, or acted as pioneers for, migrants coming from the Bismarks and elsewhere in Melanesia, ultimately producing the darker-skinned physiognomy that is typical of modern Ni-Vanuatu.[19][20] Linguistically, the Lapita peoples' Austronesian languages were maintained, with all of the numerous 100+ autochthonous languages of Vanuatu being classified as belonging to the Oceanic branch of the Austronesian language family.[21] This linguistic hyperdiversity resulted from a number of factors: continuing waves of migration, the existence of numerous decentralised and generally self-sufficient communities, hostilities between people groups, with none able to dominate any of the others, and the difficult geography of Vanuatu that impeded inter- and intra-island travel and communication.[22] The geological record also shows that a huge volcanic eruption occurred on Ambrym in c. 200 CE, which would have devastated local populations and likely resulted in further population movements.[12][14][23] Human cannibalism was widespread in some parts of Vanuatu.[24] The Vanuatu islands first had contact with Europeans in April 1606, when the Portuguese explorer Pedro Fernandes de Queirós, sailing for the Spanish Crown, departed El Callao,[25] sailed by the Banks Islands, landing briefly on Gaua (which he called Santa María).[14][26] Continuing further south, Queirós arrived at the largest island, naming it La Austrialia del Espíritu Santo or \"The Southern Land of the Holy Spirit\", believing he had arrived in Terra Australis (Australia).[12][27] The Spanish established a short-lived settlement named Nueva Jerusalem at Big Bay on the north side of the island.[14][26] Despite Queirós's intention, relations with the Ni-Vanuatu turned violent within days. The Spanish subsequent attempts to make contact were met with the islanders fleeing or leading the explorers into an ambush.[14] Many of the crew, including Queirós, were also suffering from ill health, with Queirós's mental state also deteriorating.[14][26] The settlement was abandoned after a month, with Queirós continuing his search for the southern continent.[14] Europeans did not return until 1768, when the French explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville sailed by the islands on 22 May, naming them the Great Cyclades.[28][12] Of the various French toponyms Bougainville devised, only Pentecost Island has stuck.[26] The French landed on Ambae, trading with the native people in a peaceful manner, though Bougainville stated that they were later attacked, necessitating him to fire warning shots with his muskets, before his crew left and continued their voyage.[26] In July–September 1774 the islands were explored extensively by British explorer Captain James Cook, who named them the New Hebrides, after the Hebrides off the west coast of Scotland, a name that lasted until independence in 1980.[29][12][26] Cook managed to maintain generally cordial relations with the Ni-Vanuatu by giving them presents and refraining from violence.[14][26] In 1789, William Bligh and the remainder of his crew sailed through the Banks Islands on their return voyage to Timor following the mutiny on the Bounty; Bligh later returned to the islands, naming them after his benefactor Joseph Banks.[30] Whaleships were among the first regular visitors to this group of islands. The first recorded visit was by the Rose in February 1804, and the last known visit by the New Bedford ship John and Winthrop in 1887.[31] In 1825, the trader Peter Dillon's discovery of sandalwood on the island of Erromango, highly valued as an incense in China where it could be traded for tea, resulted in rush of incomers that ended in 1830 after a clash between immigrant Polynesian workers and indigenous Ni-Vanuatu.[12][32][33][34] Further sandalwood trees were found on Efate, Espiritu Santo, and Aneityum, prompting a series of boom and busts, though supplies were essentially exhausted by the mid-1860s, and the trade largely ceased.[32][34] During the 1860s, planters in Australia, Fiji, New Caledonia, and the Samoan islands, in need of labourers, encouraged a long-term indentured labour trade called \"blackbirding\".[34] At the height of the labour trade, more than one-half the adult male population of several of the islands worked abroad. Because of this, and the poor conditions and abuse often faced by workers, as well the introduction of common diseases to which native Ni-Vanuatu had no immunity, the population of Vanuatu declined severely, with the current population being greatly reduced compared to pre-contact times.[29][12][34] Greater oversight of the trade saw it gradually wind down, with Australia barring any further 'blackbird' labourers in 1906, followed by Fiji and Samoa in 1910 and 1913 respectively.[34] From 1839 onwards, missionaries, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, arrived on the islands.[14][34] At first, they faced hostility, most notably with the killings of John Williams and James Harris of the London Missionary Society on Erromango in 1839.[14][35] Despite this, they pressed on, resulting in many conversions. To the consternation of the Europeans, Ni-Vanuatu syncretised Christianity with traditional kastom beliefs.[34] The Anglican Melanesian Mission also took young converts for further training in New Zealand and Norfolk Island.[14] Presbyterian missionaries are particularly successful on Aneityum, though less so on Tanna, with missionaries being repeatedly chased off the island by locals throughout the 1840s–60s.[14] The waves of illnesses and deaths the missionaries brought with them may have been partly to blame for the hostile response.[14][34] Other European settlers also came, looking for land for cotton plantations, the first of these being Henry Ross Lewin on Tanna in 1865 (which he later abandoned).[36] When international cotton prices collapsed after the ending of the American Civil War, they switched to coffee, cocoa, bananas, and, most successfully, coconuts. Initially British subjects from Australia made up the majority of settlers, but with little support from the British government they frequently struggled to make a success of their settlements.[34] French planters also began arriving, beginning with Ferdinand Chevillard on Efate in 1880, and later in larger numbers following the creation of the Compagnie Caledonienne des Nouvelles-Hébrides (CCNH) I. 1882 by John Higginson (a fiercely pro-French Irishman), which soon tipped the balance in favour of French subjects.[37][38] The French government took over the CCNH in 1894 and actively encouraged French settlement.[34] By 1906, French settlers (at 401) outnumbered the British (228), almost two to one.[29][34] The jumbling of French and British interests in the islands and the near lawlessness prevalent there brought petitions for one or both of the two powers to annex the territory.[34] The Convention of 16 October 1887 established a joint naval commission for the sole purpose of protecting French and British citizens, with no claim to jurisdiction over internal native affairs.[14][39] Hostilities between settlers and Ni-Vanuatu were commonplace, often centring on disputes over land which had been purchased in dubious circumstances.[34] There was pressure from French settlers in New Caledonia to annex the islands, though Britain was unwilling to relinquish their influence completely.[14] As a result, in 1906, France and the United Kingdom agreed to administer the islands jointly; called the Anglo-French Condominium, it was a unique form of government with two separate governmental, legal, judicial and financial systems that came together only in a Joint Court.[34][40] Land expropriation and exploitation of Ni-Vanuatu workers on plantations continued apace.[34] In an effort to curb the worst of the abuses, and with the support of the missionaries, the Condominium's authority was extended via the Anglo-French Protocol of 1914, although this was not formally ratified until 1922.[34] While this resulted in some improvements, labour abuses continued, and Ni-Vanuatu were barred from acquiring the citizenship of either power, being officially stateless.[29][34] The underfunded Condominium government proved dysfunctional, with the duplication of administrations making effective governance difficult and time-consuming.[34] Education, healthcare and other such services were left in the hands of the missionaries.[34] During the 1920s–1930s, indentured workers from Vietnam (then part of French Indochina) came to work in the plantations in the New Hebrides.[41] By 1929, there were some 6,000 Vietnamese people in the New Hebrides.[34][41] There was some social and political unrest among them in the 1940s due to the poor working conditions and the social effects of Allied troops, who were generally more sympathetic to their plight than the planters.[42] Most Vietnamese were repatriated in 1946 and 1963, though a small Vietnamese community remains in Vanuatu today.[43] The Second World War brought immense change to the archipelago. The fall of France to Nazi Germany in 1940 allowed Britain to gain a greater level of authority on the islands.[40] The Australian military stationed a 2,000-strong force on Malakula in a bid to protect Australia from a possible Japanese invasion.[40] Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, the United States joined the war on the Allied side; Japan soon advanced rapidly throughout Melanesia and was in possession of much of what is now Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands by April 1942, leaving the New Hebrides on the frontline of any further advance.[40] To forestall this, from May 1942 US troops were stationed on the islands, where they built airstrips, roads, military bases and an array of other supporting infrastructure on Efate and Espiritu Santo.[44] At the peak of the deployment, some 50,000 Americans were stationed on the two military bases, outnumbering the native population of roughly 40,000, with thousands more Allied troops passing through the islands at some point.[44] A small Ni-Vanuatu force of some 200 men (the New Hebrides Defence Force) was established to support the Americans, and thousands more were engaged in the construction and maintenance work as part of the Vanuatu Labor Corps.[44] The American presence effectively sidelined the Anglo-French authorities for the duration of their stay, with the Americans' more tolerant and friendly attitude to the Ni-Vanuatu, informal habits, relative wealth, and the presence of African American troops serving with a degree of equality (albeit in a segregated force) seriously undermining the underlying ethos of colonial superiority.[44] Wartime Vanuatu was the setting for James Michener's novel Tales of the South Pacific. With the successful reoccupation of the Solomons in 1943 the New Hebrides lost their strategic importance, and the Americans withdrew in 1945, selling much of their equipment at bargain prices and dumping the rest in the sea, at a place now called Million Dollar Point on Espiritu Santo.[34] The rapid American deployment and withdrawal led to growth in 'cargo cults', most notably that of John Frum, whereby Ni-Vanuatu hoped that by returning to traditional values whilst mimicking aspects of the American presence that 'cargo' (i.e. large quantities of American goods) would be delivered to them.[45][46] Meanwhile, the Condominium government returned, though understaffed and underfunded, it struggled to reassert its authority.[34] Decolonisation began sweeping the European empires after the war, and from the 1950s the Condominium government began a somewhat belated campaign of modernisation and economic development.[34] Hospitals were built, doctors trained and immunisation campaigns carried out.[34] The inadequate mission-run school system was taken over and improved, with primary enrollment greatly increasing to be near-universal by 1970.[34] There was greater oversight of the plantations, with worker exploitation being clamped down on and Ni-Vanuatu paid higher wages.[34] New industries, such as cattle ranching, commercial fishing and manganese mining were established.[34] Ni-Vanuatu began gradually to take over more positions of power and influence within the economy and the church.[34] Despite this, the British and French still dominated the politics of the colony, with an Advisory Council set up in 1957 containing some Ni-Vanuatu representation having little power.[34] The economic development had unintended consequences. In the 1960s, many planters began fencing off and clearing large areas of bushland for cattle ranching, which were often deemed to be communally-held kastom lands by Ni-Vanuatu.[34] On Espiritu Santo, the Nagriamel movement was founded in 1966 by Chief Buluk and Jimmy Stevens on a platform of opposing any further land clearances and gradual, Ni-Vanuatu-led, economic development.[34][47] The movement gained a large following, prompting a crackdown by the authorities, with Buluk and Stevens being arrested in 1967.[34] Upon their release, they began to press for complete independence.[34] In 1971, Father Walter Lini established another party: the New Hebrides Cultural Association, later renamed the New Hebrides National Party (NHNP), which also focused on achieving independence and opposition to land expropriation.[34] The NNDP first came to prominence in 1971, when the Condominium government was forced to intervene after a rash of land speculation by foreign nationals.[34] Meanwhile, French settlers, and Francophone and mixed-race Ni-Vanuatu, established two separate parties on a platform of more gradual political development – the Mouvement Autonomiste des Nouvelles-Hébrides (MANH), based on Espiritu Santo, and the Union des Communautés des Nouvelles-Hébrides (UCNH) on Efate.[34] The parties aligned on linguistic and religious lines: the NHNP was seen as the party of Anglophone Protestants, and were backed by the British who wished to exit the colony altogether, whereas the MANH, UCNH, Nagriamel and others (collectively known as the 'Moderates') represented Catholic Francophone interests, and a more gradual path to independence.[34] France backed these groups as they were keen to maintain their influence in the region, most especially in their mineral-rich colony of New Caledonia where they were attempting to suppress an independence movement.[34][48] Meanwhile, economic development continued, with numerous banks and financial centres opening up in the early 1970s to take advantage of the territory's tax haven status.[34] A mini-building boom took off in Port Vila and, following the building of a deep-sea wharf, cruise ship tourism grew rapidly, with annual arrivals reaching 40,000 by 1977.[34] The boom encouraged increasing urbanisation and the populations of Port Vila and Luganville grew rapidly.[34] In November 1974, the British and French met and agreed to create New Hebrides Representative Assembly in the colony, based partly on universal suffrage and partly on appointed persons representing various interest groups.[34] The first election took place in November 1975, resulting in an overall victory for the NHNP.[34] The Moderates disputed the results, with Jimmy Stevens threatening to secede and declare independence.[34] The Condominium's Resident Commissioners decided to postpone the opening of the Assembly, though the two sides proved unable to agree on a solution, prompting protests and counter-protests, some of which turned violent.[34][49][50] After discussions and some fresh elections in disputed areas, the Assembly finally convened in November 1976.[34][51][52] The NHNP renamed itself the Vanua'aku Pati (VP) in 1977, and now supported immediate independence under a strong central government and an Anglicisation of the islands. The Moderates meanwhile supported a more gradual transition to independence and a federal system, plus the maintenance of French as an official language.[34] In March 1977, a joint Anglo-French and Ni-Vanuatu conference was held in London, at which it was agreed to hold fresh Assembly elections and later an independence referendum in 1980; the VP boycotted the conference and the subsequent election in November.[34][53] They set up a parallel 'People's Provisional Government' which had de facto control of many areas, prompting violent confrontations with Moderates and the Condominium government.[34][54][55] A compromise was eventually brokered, a Government of National Unity formed under a new constitution, and fresh elections held in November 1979, which the VP won with a comfortable majority. Independence was now scheduled for 30 July 1980.[34] Performing less well than expected, the Moderates disputed the results.[34][56] Tensions continued throughout 1980. Violent confrontations occurred between VP and Moderate supporters on several islands.[34] On Espiritu Santo Nagriamel and Moderate activists under Jimmy Stevens, funded by the American libertarian organisation Phoenix Foundation, took over the island's government in January and declared the independent Republic of Vemarana, prompting VP supporters to flee and the central government to institute a blockade.[34][57] In May, an abortive Moderate rebellion broke out on Tanna, in the course of which one of their leaders was shot and killed.[34] The British and French sent in troops in July in a bid to forestall the Vemarana secessionists. Still ambivalent about independence, the French effectively neutered the force, prompting a collapse of law and order on Espiritu Santo resulting in large scale looting.[34] The New Hebrides, now renamed Vanuatu, achieved independence as planned on 30 July 1980 under Prime Minister Walter Lini, with a ceremonial President replacing the Resident Commissioners.[34][58][59] The Anglo-French forces withdrew in August, and Lini called in troops from Papua New Guinea, sparking the brief 'Coconut War' against Jimmy Stevens's Vemarana separatists.[34][60] The PNG forces quickly quelled the Vemarana revolt and Stevens surrendered on 1 September; he was later jailed.[34][61][62] Lini remained in office until 1991, running an Anglophone-dominated government and winning both the 1983 and 1987 elections.[63][64] In foreign affairs, Lini joined the Non Aligned Movement, opposed Apartheid in South Africa and all forms of colonialism, established links with Libya and Cuba, and opposed the French presence in New Caledonia and their nuclear testing in French Polynesia.[65][66] Opposition to Lini's tight grip on power grew and in 1987, after he had suffered a stroke whilst on a visit to the United States, a section of the Vanua'aku Pati (VP) under Barak Sopé broke off to form a new party (the Melanesian Progressive Party, MPP), and an attempt was made by President Ati George Sokomanu to unseat Lini.[60] This failed, and Lini became increasingly distrustful of his VP colleagues, firing anyone he deemed to be disloyal.[64] One such person, Donald Kalpokas, subsequently declared himself to be VP leader, splitting the party in two.[64] On 6 September 1991 a vote of no confidence removed Lini from power;[64] Kalpokas became prime minister, and Lini formed a new party, the National United Party (NUP).[64][60] Meanwhile, the economy had entered a downturn, with foreign investors and foreign aid put off by Lini's flirtation with Communist states and tourist numbers down due to the political turmoil, compounded by a crash in the price of copra, Vanuatu's main export.[64] As a result, the Francophone Union of Moderate Parties (UMP) won the 1991 election, but not with enough seats to form a majority. A coalition was thus formed with Lini's NUP, with the UMP's Maxime Carlot Korman becoming prime minister.[64] Since the 1991 general election, Vanuatuan politics have been unstable with a series of fractious coalition governments and the use of no confidence votes resulting in frequent changes of prime ministers. The democratic system as a whole has been maintained and Vanuatu remains a peaceful and reasonably prosperous state. Throughout most of the 1990s the UMP were in power, the prime ministership switching between UMP rivals Korman and Serge Vohor, and the UMP instituting a more free market approach to the economy, cutting the public sector, improving opportunities for Francophone Ni-Vanuatu and renewing ties with France.[64][67] The government struggled with splits in their NUP coalition partner and a series of strikes within the Civil Service in 1993–1994, the latter dealt with by a wave of firings.[64] Financial scandals dogged both Korman and Vohor, with the latter implicated in a scheme to sell Vanuatu passports to foreigners.[68][69] In 1996, Vohor and President Jean-Marie Léyé were briefly abducted by the Vanuatu Mobile Force over a pay dispute and later released unharmed.[70][60] A riot occurred in Port Vila in 1998 when savers attempted to withdraw funds from the Vanuatu National Provident Fund following allegations of financial impropriety, prompting the government to declare a brief state of emergency.[60][69] A Comprehensive Reform Program was enacted in the 1998 with the aim of improving economic performance and cracking down on government corruption.[69] At the 1998 Vanuatuan general election the UMP were unseated by the VP under Donald Kalpokas.[60][71][72] He lasted only a year, resigning when threatened with a no confidence vote, replaced by Barak Sopé of the MPP in 1999, himself unseated in a no confidence vote in 2001.[73][69] Despite the political uncertainty Vanuatu's economy continued to grow in this period, fuelled by high demand for Vanuatu beef, tourism, remittances from foreign workers, and large aid packages from the Asian Development Bank (in 1997) and the US Millennium Challenge fund (in 2005).[74] Vanuatu was removed from the OECD list of 'uncooperative tax havens' in 2003 and joined the World Trade Organization in 2011.[74][75] Edward Natapei of the VP became prime minister in 2001 and went on to win the 2002 Vanuatuan general election.[76] The 2004 Vanuatuan general election saw Vohor and the UMP return to power. He lost much support over a secret deal to recognise Taiwan in the China-Taiwan dispute and was unseated in a confidence vote less than five months after taking office, being replaced by Ham Lini.[77][78] Lini switched back recognition to the People's Republic of China, and the PRC remains a major aid donor to the Vanuatu government.[79][80] In 2007, violent clashes broke out in Port Vila between migrants from Tanna and Ambrym, in which two people died.[81][75] Lini lost the 2008 Vanuatuan general election, with Natapei returning to power as Vanuatu politics entered a period of turmoil. There were frequent attempts by the opposition to unseat Natapei via the use of no confidence votes – though unsuccessful, he was briefly removed on a procedural technicality in November 2009, an action that was then overturned by the Chief Justice.[82][83] Sato Kilman of the People's Progressive Party (PPP) ousted Natapei in another no confidence vote in December 2010. He was removed in the same manner by Vohor's UMP in April 2011. This was invalidated on a technical point and he returned as PM. The Chief Justice then overturned his victory. Natapei returned to power for ten days, until Parliament voted in Kilman again.[84] Kilman managed to remain in office for two years, before being ousted in March 2013.[85] The new government was the first time the Green Confederation was in power, and the new prime minister, Moana Carcasses Kalosil, was the first non-Ni-Vanuatu to hold the position (Kalosil is of mixed French-Tahitian ancestry and a naturalised Vanuatu citizen). Kalosil took steps to institute a review of diplomatic passport sales in his country. He also expressed his support for the West Papuan independence movement. Support for this move was also expressed by former Prime Ministers Kilman and Carlot Korman.[86][87][88][89] Kalosil was ousted in another confidence vote in 2014, with the VP returning under Joe Natuman, who himself was ousted the following year in a confidence vote led by Kilman. Meanwhile, the country was devastated by Cyclone Pam in 2015, which resulted in 16 deaths and enormous destruction.[90] A corruption investigation in 2015 resulted in the conviction of numerous MPs in Kilman's government for bribery, including former PM Moana Carcasses Kalosil.[91][92] His authority was severely weakened, and Kilman lost the 2016 Vanuatuan general election to Charlot Salwai's Reunification Movement for Change (RMC). Salwai in turn lost the 2020 Vanuatuan general election amidst allegations of perjury, bringing back in the VP under Bob Loughman as the country dealt with the aftermath of Cyclone Harold and the global COVID-19 pandemic.[93][94] Vanuatu was one of the last places on Earth to suffer a coronavirus outbreak, recording its first case of COVID-19 in November 2020.[95] In October 2023, Vanuatu aimed itself at being the first Pacific country to eliminate cervical cancer.[96] In December 2024, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake reportedly damaged almost every single house in Efate, where the capital, Port Vila, is located, resulting in 19 fatalities.[97] The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that 116,000 people had been directly affected by the earthquake,[98] equivalent to a third of Vanuatu's population.[99] Vanuatu is a Y-shaped archipelago consisting of about 83 relatively small, geologically newer islands of volcanic origin (65 of them inhabited), with about 1,300 kilometres (810 mi) between the most northern and southern islands.[100][101] Two of these islands (Matthew and Hunter) are also claimed and controlled by France as part of the French collectivity of New Caledonia. The country lies between latitudes 13°S and 21°S and longitudes 166°E and 171°E. The fourteen of Vanuatu's islands that have surface areas of more than 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi) are, from largest to smallest: Espiritu Santo, Malakula, Efate, Erromango, Ambrym, Tanna, Pentecost, Epi, Ambae or Aoba, Gaua, Vanua Lava, Maewo, Malo and Aneityum or Anatom. The nation's largest towns are the capital Port Vila, on Efate, and Luganville on Espiritu Santo.[102] The highest point in Vanuatu is Mount Tabwemasana, at 1,879 metres (6,165 ft), on the island of Espiritu Santo. Vanuatu's total area is roughly 12,274 square kilometres (4,739 sq mi),[103] of which its land surface is very limited (roughly 4,700 square kilometres (1,800 sq mi)). Most of the islands are steep, with unstable soils and little permanent freshwater.[101] One estimate, made in 2005, is that only 9% of land is used for agriculture (7% with permanent crops, plus 2% considered arable).[104] The shoreline is mostly rocky with fringing reefs and no continental shelf, dropping rapidly into the ocean depths.[101] There are several active volcanoes in Vanuatu, including Lopevi, Mount Yasur and several underwater volcanoes. Volcanic activity is common, with an ever-present danger of a major eruption; a nearby undersea eruption of 6.4 magnitude occurred in November 2008 with no casualties, and an eruption occurred in 1945.[105] Vanuatu is recognised as a distinct terrestrial ecoregion, which is known as the Vanuatu rain forests.[106] It is part of the Australasian realm, which includes New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands, Australia, New Guinea and New Zealand. Vanuatu's population (estimated in 2008 as growing 2.4% annually)[107] is placing increasing pressure on land and resources for agriculture, grazing, hunting, and fishing. 90% of Vanuatu households fish and consume fish, which has caused intense fishing pressure near villages and the depletion of near-shore fish species. While well-vegetated, most islands show signs of deforestation. The islands have been logged, particularly of high-value timber, subjected to wide-scale slash-and-burn agriculture, and converted to coconut plantations and cattle ranches, and now show evidence of increased soil erosion and landslides.[101] Many upland watersheds are being deforested and degraded, and fresh water is becoming increasingly scarce. Proper waste disposal, as well as water and air pollution, are becoming troublesome issues around urban areas and large villages. Additionally, the lack of employment opportunities in industry and inaccessibility to markets have combined to lock rural families into a subsistence or self-reliance mode, putting tremendous pressure on local ecosystems.[101] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.82/10, ranking it 18th globally out of 172 countries.[108] Despite its tropical forests, Vanuatu has relatively few terrestrial plant and animal species. It has an indigenous flying fox, Pteropus anetianus. Flying foxes are important rainforest and timber regenerators. They pollinate and disperse seed from a variety of native trees. Their diet is nectar, pollen and fruit and they are commonly called \"fruit bats\". They are in decline across their South Pacific range. The 19 species of native reptiles include the flowerpot snake, found only on Efate. The Fiji banded iguana (Brachylophus fasciatus) was introduced as a feral animal in the 1960s.[109][110] There are eleven species of bats (three unique to Vanuatu) and sixty-one species of land and water birds. While the small Polynesian rat is thought to be indigenous, the large species arrived with Europeans, as did domesticated hogs, dogs, and cattle. The ant species of some of the islands of Vanuatu were catalogued by E. O. Wilson.[111] The region has more than 4,000 species of marine molluscs and a large diversity of marine fishes. Cone snails and stonefish carry poison that is fatal to humans. The Giant East African land snail arrived only in the 1970s but has already spread from the Port Vila region to Luganville. There are three or possibly four adult saltwater crocodiles living in Vanuatu's mangroves and no current breeding population.[110] It is said the crocodiles reached the northern part of the islands after cyclones, given the island chain's proximity to the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, where crocodiles are common.[112] The climate is tropical, with about nine months of warm to hot rainy weather and the possibility of cyclones and three to four months of cooler, drier weather characterised by winds from the southeast. The water temperature ranges from 22 °C (72 °F) in winter to 28 °C (82 °F) in the summer. Cool between April and September, the days become hotter and more humid starting in October. The daily temperature ranges from 20–32 °C (68–90 °F). Southeasterly trade winds occur from May to October.[101] Vanuatu has a long rainy season, with significant rainfall almost every month. The wettest and hottest months are December through April, which also constitutes the cyclone season. The driest months are June through November.[101] Rainfall averages about 2,360 millimetres (93 in) per year but can be as high as 4,000 millimetres (160 in) in the northern islands.[104] According to the WorldRiskIndex 2021, Vanuatu ranks first among the countries with the highest disaster risk worldwide.[113] In March 2015, Cyclone Pam impacted much of Vanuatu as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, causing deaths and extensive damage to all the islands. As of 17 March 2015[update] the United Nations said the official death toll was 11 (six from Efate and five from Tanna), and 30 were reported injured; these numbers were expected to rise as more remote islands reported back.[114][115] Vanuatu lands minister, Ralph Regenvanu said, \"This is the worst disaster to affect Vanuatu ever as far as we know.\"[116] In April 2020, Cyclone Harold travelled through the Espiritu Santo town of Luganville, causing great material damage there and on at least four islands.[117] Vanuatu has relatively frequent earthquakes. Of the 58 M7 or greater events that occurred between 1909 and 2001, few were studied. A severe earthquake in November 1999, followed by a tsunami, caused extensive damage to the northern island of Pentecost, leaving thousands homeless. Another powerful earthquake in January 2002 caused extensive damage in the capital, Port Vila, and surrounding areas and was also followed by a tsunami. Another earthquake of 7.2 struck on 2 August 2007.[118] The Republic of Vanuatu is a parliamentary democracy[119] with a written constitution, which declares that the \"head of the Republic shall be known as the President and shall symbolise the unity of the nation.\" The powers of the President of Vanuatu, who is elected for a five-year term by a two-thirds vote of an electoral college, are primarily ceremonial.[120] The electoral college consists of members of Parliament and the presidents of Regional Councils. The President may be removed by the electoral college for gross misconduct or incapacity. The Prime Minister, who is the head of government, is elected by a majority vote of a three-quarters quorum of the Parliament. The Prime Minister, in turn, appoints the Council of Ministers, whose number may not exceed a quarter of the number of parliamentary representatives. The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers constitute the executive government. The Parliament of Vanuatu is unicameral and has 52 members,[121] who are elected by popular vote every four years unless earlier dissolved by a majority vote of a three-quarters quorum or by a directive from the President on the advice of the Prime Minister. Forty-four of these MPs are elected through Single non-transferable voting; eight are elected through single-member plurality. The national Council of Chiefs, called the Malvatu Mauri and elected by district councils of chiefs, advises the government on all matters concerning ni-Vanuatu culture and language. The Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and up to three other judges. Two or more members of this court may constitute a Court of Appeal. Magistrate courts handle most routine legal matters. The legal system is based on British common law and French civil law. The constitution also provides for the establishment of village or island courts presided over by chiefs to deal with questions of customary law.[122] Squatting occurs and the principle of adverse possession does not exist.[123] Besides national authorities and figures, Vanuatu also has high-placed people at the village level. Chiefs continue to be the leading figures at the village level. It has been reported that even politicians need to oblige them.[124] In northern Vanuatu, feasts are graded through the nimangki system. In July 2024, Minister Charlot Salwai graced the opening ceremony of the new $21 million presidential palace built by China. Hu Chunhua bestowed Vanuatu an oversized novelty golden key emblazoned with \"China Aid\". Dragon dancers and ceremonial kava brew completed the festivity.[125] Vanuatu has joined the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Agence de Coopération Culturelle et Technique, la Francophonie, and the Commonwealth of Nations. Vanuatu has been a member of the Forum of Small States (FOSS) since the group's founding in 1992.[126] Since 1980, Australia, the United Kingdom, France and New Zealand have provided the bulk of Vanuatu's development aid. Direct aid from the UK to Vanuatu ceased in 2005 following the decision by the UK to no longer focus on the Pacific. More recently, new donors such as the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) of the United States and the People's Republic of China have been providing increased amounts of aid funding and loans. In 2005 the MCA announced that Vanuatu was one of the first 15 countries in the world selected to receive support – an amount of US$65 million was given for the provision and upgrading of key pieces of public infrastructure. In March 2017, at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council, Vanuatu made a joint statement on behalf of some other Pacific nations raising human rights abuses in the Western New Guinea or West Papua region, which has been part of Indonesia since 1963,[127] and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a report[128][129] as more than 100,000 Papuans allegedly have died during decades of Papua conflict.[130] Indonesia rejected Vanuatu's allegations.[129] In September 2017, at the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly, the Prime Ministers of Vanuatu, Tuvalu, and the Solomon Islands once again raised human rights concerns in West Papua.[131] In 2018, newspaper reports from Australia indicated growing concern about the level of Chinese investment in Vanuatu, with over 50% of the country's debt of $440 million owed to China.[132] Concern was focused on the possibility that China would use Vanuatu's potential inability to repay debt as leverage to bargain for control of, or a People's Liberation Army presence at, Luganville Wharf. China loaned and funded the $114 million redevelopment of the wharf, which has already been constructed, with the capacity to dock naval vessels.[133] In July 2024, China built three governmental buildings, including the new presidential palace, supposedly as a free donation to Vanuatu; this has revived international concerns about the potential overreach of Chinese authorities on Vanuatu and other Pacific countries.[134] Vanuatu retains strong economic and cultural ties to Australia, the European Union (in particular France), the UK, and New Zealand. Australia now provides the bulk of external assistance, including to the police force, which has a paramilitary wing.[135] Karen Bell is the new British High Commissioner to Vanuatu. The British High Commission to Vanuatu, located in Port Vila, was reopened in the summer of 2019 as part of the UK Government's 'Pacific Uplift' strategy.[136] The British Friends of Vanuatu,[137] based in London, provides support for Vanuatu visitors to the UK, and can often offer advice and contacts to persons seeking information about Vanuatu or wishing to visit, and welcomes new members (not necessarily resident in the UK). The association's Charitable Trust funds small scale assistance in the education and training sector. In 2018, Vanuatu banned all use of plastic bags and plastic straws, with more plastic items scheduled to be banned in 2020.[138] In 2019, Vanuatu's plastic waste disposal rate was approximately 2,000 tonnes per year, with the most common items being single-use soft plastic packaging, polyethylene terephthalate water bottles, and styrofoam packaging.[139] In 2020, the government banned another seven more 'types' of items, covering cutlery, single-use plates, and artificial flowers.[140] In 2023, the governments of Vanuatu and other islands vulnerable to climate change (Fiji, Niue, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu) launched the \"Port Vila Call for a Just Transition to a Fossil Fuel Free Pacific\", calling for the phase-out of fossil fuels and the 'rapid and just transition' to renewable energy and strengthening environmental law, including introducing the criminalization of ecocide.[141][142][143] There are two police wings: the Vanuatu Police Force (VPF) and the paramilitary wing, the Vanuatu Mobile Force (VMF).[144] Altogether there were 547 police officers organised into two main police commands: one in Port Vila and one in Luganville.[144] In addition to the two command stations there were four secondary police stations and eight police posts. This means that there are many islands with no police presence, and many parts of islands where getting to a police post can take several days.[145][146] There is no purely military expenditure.[147] In 2017, Vanuatu signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[148][149] Vanuatu has been divided into six provinces since 1994.[150][151] The names in English of all provinces are derived from the initial letters of their constituent islands: Provinces are autonomous units with their own popularly elected local parliaments known officially as provincial councils.[152] The provinces are in turn divided into municipalities (usually consisting of an individual island) headed by a council and a mayor elected from among the members of the council.[153] Vanuatu was ranked the 173rd safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.[154] In 2015, Vanuatu was ranked the 84th most economically free country by The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal.[155] The economy grew about 6% in the early 2000s.[156] This is higher than in the 1990s, when GDP rose less than 3%, on average. One report from the Manila-based Asian Development Bank about Vanuatu's economy gave mixed reviews and noted that the economy grew at a 5.9% rate from 2003 to 2007.[156] Vanuatu became the 185th member of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in December 2011.[157] Exports include copra, kava, beef, cocoa, and timber; imports include machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, and fuels. In contrast, mining activity is very low. Agriculture provides a living for 65% of the population. In particular, production of copra and kava creates substantial revenue. Many farmers have been abandoning cultivation of food crops and use earnings from kava cultivation to buy food.[124] Kava has also been used in ceremonial exchanges between clans and villages.[158] Cocoa is also grown for foreign exchange.[159] In 2007, the number of households engaged in fishing was 15,758, mainly for consumption (99%), and the average number of fishing trips was 3 per week.[160] The tropical climate enables growing of a wide range of fruits and vegetables and spices, including banana, garlic, cabbage, peanuts, pineapples, sugarcane, taro, yams, watermelons, leaf spices, carrots, radishes, eggplants, vanilla (both green and cured), pepper, cucumber, and many others.[161] In 2007, the value (in terms of millions of vatu – the official currency of Vanuatu) for agricultural products was estimated for different products: kava (341 million vatu), copra (195), cattle (135), crop gardens (93), cocoa (59), forestry (56), fishing (24), and coffee (12).[162] Raising cattle leads to beef production for export. One estimate in 2007 for the total value of cattle heads sold was 135 million vatu; cattle were first introduced into the area from Australia by British planter James Paddon.[163] On average, each household has 5 pigs and 16 chickens, and while cattle are the \"most important livestock\", pigs and chickens are important for subsistence agriculture as well as playing a significant role in ceremonies and customs (especially pigs).[164] There are 30 commercial farms (sole proprietorships (37%), partnerships (23%), corporations (17%)), with revenues of 533 million vatu and expenses of 329 million vatu in 2007.[165] The Vanuatu National Statistics Office (VNSO) released their 2007 agricultural census in 2008. According to the study, agricultural exports make up about three-quarters (73%) of all exports; 80% of the population lives in rural areas where \"agriculture is the main source of their livelihood\"; and of these households, almost all (99%) engaged in agriculture, fisheries and forestry.[166] Total annual household income was 1,803 million vatu. Of this income, agriculture grown for their own household use was valued at 683 million vatu, agriculture for sale at 561, gifts received at 38, handicrafts at 33, and fisheries (for sale) at 18.[166] Although manganese mining halted in c. 1980,[167] there was an agreement in 2006 to export manganese already mined but not yet exported.[168] The country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light-industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from import duties and a 15% VAT on goods and services.[169] The country's economic development has been suspected to be hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances between constituent islands and from main markets.[170] Vanuatu is one of the premier vacation destinations for scuba divers wishing to explore coral reefs of the South Pacific region.[171] Another attraction to scuba divers is the wreck of the US ocean liner and converted troop carrier SS President Coolidge on Espiritu Santo island. Sunk during World War II, it is one of the largest shipwrecks in the world that is accessible for recreational diving. Tourism increased 17% from 2007 to 2008 to reach 196,134 arrivals, according to one estimate.[172] The 2008 total is a sharp increase from 2000, in which there were only 57,000 visitors (of these, 37,000 were from Australia, 8,000 from New Zealand, 6,000 from New Caledonia, 3,000 from Europe, 1,000 from North America, and 1,000 from Japan).[173] Vanuatu sells citizenship for about $150,000. With demand from the Chinese market booming, passport sales may now account for more than 30% of the country's revenue.[174] Such schemes have been shown to raise ethical problems,[175] and have been involved in some political scandals.[68][176] On 19 July 2023, Vanuatu lost UK visa-free access due to concerns over its citizenship by investment scheme.[177] Financial services are an important part of the economy. Vanuatu is a tax haven that until 2008 did not release account information to other governments or law-enforcement agencies.[178] International pressure, mainly from Australia, influenced the Vanuatu government to begin adhering to international norms to improve transparency. In Vanuatu, there is no income tax, withholding tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, or exchange control.[179] Many international ship-management companies choose to flag their ships under the Vanuatu flag, because of the tax benefits and favourable labour laws (Vanuatu is a full member of the International Maritime Organization and applies its international conventions). Vanuatu is recognised as a \"flag of convenience\" country.[180] Several file-sharing groups, such as the providers of the KaZaA network of Sharman Networks and the developers of WinMX, have chosen to incorporate in Vanuatu to avoid regulation and legal challenges.[181] In response to foreign concerns, the government has promised to tighten regulation of its offshore financial centre. Vanuatu receives foreign aid mainly from Australia and New Zealand. The largest expenditure by households was food (300 million vatu), followed by household appliances and other necessities (79 million vatu), transportation (59), education and services (56), housing (50), alcohol and tobacco (39), clothing and footwear (17).[182] Exports were valued at 3,038 million vatu, and included copra (485), kava (442), cocoa (221), beef (fresh and chilled) (180), timber (80) and fish (live fish, aquarium, shell, button) (28).[183] Total imports of 20,472 million vatu included industrial materials (4,261), food and drink (3,984), machinery (3,087), consumer goods (2,767), transport equipment (2,125), fuels and lubricants (187) and other imports (4,060).[184] There are substantial numbers of crop gardens – 97,888 in 2007 – many on flat land (62%), slightly hilly slope (31%), and even on steep slopes (7%); there were 33,570 households with at least one crop garden, and of these, 10,788 households sold some of these crops over a twelve-month period.[185] Mobile phone service in the islands is provided by Vodafone (formerly TVL)[186] and Digicel. Internet access is provided by Vodafone, Telsat Broadband, Digicel, and Wantok using a variety of connection technologies. A submarine optical fibre cable now connects Vanuatu to Fiji.[187] According to the 2020 census, Vanuatu had a population of 300,019. Men outnumber women, with the population consisting of 151,597 men and 148,422 women in 2020.[188] The population is predominantly rural, but Port Vila and Luganville have tens of thousands of residents. An English coinage termed the inhabitants of Vanuatu as Ni-Vanuatu. The Ni-Vanuatu are primarily of Melanesian descent, with the remainder made up of a mix of Europeans, Asians, and other Pacific islanders.[188] The community of Vietnamese in Vanuatu comprises most of the country's Asian population. The Vietnamese community has declined from 10% of Vanuatu's population in 1929 to about 0.3% (or 1,000 individuals) in 2017.[189] In 2006[190] and 2024,[191] the New Economics Foundation and Friends of the Earth environmentalist group published the Happy Planet Index, which analysed data on levels of reported happiness, life expectancy, and ecological footprint, and they ranked Vanuatu at number one worldwide for the second time. Trade in citizenship for investment has been an increasingly significant source of revenue for Vanuatu in recent years. The sale of what is called \"honorary citizenship\" in Vanuatu has been on offer for several years under the Capital Investment Immigration Plan and more recently the Development Support Plan. People from mainland China make up the bulk of those who have purchased honorary citizenship, entitling them to a Vanuatu passport.[175] The national language of the Republic of Vanuatu is Bislama. The official languages are Bislama, English, and French. The principal languages of education are English and French. The use of English or French as the formal language is split along political lines.[192] Bislama is a creole spoken natively in urban areas. Combining a typical Melanesian grammar and phonology with an almost entirely English-derived vocabulary, Bislama is the lingua franca of the archipelago, used by the majority of the population as a second language. The growth of Bislama as a first language has considerably encroached on the indigenous languages, whose use receded from 73.1% to 63.2% of the population between 1999 and 2009.[193] In addition, 113 indigenous languages, all of which are Southern Oceanic languages except for three outlier Polynesian languages, are spoken in Vanuatu.[194] The density of languages per capita is the highest of any nation in the world,[195] with an average of only 2,000 speakers per language. All vernacular languages of Vanuatu (i.e., excluding Bislama) belong to the Oceanic branch of the Austronesian family. Christianity is the predominant religion in Vanuatu, consisting of several denominations. About one-third of the population belongs to the Presbyterian Church in Vanuatu,[196] Roman Catholic and Anglican are other common denominations, each claiming about 15% of the population. According to its 2022 facts and statistics, 3.6% of the population belongs to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, with a countrywide membership of over 11,000.[197] As of 2010, 1.4% of the people of Vanuatu are members of the Baháʼí Faith, making Vanuatu the 6th most Baháʼí country in the world.[198] The less significant groups are the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Church of Christ,[199] Neil Thomas Ministries (NTM), Jehovah's Witnesses, and others. In 2007, Islam in Vanuatu was estimated to consist of about 200 converts.[200][201] Because of the modern goods that the military in the Second World War brought with them when they came to the islands, several cargo cults developed. Many died out, but the John Frum cult on Tanna is still large, and has adherents in the parliament.[202] Also on Tanna is the Prince Philip Movement, which reveres the United Kingdom's Prince Philip.[203] Villagers of the Yaohnanen tribe believed in an ancient story about the pale-skinned son of a mountain spirit venturing across the seas to look for a powerful woman to marry. Prince Philip, having visited the island with his new wife Queen Elizabeth II, fit the description exactly and is therefore revered as a god around the isle of Tanna.[204] After Philip died, an anthropologist familiar with the group, said that after their period of mourning the group would probably transfer their veneration to King Charles III, who had visited Vanuatu in 2018 and met with some of the tribal leaders.[205] The estimated literacy rate of people aged 15–24 years is about 74% according to UNESCO figures.[206] The rate of primary school enrolment rose from 74.5% in 1989 to 78.2% in 1999 and then to 93.0% in 2004 but then fell to 85.4% in 2007. The proportion of pupils completing a primary education fell from 90% in 1991 to 72% in 2004[207] and up to 78% in 2012. Port Vila and three other centres have campuses of the University of the South Pacific, an educational institution co-owned by twelve Pacific countries. The campus in Port Vila, known as the Emalus Campus, houses the university's law school. Vanuatu culture may be divided into three major cultural regions. In the north, wealth is established by how much one can give away through a grade-taking system. Pigs, particularly those with rounded tusks, are considered a symbol of wealth throughout Vanuatu. In the centre, more traditional Melanesian cultural systems dominate. In the south, a system involving grants of title with associated privileges has developed.[194] Young men undergo various ceremonies, usually including circumcision.[194][208] Most villages have a nakamal or village clubhouse, which serves as a meeting point for men and a place to drink kava. Villages also have male- and female-only sections. These sections are situated all over the villages; in nakamals, special spaces are provided for females when they are in their menstruation period.[194] There are few prominent Ni-Vanuatu authors. Women's rights activist Grace Mera Molisa, who died in 2002, was a descriptive poet. The traditional music of Vanuatu is still present in the rural areas of Vanuatu.[209] Musical instruments consist mostly of idiophones: drums of various shapes and sizes, slit gongs, stamping tubes, and rattles, among others. Another musical genre that has become widely popular during the 20th century in all areas of Vanuatu is known as string band music. It combines guitars, ukuleles, and popular songs. More recently, the music of Vanuatu, as an industry, grew rapidly in the 1990s, and several bands have emerged with a Ni-Vanuatu identity.[210] Popular genres of modern commercial music include zouk music and reggaeton. The cuisine of Vanuatu (aelan kakae) incorporates fish, root vegetables such as taro and yams, fruits, and vegetables. Most island families grow food in their gardens, and food shortages are rare. Papayas, pineapples, mangoes, plantains, and sweet potatoes are abundant through much of the year. Coconut milk and coconut cream are used to flavour many dishes. Most food is cooked using hot stones or through boiling and steaming; very little food is fried.[101] The national dish of Vanuatu is the laplap.[211] The most practised sport in Vanuatu is football. The top-flight league is the VFF National Super League. The Port Vila Football League is another competition. The island of Pentecost is known for its tradition of land diving, locally known as gol. The ritual consists of men land diving off a 98-foot-high wooden tower with their ankles tied to vines, as part of the annual yam harvest festival.[212][213] This local tradition is often credited to the inspiration of the modern practice of bungee jumping, which was developed in New Zealand in the 1980s.",

                "content": "Vanuatu is a country in the Pacific Ocean. The official languages of Vanuatu are Bislama, English and French. In 2020, 300,019 people lived in Vanuatu.[5] The capital of Vanuatu is Port Vila. The country was ruled as a colony by England and France. It got its independence in 1980.[7] During the colonial time, it was named the \"New Hebrides\" or \"Nouvelles Hebrides\". Evidence shows, that people lived in Vanuatu by 1300 BC.[8] Portuguese explorer Pedro Fernández de Quirós first discovered the islands in 1606. British explorer, navigator James Cook discovered the islands in 1774. Cook mapped the islands and named them New Hebrides.[9][8] Vanuatu is an island archipelago. It has about 82 small islands. The islands were made from volcanoes. People live on 65 of the islands. There is about 800 miles (1,300 km) north to south distance between the outermost islands. Two of the islands (Matthew and Hunter) are also claimed by France. Fourteen of Vanuatu's islands are larger than 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi). The highest point in Vanuatu is Mount Tabwemasana, at 1,879 metres (6,165 ft), on the island of Espiritu Santo. Even though it has tropical forests, Vanuatu has a small number of plant and animal species. There are no large mammals. The 19 species of native reptiles include the flowerpot snake, found only on Efate. The Fiji Banded Iguana (Brachylophus fasciatus) was introduced as a feral animal in the 1960s.[10][11] There are 11 species of bats and 61 species of land and water birds. The region is rich in sea life. There are more than 4,000 species of marine molluscs. Coneshell and stonefish carry poison that will kill humans. The giant East African land snail arrived only in the 1970s but already has spread from the Port-Vila region to Luganville. There are three or possibly four adult saltwater crocodiles living in Vanuatu's mangroves and no current breeding population.[11] It is said the crocodiles reach the northern part of the islands after cyclones. This is because of the island chain's closeness to the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, where crocodiles are very common.[12] The national dish of Vanuatu is the lap lap.[13] There are six provinces in Vanuatu. They are Malampa, Penama, Sanma, Shefa, Tafea and Torba. Some of the cities are:[14] Adele Willie is a sports commentator.",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Vanuatu, country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, consisting of a chain of 13 principal and many smaller islands located about 500 miles (800 km) west of Fiji and 1,100 miles (1,770 km) east of Australia. The islands extend north-south for some 400 miles (650 km) in an irregular Y shape. The Torres Islands are the northernmost group. Southward from the Torres group, the main islands are Vanua Lava and Santa Maria (Gaua) in the Banks Islands group, Espiritu Santo, Aoba (Ambae), Maéwo, Pentecost, Malakula, Ambrym, Épi, Éfaté, Erromango, Tanna, and Anatom. Some 200 miles (320 km) to the southeast of Anatom, two uninhabited islands, Hunter and Matthew, are claimed by both Vanuatu and France (as part of New Caledonia). Formerly the jointly administered Anglo-French condominium of the New Hebrides, Vanuatu achieved independence in 1980. The name Vanuatu means “Our Land Forever” in many of the locally used Melanesian languages. The capital, largest city, and commercial centre is Port-Vila (Vila), on Éfaté. A diverse relief—ranging from rugged mountains and high plateaus to rolling hills and low plateaus, with coastal terraces and offshore coral reefs—characterizes the islands. Sedimentary and coral limestones and volcanic rock predominate; frequent earthquakes indicate structural instability. Active volcanoes are found on several islands, including Séré’ama on Vanua Lava, Manaro on Aoba, Garet on Santa Maria, the twin volcanic vents of Benbow and Marum on Ambrym, and Yasur on Tanna. There are also several submarine volcanoes in the group, and some islands have solfataras or fumaroles. The highest point is Tabwémasana, 6,165 feet (1,879 metres), on Espiritu Santo, the largest island. There are two seasons—hot and wet from November to April, and cooler and drier from May to October. The southeast trades are the prevailing winds, although northerlies during the hot season provide most of the heavy rainfall. Annual precipitation varies from about 80 inches (2,000 mm) in the south to some 160 inches (4,000 mm) in the northern islands. Much of the group is covered by dense rain forest, but drier regions have patches of savanna grassland. Abundant bird and insect life contrasts with the sparse fauna. Of the approximately 10 types of bats found in Vanuatu, three are found only there. Vanuatu is also home to the estuarine crocodile. The indigenous population, called ni-Vanuatu, is overwhelmingly Melanesian, though some of the outlying islands have Polynesian populations. There are also small minorities of Europeans, Micronesians, Chinese, and Vietnamese. Roughly three-fourths of the population lives in rural areas, but since independence the urban centres of Luganville and Port-Vila have drawn a significant number of people attracted by better opportunities. More than 100 local Melanesian languages and dialects are spoken; Bislama, an English-based Melanesian pidgin, is the national language and, along with English and French, is one of three official languages. Some seven-tenths of the population is Protestant, Presbyterians constituting the largest denomination. Other religions include Roman Catholicism, traditional beliefs, and cargo cults. Subsistence agriculture has traditionally been the economic base of Vanuatu, together with an elaborate exchange network within and between islands. Economic changes occurred with the development of European plantations in the island group after 1867: cotton was the initial crop, followed by corn (maize), coffee, cocoa beans, and coconuts (for copra). Cattle ranching was instituted later. By the 1880s French planters had reversed the initial British domination of the plantation sector, though they too found it increasingly difficult to compete with ni-Vanuatu producers, who could fall back on subsistence agriculture in times of economic downturn. French hopes of economic hegemony, based on high world prices for copra and the importation of Vietnamese labour in the 1920s, were dashed by the Great Depression of the 1930s. By 1948 most of the copra in the island group was being produced by the ni-Vanuatu themselves, though it was not until the development of cooperatives in the 1970s that they were finally able to assume control of the trade. Kava, beef, copra, timber, and cocoa are the most important exports; Australia, New Caledonia, Japan, and New Zealand are the main export destinations. Imports—mainly of machinery and transport equipment, food and live animals, and mineral fuels—come principally from Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, and Fiji. Because of its vulnerability to weather and commodity market fluctuations, Vanuatu is working toward supplementing large-scale agriculture with stronger extractive, manufacturing, and service sectors to foster its long-term economic growth. Since independence, Vanuatu’s tourism and offshore financial services have emerged as the largest earners of foreign income. The growing lucre generated by tourism has attracted the attention of foreign companies seeking to develop land into resorts and other attractions. Although, according to the 1980 constitution, all land in Vanuatu is under ni-Vanuatu customary collective ownership and cannot be sold to foreigners, increasing interest from abroad in the late 20th and early 21st centuries prompted the government to allow land to be leased for 75-year periods. Such leases were often negotiated to the disadvantage of ni-Vanuatu, however; many included, for example, a provision that, at the end of the 75 years, the customary owners could regain their lands only by paying in full the cost of any development. In the early 21st century there was concern that such provisions would mean the permanent alienation of customarily owned lands. Forestry, important in the islands’ early colonial history but later eclipsed by plantation agriculture, has also grown in importance. Much of the country is forested (including areas of sandalwood and other valuable tropical species). Because the majority of trees felled during the 1980s were exported as unsawn logs, in the early 1990s the government banned exports of roundwood and limited the annual harvest. Earnings from processed wood (mostly sawn on small portable mills) grew as a result, and wood products accounted for a small but significant proportion of exports in the early 21st century. The sale of commercial fishing rights is another important source of foreign revenue, and there is extensive small-scale fishing for local consumption. Mining of manganese ore on Éfaté ended in the 1970s, but later surveys identified a number of remaining deposits there as well as the likely existence of exploitable gold, copper, and petroleum reserves elsewhere in the islands. On most of Vanuatu’s islands, unpaved roads link coastal settlements; there are few interior roads. Interisland transportation is by boat or airplane. Major airports are located near Port-Vila, near Luganville on Espiritu Santo, and on the northwest side of Tanna. Many smaller airfields are scattered throughout the islands.",

                "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger (/ˈʃwɔːrtsənɛɡər/ SHWORT-sə-neg-ər, Austrian German: [ˈarnɔlt ˈaːlɔʏs ˈʃvartsn̩ˌɛɡɐ] ⓘ; born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian and American actor, businessman, former politician, and former professional bodybuilder, known for his roles in high-profile action films. He served as the 38th governor of California from 2003 to 2011.[5] Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at age 15 and won the Mr. Universe title aged 20, and subsequently the Mr. Olympia title seven times. He is tied with Phil Heath for the joint-second number of all-time Mr. Olympia wins, behind Ronnie Coleman and Lee Haney, who are joint-first with eight wins each. Nicknamed the \"Austrian Oak\" in his bodybuilding days, he is regarded as one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time.[6][7] He has written books and articles about bodybuilding, including the autobiographical Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder (1977) and The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding (1998).[8][9] The Arnold Sports Festival, the second-most prestigious bodybuilding event after Mr. Olympia, is named after him.[10] He appeared in the bodybuilding documentary Pumping Iron (1977), which set him on his way to a career in films.[11] After retiring from bodybuilding, he gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action star, with his breakthrough in the sword and sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian (1982),[12] a box-office success with a sequel in 1984.[13] After playing the title character in the science fiction film The Terminator (1984), he starred in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and three other sequels. His other successful action films included Commando (1985), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), Total Recall (1990), and True Lies (1994), in addition to comedy films such as Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990) and Jingle All the Way (1996).[14] At the height of his career, Schwarzenegger was known for his rivalry with Sylvester Stallone.[15] He is the founder of the film production company Oak Productions.[16] As a registered member of the Republican Party, Schwarzenegger chaired the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports during most of the George H. W. Bush administration. In 2003, he was elected governor of California in a special recall election to replace Gray Davis, the governor at the time. He received 48.6 percent of the vote, 17 points ahead of the runner-up, Cruz Bustamante of the Democratic Party. He was sworn in on November 17 to serve the remainder of Davis' term, and was reelected in the 2006 gubernatorial election with an increased vote share of 55.9 percent to serve a full term.[17] In 2011 he reached his term limit as governor and returned to acting. Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born in Thal on July 30, 1947,[18] the second son of Gustav Schwarzenegger and his wife Aurelia (née Jadrny; 1922–1998). Gustav was the local chief of police, and after the Anschluss in 1938 joined the Nazi Party and in 1939 the Sturmabteilung (SA). In World War II, Gustav served as a military policeman in the invasions of Poland, France and the Soviet Union, including the siege of Leningrad, rising to the title of Hauptfeldwebel.[19][20] He was wounded in the Battle of Stalingrad,[21] and was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria. According to Holocaust scholar Michael Berenbaum, Gustav Schwarzenegger served \"in theaters of the war where atrocities were committed. But there is no way to know from the documents whether he played a role.\"[19] Gustav's background received wide press attention during the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election in which Schwarzenegger was elected.[22] Gustav married Aurelia on October 20, 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. According to Schwarzenegger, his parents were very strict: \"Back then in Austria it was a very different world ... if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared.\"[23] He grew up in a Catholic family.[24] Gustav preferred his elder son, Meinhard, over Arnold.[25] His favoritism was \"strong and blatant\", which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child.[26] Schwarzenegger says that his earliest childhood memory is of climbing into his parents' bed during a bad thunder-and-lightning storm and cuddling between his mother and father.[27] He has said, however, that his father had \"no patience for listening or understanding your problems\".[24] He had a good relationship with his mother, with whom he kept in touch until her death.[28] In an interview with Fortune in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what \"would now be called child abuse\" at the hands of his father: \"My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'You can't do this,' I said, 'This is not going to be for much longer because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'\"[20] At school, Schwarzenegger was reportedly academically average but stood out for his \"cheerful, good-humored, and exuberant\" character.[24] He struggled with reading and was later diagnosed as being dyslexic.[29][30] Money was a problem in their household; Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator.[26] His father Gustav was an athlete, and wished for his sons to become champions in Bavarian curling.[31] Influenced by his father, Schwarzenegger played several sports as a boy.[24] Schwarzenegger began weight training in 1960 when his football coach took his team to a local gym.[18] At age 14, he chose bodybuilding over football as a career.[13][32] He later said, \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.\"[23] However, his official website biography claims that \"at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.\"[33] During a speech in 2001, he said, \"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.\"[34] Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see films with bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves and Johnny Weissmuller.[23] When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: \"As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.\" In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz.[18] He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends to train even when it was closed. \"It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.\" When asked about his first cinema experience as a boy, he replied: \"I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie.\"[23] In Graz, he was mentored by Alfred Gerstl, who had Jewish ancestry and later became president of the Federal Council, and befriended his son Karl.[35][36] Schwarzenegger's brother, Meinhard, died in a car crash on May 20, 1971.[18] He was driving drunk and died instantly. Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral. Meinhard was engaged to Erika Knapp, and they had a three-year-old son named Patrick. Schwarzenegger paid for Patrick's education and helped him to move to the U.S.[26] Schwarzenegger's father, Gustav, died of a stroke on December 13, 1972.[18] In Pumping Iron, Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later, he and the film's producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder to show the extremes some would go to for their sport and to make Schwarzenegger's image colder to create controversy for the film.[37] However, Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, recalled that he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother.[38] Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father's funeral.[26] Schwarzenegger served in the Austrian Army in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males.[18][33] During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest.[32] He went AWOL during basic training so he could take part in the competition and then spent a week in military prison: \"Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences.\" He entered another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirerhof Hotel, where he placed second. He was voted \"best-built man of Europe\", which made him famous in bodybuilding circles. \"The Mr. Universe title was my ticket to America—the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich.\"[34] Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the NABBA Mr. Universe competition in London.[33] He placed second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner Chester Yorton.[33] Charles \"Wag\" Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving his. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary English.[39][40] Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: \"Being with them made me so much more sophisticated. When you're the age I was then, you're always looking for approval, for love, for attention and also for guidance. At the time, I wasn't really aware of that. But now, looking back, I see that the Bennett family fulfilled all those needs. Especially my need to be the best in the world. To be recognized and to feel unique and special. They saw that I needed that care and attention and love.\"[41] Also in 1966, at Bennett's home, Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol Reg Park, who became his friend and mentor.[41][42] The training paid off and, in 1967, Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at age 20.[33] He would go on to win the title another three times.[32] He then returned to Munich, where he attended business school and worked at Rolf Putziger's gym, where he worked and trained from 1966 to 1968 before returning to London in 1968 to win his next Mr. Universe title.[33] He frequently told Roger C. Field, his English coach and friend in Munich at the time, \"I'm going to become the greatest actor!\"[43] Schwarzenegger, who dreamed of moving to the US since age ten, and saw bodybuilding as his avenue of opportunity,[44] realized his dream by moving to the US in October 1968 at age 21, speaking little English.[32][18] There he trained at Gold's Gym in Venice, Los Angeles, California, under Joe Weider's supervision. From 1970 to 1974, one of Schwarzenegger's weight training partners was Ric Drasin, a professional wrestler who designed the original Gold's Gym logo in 1973.[45] Schwarzenegger also became good friends with professional wrestler Superstar Billy Graham. In 1970, at age 23, Schwarzenegger captured his first Mr. Olympia title in New York, and would go on to win the title seven times.[33] The immigration law firm Siskind & Susser has stated that Schwarzenegger may have been an illegal immigrant at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s because of violations in the terms of his visa.[46] LA Weekly said in 2002 that Schwarzenegger was \"the most famous US immigrant\", who \"overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s\".[44] In 1977, Schwarzenegger's autobiography and weight-training guide, Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder, was a huge success.[18] In 1977, he posed for the gay magazine After Dark.[47][48] After taking an assortment of courses at Santa Monica College in California (including English classes), as well as further upper division classes at the University of California, Los Angeles as part of UCLA's extension program, he accumulated enough credits to be \"within striking distance\" of graduation. In 1979, he enrolled in the University of Wisconsin–Superior as a distance education student, completing most of his coursework by correspondence and flying out to Superior to meet professors and take final exams. In May 1980, he formally graduated and earned his bachelor's degree in business administration and marketing. He received his United States citizenship in 1983.[49] He received an honorary degree from Stockton University in 2023.[50] Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding,[10] and his legacy is commemorated in the Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows. For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines Muscle & Fitness and Flex. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California.[51] Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005.[51] American Media Inc., which owns Muscle & Fitness and Flex, announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.[51] One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.[18] He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.[18][33] He would go on to compete in many bodybuilding contests, and win most of them. His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe wins (4 – NABBA [England], 1 – IFBB [USA]), and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until Lee Haney won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991. Schwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 Arnold Classic he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.[52] During Schwarzenegger's early years in bodybuilding, he also competed in several Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting contests. Schwarzenegger's first professional competition was in 1963[53] and he won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968.[4] In 1967, Schwarzenegger won the Munich stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254 kg / 560 lb) is lifted between the legs while standing on two footrests. Schwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming Mr. Olympia.[18][33] His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion Sergio Oliva. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.[33] He continued his winning streak in the 1971–1974 competitions.[33] He also toured different countries selling vitamins, as in Helsinki, Finland in 1972, when he lived at the YMCA Hotel Hospiz (nowadays Hotel Arthur[56]) on Vuorikatu and presented vitamin pills at the Stockmann shopping center.[57][58] In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time,[33] beating Franco Columbu. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.[33] Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete and film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called Pumping Iron. Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film Stay Hungry with Jeff Bridges. Although significantly taller and heavier, Lou Ferrigno proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia. Schwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia.[18] Schwarzenegger was training for his role in Conan, and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide color commentary for network television when he announced at the eleventh hour that, while he was there, \"Why not compete?\" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. Having been declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition. This victory (subject of the documentary The Comeback) was highly controversial, though, as fellow competitors and many observers felt that his lack of muscle mass (especially in his thighs) and subpar conditioning should have precluded him from winning against a very competitive lineup that year.[10][59] Mike Mentzer, in particular, felt cheated and withdrew from competitive bodybuilding after that contest.[60][59] Schwarzenegger has acknowledged using performance-enhancing anabolic steroids while they were legal, writing in 1977 that \"steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when cutting up.\"[64] He has called the drugs \"tissue building\".[65] In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted his early death on the basis of a link between his steroid use and later heart problems. Since the doctor never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a US$10,000 libel judgment against him in a German court.[66] In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with Globe, a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health.[67] Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the title role in Hercules in New York (1970). Credited under the stage name \"Arnold Strong\", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production.[32] His second film appearance was as a mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: \"It was very difficult for me in the beginning – I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance.\"[23] Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the bodybuilding film Pumping Iron (1977),[13][32] elements of which were dramatized. In 1991, he purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography.[68] In 1977, he made guest appearances in single episodes of the ABC sitcom The San Pedro Beach Bums and the ABC police procedural The Streets of San Francisco. Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of The Incredible Hulk, but did not win the role because of his height. Later, Lou Ferrigno got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with Kirk Douglas and Ann-Margret in the 1979 comedy The Villain. In 1980, he starred in a biographical film of the 1950s actress Jayne Mansfield as Mansfield's husband, Mickey Hargitay. Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the sword and sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian in 1982, which was a box-office hit.[13] This was followed by a sequel, Conan the Destroyer, in 1984, although it was not as successful as its predecessor.[69] In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video Carnival in Rio.[70] In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character in James Cameron's science fiction action film The Terminator.[13][32][71] It has been called his acting career's signature role.[72] Following this, Schwarzenegger made another sword and sorcery film, Red Sonja, in 1985.[69] During the 1980s, audiences had an appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone becoming international stars.[32] During the Schwarzenegger-Stallone rivalry they attacked each other in the press, and tried to surpass the other with more on-screen killings and larger weapons.[73] Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his sense of humor, separating him from more serious action hero films. He made a number of successful action films in the 1980s, such as Commando (1985), Raw Deal (1986), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), and Red Heat (1988). Twins (1988), a comedy with Danny DeVito, also proved successful. Total Recall (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10 million (equivalent to $23.3 million today) and 15% of the film's gross. A science fiction script, the film was based on the Philip K. Dick short story \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\". Kindergarten Cop (1990) reunited him with director Ivan Reitman, who directed him in Twins. Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing, first with a 1990 episode of the TV series Tales from the Crypt, \"The Switch\",[74] and then with the 1992 telemovie Christmas in Connecticut.[75] He has not directed since. Schwarzenegger's commercial peak was his return as the title character in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), which was the highest-grossing film of the year. Film critic Roger Ebert commented that \"Schwarzenegger's genius as a movie star is to find roles that build on, rather than undermine, his physical and vocal characteristics.\"[76] In 1993, the National Association of Theatre Owners named him the \"International Star of the Decade\".[18] His next film project, the 1993 self-aware action comedy spoof Last Action Hero, was released opposite Jurassic Park, and did not do well at the box office. His next film, the comedy drama True Lies (1994), was a popular spy film and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron. That same year, the comedy Junior was released, the last of Schwarzenegger's three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito. This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. It was followed by the action thriller Eraser (1996), the Christmas comedy Jingle All The Way (1996), and the comic book-based Batman & Robin (1997), in which he played the supervillain Mr. Freeze. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of Batman & Robin, his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller End of Days (1999), later followed by the action films The 6th Day (2000) and Collateral Damage (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003, he made his third appearance as the title character in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, which went on to earn over $150 million domestically (equivalent to $248 million today).[77] In tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a 25-meter-tall (80 ft) Terminator statue in a park in central Graz. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the Special Olympics.[78] His film appearances after becoming Governor of California included a three-second cameo appearance in The Rundown and the 2004 remake of Around the World in 80 Days. In 2005, he appeared as himself in the film The Kid & I. He voiced Baron von Steuben in the Liberty's Kids episode \"Valley Forge\". He had been rumored to be appearing in Terminator Salvation as the original T-800; he denied his involvement,[79] but he ultimately did appear briefly via his image being inserted into the movie from stock footage of the first Terminator film.[80][81] Schwarzenegger appeared in Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables (2010), where he made a cameo appearance. In January 2011, just weeks after leaving office in California, Schwarzenegger announced that he was reading several new scripts for future films, one of them being the World War II action drama With Wings as Eagles, written by Randall Wallace, based on a true story.[82][83] On March 6, 2011, at the Arnold Seminar of the Arnold Classic, Schwarzenegger revealed that he was being considered for several films, including sequels to The Terminator and remakes of Predator and The Running Man, and that he was \"packaging\" a comic book character.[84] The character was later revealed to be the Governator, star of the comic book and animated series of the same name. Schwarzenegger inspired the character and co-developed it with Stan Lee, who would have produced the series. Schwarzenegger would have voiced the Governator.[85][86][87][88] On May 20, 2011, Schwarzenegger's entertainment counsel announced that all film projects currently in development were being halted: \"Schwarzenegger is focusing on personal matters and is not willing to commit to any production schedules or timelines.\"[89] On July 11, 2011, it was announced that Schwarzenegger was considering a comeback film, despite legal problems related to his divorce.[90] He starred in The Expendables 2 (2012) as Trench Mauser,[91] and starred in The Last Stand (2013), his first leading role in 10 years, and Escape Plan (2013), his first co-starring role alongside Sylvester Stallone. He starred in Sabotage, released in March 2014, and returned as Trench Mauser in The Expendables 3, released in August 2014. He starred in the fifth Terminator film Terminator Genisys in 2015.[13][32][71][92] He then planned to reprise his role as Conan the Barbarian in The Legend of Conan,[93][94] later renamed Conan the Conqueror. [95] However, in April 2017, producer Chris Morgan stated that Universal had dropped the project, although there was a possibility of a TV show. The story of the film was supposed to be set 30 years after the first, with some inspiration from Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.[96] In September 2015, the media announced that Schwarzenegger was to replace Donald Trump as host of The New Celebrity Apprentice.[97] This show, the 15th season of The Apprentice, aired during the 2016–2017 TV season. In the show, he used the phrases \"you're terminated\" and \"get to the choppa\", which are quotes from some of his famous roles (The Terminator and Predator, respectively), when firing the contestants.[98][99] In March 2017, following repeated criticisms from Trump, Schwarzenegger announced that he would not return for another season on the show. He also reacted to Trump's remarks in January 2017 via Instagram: \"Hey, Donald, I have a great idea. Why don't we switch jobs? You take over TV because you're such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job, and then people can finally sleep comfortably again.\"[100] In August 2016, his filming of action-comedy Killing Gunther was temporarily interrupted by bank robbers near the filming location in Surrey, British Columbia.[101] The film was released in September 2017. He was announced to star and produce in a film about the ruins of Sanxingdui called The Guest of Sanxingdui as an ambassador.[102] On February 6, 2018, Amazon Studios announced they were working with Schwarzenegger to develop a new series, Outrider, in which he will star and executive produce. The western-drama set in the Oklahoma Indian Territory in the late 19th century will follow a deputy (portrayed by Schwarzenegger) who is tasked with apprehending a legendary outlaw in the wilderness, but is forced to partner with a ruthless Federal Marshal to make sure justice is properly served. The series would also mark as Schwarzenegger's first major scripted TV role.[103] Schwarzenegger returned to the Terminator franchise with Terminator: Dark Fate, which was released on November 1, 2019. It was produced by the series' co-creator James Cameron, who directed him previously in the first two films in the series and in True Lies.[104][105] It was shot in Almería, Hungary and the US.[106] Schwarzenegger has been a registered Republican for many years. When he was an actor, his political views were always well known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a left-wing and Democratic-leaning community. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained that he was a Republican because he believed the Democrats of the 1960s sounded too much like Austrian socialists.[107] I finally arrived here in 1968. What a special day it was. I remember I arrived here with empty pockets but full of dreams, full of determination, full of desire. The presidential campaign was in full swing. I remember watching the Nixon–Humphrey presidential race on TV. A friend of mine who spoke German and English translated for me. I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism, which I had just left. But then I heard Nixon speak. He was talking about free enterprise, getting the government off your back, lowering the taxes and strengthening the military. Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air. I said to my friend, I said, \"What party is he?\" My friend said, \"He's a Republican.\" I said, \"Then I am a Republican.\" And I have been a Republican ever since. In 1985, Schwarzenegger appeared in \"Stop the Madness\", an anti-drug music video sponsored by the Reagan administration. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the 1988 presidential election, accompanying then–Vice President George H. W. Bush at a campaign rally.[108] Schwarzenegger famously introduced the first episode of the 1990 Milton Friedman hosted PBS series Free to Choose stating: I truly believe that the series has changed my life, and when you have such a powerful experience as that, I think you shouldn't keep it to yourself, so I wanted to share it with you. Being 'free to choose' for me means being free to make your own decisions, free to live your own life, pursue your own goals, chase your own rainbow without the government breathing down on your neck or standing on your shoes. For me that meant coming here to America, because I came from a socialistic country where the government controls the economy. It's a place where you can hear 18-year-old kids already talking about their pension. But me, I wanted more. I wanted to be the best. Individualism like that is incompatible with socialism. So I felt I had to come to America.[109][110] Schwarzenegger goes on to tell of how he and his then wife Maria Shriver were in Palm Springs preparing to play a game of mixed doubles when Milton Friedman's famous show came on the television. Schwarzenegger recalls that while watching Friedman's Free to Choose, Schwarzenegger, \"...recognized Friedman from the study of my own degree in economics, but I didn't know I was watching Free to Choose... it knocked me out. Dr. Friedman expressed, validated and explained everything I ever thought or experienced or observed about the way the economy works, and I guess I was really ready to hear it.\"[110] Numerous critics state that Schwarzenegger strayed from much of Friedman's economic ways of thinking in later years, especially upon being elected Governor of California from 2003 through 2011.[111][112] Schwarzenegger's first political appointment was as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, on which he served from 1990 to 1993.[18] He was nominated by the then-President Bush, who dubbed him \"Conan the Republican\". He later served as chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor Pete Wilson. Between 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a Red Cross ambassador (a ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television and radio public service announcements to donate blood. In an interview with Talk magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, \"I think about it many times. The possibility is there because I feel it inside.\" The Hollywood Reporter claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for governor of California. Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, \"I'm in show business – I am in the middle of my career. Why would I go away from that and jump into something else?\"[113] Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the 2003 California recall election for Governor of California on the August 6, 2003, episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.[32] Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the \"Governator\" (referring to The Terminator movies, see above) and \"The Running Man\" (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election \"Total Recall\" (another movie starring Schwarzenegger). Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.[114] On October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor Gray Davis being removed from office with 55.4% of the Yes vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat Cruz Bustamante, fellow Republican Tom McClintock, and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3 million votes. Under the regulations of the California Constitution, no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the second foreign-born governor of California after Irish-born Governor John G. Downey in 1862. Schwarzenegger is a moderate Republican.[115] He says he is fiscally conservative and socially liberal.[116] On the issue of abortion, he describes himself as pro-choice, but supports parental notification for minors and a ban on partial-birth abortion.[117] He has supported gay rights, such as domestic partnerships, and he performed a same-sex marriage as governor.[118] However, Schwarzenegger vetoed bills that would have legalized same-sex marriage in California in 2005 and 2007.[119][120] He additionally vetoed two bills that would have implemented a single-payer health care system in California in 2006[121][122] and 2008,[123] respectively. Schwarzenegger was entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up political gridlock. Building on a catchphrase from the sketch \"Hans and Franz\" from Saturday Night Live (which partly parodied his bodybuilding career), Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians \"girlie men\".[124] Schwarzenegger's early victories included repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses from being given out to illegal immigrants, but later he began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a special election he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He later commented that \"no one could win if the opposition raised 160 million dollars to defeat you\". The U.S. Supreme Court later found the public employee unions' use of compulsory fundraising during the campaign had been illegal in Knox v. Service Employees International Union, Local 1000.[125] Schwarzenegger, against the advice of fellow Republican strategists, appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff. He gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election. Schwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democrat Phil Angelides, the California State Treasurer, in the 2006 elections, held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over 1 million votes.[126] Around this time, many commentators saw Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the center of the political spectrum. After hearing a speech by Schwarzenegger at the 2006 Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast, in which Schwarzenegger said, in part \"How wrong I was when I said everyone has an equal opportunity to make it in America ... the state of California does not provide [equal] education for all of our children\", San Francisco mayor and future governor of California Gavin Newsom said: \"He's becoming a Democrat ... He's running back, not even to the center. I would say center-left.\"[127] Some speculated that Schwarzenegger might run for the United States Senate in 2010, as his governorship would be term-limited by that time. Such rumors turned out to be false.[128][129] Wendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and bodybuilding as the means to escape a depressing home.[25] Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, \"I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential – I was always fascinated by people in control of other people.\"[25] Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, \"I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes.\"[44] Eunice Kennedy Shriver was the sister of John F. Kennedy, and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger cannot run for U.S. president as he is not a natural-born citizen of the United States. Schwarzenegger is a dual Austrian and United States citizen.[130] He has held Austrian citizenship since birth and U.S. citizenship since becoming naturalized in 1983. Being Austrian and thus European, he was able to win the 2007 European Voice campaigner of the year award for taking action against climate change with the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and plans to introduce an emissions trading scheme with other US states and possibly with the EU.[131] Because of his personal wealth from his acting career, Schwarzenegger did not accept his governor's salary of $175,000 per year.[132] Schwarzenegger's endorsement in the Republican primaries of the 2008 presidential election was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates Rudy Giuliani and Senator John McCain, Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, \"It's Rudy's fault!\" (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind). Schwarzenegger's endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain's campaign; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy.[133] In its April 2010 report, Progressive ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Schwarzenegger one of 11 \"worst governors\" in the United States because of various ethics issues throughout Schwarzenegger's term as governor.[134][135] Governor Schwarzenegger played a significant role in opposing Proposition 66, a proposed amendment of the Californian Three Strikes Law, in November 2004. This amendment would have required the third felony to be either violent or serious to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence. In the last week before the ballot, Schwarzenegger launched an intense campaign[136] against Proposition 66.[137] He stated that \"it would release 26,000 dangerous criminals and rapists\".[138] Although he began his tenure as governor with record high approval ratings (as high as 65% in May 2004),[139] he left office with a near-record low 23%,[140] only one percent higher than that of Gray Davis, his predecessor, when he was recalled in October 2003.[141] In May 2010, Esteban Núñez pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the death of Luis Santos. Núñez is the son of Fabian Núñez, then California Assembly Speaker of the House and a close friend and staunch political ally of then governor Schwarzenegger.[142][143][144][145] As a personal favor to \"a friend\", just hours before he left office, and as one of his last official acts, Schwarzenegger commuted Núñez's sentence by more than half, to seven years.[144][146][147] He believed that Núñez's sentence was \"excessive\" in comparison with the same prison term imposed on Ryan Jett, the man who fatally stabbed Santos.[148] Against protocol, Schwarzenegger did not inform Santos' family or the San Diego County prosecutors about the commutation. They learned about it in a call from a reporter.[147] The Santos family, along with the San Diego district attorney, sued to stop the commutation, claiming that it violated Marsy's Law. In September 2012, Sacramento County superior court judge Lloyd Connelly stated, \"Based on the evidentiary records before this court involving this case, there was an abuse of discretion... This was a distasteful commutation. It was repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state.\" However, Connelly ruled that Schwarzenegger remained within his executive powers as governor.[142] Subsequently, as a direct result of the way the commutation was handled, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bipartisan bill that allows offenders' victims and their families to be notified at least 10 days before any commutations.[149] Núñez was released from prison after serving less than six years.[150] During his initial campaign for governor in 2003, allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger.[151] Within the last five days before the election, news reports appeared in the Los Angeles Times recounting decades-old allegations of sexual misconduct from six individual women.[152][151] Schwarzenegger responded to the allegations in 2004 admitting that he has \"behaved badly sometimes\" and apologized, but also stated that \"a lot of [what] you see in the stories is not true\".[153] One of the women who came forward was British television personality Anna Richardson, who settled a libel lawsuit in August 2006 against Schwarzenegger; his top aide, Sean Walsh; and his publicist, Sheryl Main.[154] A joint statement read: \"The parties are content to put this matter behind them and are pleased that this legal dispute has now been settled.\"[154][155] In 2023, Schwarzenegger revisited the issue while promoting his new three-part biographical documentary on Netflix called Arnold. Schwarzenegger stated that he was \"totally wrong\".[156] During this time a 1977 interview in adult magazine Oui gained attention, in which Schwarzenegger discussed using substances such as marijuana.[157] Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. Olympia in 1975 in the documentary film Pumping Iron (1977). In an interview with GQ magazine in October 2007, Schwarzenegger said, \"[Marijuana] is not a drug. It's a leaf. My drug was pumping iron, trust me.\"[158] His spokesperson later said the comment was meant to be a joke.[158] Schwarzenegger became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 17, 1983.[159] Shortly before he gained his citizenship, he asked the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his Austrian citizenship, as Austria does not usually allow dual citizenship. His request was granted, and he retained his Austrian citizenship.[160] In 2005, Peter Pilz, a member of the Austrian Parliament from the Austrian Green Party, unsuccessfully advocated for Parliament to revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship under Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act, which states: \"A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic.\". Pilz felt that Schwarzenegger's decision not to intervene in the executions of Donald Beardslee and Stanley Williams had done so.[130] The death penalty in Austria had been abolished in 1968. On September 27, 2006, Schwarzenegger signed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, creating the nation's first cap on greenhouse gas emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries, and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.[161] Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006, allowing California to work with the Northeast's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the number of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan took effect in 2009.[162] In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his Hummers to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home.[163] In respect for his contribution to the direction of the US motor industry, Schwarzenegger was invited to open the 2009 SAE World Congress in Detroit on April 20, 2009.[164] In 2011, Schwarzenegger founded the R20 Regions of Climate Action to develop a sustainable, low-carbon economy.[165] In 2017, he joined French President Emmanuel Macron in calling for the adoption of a Global Pact for the Environment.[166] In 2017, Schwarzenegger launched the Austrian World Summit,[167] an international climate conference that is held annually in Vienna, Austria. The Austrian World Summit is organized by the Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative and aims is to bring together representatives from politics, civil society and business to create a broad alliance for climate protection and to identify concrete solutions to the climate crisis. Presidential aspirations by the Austrian-born Schwarzenegger would be blocked by a constitutional hurdle; Article II, Section I, Clause V, prevents individuals who are not natural-born citizens of the United States from assuming the office. The Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment in 2003 was widely accredited as the \"Amend for Arnold\" bill, which would have added an amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing his run. In 2004, the \"Amend for Arnold\" campaign was launched, featuring a website and TV advertising promotion.[168][169] In June 2007, Schwarzenegger was featured on the cover of Time magazine with Michael Bloomberg, and subsequently, the two joked about a presidential ticket together.[170][171] Schwarzenegger has also enjoyed a highly successful business career.[25][44] Following his move to the United States, Schwarzenegger became a \"prolific goal setter\" and would write his objectives at the start of the year on index cards, like starting a mail order business or buying a new car – and succeed in doing so.[38] As a result of his early business and investment success, Schwarzenegger became a millionaire by the age of 25, well before making a name for himself in Hollywood. His path to financial independence came as a result of his success as a proactive businessman and investor involved with a series of lucrative business ventures and real estate investments.[172] In 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder Franco Columbu started a bricklaying business. The business flourished thanks to the pair's marketing savvy and an increased demand following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.[173][174] When signs of profitability emerged as business began to pick up, Schwarzenegger and Columbu rolled over the profits from their bricklaying venture to go on and start their own mail-order business that sold bodybuilding and fitness-related equipment and instructional tapes.[18][173] Schwarzenegger transferred profits from the mail-order business and his bodybuilding-competition winnings by rolling the proceeds into his first real estate investment: an apartment building he purchased for $10,000. Schwarzenegger made millions of dollars by investing in a variety of real estate holding companies both within the United States and around the world.[175][176] Schwarzenegger and fellow Hollywood veteran actor and industry adversary Sylvester Stallone brought their long-storied industry rivalry to an end by both investing in the Planet Hollywood[73] chain of international theme restaurants (modeled after the Hard Rock Cafe) along with Bruce Willis and Demi Moore. However, Schwarzenegger severed his financial ties with the chain in early 2000.[177][178] Schwarzenegger remarked that the restaurant did not achieve the success that he had hoped for, claiming he wanted to focus his attention on \"new US global business ventures\" and his then-burgeoning acting career.[177] Schwarzenegger also made a private commercial real estate investment in the Easton Town Center, a shopping mall based in Columbus, Ohio.[179] He has talked about some of the mentors who have helped him over the years in business: \"I couldn't have learned about business without a parade of teachers guiding me... from Milton Friedman to Donald Trump... and now, Les Wexner and Warren Buffett. I even learned a thing or two from Planet Hollywood, such as when to get out! And I did!\"[34] He has significant equity ownership in Dimensional Fund Advisors, an Austin-based investment firm.[180] Schwarzenegger is also the owner of Arnold's Sports Festival, a sports and fitness festival which he started in 1989 and is held annually in Columbus, Ohio. It is a festival that hosts thousands of international health and fitness professionals which has also expanded into a three-day expo. He also owns a film production company called Oak Productions, Inc. and Fitness Publications, a joint book publishing venture partnered with Simon & Schuster.[181] In 2018, Schwarzenegger partnered with basketball player LeBron James to establish Ladder, a company that developed nutritional supplements to help athletes with severe cramps. The pair sold Ladder to Openfit for an undisclosed amount in 2020 after reporting more than $4 million in sales for that year.[182] In 1992, Schwarzenegger and his wife opened a restaurant in Santa Monica called Schatzi On Main. Schatzi literally means \"little treasure\", and colloquially \"honey\" or \"darling\" in German. In 1998, he sold his restaurant.[183] In 2024, Forbes estimated that Schwarzenegger was a billionaire.[184] In June 1997, Schwarzenegger spent $38 million on a private Gulfstream jet.[185] Regarding his private fortune, Schwarzenegger once quipped: \"Money doesn't make you happy. I now have $50 million, but I was just as happy when I had $48 million.\"[25] In 2003, Schwarzenegger's net worth was conservatively estimated at $100 million to $200 million.[186] After separating from his wife, Maria Shriver, in 2011, it was estimated that his net worth had been approximately $400 million, and even as high as $800 million, based on tax returns he filed in 2006.[187] Schwarzenegger has also appeared in a series of commercials for the Machine Zone game Mobile Strike as a military commander and spokesman.[188] In 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher with whom he lived until 1974.[189] The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S. Their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television.[38] They shared an apartment in Santa Monica, California, for three and a half years, and having little money, they would visit the beach all day or have barbecues in the back yard.[38] Although Baker claims that when she first met Schwarzenegger, he had \"little understanding of polite society\" and she found him a turn-off, she says, \"He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be—he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive ... I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me.\"[38] Schwarzenegger said of Baker in his 1977 memoir, \"Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life.\"[189] Baker has described Schwarzenegger as a \"joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic\" but claims that towards the end of the relationship he became \"insufferable—classically conceited—the world revolved around him\".[190] Baker published her memoir in 2006, Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak.[191] Although Baker painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover at times, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours.[191] Baker claims that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life.[191] Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ.[191] Schwarzenegger met his next lover, Beverly Hills hairdresser's assistant Sue Moray, on Venice Beach in July 1977. According to Moray, the couple led an open relationship: \"We were faithful when we were both in LA... but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted.\"[26] Schwarzenegger met television journalist Maria Shriver, niece of President John F. Kennedy, at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977. He went on to have a relationship with both Moray and Shriver until August 1978 when Moray (who knew of his relationship with Shriver) issued an ultimatum.[26] On April 26, 1986, Schwarzenegger married Shriver in Hyannis, Massachusetts.[192] They have four children: Katherine (* 1989), Christina (* 1991), Patrick (* 1993) and Christopher (* 1997).[193][194][195][196] All of their children were born in Los Angeles.[197] The family lived in an 11,000-square-foot (1,000 m2) home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California,[198][199] with vacation homes in Sun Valley, Idaho, and Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.[200] They attended St. Monica's Catholic Church.[201] On May 9, 2011, Shriver and Schwarzenegger ended their relationship after 25 years of marriage with Shriver moving out of their Brentwood mansion.[202][203][204] Pursuant to the divorce judgment, Schwarzenegger kept the Brentwood home, while Shriver purchased a new home nearby so that the children could travel between their parents' homes. They shared custody of the two youngest children.[205] Schwarzenegger came under fire after the initial petition did not include spousal support and a reimbursement of attorney's fees.[93] However, he claims this was not intentional and that he signed the initial documents without having properly read them.[93] He filed amended divorce papers remedying this.[93][206] Schwarzenegger and Shriver finalized their divorce in 2021, ten years after separating.[207] In June 2022, a jury ruled that Maria Shriver was entitled to half of her ex-husband's post-divorce savings that he earned from 1986 to 2011, including a pension.[208] On May 16, 2011, the Los Angeles Times revealed that Schwarzenegger had fathered a son, Joseph, more than 14 years earlier with an employee in their household, Mildred Patricia \"Patty\" Baena.[209][210][211] \"After leaving the governor's office I told my wife about this event, which occurred over a decade ago,\" Schwarzenegger said to the Times. In the statement, Schwarzenegger did not mention that he had confessed to his wife only after she had confronted him with the information, which she had done after confirming with the housekeeper what she had suspected about the child.[212] Baena is of Guatemalan origin. She was employed by the family for 20 years and retired in January 2011.[213] The pregnant Baena was working in the home while Shriver was pregnant with the youngest of the couple's four children.[214] Baena's son with Schwarzenegger was born five days after Shriver gave birth.[215][216] Schwarzenegger said that it took seven or eight years before he found out that he had fathered a child with his housekeeper. It was not until the boy \"started looking like [him] ... that [he] put things together\".[217] Schwarzenegger has taken financial responsibility for the child \"from the start and continued to provide support\".[218] KNX 1070 radio reported that, in 2010, he bought a new four-bedroom house with a pool for Baena and their son in Bakersfield, California.[219] Baena separated from her husband, Rogelio, a few months after Joseph's birth. She filed for divorce in 2008.[220] Rogelio said that the child's birth certificate was falsified and that he planned to sue Schwarzenegger for engaging in conspiracy to falsify a public document, a serious crime in California.[221] When asked in January 2014, \"Of all the things you are famous for ... which are you least proud of?\" Schwarzenegger replied, \"I'm least proud of the mistakes I made that caused my family pain and split us up.\"[222][223][224][225] Schwarzenegger was born with a bicuspid aortic valve, an aortic valve with only two leaflets, where a normal aortic valve has three.[226][227] He opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made from his own pulmonary valve, which itself was replaced with a cadaveric pulmonic valve, in a Ross procedure; medical experts predicted he would require pulmonic heart valve replacement surgery within the next two to eight years because his valve would progressively degrade. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available at the time of his surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.[228] On March 29, 2018, Schwarzenegger underwent emergency open-heart surgery for replacement of his replacement pulmonic valve.[229] He said about his recovery: \"I underwent open-heart surgery this spring, I had to use a walker. I had to do breathing exercises five times a day to retrain my lungs. I was frustrated and angry, and in my worst moments, I couldn't see the way back to my old self.\"[230] In 2020, 23 years after his first surgery, Schwarzenegger underwent a surgery for a new aortic valve.[231] On December 9, 2001, he broke six ribs and was hospitalized for four days after a motorcycle crash in Los Angeles.[232] Schwarzenegger saved a drowning man in 2004 while on vacation in Hawaii by swimming out and bringing him back to shore.[233] On January 8, 2006, while Schwarzenegger was riding his Harley-Davidson motorcycle in Los Angeles with his son Patrick in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on, causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed, Schwarzenegger sustained an injury to his lip requiring 15 stitches. \"No citations were issued,\" said Officer Jason Lee, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman.[234] Schwarzenegger did not obtain his motorcycle license until July 3, 2006.[235] Schwarzenegger tripped over his ski pole and broke his right femur while skiing in Sun Valley, Idaho, with his family on December 23, 2006.[236] On December 26, he underwent a 90-minute operation in which cables and screws were used to wire the broken bone back together. He was released from St. Johns Hospital and Health Center on December 30, 2006.[237] Schwarzenegger's private jet made an emergency landing at Van Nuys Airport on June 19, 2009, after the pilot reported smoke coming from the cockpit, according to a statement released by his press secretary. No one was harmed in the incident.[238] On May 18, 2019, while on a visit to South Africa, Schwarzenegger was attacked and dropkicked from behind by an unknown malefactor while giving autographs to his fans at one of the local schools. Despite the surprise and unprovoked nature of the attack, he reportedly suffered no injuries and continued to interact with fans. The attacker was apprehended and Schwarzenegger declined to press charges against him.[239][240][241] Schwarzenegger was involved in a multi-vehicle collision on the afternoon of Friday, January 21, 2022. Schwarzenegger was driving a black GMC Yukon SUV near the intersections of Sunset Boulevard and Allenford Avenue in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, when his vehicle collided with a red Toyota Prius. The driver of the Prius was transported to the hospital for injuries sustained to her head. Schwarzenegger was uninjured.[242][243][244] Schwarzenegger's official height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) has been brought into question by several articles. During his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, it was claimed that he measured 6 ft 1.5 in (1.867 m). However, in 1988, both the Daily Mail and Time Out magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter.[245] Prior to running for governor, Schwarzenegger's height was once again questioned in an article by the Chicago Reader.[246] As governor, Schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman Herb Wesson over their heights. At one point, Wesson made an unsuccessful attempt to, in his own words, \"settle this once and for all and find out how tall he is\" by using a tailor's tape measure on the Governor.[247] Schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the words \"Need a lift?\" on the five-foot-five-inch (1.65 m) Wesson's chair before a negotiating session in his office.[248] Democrat Bob Mulholland also claimed Schwarzenegger was 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) and that he wore risers in his boots.[249] In 1999, Men's Health magazine stated his height was 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m).[250] Schwarzenegger's autobiography, Total Recall, was released in October 2012. He devotes one chapter called \"The Secret\" to his extramarital affair. The majority of his book is about his successes in the three major chapters in his life: bodybuilder, actor, and Governor of California.[251] Schwarzenegger released a second book in 2023 titled Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life, which features life advice and again touches on his life experiences. Growing up during Allied-occupied Austria, Schwarzenegger commonly saw heavy military vehicles such as tanks as a child.[252] As a result, he paid $20,000 to bring his Austrian Army M47 Patton tank (331) to the United States,[253] which he previously operated during his mandatory service in 1965. However, he later obtained his vehicle in 1991/2,[254] during his tenure as the Chairmen of the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition,[255] and now uses it to support his charity.[254] His first car ever was an Opel Kadett in 1969 after serving in the Austrian army, then he rode a Harley-Davidson Fat Boy in 1991.[256] Moreover, he came to develop an interest in large vehicles and became the first civilian in the U.S. to purchase a Humvee. He was so enamored by the vehicle that he lobbied the Humvee's manufacturer, AM General, to produce a street-legal, civilian version, which they did in 1992; the first two Hummer H1s they sold were also purchased by Schwarzenegger. In 2010, he had one regular and three running on non-fossil power sources; one for hydrogen, one for vegetable oil, and one for biodiesel.[257] Schwarzenegger was in the news in 2014 for buying a rare Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse. He was spotted and filmed in 2015 in his car, painted silver with bright aluminium forged wheels. His Bugatti has its interior adorned in dark brown leather.[258] In 2017, Schwarzenegger acquired a Mercedes G-Class modified for all-electric drive.[259] The Hummers that Schwarzenegger bought in 1992 are so large—each weighs 6,300 lb (2,900 kg) and is 7 feet (2.1 m) wide—that they are classified as large trucks, and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to them. During the gubernatorial recall campaign, he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about $21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the California Hydrogen Highway Network, and gained a United States Department of Energy grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost.[260] California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.[261] Schwarzenegger was nicknamed the \"Austrian Oak\" in his bodybuilding days, \"Arnie\" or \"Schwarzy\" during his acting career,[262] and \"the Governator\" (a portmanteau of \"Governor\" and \"Terminator\") during his political career. He married Maria Shriver, a niece of the former U.S. president John F. Kennedy, in 1986. They separated in 2011 after he admitted to having fathered a child with their housemaid in 1997; their divorce was finalized in 2021.[263] Schwarzenegger has been involved with the Special Olympics for many years after they were founded in 1968 by his later mother-in-law Eunice Kennedy Shriver.[264] In 2007, Schwarzenegger was the official spokesperson for the Special Olympics held in Shanghai, China.[265] Schwarzenegger believes that quality school opportunities should be made available to children who might not normally be able to access them.[266] In 1995, he founded the Inner City Games Foundation (ICG) which provides cultural, educational and community enrichment programming to youth. ICG is active in 15 cities around the country and serves over 250,000 children in over 400 schools countrywide.[266] He has also been involved with After-School All-Stars and founded the Los Angeles branch in 2002.[267] ASAS is an after school program provider, educating youth about health, fitness and nutrition. On February 12, 2010, Schwarzenegger took part in the Vancouver Olympic Torch relay. He handed off the flame to the next runner, Sebastian Coe.[268] Schwarzenegger had a collection of Marxist busts, which he requested from Russian friends during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, as they were being destroyed. In 2011, he revealed that his wife had requested their removal, but he kept the one of Vladimir Lenin present, since \"he was the first\".[269] In 2015, he said he kept the Lenin bust to \"show losers.\"[270] Schwarzenegger is a supporter of Israel, and has participated in a Los Angeles pro-Israel rally[271] among other similar events.[272] In 2004, Schwarzenegger visited Israel to break ground on Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance Jerusalem, and to lay a wreath at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial, he also met with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and President Moshe Katsav.[273] In 2011, at the Independence Day celebration hosted by the Israeli Consulate General in Los Angeles, Schwarzenegger said: \"I love Israel. When I became governor, Israel was the first country that I visited. When I had the chance to sign a bill calling on California pension funds to divest their money from companies that do business with Iran, I immediately signed that bill\", then he added, \"I knew that we could not send money to these crazy dictators who hate us and threaten Israel any time they have a bad day.\"[272] Schwarzenegger supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[274] Schwarzenegger also expressed support for the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[275] In 2014, Schwarzenegger released a video message in support of the Euromaidan protests against Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych.[276] In 2022, Schwarzenegger released another video message condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Schwarzenegger's Twitter account is one of the 22 accounts that the president of Russia's Twitter account follows.[277] Schwarzenegger, who played football as a boy, grew up watching Bayern Munich and Sturm Graz.[278] He also expressed his admiration of Jürgen Klopp's Liverpool in October 2019.[278] Schwarzenegger inspired many actors to become action heroes, including Dwayne Johnson,[279][280] Matt McColm,[281] Christian Boeving,[282] Vidyut Jamwal,[283] and Daniel Greene.[282] Boeving's character in the 2003 action film When Eagles Strike was based on Schwarzenegger's image from the late 1980s: mostly on Major \"Dutch\" Schaefer from Predator (1987) and Colonel John Matrix from Commando (1985).[284] In 2012, Schwarzenegger helped to found the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, which is a part of the USC Price School of Public Policy at the University of Southern California.[285] The institute's mission is to \"[advance] post-partisanship, where leaders put people over political parties and work together to find the best ideas and solutions to benefit the people they serve\" and to \"seek to influence public policy and public debate in finding solutions to the serious challenges we face\".[286] Schwarzenegger serves as chairman of the institute.[287] An 8-foot-tall (2.4 m), 800 lb (363 kg) bronze sculpture of Schwarzenegger performing his signature 'twisted double biceps pose' designed by sculptor Ralph Crawford[288] is located outside the Greater Columbus Convention Center Columbus, Ohio, which is the venue of the annual Arnold Sports Festival.[289] For the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Schwarzenegger endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich.[290] However, he announced in October that he would not vote for the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in that year's United States presidential election, with this being the first time he did not vote for the Republican candidate since becoming a citizen in 1983.[291][292][293] In 2017, Schwarzenegger condemned white supremacists who were seen carrying Nazi and Confederate flags by calling their heroes \"losers.\"[294] Following the January 6 United States Capitol attack by supporters of President Donald Trump, Schwarzenegger posted a video address on social media in which he likened the insurrection to Nazi Germany's Kristallnacht, which he described as \"a night of rampage against the Jews carried out [by] the Nazi equivalent of the Proud Boys.\" He spoke of his father's alcoholism, domestic violence, and abuse, and how it was typical of other former Nazis and collaborators in the post-war era; and described Trump as \"a failed leader. He will go down in history as the worst president ever.\"[295][296] In late March 2021, Schwarzenegger was interviewed by Politico about the upcoming recall election in California in which he said that \"it's pretty much the same atmosphere today as it was then,\"[297] and when he was asked about Newsom's claim of this being a \"Republican recall\" he responded that \"this recall effort is sparked by ordinary folks,\" and that this was not a power grab by Republicans.[298][299] Schwarzenegger has spoken out about COVID-19, urging Americans to wear masks and practice social distancing. In August 2021, he said: \"There is a virus here. It kills people and the only way we prevent it is: get vaccinated, wear masks, do social distancing, washing your hands all the time, and not just to think about, 'Well my freedom is being kind of disturbed here.' No, screw your freedom.\"[300] On January 17, 2024, Schwarzenegger was detained by German authorities after failing to claim an item to customs agents after landing in Munich. A spokesperson for the customs agency said that Schwarzenegger would face criminal tax proceedings because he failed to declare an item that originated in a country that is not a part of the European Union. The item in question was a watch manufactured by Audemars Piguet, a Swiss company. A spokesperson for Schwarzenegger said that he was never asked to fill out a declaration form and he was compliant with officials upon his detainment. Schwarzenegger was held for three hours and was released after pre-paying potential taxes. The watch was subsequently auctioned off at a dinner in Kitzbühel to raise funds for the Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative the next day, fetching €270,000.[301][302] On October 30, 2024, Schwarzenegger endorsed Kamala Harris for president.[303] At a 2015 security conference, Schwarzenegger called climate change the issue of our time,[304] and urged politicians to stop treating it as a political issue.[305] Next, in 2016, he collaborated on a campaign by WildAid, starring in the PSA, \"Less Meat, Less Heat,\"[306] that encourages people to eat less meat as a means of combating climate change.[307] In 2018, he appeared in, and served as an executive producer (alongside James Cameron et al.) for, the documentary The Game Changers. This film explores the rise of plant-based diets in professional sports.[308] In February 2022, he said that he has \"been about 80% plant-based for the past five years of my life.\"[309] He also says that while he occasionally still consumes smaller amounts of animal products, following a mostly plant-based diet is better for his \"overall-health,\" and that James Cameron helped him to understand that it is better for the environment.[309] Bodybuilding Entertainment Halls of Fame State/local International",

He was the governor of the American state of California from 2003 to 2011. He currently lives in Los Angeles, California. After serving in the army, Schwarzenegger moved to Munich, where he often slept in a gym because he did not have anywhere else to live. Schwarzenegger then moved to the United States in 1968 and eventually became an actor. He has been in several big budget Hollywood movies including The Terminator series. He eventually stopped acting in order to run for governor of California in 2003. In 2003, Governor Gray Davis was removed as governor and Schwarzenegger was elected. His term ended in early January 2011, and he was replaced by Jerry Brown. Before becoming an actor, Schwarzenegger was also a bodybuilder and had won both the Mr. Olympia and Mr. Universe titles over 7 consecutive times. Schwarzenegger has also set up his own official competition, Arnold Classic. In 1971, Schwarzenegger's younger maternal half-brother Meinhard died in a car accident due to driving while drunk. In 1986, Schwarzenegger married Maria Shriver, but they separated and divorced in 2021. They have 2 daughters, Katherine and Christina, and also 2 sons, Patrick and Christopher. Schwarzenegger also has a son with another woman. Some people think that Arnold had cheated on his wife but, such statements have not been proven. In 2013, Schwarzenegger returned to acting with a role in the movie Escape Plan.",

The tournament, which has staged its closing matches in Qatar this week, effectively replaces the FIFA Club World Cup, which will now take place in an expanded 32-team format next summer. The name is taken from the old annual showdown between the champions of Europe and South America staged between 1960 and 2004. Madrid won that competition three times in 1960, 1998 and 2002, losing the 1966 and 2000 finals.

Salomon Rondon MORE: All the latest soccer news | Real Madrid news | Explaining how 'socios' own Real Madrid 84 mins: GOOOOAAAAAALLLLLL!!!! Vinicius (pen)!!!! In truth, it's not a great penalty from Vinicius and Moreno guesses correctly but there's just enough on the strike for it to squirm under the Pachuca goalkeeper. 83 mins: PENALTY TO REAL MADRID! Idrissi is penalised. That feels harsh. There might have been faint contact but Ceballos knew what he was doing and it's one of those that looks more like a penalty the more you watch it. 81 mins: Ceballos goes down looking for a penalty. The crowd boo but the referee could not have been less convinced. On the replay it looks like a dive but Valenzuela is going to the monitor. 80 mins: This is a little gem of a cameo from the magisterial Modric, who forces Sanchez into a last-ditch tackle. 75 mins: Double change for Pachuca, with Sanchez and Mena into the action in place of the industrious Rodriguez and Bautista. 74 mins: Modric orchestrates a fine Madrid attack, Bellingham finds another cute through-ball and Moreno has to deny Vinicius with his leg. 73 mins: Modric floats one a free-kick into the box but Moreno is out to claim. 70 mins: Rondon gets up to meet Montiel's cross and heads onto the roof of the net! 69 mins: Bellingham and Valverde work an attack to Vinicius, who drags his right-footed effort wide. Rodrygo is making way for Luka Modric, 39 years young. He will collect trophy 28 of his Madrid career unless something crazy happens over the closing minutes. 67 mins: Free-kick to Pachuca, fairly straight and north of 35 yards form goal. Rondon arrows a fine low strike that Courtois beats out of his bottom right corner. 64 mins: Some more sloppy playing out from Madrid. It goes unpunished but they've probably eased off too much since Rodrygo doubled the lead. 61 mins: Double change for Madrid as Ceballos and Diaz come on for Camavinga and Mbappe. 60 mins: Courtois does well to get down to Gonzalez's cross with the veteran striker Rondon poised to take advantage. 59 mins: Dreadful giveaway in midfield by Madrid, who scramble back and the Pachuca attack progresses to Rodriguez down the right but no further. 56 mins: THE GOAL STANDS! Referee Valenzuela explains over the stadium PA - a good innovation whenever it's used, in my opinion, that he did not believe Bellingham to be interfering. 55 mins: VAR REVIEW! Hang on, they're having a look at Rodrygo's goal. Bellingham was in an offside position, squatting down in front of the goalkeeper. The question now is whether or not the Englishman is deeper to be interfering with play. 53 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLL!!!!! Rodrygo!!!! A wonderful goal from the Brazil winger, who collects the ball in the D, twists and turns away from a couple of challenges and then curls a superb strike beyond Moreno from the edge of the box. 51 mins: Sharp effort from Deossa that deflects off Garcia and goes behind for a corner. Again, the delivery isn't great. Off we go again. Can Pachuca flip the script and deny Real Madrid their latest trophy? They've 45 minutes to turn the tide. Pachuca kept Madrid at bay and competed well for most of the opening 45 minutes. But Madrid threatened to run away with things in the minutes immediately after Mbappe's opening goal and they will fancy doing so when the action resumes. 45 mins: There'll be one added minute and Pachuca seem to have effectively weathered the storm that followed Mbappe's goal. 39 mins: Now Valverde gets into the box on the right-hand side and clatters over the near post. Halftime suddenly feels a long time away for Pachuca. 38 mins; The goal was Real Madrid's first short on target and Mbappe fancies another as he thuds a low drive wide from outside the box. 37 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLL!!!!! Kylian Mbappe!!!! Madrid's stars combine to break the deadlock. Bellingham cutely plays through Vinicius, who deftly dummies his way around Moreno and cuts back across goal for Mbappe to convert. 34 mins: Moreno is out sharply to make a fine close-range save from Rodrygo. Then the offside flag goes up. 29 mins: Pachuca surge up the other end and Gonzalez wins a corner, which is taken short. Bautista has a faintly ludicrous shot from about 35 yards that's miles off target. 28 mins: Madrid continue to knock at the door but Mbappe can't quite get the ball out of his feet and is crowded out. 22 mins: Fantastic sliding block from Micolta to deny Rodrygo. The Pachuca defender came out of nowhere then. Madrid can't make the corner count but this is starting to feel like a pretty taxing experience for their opponents. 16 mins: Quick VAR check after a coming together between Valverde and Deossa in the Madrid box. Nothing in that though, no need for a check on the screen. On we go. 14 mins: Rudiger pings a cross-field ball for Rodrygo, who wants a free-kick following Bryan Gonzalez's challenge. Nothing doing and that's a goal kick. 12 mins: Into the Pachuca area in a flash and Vinicius wins a corner. Played short by Rodrygo, doesn't really work but they get another go. Now Bellingham can't get to a near-post delivery. 11 mins: Pachuca are switching play effectively here, pushing Madrid back and they win another corner. Montiel's delivery is cleared and here come Vinicius and Mbappe... 7 mins: Oh, hello! Pachuca right-back Rodriguez is allowed to advance and slaps a low shot from just over 25 yards. Courtois scrambles to push it around the post and Madrid deal with the corner. 5 mins: A Madrid attack breaks down after Mbappe is penalised for handball. He reckons the ball hit his stomach and I dare say he has a point. Off we go. Real Madrid settle into some calm possession before Courtois launches it forward to no one in particular. 4 mins before kickoff: Here come the teams, entering the scene of the 2022 FIFA World Cup final. It means Kylian Mbappe is back at the scene of both an unforgettable hat-trick and probably his most crushing career disappointment. Lusail Stadium was heaving that night in 2022. Two years on, there are definitely more than a few seats going spare. 20 mins before kickoff: So, not to get all existential, why are we all here? Well, this competition basically fills the gap in the schedule (woe betide we have one of those) left by the FIFA Club World Cup, which will now take place as a 32-team expanded tournament next year to ensure we have no gaps in the schedule. Anyway, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup featured knockout games with the club champions from FIFA's six affiliated confederations. Real Madrid gained an automatic place in the final and Pachuca booked their spot by stunning Copa Libertadores winners Botafogo 3-0 in the 'Derby of the Americas' on December 11 before knocking out Al Ahly on penalties. The old Intercontinental Cup was played between the UEFA and CONMEBOL champions from 1960 to 2004, with Real Madrid prevailing on three occasions. 45 mins before kickoff: This is how Pachuca line up . It looks like that might be a narrow 4-4-2 diamond as they seek to starve Madrid of room in central areas. 🌪️ | Este es el #XITuzo con el que hoy salimos al campo a dejar la vida ante el Real Madrid por la Copa Intercontinental.🔥¡ADELANTE TUZOS!🔥#PachucaParaElMundo🤍💙 | #RealMadridPachuca pic.twitter.com/UvZkcGiMM2 1 hour before kickoff: Here's the confirmed Real Madrid team news.

Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid enters the match as firm favorites, aiming to secure their ninth Intercontinental title. Fresh off their Champions League triumph in June. The team last claimed this prestigious honor in 2023 and is eager to extend their legacy. Pachuca's route to the final has been marked by resilience and determination. Earning their sixth CONCACAF Champions Cup earlier this year, they carried that momentum into Qatar, where they first overcame Botafogo with a commanding 3-0 victory. Goals from Oussama Idrissi, Nelson Deossa, and Salomon Rondon highlighted their attacking flair. Their semifinal against Al Ahly was a much closer affair, ending in a penalty shootout triumph, with goalkeeper Carlos Moreno saving the decisive kick. This final marks the first-ever clash between Real Madrid and Pachuca, setting the stage for an intriguing battle of styles.

Pachuca (4-2-3-1): Moreno; Luis Rodríguez, Barreto, Micolta, Bryan González; Montiel, Peraza; Idrissi, Bautista, Deossa, Rondón. Lineups are announced and players are warming up. Mbappe starts as the attacking trident is back. Tchouaméni remains in the center of the defense. Real Madrid's squad is bolstered by the return of Kylian Mbappe, who missed their recent 3-3 draw with Rayo Vallecano due to a thigh injury. Alongside Vinicius Junior, the duo forms a lethal attacking partnership that could prove too much for Pachuca to handle. Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo, and Federico Valverde add depth to an already star-studded lineup. However, Madrid's defensive options remain limited. With season-ending injuries to Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, and Ferland Mendy, Carlo Ancelotti has had to rely on Aurelien Tchouameni and Antonio Rudiger as makeshift center-backs. David Alaba's recent return to training provides a glimmer of hope, but he has not been included in the squad for this trip. Real Madrid possible starting XI: Courtois; Vazquez, Tchouameni, Rudiger, Garcia; Valverde, Camavinga, Bellingham; Rodrygo, Mbappe, Vinicius Jr Pachuca possible starting XI: Moreno; Rodriguez, Cabral, Micolta, Gonzalez; Montiel, Pedraza, Deossa, Bautista, Idrissi; Rondon For fans in the United Kingdom, Real Madrid vs Pachuca can be seen on DAZN UK.

Kylian Mbappe starts alongside Vinicius Jr at the Lusail Stadium after injury, boosting the Champions League holders after Saturday’s six-goal draw at Rayo Vallecano that saw the title holders drop to third in LaLiga. Carlo Ancelotti is out to secure the 15th major trophy of his Madrid career that would see him move clear of Miguel Munoz as the club’s most successful manager ever. But Los Blancos could face a tough test against Pachuca, who won the Concacaf Champions Cup earlier this year and eased past Copa Libertadores winners Botafogo in a Derby of the Americas shock last week before then holding their nerve in a Challenger Cup penalty shootout triumph that followed a goalless draw with CAF Champions League holders Al Ahly. Both sides are bidding to become the first winners of this inaugural trophy in a competition that is similar to the old format of the Club World Cup, which has been significantly revamped and expanded and moved to the summer.

Real Madrid vs Pachuca latest news Live updates 84 mins: Not a great penalty by any means from Vinicius Jr, who goes low and almost down the middle. Moreno gets his hand on it, but can’t keep it out. Game, set and match, Real Madrid. 83 mins: After another long look at the replays, the referee does award the spot-kick. Vinicius Jr to step up and set the seal on Real Madrid’s fifth major trophy win of 2024... 81 mins: Lovely little flick from Lucas Vazquez to bamboozle Idrissi, who looks to trip the Spaniard inside the box. Referee Jesus Valenzuela says no penalty initially as play goes on, but Real Madrid are incensed. The VAR will send him to check the monitor again... 78 mins: Brahim Diaz tried his luck a few moments ago, but could not hit the target to put this game firmly to bed for Real Madrid. Bellingham still largely running the show here, with Modric eyeing a chance to get on the scoresheet late off the bench. 74 mins: A double change from Pachuca now as Uruguayan head coach Guillermo Almada looks to his bench for the first time tonight - slightly surprising given the scoreline, time remaining and their tiring exploits in Qatar already this week. Carlos Sanchez and Angel Mena replace Luis Rodriguez and Bautista. 72 mins: Wonderful football from Real Madrid as Bellingham combines brilliantly inside the box with Vinicius Jr, who can’t lift the ball over Moreno. Brahim Diaz’s dangerous low ball into the six-yard box is then hacked clear. 70 mins: What a chance for Pachuca! Rondon soars high above Tchouameni to connect with Montiel’s enticing cross and whistle a header narrowly over the crossbar with Courtois at full stretch.

Luka Modric is coming on for Los Blancos in place of Rodrygo.

An eerily quiet atmosphere inside the Lusail Stadium rather gives this the feel of a pre-season game. A far cry from the unforgettable 2022 World Cup final held at the same venue.

                "title": "Honda, Nissan in merger talks to form world's 3rd-biggest auto group",
                "content": "KYODO NEWS - 4 hours ago - 23:10 | All, Japan Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. have begun talks on a merger that would create the world's third-biggest automaker group by volume, sources familiar with the matter said Wednesday, amid fierce global competition in electric vehicles dominated by overseas rivals. Japan's second- and third-largest automakers are considering the possibility of establishing a holding company, the sources said, in an apparent bid to form an automobile alliance to challenge Tesla Inc. of the United States and Chinese EV makers such as BYD Co. The talks come as speculation swirls among industry officials that Taiwan's electronics giant Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., has made a buyout offer for struggling Nissan, with some viewing the potential merger with Honda as a move by Nissan to thwart Foxconn's effort. \"We are considering collaboration. Other possibilities are also being considered, but nothing has been decided,\" Honda President Toshihiro Mibe told reporters. Honda and Nissan are considering making an announcement as early as next Monday, the sources said. Honda, Nissan, and Mitsubishi Motors Corp., which partners with Nissan, said in a statement that they are \"considering various possibilities for future collaboration, but no decisions have been made.\" The merger would create an alliance that rivals industry giants Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG in size, with combined sales reaching around 8 million vehicles if those of Mitsubishi Motors are included. Honda and Nissan agreed in March to commence a feasibility study on a strategic partnership in EV production and software technologies to cut costs and improve competitiveness, with Mitsubishi Motors joining the talks in August. At a press conference in August, Mibe said the talks did not involve a capital tie-up, although he did not deny such a possibility in the future. Global automakers are struggling to secure funds to cover increasingly high costs for EV development due to expensive batteries and the massive resources required for software development, such as autonomous driving functions. Honda, which traditionally preferred to develop cars in-house, has been ramping up collaboration with companies such as Sony Group Corp. and General Motors Co. in recent years. Nissan, which agreed to review its decades-old capital alliance with Renault SA last year in a deal that lowered the French automaker's influence over the Japanese company, has been exploring ways to increase its competitiveness. Honda and Nissan are facing slumping sales in China, where local brands with more affordable EVs are grabbing market share from Japanese automakers. Last month, Honda cut its net profit outlook for the current business year through March to 950 billion yen ($6.2 billion), which would represent a 14.2 percent decline from the previous year, due to weaker-than-expected auto sales in China. Also in November, Nissan unveiled a plan to cut 9,000 jobs and reduce global output capacity by 20 percent, saying its business in the United States and China continued to struggle. In 2023, Honda and Nissan sold 3.98 million and 3.37 million vehicles worldwide, respectively. The Toyota group sold 11.23 million vehicles that year, maintaining the top position for the fourth consecutive year, followed by Volkswagen with 9.24 million. Following media reports on the potential merger talks, trading of Nissan shares was briefly halted by the Tokyo Stock Exchange ahead of the Wednesday morning session but resumed after the companies issued the statement. Nissan shares closed nearly 24 percent higher at 417 yen, while Honda shares declined about 3 percent to 1,244 yen.

She has said that the experience helped her learn \"first-hand how attorneys appointed by the court to administer an estate can enrich themselves at the expense of the families struggling to make sense of the bureaucracy\".[28] During college, Ocasio-Cortez was an intern for U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy in his section on foreign affairs and immigration issues.[29] In interviews, she said she was the only Spanish speaker in the office and the sole person responsible for assisting Spanish-speaking constituents.[29][30][31] Ocasio-Cortez graduated cum laude[32] from Boston University in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in international relations and economics.[33][30][34] After college, Ocasio-Cortez moved back to the Bronx and took a job as a bartender and waitress to help her mother—a house cleaner and school bus driver—fight foreclosure of their home.[35][36] She later launched Brook Avenue Press, a now-defunct publishing firm for books that portrayed the Bronx in a positive light.[37][38] Ocasio-Cortez also worked for the nonprofit National Hispanic Institute.[25][39][40] During the 2016 primary, Ocasio-Cortez worked as an organizer for Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign.[41] After the general election, she traveled across America by car, visiting places such as Flint, Michigan, and Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota, and speaking to people affected by the Flint water crisis and the Dakota Access Pipeline.[42] In an interview she recalled her December 2016 visit to Standing Rock as a tipping point, saying that before that, she had believed that the only way to run for office effectively was to have access to wealth, social influence, and power. But her visit to North Dakota, where she saw others \"putting their whole lives and everything that they had on the line for the protection of their community\", inspired her to begin to work for her own community.[43] One day after she visited North Dakota, she got a phone call from Brand New Congress, which was recruiting progressive candidates (her brother had nominated her soon after Election Day 2016).[44] She has credited Jabari Brisport's unsuccessful City Council campaign with restoring her belief in electoral politics, in running as a socialist candidate, and in Democratic Socialists of America as an organization.[45] Ocasio-Cortez began her campaign in April 2017[7] while waiting tables and tending bar at Flats Fix, a taqueria in New York City's Union Square.[47] \"For 80 percent of this campaign, I operated out of a paper grocery bag hidden behind that bar,\" she told Bon Appétit.[48] She was the first person since 2004 to challenge Joe Crowley, the Democratic Caucus Chair, in the primary. She faced a financial disadvantage, saying, \"You can't really beat big money with more money. You have to beat them with a totally different game.\"[49][50][28] Ocasio-Cortez's campaign undertook grassroots mobilization and did not take donations from corporations.[7] Her campaign posters' designs were said to have taken inspiration from \"revolutionary posters and visuals from the past\".[46] The candidates' only face-to-face encounter during the campaign occurred on a local political talk show, Inside City Hall, on June 15. The format was a joint interview conducted by Errol Louis, which NY1 characterized as a debate.[51] A debate in the Bronx was scheduled for June 18, but Crowley did not participate. He sent former New York City Council member Annabel Palma in his place.[52][53][54] Ocasio-Cortez was endorsed by progressive and civil rights organizations such as MoveOn[55] and Democracy for America.[41] Then-Governor Cuomo endorsed Crowley,[56] as did both of New York's U.S. senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand,[57] multiple U.S. representatives, various local elected officials and trade unions, and groups such as the Sierra Club,[58] Planned Parenthood,[58] the Working Families Party,[59] NARAL Pro-Choice America,[60] and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, among others.[61] California representative Ro Khanna, a Justice Democrat like Ocasio-Cortez,[57][7] initially endorsed Crowley but later endorsed Ocasio-Cortez in an unusual dual endorsement.[62] Ocasio-Cortez received 57.13% of the vote (15,897) to Crowley's 42.5% (11,761), defeating the 10-term incumbent by almost 15 percentage points on June 26, 2018.[63] The result shocked many political commentators and analysts and immediately garnered nationwide attention. Many news sources, including Time, CNN, The New York Times, and The Guardian mentioned how the win completely defied their predictions and expectations.[41][64][65][5] She was outspent by a margin of 18 to 1 ($1.5 million to $83,000) but won the endorsement of some influential groups on the party's left.[66] Crowley conceded defeat on election night,[67] but did not telephone Ocasio-Cortez that night to congratulate her, fueling short-lived speculation that he intended to run against her in the general election.[68] Bernie Sanders and Noam Chomsky congratulated her.[69][70] Several commentators noted the similarities between Ocasio-Cortez's victory over Crowley and Dave Brat's Tea Party movement-supported 2014 victory over House majority leader Eric Cantor in the Republican primary for Virginia's 7th congressional district.[71][72] Like Crowley, Cantor was a high-ranking member in his party's caucus.[73] After her primary win, Ocasio-Cortez endorsed several progressive primary challengers to Democratic incumbents nationwide,[74] capitalizing on her fame and spending her political capital in a manner unusual even[tone] for unexpected primary winners.[75] Without campaigning for it, Ocasio-Cortez won the Reform Party primary as a write-in candidate in a neighboring congressional district, New York's 15th, with a total vote count of nine, highest among all 22 write-in candidates. She declined the nomination.[76][77] Ocasio-Cortez faced Republican nominee Anthony Pappas in the November 6 general election.[78] Pappas, an economics professor, did not actively campaign. The 14th district has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+29, making it New York City's sixth-most Democratic district, with registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans almost six to one.[79][80] Ocasio-Cortez was endorsed by various politically progressive organizations and figures, including former president Barack Obama and U.S. senator Bernie Sanders.[81][82] She spoke at the Netroots Nation conference in August 2018, and was called \"the undisputed star of the convention\".[83] Crowley remained on the ballot as the nominee of the Working Families Party (WFP) and the Women's Equality Party (WEP). Neither he nor the WFP party actively campaigned, both having endorsed Ocasio-Cortez after the Democratic primary.[84] Ocasio-Cortez called the WEP, which Governor Cuomo created ahead of the 2014 New York gubernatorial election, a cynical, centrist group that endorsed male incumbents over female challengers like her and Cynthia Nixon.[85] Former Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman, who won reelection in 2006 on a third-party line after losing the Democratic primary in 2006, penned a July 17 column in the Wall Street Journal expressing hope that Crowley would actively campaign on the WFP ballot line.[86] WFP Executive Director Dan Cantor wrote an endorsement of, and apology to, Ocasio-Cortez for the New York Daily News; he asked voters not to vote for Crowley if his name remained on the general election ballot.[87] Ocasio-Cortez won the election with 78% of the vote (110,318) to Pappas's 14% (17,762). Crowley, on the WFP and WEP lines, received 9,348 votes (6.6%). Her election was part of a broader Democratic victory in the 2018 midterm elections, as the party gained control of the House by picking up 41 seats.[88] Saikat Chakrabarti, who had been her campaign co-chair, became chief of staff for her congressional office.[89] His departure in 2019 drew considerable speculation as to whether Ocasio-Cortez was trying to implement a more moderate strategy.[90] The first media network to give Ocasio-Cortez a platform and extensively cover her campaign and policies was The Young Turks, a left-wing online news program.[7] After her primary win, she quickly garnered nationwide media attention, including numerous articles and TV talk-show appearances.[91][92] She also drew a great amount of media attention when she and Sanders campaigned for James Thompson in Kansas in July 2018.[93] A rally in Wichita had to be moved from a theater with a capacity of 1,500 when far more people said they would attend. The event drew 4,000 people, with some seated on the floor.[94] In The New Yorker, Benjamin Wallace-Wells wrote that while Sanders remained \"the de-facto leader of an increasingly popular left, [he is unable to] do things that do not come naturally to him, like supply hope.\" Wallace-Wells suggested that Ocasio-Cortez had made Sanders's task easier, as he could point to her success to show that ideas \"once considered to be radical are now part of the mainstream\".[94] Until she defeated incumbent Joe Crowley in the 2018 Democratic primary, Ocasio-Cortez received little coverage on most traditional news media outlets.[95][96] Jimmy Dore interviewed her when she first announced her candidacy in June 2017.[97] After her primary win, Brian Stelter wrote that progressive-media outlets, such as The Young Turks and The Intercept, \"saw the Ocasio-Cortez upset coming\" in advance.[72] Margaret Sullivan wrote in The Washington Post that traditional metrics of measuring a campaign's viability, like total fundraising, were contributing to a \"media failure\" and that \"they need to get closer to what voters are thinking and feeling: their anger and resentment, their disenfranchisement from the centers of power, their pocketbook concerns.\"[96] Ocasio-Cortez's campaign was featured on the cover of the June 2018 edition of The Indypendent,[98][99] a free New York City-based monthly newspaper. In a tweet she hailed the cover appearance on \"NYC's classic monthly\" as an important breakthrough for her campaign.[100] Otherwise Ocasio-Cortez was barely mentioned in print until her primary win.[101] Ocasio-Cortez was one of the subjects of the 2018 Michael Moore documentary Fahrenheit 11/9; it chronicled her primary campaign.[102][103] In an attempt to embarrass Ocasio-Cortez just before she took office, Twitter user \"AnonymousQ\" shared a video dating to Ocasio-Cortez's college years: a Boston University student-produced dance video in which she briefly appeared.[104] Many social media users came to her defense, inspiring memes and a Twitter account syncing the footage to songs like \"Mambo No. 5\" and \"Gangnam Style\".[105] Ocasio-Cortez responded by posting a video of herself dancing to Edwin Starr's \"War\" outside her congressional office.[104] Elizabeth Warren wrote the entry on Ocasio-Cortez for 2019's Time 100.[106] The documentary Knock Down the House, directed by Rachel Lears, which focuses on four female Democrats in the 2018 United States elections who were not career politicians—Ocasio-Cortez, Amy Vilela, Cori Bush and Paula Jean Swearengin—premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. Ocasio-Cortez was the only one of the women featured in the film to win.[107][108] It was released by Netflix on May 1, 2019.[109] Ocasio-Cortez also appeared in Lears's 2022 film To the End, which focuses on the effects of climate change. The film debuted at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival[110][111] and was presented at the Tribeca Film Festival in June 2022.[112] Michelle Caruso-Cabrera challenged Ocasio-Cortez in the 2020 Democratic primary.[113] After Ocasio-Cortez won the nomination, Caruso-Cabrera reorganized and ran in the general election as the Serve America Movement nominee.[114] Ocasio-Cortez's Republican challengers in the general election included nominee John Cummings, a former police officer, and Antoine Tucker, a write-in candidate.[114][115] The American Prospect wrote in October 2020 that Ocasio-Cortez was \"spending the 2020 campaign running workshops\" for constituents on workplace organizing, fighting eviction, and organizing childcare.[116] They noted that Ocasio-Cortez was often not featured in the streamed workshops, saying the \"strategy decentralizes the candidate from her own campaign.\"[116] On October 20, 2020, Ocasio-Cortez hosted a Twitch stream of the social deduction game Among Us, with fellow congresswoman Ilhan Omar, and many established streamers such as Pokimane, Hasan Piker, DrLupo, and mxmtoon.[117] The stream peaked with over 400,000 viewers and, according to The Guardian's Joshua Rivera, succeeded in humanizing her.[118][119][120][121] Ocasio-Cortez again streamed Among Us on Twitch on November 27, 2020, with Hasan Piker, xQc, ContraPoints and Canadian MP Jagmeet Singh to raise money for food pantries, eviction defense legal aid, and community support organizations to assist those suffering economic hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic.[122] The stream raised $200,000 and Ocasio-Cortez wrote, \"This is going to make such a difference for those who need it most right now.\"[123] Ocasio-Cortez ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.[124] She defeated Republican Tina Forte and Conservative Party nominee Desi Cuellar in the general election.[125] In May, the DSA debated whether to endorse Ocasio-Cortez. Some members argued that she was more committed to the Democratic Party and that her positions on Palestine had become weaker.[126] On June 23, the DSA National Political Committee (NPC) voted to endorse her so long as she fulfilled its list of demands, most concerning Palestine. The New York City chapter, which endorsed her, rejected the deal. On July 10, the NPC withdrew its endorsement of Ocasio-Cortez. It mainly cited a panel she held with Jewish leaders that supposedly conflated antisemitism with anti-Zionism. Other concerns included her support for a resolution that characterized denial of Israel's right to exist as antisemitism and her support of the Iron Dome defense system.[127][128][129] Investment banker Marty Dolan, a moderate Democrat, ran against Ocasio-Cortez in the primary. Ocasio-Cortez won overwhelmingly.[130] Ocasio-Cortez again easily won the general election.[131] Notably, some voters in her district split their tickets, voting for Ocasio-Cortez and for Trump in the presidential election. A political analyst speaking to NBC New York said this was because both candidates \"were leading with the message of working-class pocketbook issues\".[132] Ocasio-Cortez asked those who split their tickets why they did so; some said that they both cared about the working class and were \"less establishment\", while others cited the Israel-Hamas war and the economy.[133] Taking office at age 29, Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest woman ever to serve in the United States Congress, and also the youngest member of the 116th Congress.[134] When the 116th Congress convened on January 3, 2019, Ocasio-Cortez entered with no seniority but with a large social media presence. Axios credited her with \"as much social media clout as her fellow freshman Democrats combined\".[135] Since June 2024[update], she has 13.1 million X (formerly Twitter) followers,[136] up from 1.4 million in November 2018[135] and surpassing Nancy Pelosi.[137] She has 8.1 million Instagram followers as of June 2024[138] and 1.8 million followers on Facebook as of June 2024.[139] Her colleagues appointed her to teach them social media lessons upon her arrival in Congress.[139] In early July 2019 two lawsuits were filed against her for blocking Joey Salads and Dov Hikind on Twitter in light of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that it was a violation of the First Amendment for President Trump to block people on Twitter.[140][141] On November 4, 2019, it was announced that they settled the lawsuit with Ocasio-Cortez issuing a statement apologizing for the Twitter block.[142][143] In a 2019 interview, Ocasio-Cortez said she had stopped using her private Facebook account and was minimizing her usage of all social media accounts and platforms, calling them a \"public health risk\".[144][145] In November 2018, on the first day of congressional orientation, Ocasio-Cortez participated in a climate change protest outside the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.[146] Also that month, she backed Pelosi's bid to be Speaker of the House once the Democratic Party reclaimed the majority on the condition that Pelosi \"remains the most progressive candidate for speaker\".[147] During the orientation for new members hosted by the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter in December 2018 about the influence of corporate interests by sponsors such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Center for Strategic and International Studies: \"Lobbyists are here. Goldman Sachs is here. Where's labor? Activists? Frontline community leaders?\"[148][149][150] When Ocasio-Cortez made her first speech on the floor of Congress in January 2019, C-SPAN tweeted the video. Within 12 hours, the video of her four-minute speech set the record as C-SPAN's most-watched Twitter video of a member of the House of Representatives.[151] In February 2019, speaking at a Congressional hearing with a panel of representatives from campaign finance watchdog groups, Ocasio-Cortez questioned the panel about ethics regulations as they apply to both the president and members of Congress. She asserted that no regulations prevent lawmakers \"from being bought off by wealthy corporations\".[152] With more than 37.5 million views, the clip became the most-watched political video posted on Twitter.[153] When President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen appeared before the Oversight Committee in February 2019, Ocasio-Cortez asked him whether Trump had inflated property values for bank or insurance purposes and where to get more information on the subject.[154] Cohen's reply implied that Trump may have committed tax and bank fraud in his personal and business tax returns, financial statements and real-estate filings.[155][156] The president of the American Constitution Society named Ocasio-Cortez as the committee member best at obtaining specific information from Cohen about Trump's \"shady practices, along with a road map for how to find out more\".[157] New York Times columnist David Brooks praised her skill in questioning Cohen.[158] The exchange between Ocasio-Cortez and Cohen prompted an investigation by New York attorney general Letitia James, who referred to it in August 2020 when filing legal action to compel Trump's companies to comply with subpoenas about financial information, and to compel his son Eric Trump to testify.[159] Further developments as a result of the exchange saw James form a civil investigation and lawsuit against the Trump Organization regarding potential financial fraud, which resulted in a fine of $354 million and a ban on Trump doing business in New York for two to three years.[160][161][162] According to reports in March 2019, Ocasio-Cortez continued to receive media coverage early in her congressional tenure on par with that of 2020 presidential candidates[163] and was considered \"one of the faces of the Democratic party\"[164] and one of the most talked-about politicians in the United States.[165] Between July 8 and 14, 2019, she drew more social media attention than the Democratic presidential candidates. Tracking company NewsWhip found that interactions with news articles on Ocasio-Cortez numbered 4.8 million, while no Democratic presidential candidate got more than 1.2 million. David Bauder of the Associated Press wrote that Trump's supporters were thus having \"some success\" in having \"Ocasio-Cortez be top of mind when people think of\" the Democratic Party.[166] According to a Media Matters for America study, Ocasio-Cortez has been intensely discussed on sister television channels Fox News and Fox Business, being mentioned every day from February 25 to April 7, 2019, for a total of 3,181 mentions in 42 days (an average of around 75 per day). The Guardian's David Smith wrote that this is evidence that Fox is \"obsessed by Ocasio-Cortez, portraying her as a radical socialist who threatens the American way of life\".[167] Brian Stelter of CNN Business found that between January and July 2019, she had nearly three times as many mentions on Fox News as on CNN and MSNBC, and seven times the coverage of James Clyburn, a Democratic leader in the House of Representatives. Stelter wrote that the attention Ocasio-Cortez is receiving has caused \"the perception, particularly on the right, that her positions and policies are representative of the Democratic Party as a whole\".[168] In a CBS News and YouGov poll of almost 2,100 American adults conducted from July 17 to 19, it was found that Republican respondents were more aware of Ocasio-Cortez than Democratic respondents. She had very unfavorable ratings among Republican respondents and favorable ratings among Democratic respondents.[169] In March 2019, Time Magazine said Ocasio-Cortez was the \"second-most talked about politician\" in the United States, after Trump, and called her \"the Wonder Woman of the left\".[170] In March 2019, PolitiFact reported that Ocasio-Cortez is \"one of the most targeted politicians for hoax claims, despite the fact that she just entered Congress as a freshman\". Fake quotes attributed to her, fake photos of her, and false rumors about her have spread on social media. Some of these have originated from 4chan and r/The_Donald.[171] By July 2019, the fake material included attributing things Trump said to Ocasio-Cortez, such as \"I have a very good brain and I've said lots of things.\"[172] On July 18, 2019, Charlie Rispoli, a police officer from Gretna, Louisiana, posted on Facebook an apparent threat to shoot Ocasio-Cortez, calling her a \"vile idiot\" who \"needs a round, and I don't mean the kind she used to serve\" as a bartender. Rispoli posted the comment in response to a fake news article that falsely quoted Ocasio-Cortez as saying, \"We pay soldiers too much\". A photo from the article also had the label \"satire\".[173] Rispoli was fired for his post and his Facebook account was deleted.[174] Ocasio-Cortez is known to wear red lipstick, usually by the American makeup brand Stila Cosmetics in the shade \"Beso\", as a style trait of Latina women from the Bronx.[175] In a skincare tutorial for Vogue, she explained that beauty and femininity are important to her because these things are often used against women in politics and society, and that self-love is like a \"mini protest\" against misogynistic critiques.[176] Ocasio-Cortez attended the 2021 Met Gala, which had the theme \"In America: a Lexicon of Fashion\". The Met Gala is an annual fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art that is overseen by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who selects every invitee and designer pairing. Ocasio-Cortez wore an organza gown emblazoned with the phrase \"Tax the Rich\". As an elected official in New York City, she was considered a guest of the museum, and as such did not have to buy a ticket, which costs persons other than elected officials at least $35,000. Responding to critics, Ocasio-Cortez stated that they were using a sexist double standard and that she \"punctured the fourth wall of excess and spectacle\". James also believed that the extremely wealthy people in attendance needed to see the message in person.[177] In September 2021, the American Accountability Foundation filed an ethics complaint against Ocasio-Cortez for attending the Met Gala. The AAF claimed that her attendance amounted to accepting an illegal gift since her estimated $35,000 ticket was paid for by Condé Nast, a for-profit company, not a charity.[178][179][180] Ocasio-Cortez is a member of an informal group of progressive members of Congress called \"the Squad\", initially including Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib.[181] On July 14, 2019, Trump attacked the Squad (which had only four members at the time) in a tweet, saying that they should \"go back and help fix\" the countries they came from rather than criticize the American government.[182] He continued to make similar comments over the next several days, even though three of the women, including Ocasio-Cortez, were born in the United States. Ocasio-Cortez responded in a tweet that \"the President's words [yesterday], telling four American Congresswomen of color 'go back to your own country' is hallmark language of white supremacists.\"[183] She later added, \"We don't leave the things that we love, and when we love this country, what that means is that we propose the solutions to fix it.\"[184] Days later, Trump falsely asserted that Ocasio-Cortez called \"our country and our people 'garbage'\"; she had actually said that Americans should not be content with moderate policies that are \"10% better from garbage\".[185] Trump also falsely claimed that Ocasio-Cortez said \"illegal immigrants are more American\" than Americans who tried to keep them out; she actually said that \"women and children on that border that are trying to seek refuge and opportunity\" in America \"are acting more American\" than those who tried to keep them out.[186] The Squad grew in 2020, 2022, and 2024, with Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Greg Casar, Summer Lee, and Delia Ramirez joining.[187] Ocasio-Cortez submitted her first piece of legislation, the Green New Deal, to the House on February 7, 2019. She and Senator Ed Markey released a joint non-binding resolution laying out the main elements of a 10-year \"economic mobilization\" that \"would phase out fossil fuel use and overhaul the nation's infrastructure.\"[188] Their plan called for implementing the \"social cost of carbon\" that was part of the Obama administration's plans to address climate change. In the process it aimed to create jobs.[188] According to CNBC, an initial outline the Green New Deal called for \"completely ditching fossil fuels, upgrading or replacing 'every building' in the country and 'totally overhaul[ing] transportation' to the point where 'air travel stops becoming necessary'\". The outline set a goal of having the U.S. \"creating 'net zero' greenhouse gases in 10 years. Why 'net zero'? The lawmakers explained: 'We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.'\"[189] Activist groups such as Greenpeace and the Sunrise Movement came out in favor of the plan. No Republican lawmakers voiced support.[190][191] The plan gained support from some Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker;[192] other Democrats, such as Senator Dianne Feinstein and House speaker Nancy Pelosi, dismissed the proposal (Pelosi has referred to it as \"the green dream, or whatever they call it\").[193] On March 26, Senate Republicans called for an early vote on the Green New Deal without allowing discussion or expert testimony. Markey said Republicans were trying to \"make a mockery\" of the Green New Deal debate and called the vote a \"sham\". In protest, Senate Democrats voted \"present\" or against the bill, resulting in a 57–0 defeat on the Senate floor.[194][195] In March 2019, a group of UK activists proposed that the Labour Party adopt a similar plan, \"Labour for a Green New Deal\". The group said it was inspired by the Sunrise Movement and the work Ocasio-Cortez has done in the US.[196] On July 20, 2020, U.S. Representatives Ted Yoho and Roger Williams accosted Ocasio-Cortez on the Capitol steps, where Yoho (as overheard by a journalist) called her \"disgusting\" and told her \"You are out of your freaking mind\" for recently suggesting that poverty and unemployment were driving a spike in crime in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic amid her ongoing advocacy for cutting police budgets. Ocasio-Cortez told Yoho he was being \"rude\". As she walked away from Yoho into the Capitol, Yoho called her a \"fucking bitch\".[197][198] Yoho addressed the matter on the House floor and, without naming Ocasio-Cortez, apologized for the \"abrupt manner of the conversation\" with her, claiming that \"offensive name calling, words attributed to me by the press, were never spoken to my colleagues\", and concluding: \"I cannot apologize for my passion\".[199][200] Ocasio-Cortez responded with a speech saying that the incident was emblematic of a \"culture ... accepting of violence and violent language against women ... In using that language, in front of the press, he gave permission to use that language against his wife, his daughters, women in his community, and I am here to stand up to say that is not acceptable.\"[201][202] In November 2021, Representative Paul Gosar posted a version of the title sequence of the anime series Attack on Titan on social media that he had edited with the faces of Ocasio-Cortez, Joe Biden, and himself superimposed on the show's characters, depicting Gosar attacking them with swords and killing Ocasio-Cortez. Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for law enforcement and the House Ethics Committee to investigate it as a threat.[203] Pelosi opened discussion on the House floor, saying that Gosar's actions demanded a response: \"We cannot have members joking about murdering each other or threatening the president of the United States. This is both an indictment of our elected officials and an insult to the institution of the House of Representatives. It's not just about us as members of Congress. It is a danger that it represents to everyone in the country.\"[204] When Republican House members refused to condemn the video, Ocasio-Cortez responded that she believed the video was \"part of a pattern that normalizes violence\", adding, \"I believe this is a part of a concerted strategy and I think it's very important for us to draw a strict line a strong line for material consequence\". She gave a six-minute floor speech, saying, \"This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar. This is about what we're willing to accept.\" The House voted to censure Gosar, mostly along party lines. The last time the House censured a lawmaker was in 2010.[205][206] In a nearly 90-minute Instagram Live video made in February 2021,[207] Ocasio-Cortez said that she had previously experienced sexual assault, and recounted her experience of fear during the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, when she was in her office (in the Cannon House Office Building).[208] She said she had hidden in her office bathroom before being startled by a Capitol Police officer who entered her office suite and shouted \"Where is she?\" before ordering her and her staff to evacuate to a different House Office Building. Ocasio-Cortez said the officer did not self-identify, and said she first believed the officer's voice was that of an attacker. She described sheltering in place in Representative Katie Porter's office and preparing for what she believed would be an assault by rioters on their offices.[209][210] She said, \"I had a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die.\"[211] Ocasio-Cortez gave her first major convention speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, where she was given a primetime slot.[212] She expressed support for the Harris-Walz campaign and heavily criticized Trump, calling him a union buster who would \"sell this country for a dollar if it meant lining his own pockets and greasing the palms of his Wall Street friends\". She leaned into her middle-class background and said that Harris would support the middle class because she is from it and understands it. Ocasio-Cortez also addressed the Israel-Hamas war, saying Harris was \"working tirelessly\" for a ceasefire and hostage deal.[213] The speech was well received, including by moderate and establishment Democrats. After the speech, Politico wrote that Ocasio-Cortez was one of the party's \"most celebrated stars\" and that the establishment acknowledged it.[214][215] The speech also led to speculation as to whether Ocasio-Cortez would run for higher office.[216][214][217][218] Ocasio-Cortez reacted to the 2021 Texas power crisis by organizing a fundraiser to provide food, water, and shelter to affected Texans. The fundraiser, which began on February 18, raised $2 million in its first day[219][220] and $5 million by February 21.[221] The money was given to organizations such as the Houston Food Bank and the North Texas Food Bank.[221] Ocasio-Cortez also traveled to Houston to help volunteers with recovery.[222] On April 15, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez and three other senators called a press conference to announce a bill that they had introduced to implement postal banking pilot programs in rural and low-income urban neighborhoods where millions of households cannot access or afford standard banking services. Ocasio-Cortez described the families she sees in her urban community who need to rely on check cashing companies that charge exorbitant interest rates due to the absence of mainstream banks. \"They'll show up to a check cashing place and imagine cashing your stimulus check...and having 10 to 20% of that check taken away from you.\"[223] On November 5, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez was one of six House Democrats to break with their party and vote against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, as it was decoupled from the social safety net provisions in the Build Back Better Act.[224][225] In September 2022, Ocasio-Cortez was asked about running for president. She said, \"I hold two contradictory things [in mind] at the same time. One is just the relentless belief that anything is possible. But at the same time, my experience here has given me a front-row seat to how deeply and unconsciously, as well as consciously, so many people in this country hate women. And they hate women of color. People ask me questions about the future. And realistically, I can't even tell you if I'm going to be alive in September [of 2022]. And that weighs very heavily on me. And it's not just the right wing. Misogyny transcends political ideology: left, right, center.\"[226] In June 2024, following reports that Clarence Thomas accepted undisclosed gifts from conservatives, Ocasio-Cortez said the Court was \"corrupted by money and extremism\" and undemocratic. She and Representative Jamie Raskin led a congressional meeting about the Court,[227] and explored options for holding justices accountable.[228] On June 25, they introduced the \"High Court Gift Ban Act\", which would impose restrictions on the gifts given to justices.[229] In July 2024, Ocasio-Cortez supported and co-led the \"DEFIANCE Act\", which would allow people to sue creators and distributors of non-consensual deepfake pornography of themselves, something that had previously been done to her.[230] On July 1, after the Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States that presidents have immunity from criminal prosecution for official actions, Ocasio-Cortez announced she would file articles of impeachment against justices. She said the court was corrupt and that Congress must defend the nation against an \"authoritarian capture\".[231][232] On July 10, Ocasio-Cortez officially introduced articles of impeachment against justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, co-sponsored by seven House Democrats. The resolution accused the justices of failing to recuse themselves from cases despite personal bias and not disclosing lavish gifts they received. The resolution cited the involvement of Ginni Thomas in attempts to overturn the 2020 election and the presence of \"Stop the Steal\" symbols on Alito's properties as personal bias.[233] In a statement, she said that corruption in the court had become a constitutional crisis that threatened democracy.[234][235] Legal experts said the case would likely fail, but was still important because it drew attention to the justices' conduct.[236] In December 2024, Ocasio-Cortez made a bid for ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, but lost to the more senior Gerry Connolly.[237] Ocasio-Cortez has been described as progressive,[242] left-wing,[243] left-wing populist,[244] and far-left.[245] Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America[9] and embraces the democratic socialist label as part of her political identity. In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, she described democratic socialism as \"part of what I am. It's not all of what I am. And I think that that's a very important distinction.\"[246] In response to a question about democratic socialism ultimately calling for an end to capitalism during a Firing Line interview on PBS, she answered: \"Ultimately, we are marching towards progress on this issue. I do think that we are going to see an evolution in our economic system of an unprecedented degree, and it's hard to say what direction that that takes.\"[247] Later at a conference she said \"To me, capitalism is irredeemable.\"[248] Ocasio-Cortez supports progressive ideals such as workplace democracy,[11] single-payer Medicare for All, tuition-free public college and trade school,[249] a federal job guarantee,[250] the cancellation of all $1.6 trillion of outstanding student debt,[251] guaranteed family leave,[252] abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,[253] ending the privatization of prisons, enacting gun-control policies,[254] and energy policy relying on 100% renewables.[255] She told Anderson Cooper that she favors policies that \"most closely resemble what we see in the UK, in Norway, in Finland, in Sweden\".[256] Ocasio-Cortez has rejected state socialism, calling it \"undemocratic\" and \"easily corrupted\", but has expressed support for worker control of the means of production.[257] She has also said that market economies are not incompatible with democratic socialism as long as workers control companies, citing worker cooperatives as a model.[258] Ocasio-Cortez supports raising the marginal tax rate on top income earners to fund the implementation of her policy goals.[259] She was among the 46 House Democrats who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[260] Ocasio-Cortez has called for reducing defense spending.[261] In December 2022, she was the only House Democrat to vote against an omnibus spending package because it increased funding for defense and federal agencies that oversee immigration.[262] In late 2020, Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib proposed a public banking bill to encourage creation of state and local public banks by giving them access to facilities from the Federal Reserve and setting national guidelines on public banking.[263] In April 2021, Ocasio-Cortez announced a bill that she and three senators had introduced to implement postal banking pilot programs in rural and low-income urban neighborhoods where millions of households cannot access or afford standard banking services.[223] Ocasio-Cortez has been a vocal supporter of labor rights, including a $15 per hour federal minimum wage.[264] In May 2019, she returned to bartending at the Queensboro Restaurant in Jackson Heights, Queens, to promote the Raise the Wage Act, which would increase the minimum hourly wage for restaurant servers and other tipped workers from $2.13 to $15. Speaking to restaurant workers, customers and reporters, she criticized an exemption in U.S. minimum wage law for restaurants and the service sector that allows them to be paid less than $7.25 per hour, saying, \"Any job that pays $2.13 per hour is not a job, it is indentured servitude.\"[265][266] On January 20, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez skipped the inauguration of Joe Biden in order to join the 2021 Hunts Point Produce Market strike in the Bronx.[267] In September 2019, Ocasio-Cortez introduced an anti-poverty policy proposal (packaged in a bundle called \"A Just Society\") that would take into account the cost of childcare, health care, and \"new necessities\" like Internet access when measuring poverty. The proposal would cap annual rent increases and ensure access to social welfare programs for people with convictions and undocumented immigrants.[268] According to the U.S. census, about 40 million Americans live in poverty. Ocasio-Cortez has proposed a marginal tax as high as 70% on income above $10 million to pay for the Green New Deal. According to tax experts contacted by The Washington Post, this tax would bring in extra revenue of $720 billion per decade.[269][270] But an analysis by the think tank Tax Foundation estimated that, after accounting for macroeconomic effects, the proposal would increase tax revenue by $189.1 billion over ten years if it is applied only to ordinary income, or decrease tax revenue by 53.1 billion if it is applied to all forms of income, including capital gains.[271] Ocasio-Cortez has opposed and voted against the pay-as-you-go rule supported by Democratic leaders, which requires deficit-neutral fiscal policy, with all new expenditures balanced by tax increases or spending cuts. She and Representative Ro Khanna have condemned the rule for hamstringing new or expanded progressive policies.[272][273] Drawing a parallel with the Great Depression, she has argued that the Green New Deal needs deficit spending like the original New Deal.[274] Ocasio-Cortez opposed a planned deal by New York City to give Amazon.com $3 billion in state and city subsidies and tax breaks to build a secondary headquarters (Amazon HQ2) that was expected to bring in $27 billion in tax revenue for the city and state, in an area near her congressional district, saying that the city should instead itself invest $3 billion in the district.[275][276][277] Some commentators criticized her remarks on the grounds that she did not understand tax breaks are discounts on money paid to, not by, the government, that \"New York does not have $3 billion in cash\" it would \"give\" to Amazon, and that between 25,000 and 40,000 new jobs, in addition to the high-paying tech jobs Amazon would have created, disappeared when Amazon left. Conservative columnist Marc Thiessen argued that \"her economic illiteracy is dangerous\" because \"by helping to drive Amazon away, she did not save New York $3 billion; she cost New York $27 billion.\"[278] In 2024, Ocasio-Cortez took part in a live-streamed roundtable with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, discussing \"efforts to check unlawful corporate power\".[279] Later, in response to investor and Harris supporter Mark Cuban saying that he wouldn't keep Khan, Ocasio-Cortez said \"anyone goes near Lina Khan and there will be an out and out brawl\".[280] Ocasio-Cortez has called for \"more environmental hardliners in Congress\",[274] calling climate change \"the single biggest national security threat for the United States and the single biggest threat to worldwide industrialized civilization\".[281] Referring to a recent United Nations report indicating that the effects of climate change could become irreversible unless carbon emissions are reined in within the next 12 years, she has argued that global warming must be addressed immediately to avert human extinction.[282][283][284] Ocasio-Cortez's environmental plan, the Green New Deal, advocates for the U.S. to transition to an electrical grid running on 100% renewable energy[192] and to end the use of fossil fuels within ten years. The changes, estimated to cost roughly $2.5 trillion per year, would be financed in part by higher taxes on the wealthy.[285][286][287] She has said she has an \"open mind\" about nuclear power's role in the Green New Deal,[288] but has been criticized for ignoring it in her proposals for the deal.[289][290] In 2024, Ocasio-Cortez, supported by Bowman and Sanders, introduced the \"Green New Deal for Public Housing\", a plan to fund the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) and help it transition to clean energy.[291] Ocasio-Cortez criticized the American companies Activision Blizzard and Apple for censoring pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.[292] She co-signed a letter to Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick that read, \"As China amplifies its campaign of intimidation, you and your company must decide whether to look beyond the bottom line and promote American values—like freedom of speech and thought—or to give in to Beijing's demands in order to preserve market access.\"[293] A bipartisan letter by Ocasio-Cortez and seven other lawmakers fiercely criticized the NBA's handling of a controversy involving a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The lawmakers wrote that the NBA's response not only \"sold out an American citizen\" but also \"reinforces the Chinese Communist Party view that those who point to Chinese repression in Hong Kong are as best stating opinions, not facts\", as well as being \"a betrayal of fundamental American values\".[294][295][296] Ocasio-Cortez voted to withdraw U.S. military aid for Saudi Arabia's intervention in Yemen,[297] and was among 56 Democrats to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.[298][299] Ocasio-Cortez criticized President Trump's administration for escalating tensions with Iran, saying that it would bring the country into a \"military conflict that is completely irresponsible\".[300] Ocasio-Cortez supported the Mahsa Amini protests, saying, \"right to choose belongs to us all, from hijabs to reproductive care\". This was criticized by the conservative Washington Examiner, which said that Iranian repression was not comparable to abortion restrictions.[301] In May 2018, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Israel Defense Forces' use of deadly force against Palestinians participating in the 2018 Gaza border protests, calling it a \"massacre\" in a tweet.[302][303] In a July 2018 interview, she said she was \"a proponent of a two-state solution\"[247] and called Israel's presence in the West Bank an \"occupation of Palestine\". After being asked to elaborate, she responded she was not \"the expert on geopolitics on this issue\".[304][305] Her use of the term \"occupation\" drew backlash from a number of pro-Israel groups and commentators.[306][304] Others defended her remarks, citing the United Nations' designation of the territory in the West Bank as occupied.[307][308] In July 2019, Ocasio-Cortez voted against a House resolution introduced by Representative Brad Schneider condemning the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel.[309] The resolution passed 398–17.[310] Ocasio-Cortez warned that Israel's planned annexation of Palestinian territories in the occupied West Bank \"would lay the groundwork for Israel becoming an apartheid state\".[311] She wrote to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that she would work to \"pursue legislation that conditions the $3.8 billion in U.S. military funding to Israel to ensure that U.S. taxpayers are not supporting annexation in any way\".[311] AIPAC condemned the letter, saying it threatened the U.S.-Israel relationship.[312] In May 2021, Ocasio-Cortez issued a statement condemning Israel's evictions of Palestinian families from their homes in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem.[313] She criticized President Biden for saying Israel \"has a right to defend itself\", arguing that \"blanket statements like these [with] little context or acknowledgement of what precipitated this cycle of violence—namely, the expulsions of Palestinians and attacks on Al Aqsa—dehumanize Palestinians [and] imply the US will look the other way at human rights violations.\"[314] On September 23, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez abruptly changed her vote from \"no\" to \"present\" on a bill providing $1 billion for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, citing the \"hateful targeting\" she had received surrounding the bill. She apologized for her vote after receiving criticism on social media from some supporters of Israel and of Palestine but maintained her opposition to the bill due to Israel's \"persistent human rights abuses against the Palestinian people\".[315] On July 18, 2023, Ocasio-Cortez and eight other progressive Democrats (Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Andre Carson, Summer Lee, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, Delia Ramirez, and Rashida Tlaib), voted against a congressional non-binding resolution proposed by August Pfluger that \"the State of Israel is not a racist or apartheid state\", that Congress rejects \"all forms of antisemitism and xenophobia\", and that \"the United States will always be a staunch partner and supporter of Israel\". She argued that it was wrong to pair \"accusations of antisemitism with real concerns around the human rights crisis in the region\" and that combining a \"vote on antisemitism and discussion of apartheid and...two-tier legal systems is very cynical\".[316] In 2023, Ocasio-Cortez condemned the October 7 attacks, calling them \"horrifying attacks against innocent civilians\".[317] On October 12, she criticized Israel's plans to block electricity, water and fuel from Gaza, calling it a \"collective punishment and a violation of international law\".[318] On October 16, she signed a resolution calling for a ceasefire in the war.[319] On March 22, 2024, she characterized Israel's assault on Gaza and the Gaza Strip famine as genocide.[320] Asked what the Biden administration could have done better in the situation, Ocasio-Cortez said it could have enforced its red line on the Rafah offensive, investigated its weapons shipments to Israel, provided heavier sanctions in response to the occupation of the West Bank, and \"rein in\" Netanyahu.[321] In a separate statement, she called for halting weapons transfers to Israel.[322] In January 2024, the U.S. and other countries cut funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) over intelligence reports that certain staff members participated in the Hamas attacks.[323] On January 29, Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged the reports, but said that cutting funding to UNRWA was \"unacceptable\" and that the U.S. \"should restore aid immediately\" because of the agency's humanitarian work.[324] Ocasio-Cortez boycotted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 2024 speech to Congress, calling him a war criminal.[325] On September 18, 2024, Ocasio-Cortez condemned Israel for the 2024 Lebanon pager explosions.[326] After the contentious confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Ocasio-Cortez urged Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to expand the court if he won and their party achieved a Senate majority.[327] In April 2021, she supported a bill to increase the Court's size.[328] She again called for expansion in September 2021 after the Court voted not to grant an emergency stay of the Texas Heartbeat Bill.[329] In March 2022, Ocasio-Cortez called on Justice Clarence Thomas to resign over his wife's texts urging President Trump's chief of staff to overturn the 2020 presidential election, raising a possible impeachment effort if he did not.[330] After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Ocasio-Cortez called for the impeachment of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. She alleged that the two had lied under oath about their views on Roe during their confirmation hearings.[331] In June 2022, after the Supreme Court made several consequential rulings and granted certiorari to Moore v. Harper, which has a potential impact on future elections, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the U.S. was \"witnessing a judicial coup in progress\".[332][333] The next month, she claimed the Court had \"gone rogue\" and that impeachment, expansion, introduction of ethics rules and recusal requirements should be considered. She added that Thomas should certainly be impeached.[334] Two days later, she led House progressives calling on the Democratic leadership in Congress to strip the Court of its jurisdiction \"in the areas of abortion, marriage equality, non-procreative intimacy, and contraception\". They pointed to Thomas's concurring opinion in Dobbs, which suggested revisiting cases that established a constitutional right to contraception, same-sex marriage, and gay sex.[335] In 2019, Ocasio-Cortez supported pay raises for Congress. She wrote, \"It's not a fun or politically popular position to take. But consistency is important. ALL workers should get cost of living increases. That's why minimum wage should be pegged to inflation, too.\" Members of Congress make $174,000 annually; the Speaker makes $223,500 and House leaders make $193,400. Republican Kevin McCarthy joined her in supporting the pay raise, saying he did not want Congress to be a place where only the wealthy can afford to serve. Colleagues such as Joe Cunningham opposed the measure, saying, \"We didn't come up here to give ourselves a raise\".[336] On June 28, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN she would support the first impeachment of President Trump, citing Trump's alleged violations of the Emoluments Clause and saying that \"we have to hold everyone accountable and that no person is above that law.\"[337][338] Ocasio-Cortez supported impeaching Trump a second time for his attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. On January 3, 2021, she said that the Trump–Raffensperger phone call constituted an impeachable offense, and called it a \"despicable abuse of power\".[339] After January 6, she and many other Democrats co-sponsored an article of impeachment against Trump. Ocasio-Cortez said that Trump should be permanently barred from office and impeached.[340] In April 2020, Ocasio-Cortez was one of 77 representatives to call for public reports of data on COVID-19 cases in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.[341] In March 2021, she and Representative Jamaal Bowman called on New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign, citing the sexual misconduct allegations against him as well as the New York COVID-19 nursing home scandal about the Cuomo administration's reported undercounting of COVID-19 nursing home deaths.[342] Ocasio-Cortez has called for \"solidarity with Puerto Rico\". She has advocated for granting Puerto Ricans further civil rights, regardless of Puerto Rico's legal classification. She advocates for voting rights and disaster relief. Ocasio-Cortez was critical of FEMA's response to Hurricane Maria and the federal government's unwillingness to address Puerto Rico's political status.[343] She believes the federal government should increase investment in Puerto Rico.[254] In August 2020, Ocasio-Cortez and Nydia Velázquez introduced the Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act of 2020, which was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.[344][345] On March 18, 2021, Ocasio-Cortez, Velázquez and Senator Bob Menendez introduced a new version, the Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act of 2021,[346] with over 70 co-sponsors in the House and seven co-sponsors in the Senate, including one Republican.[347] After the June 2024 presidential debate, Ocasio-Cortez, who previously supported Biden during the campaign,[348] said that she had spoken with Biden and that he made clear he was staying in the race. She said that she supported him and that her focus was defeating Republicans in the election.[349][350][351] Later, on July 19, she held an Instagram Live in which she said that replacing Biden was risky and legally challenging, but suggested that nominating Vice President Kamala Harris was better than an open convention.[352] When Biden withdrew from the race, she endorsed Harris.[353] Ocasio-Cortez supports transitioning to a single-payer healthcare system and considers medical care a human right.[354][355] She says that a single government health insurer should cover every American, reducing overall costs.[250] Her campaign website says, \"Almost every other developed nation in the world has universal healthcare. It's time the United States catch up to the rest of the world in ensuring all people have real healthcare coverage that doesn't break the bank.\"[355] Many 2020 Democratic presidential candidates adopted the Medicare-for-all proposal.[252] In June 2019 and in July 2021, Ocasio-Cortez proposed legislation that would remove restrictions placed on researching the medical use of psilocybin.[356][357] Ocasio-Cortez supports codifying the right to abortion, and is a member of the House pro-choice caucus.[358] On July 19, 2022, after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, she and 17 other members of Congress were arrested in an act of civil disobedience for refusing to clear a street during a protest for reproductive rights outside the Supreme Court Building.[359][360] Ocasio-Cortez campaigned in favor of establishing tuition-free public colleges and trade schools. She has said she is still paying off student loans herself and wants to cancel all student debt.[355] Ocasio-Cortez has expressed support for defunding and abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency on multiple occasions. In February 2018 she called it \"a product of the Bush-era Patriot Act suite of legislation\" and \"an enforcement agency that takes on more of a paramilitary tone every single day\".[361][362] That June, she said she would \"stop short of fully disbanding the agency\", and would rather \"create a pathway to citizenship for more immigrants through decriminalization\".[363] She later clarified that this does not mean ceasing all deportations.[364] Two days before the primary election, Ocasio-Cortez attended a protest at an ICE child-detention center in Tornillo, Texas.[365] She was the only Democrat to vote against H.R. 648, a bill to fund and reopen the government, because it funded ICE.[366] In June 2019, Ocasio-Cortez compared the detention centers for undocumented immigrants under the Trump administration at the Mexico–United States border to \"concentration camps\". She cited \"expert analysis\", linking to an Esquire article quoting Andrea Pitzer, author of One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps, who had made a similar claim.[367][368] Some academics supported Ocasio-Cortez's use of the term for the forced detention of immigrants;[369][370] others strongly criticized it, saying it showed disrespect for Holocaust victims.[371] In response to criticism from both Republicans and Democrats,[372] Ocasio-Cortez said they had conflated concentration camps (\"the mass detention of civilians without trial\") with death camps.[373] She refused to apologize for using the term: \"If that makes you uncomfortable, fight the camps, not the nomenclature.\"[374] In July 2019, Ocasio-Cortez visited migrant detention centers and other facilities in Texas as part of a congressional delegation to witness the border crisis firsthand. She called the conditions \"horrifying\". She said that women in one cell said they had not had access to showers for two weeks and were told to drink water from the toilet when their sink broke, and that one woman said that her daughters had been taken from her two weeks earlier and she did not know where they were.[375][376] In January 2021, Ocasio-Cortez expressed support for the Roadmap to Freedom resolution to guide future immigration policy championed by Representative Pramila Jayapal. The resolution aims to safeguard vulnerable migrants while reducing criminal prosecutions of migrants.[377] In February 2021, when the Biden administration reopened a Carrizo Springs, Texas, center to house unaccompanied migrant children, Ocasio-Cortez responded that such actions \"never will be okay—no matter the administration or party\".[378] For short-term measures to address the situation, she called for mandatory licensing for such centers and urged reconsideration of how the centers are \"contracted out\".[379] Ocasio-Cortez is a proponent of LGBT+ rights and equality. She has said she supports the community and thanked its members for their role in her campaign.[380][254] At the January 2019 New York City Women's March in Manhattan, Ocasio-Cortez gave a detailed speech in support of measures needed to ensure LGBT+ equality in the workplace and elsewhere.[381] She has also spoken in support of transgender rights, specifically saying, \"Trans rights are civil rights are human rights.\"[382] Later, she appeared on a video game live stream to help raise money for Mermaids, a UK-based charity for transgender children.[383] At the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on February 27, 2020, Ocasio-Cortez argued for LGBTQ equality in the context of her religious background. Referencing a Catholic hospital that refused a hysterectomy for a transgender man,[384] she argued, \"[t]here is nothing holy about rejecting medical care of people, no matter who they are, on the grounds of what their identity is. There is nothing holy about turning someone away from a hospital.\"[385][386] Ocasio-Cortez supports the \"defund the police\" movement. Asked to give her interpretation of the movement, she said: It looks like a suburb ... affluent white communities already ... fund youth, health, housing etc. more than they fund police. When a teenager or preteen does something harmful in a suburb ... White communities bend over backwards to find alternatives to incarceration ... Why don't we treat Black and Brown people the same way?[387] The MIT Lincoln Laboratory named the asteroid 23238 Ocasio-Cortez after her when she was a senior in high school in recognition of her second-place finish in the 2007 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.[23][24] Ocasio-Cortez was named the 2017 National Hispanic Institute Person of the Year by Ernesto Nieto.[25] In 2019, Ocasio-Cortez received the Adelle Foley Award.[391] She was named as one of the 2019 BBC 100 Women.[392] After the death of Ocasio-Cortez's father in 2008, her mother and grandmother moved to Florida due to financial hardship.[14][35] She still has family in Puerto Rico, where her grandfather was living in a nursing home[343] before he died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.[393] Ocasio-Cortez has said that \"to be Puerto Rican is to be the descendant of ... African Moors [and] slaves, Taino Indians, Spanish colonizers, Jewish refugees, and likely others. We are all of these things and something else all at once—we are Boricua.\"[16] She has said she has some Sephardic Jewish ancestry.[394] Ocasio-Cortez is a Catholic. She discussed her faith and its impact on her life and her campaign for criminal justice reform in a 2018 article she wrote for America, the magazine of the Jesuit order in the United States.[395] During the 2018 election campaign, Ocasio-Cortez resided in Parkchester, Bronx, with her partner, web developer Riley Roberts.[396][397][398] They became engaged in April 2022 in Puerto Rico.[399] In 2021, the watchdog group OpenSecrets, analyzing financial disclosure forms, ranked Ocasio-Cortez one of the least wealthy members of the 116th Congress, with a maximum net worth of $30,000.[400] In February 2021, Ocasio-Cortez said that she had been sexually assaulted.[401] That May, she said that she had been in psychotherapy after the January 6 United States Capitol attack, which she called \"extraordinarily traumatizing\", saying she \"did not know if I was going to make it to the end of that day alive\".[402] Ocasio-Cortez is a fan of the New York Yankees.[403]",

                "content": "The North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball program is a college basketball team of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Tar Heels have won six NCAA championships (1957, 1982, 1993, 2005, 2009, and 2017) in addition to a 1924 Helms Athletic Foundation title (retroactive). North Carolina has won a record 133 NCAA tournament matchups while advancing to 31 Sweet Sixteen berths (since 1975), a record 21 Final Fours, and 12 title games. It is the only school to have an active streak of reaching the National Championship game for nine straight decades (no other school has done it in more than six straight) and at least two Final Fours for six straight decades, all while averaging more wins per season played (20.7) than any other program in college basketball. In 2012, ESPN ranked North Carolina No. 1 on its list of the 50 most successful programs of the past fifty years. North Carolina's six national championships are third-most all-time, behind UCLA (11) and Kentucky (8). UNC has also won eighteen Atlantic Coast Conference tournament (ACC) titles,[2] and thirty-three ACC regular season titles.[3] The program has produced many notable players who went on to play in the NBA, including four of ESPN's top 74 players of all-time: Michael Jordan, James Worthy, Vince Carter, and Bob McAdoo (tied for most with UCLA).[4] Many Tar Heel assistant coaches and players have gone on to become head coaches elsewhere.[5] From the Tar Heels' first season in 1910–11 through the start of the 2021–22 season, the program has amassed a .735 all-time winning percentage (second highest all-time), winning 2,294 games and losing 829 games in 111-plus seasons.[6][7][8] The Tar Heels also have the most consecutive 20-win seasons, with 31 from the 1970–71 season through the 2000–01 season.[9] On March 2, 2010, North Carolina became the second college basketball program to reach 2,000 wins in its history. The Tar Heels are currently 3rd all-time in wins. The Tar Heels are one of only four Division I men's basketball programs to have achieved 2,000 victories. Kentucky, Kansas, and Duke are the other three. Carolina has played 182 games in the NCAA Tournament. The Tar Heels have appeared in the NCAA Tournament championship game twelve times, and have been in a record 21 NCAA Tournament Final Fours.[10] The Tar Heels have been selected to the NCAA Tournament 53 times (second-most all-time),[11][12] and have amassed 133 victories (most all-time).[11][12] North Carolina won the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in 1971,[2] and has appeared in two NIT Finals with six appearances in the NIT Tournament.[2] Additionally, the team has been the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament eighteen times, the latest being in 2024 (most No. 1 seeds all-time). North Carolina has been ranked in the top 25 of the AP Poll an all-time record 927 weeks,[13] has beaten AP No. 1 ranked teams 14 times,[14] has the most 25-win seasons with 38,[15] and has the most consecutive top-three ACC regular season finishes with 37.[16] North Carolina has ended the season ranked in the top 25 of the AP Poll 51 times and in the top 25 of the Coaches' Poll 53 times.[15] Furthermore, the Tar Heels have finished the season ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll six times and ranked No. 1 in Coaches' Poll seven times.[15] In 2008, the Tar Heels received the first unanimous preseason No. 1 ranking in the history of either the Coaches' Poll or the AP Poll.[17][18] North Carolina played its first game on January 27, 1911, beating Virginia Christian 42–21 at Bynum Gymnasium, the team's home from 1911 to 1923.[14] The team's first coach was Nat Cartmell. Cartmell was charged with illegally playing dice with known gamblers and was fired after the 1913–14 season. He would be replaced by Charles Doak.[19] In the 1914–15 season, UNC joined the SAIAA, and would compete in the conference through the 1920–21 season.[15] The 1917–18 team went 9–3 (7–0 at home) to finish 3rd in the SAIAA. On January 24, 1920, North Carolina beat Trinity College (Duke), 36–25, in the first-ever game of the Carolina-Duke rivalry.[15] In 1921, the school joined the Southern Conference.[20] Overall, the Tar Heels played 32 seasons in the Southern Conference from 1921 to 1953. During that period, they won 304 games and lost 111 for a winning percentage of 73.3%. The Tar Heels won the Southern Conference regular season title 9 times and the Southern Conference tournament 8 times. In 1924, the Tar Heels moved to the Tin Can for home games. From 1924 to 1938, UNC would go 130–20 (.867 winning percentage) at the Tin Can. Rudimentarily built of steel, attempts to heat the Tin Can failed, with ice often forming inside: The Tin Can was always freezing [...] they had icicles in the corners. To stay warm the electricians put those big-wattage bulbs under the benches, and we had blankets and wore heavy sweat clothes. Later on they did get central heat in there, but it was never adequate. You couldn't dress there. On February 29, 1924, UNC beat Kentucky, 41–20, in the first-ever game of the Kentucky–North Carolina rivalry. The 1923–24 Tar Heels squad went 26–0, and was awarded a national championship by the Helms Athletic Foundation in 1943 and later by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[21][22] In North Carolina's first five seasons in the SoCon (from 1921–22 to 1925–26), they went 96–17, won four SoCon regular season championships, and four SoCon tournament championships.[15] Their fast style of play and stingy defense earned these teams the nickname \"White Phantoms\", coined by sportswriter Oscar Bane Keeler of The Atlanta Journal,[23] used as an alternative nickname for the Tar Heels through 1950.[24] Cartwright Carmichael was the first Tar Heel to earn first-team All-America honors in any sport in 1923, and was again selected in 1924. Jack Cobb was UNC's first three-time All-America (1924, 1925, 1926), and was named Helms Foundation Player of the Year in 1926. George Glamack followed suit in 1940 and 1941, being named Helms Foundation Player of the Year also. Both Cobb and Glamack are honored with their numbers being retired (Cobb did not have a number).[15] In 1939, the Tar Heels relocated their home arena to the Woollen Gymnasium, where they would play until 1965. On March 21, 1946, under Hall of Fame coach Ben Carnevale and All-Americans Hook Dillon and Jim Jordan, North Carolina beat NYU, 57–49, for their first win in the NCAA Tournament ever. Later in the 1946 NCAA tournament, UNC advanced to their first ever Final Four, losing to Oklahoma A&M, 43–40, in the championship game.[15] For most of the first four decades of the program's history, North Carolina had very little consistency at the head coaching position, reflecting the lack of emphasis on the sport in much of the South at the time. The first coach, Cartmell, doubled as the track coach. From 1923 to 1926, three coaches led the program in as many years. Norman Shepard led the team to an undefeated season in 1923–24 while attending law school. He was succeeded by one of his players, medical student Monk McDonald, who in turn gave way to Harlan Sanborn. Other early coaches included baseball coaches Charles Doak and James Ashmore and assistant football coach Bill Lange. All told, from 1910 to 1946, no coach stayed in Chapel Hill longer than five years. Carnevale, who led UNC to its first Final Four, left after only two years. Tom Scott ran the program for six years from 1946 to 1952, but was pushed out in favor of Frank McGuire after two consecutive losing years. The modern era of Tar Heel basketball began in 1952, when Scott was pushed out after two consecutive losing seasons in favor of St. John's head coach Frank McGuire. School officials wanted a big-name coach to counter the rise of North Carolina State under Everett Case. On December 1, 1952, McGuire coached his first game at UNC with a 70–50 win over The Citadel.[15] In 1953, North Carolina split from the Southern Conference and became a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.[25] On December 12, 1953, UNC beat South Carolina, 82–56, in their first ACC game ever. On December 14, 1955, UNC routed then-No. 5 Alabama 99–77. It was UNC's first defeat of a nonconference opponent ranked in the top 10 of a major media poll. On January 14, 1956, All-American Lennie Rosenbluth scored 45 points in a 103–99 win at Clemson. On February 24, 1956, Rosenbluth had 31 points in a 73–65 win over Duke to clinch UNC's first-ever ACC regular-season title (shared with N.C. State). The following season, in 1956–57, Lennie Rosenbluth scored 40 in a Tar Heel win at Duke to finish with a perfect 24–0 regular season record (14–0 in ACC). Rosenbluth was named 1957 Helms Foundation Player of the Year. Furthermore, in 1957, the Tar Heels won their first ACC Tournament and first NCAA Championship. On March 23, 1957, No. 1 North Carolina beat Wilt Chamberlain and No. 2 Kansas, 54–53, in triple overtime as Carolina capped off a perfect 32–0 season as national champions.[15] C.D. Chesley, a Washington, D.C. television producer, piped the 1957 championship game in Kansas City to a hastily created network of five stations across North Carolina—the ancestor to the longstanding syndicated ACC football and basketball package from Raycom Sports—which helped prove pivotal in basketball becoming a craze in the state.[26] The title game was the only triple overtime final game in championship history,[27] which followed a triple overtime North Carolina defeat of Michigan State 74–70 the previous night. In 1961, the Tar Heels were placed on NCAA probation for a year for violating \"provisions prohibiting excessive entertainment\" of prospective players and providing \"improper financial assistance\" to the parents of players. As a result, they were barred from the 1961 NCAA tournament[28] and also withdrew from the 1961 ACC tournament. Following the season, Chancellor William Aycock forced McGuire to resign. As a replacement, Aycock selected one of McGuire's assistants, Kansas alumnus Dean Smith. On December 2, 1961, Carolina beat Virginia, 80–46, in Dean Smith's first game as head coach.[15] Smith's early teams were not nearly as successful as McGuire's had been. His first team went only 8–9, the last losing season UNC would suffer for 40 years.[29] On January 13, 1964, All-American Deakon Patrick scored 40 and had 28 rebounds in 97–88 win over Maryland.[15] On December 4, 1965, UNC beat William and Mary, 82–68, in the first game played at UNC's new home, Carmichael Auditorium. On December 16, 1965, Bobby Lewis scored a current UNC-record 49 points in a 115–80 win over Florida State.[15] Smith's first five teams never won more than 16 games. This grated on a fan base used to winning; in 1965 some of them even hanged him in effigy. Smith would go on to take the Tar Heels to a reign of championships and national dominance.[29] On March 17, 1967, North Carolina beat Princeton for Dean Smith's first NCAA Tournament win. Later, in the 1967 NCAA tournament, UNC beat Boston College to advance to Dean Smith's first Final Four, where they would lose to Dayton in the national semifinal. In 1968, Carolina appeared in their second consecutive Final Four. On March 23, 1968, they lost to Lew Alcindor and UCLA for the national title. On March 15, 1969, All-American Charlie Scott hit the game-winning jumper at the buzzer to beat Davidson, 87–85, to advance North Carolina to their third consecutive Final Four. On March 27, 1971, Bill Chamberlain scored 34 points as UNC beat Georgia Tech, 84–66, to win the NIT. On March 18, 1972, Carolina beat Penn, 73–59, to advance to their 4th Final Four in 6 years. All-American Bob McAdoo had 24 points and 15 rebounds, but fouled out with 13 minutes to play, as UNC lost to Florida State in the national semifinal. On March 26, 1977, the Tar Heels, back in the Final Four, edged UNLV, 84–83, in the national semifinal. Carolina, in the championship two days later, lost to Marquette, 67–59. On February 25, 1978, co-consensus National Player of the Year Phil Ford scored 34 points in his final game at Carmichael Auditorium, an 87–83 win over Duke. North Carolina returned to the Final Four in 1981. In the national semifinal, All-American Al Wood scored 39 in a win over Virginia. UNC would lose in the NCAA championship game to Indiana. The following year, North Carolina won their second NCAA championship. On March 29, 1982, Final Four MOP James Worthy scored 28 points and Michael Jordan hit the game-winning shot with 17 seconds to play as Carolina beat Georgetown, 63–62, to win Dean Smith's first national championship. On January 18, 1986, North Carolina beat Duke, 95–92, in the first game played in UNC's new arena, the Dean Smith Center. On March 24, 1991, Carolina beat Temple, 75–72, to advance to the Final Four for the first time since 1982. In the national semifinal, Carolina fell to former UNC assistant coach Roy Williams and Kansas, 79–73. In 1993, UNC won their third NCAA title. On April 5, 1993, Final Four MOP Donald Williams scored 25 points as Carolina beat Michigan, 77–71, for Dean Smith's second NCAA championship. On March 25, 1995, North Carolina beat Kentucky, 74–61, to advance to another Final Four. UNC would fall to Arkansas in the national semifinal. On March 15, 1997, North Carolina beat Colorado, 73–56, in the NCAA tournament second round for Dean Smith's 877th win, breaking Adolph Rupp's all-time record for coaches. On March 23, 1997, the Tar Heels beat Louisville, 97–74, for another Final Four appearance. Smith would coach his final game, a 66–58 loss to Arizona in the national semifinal, on March 29, 1997. After 36 years as head coach, Smith retired on October 9, 1997.[15] When he retired, Smith's 879 wins were the most ever for any NCAA Division I men's basketball coach (currently 5th all-time).[30] During his tenure, North Carolina won or shared 17 ACC regular-season titles and won 13 ACC tournaments. They went to the NCAA tournament 27 times–including 23 in a row from 1975 to 1997–appeared in 11 Final Fours and won NCAA tournament titles in 1982 and 1993. The 1982 national championship team was led by James Worthy, Sam Perkins, and a young Michael Jordan.[31] The 1993 national championship team starred Donald Williams, George Lynch and Eric Montross.[32] While at North Carolina, Smith helped promote desegregation by recruiting the university's first African American scholarship basketball player, Charlie Scott.[33] Smith unexpectedly retired before the start of practice for the 1997–98 season. He was succeeded by Bill Guthridge, who had been an assistant coach at the school for 30 years, the last 25 as Smith's top assistant. During Guthridge's three seasons as head coach, he posted an 80–28 record, making him tied for the then-NCAA record for most wins by a coach after three seasons.[34] The Tar Heels reached the NCAA Final Four twice, in the 1998 tournament and again in the 2000 tournament. North Carolina reached the Final Four in 2000 as an 8-seed, their lowest seeding in a Final Four appearance.[35] Guthridge retired in 2000 and North Carolina turned to Matt Doherty, the head coach at Notre Dame and a player on the 1982 championship team, to lead the Tar Heels.[36] Doherty had little success while at North Carolina. In his first season, the Heels were ranked No. 1 in the polls in the middle of the Atlantic Coast Conference schedule and finished with a 26–7 record. The bottom fell out the following year, as the Tar Heels finished the season with a record of 8–20, the worst season in school history. They missed postseason play entirely for the first time since the 1965–66 season (including a record 27 straight NCAA Tournament appearances) and finished with a losing record for the first time since 1962 (Dean Smith's first year as coach). They also finished 4–12 in the ACC—only the program's second losing ACC record ever. The 12 losses were six more than the Tar Heels had ever suffered in a single season of ACC play and placed them in a tie for 7th place—the program's first finish below fourth place ever. The season also saw the end of UNC's run of 31 straight 20-win seasons and 35 straight seasons of finishing third or higher in the ACC. After bringing in one of the top 5 incoming classes for the 2002–2003 season, the Tar Heels started the season by knocking off a top 5 Kansas team and going on to win the Preseason NIT and returning to the AP top 25. North Carolina went on to finish the season 17–15, but a 6–10 record in ACC play kept them out of the NCAA Tournament. Doherty led the Tar Heels to the third round of the NIT, where they ended their season with a loss to Georgetown. Despite the turnaround from the year before and the NIT appearance, at the end of the season Matt Doherty was replaced as head coach by Roy Williams. Williams had served as an assistant to Smith for 11 years before a successful 15-year tenure at Kansas, winning 9 conference regular season championships and taking his Jayhawk teams to four Final Fours. Smith himself convinced Williams to return home. Williams had also been courted by Smith for the UNC job when it had been open in 2000, but Williams had promised Nick Collison he would be at Kansas his entire college career and could not bring himself to leave Kansas at that time despite media speculation reporting Williams would take the job in 2000. Williams could not turn his mentor down a second time, so just two weeks after Doherty's resignation, Williams took the Carolina job. Williams was UNC's third coach in six years, the most turnover the program had faced since its early years. The previous two, McGuire and Smith, had covered a 45-year period. On November 22, 2003, Carolina beat Old Dominion, 90–64, in Roy Williams’ first game as head coach. In Williams' first season, the Tar Heels finished 19–11 and were ranked in a final media poll for the first time in three years. They returned to the NCAA tournament and were ousted in the second round by Texas. The following year, on April 4, 2005, the Tar Heels defeated Illinois, 75–70, to win their fourth NCAA title and Williams' first as a head coach.[37] After winning the championship, Williams lost his top seven scorers, but the 2005–06 season saw the arrival of freshman Tyler Hansbrough and Williams was named Coach of the Year. The Tar Heels swept the ACC regular season and tournament titles in 2007 and 2008. The 2008 ACC tournament was the first time North Carolina had ever won the ACC Tournament without defeating at least one in-state rival during the tournament.[38] North Carolina lost in the national semifinals of the 2008 NCAA tournament to Williams' former program Kansas. On December 18, 2008, Tyler Hansbrough scored his 2,292nd career point, breaking Phil Ford's UNC career scoring record. In the 2008–09 season, the Tar Heels won their fifth NCAA title by defeating Michigan State in the championship of the 2009 NCAA men's basketball tournament.[39] The Tar Heels won all six of that year's tournament games by at least 12 points, for an average victory margin of 20.2 points, and only trailed for a total of 10 minutes out of 240 through the entire tournament.[40] Wayne Ellington was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, the fourth Tar Heel so honored. The 2009–2010 Tar Heels struggled throughout the regular season finishing with a 16–15 record,[41] and dropped to No. 3 in Division I in all-time wins. They later lost in the first round of the ACC Tournament, playing in the first \"play-in\" Thursday game for the first time since the ACC grew to 12 teams. The Tar Heels did not receive an NCAA tournament bid, and instead accepted a bid to the NIT.[42] During the season, on March 2, 2010, Carolina beat Miami, 69–62, to become the second school in NCAA history to win its 2,000th game (North Carolina was in its 100th season of basketball at the time of this accomplishment). The Tar Heels made it to the final game of the NIT, losing to Dayton in the final game finishing with a 20–17 record. The 2010–2011 Tar Heels, with the addition of Harrison Barnes, Kendall Marshall, and Reggie Bullock, eighth in the preseason polls, struggled out the gates, starting with a 2–2 record, the worst start since the 2001–02 season. After losses to Illinois and Texas, the Tar Heels fell out of the rankings. The losses of senior Will Graves, to dismissal, and Larry Drew II, to transfer and also the unexpected off-season transfers of David and Travis Wear did not help matters. However, the Tar Heels improved greatly during the conference season, finishing first in the ACC regular season with a 14–2 record. Williams was named Conference Coach of the Year for his efforts of getting his team to work through the adversity to finish strong in the regular season.[43] Also during the season, the term Tar Heel Blue Steel was coined, referencing the Tar Heel men's basketball walk-ons. The term was started by one of the players, Stewart Cooper, in hopes that it would be a replacement for \"walk-ons\" and similar names, and soon enough Roy Williams caught on. North Carolina lost to Duke in the ACC Tournament Final and made a significant run in the NCAA Tournament until they were eliminated in the Elite Eight by Kentucky, finishing with a 29–8 record.[44] The 2011–2012 Tar Heels season started on November 11, 2011, as top-ranked Carolina beat Michigan State, 67–55, on the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson in San Diego. The Tar Heels finished the season with a record of 32–6, including a 14–2 ACC record to win the conference regular-season championship outright. The team fell to Florida State in the championship game of the 2012 ACC tournament and was a No. 1 seed in the Midwest Regional of the 2012 NCAA tournament; the team reached the Elite Eight and was defeated by Kansas 80–67. Before the Kansas game, the Tar Heels won their previous three games in the NCAA Tournament by an average of 13.7 points. In the second-round game versus Creighton, starting UNC point guard Kendall Marshall broke his right wrist with 10:56 remaining[45] in the second half with UNC leading 66–50. Marshall continued to play by dribbling primarily with his left hand and left the game with two minutes left with UNC leading 85–69. Williams announced the injury at the Creighton post-game press conference.[46] Marshall did not play in UNC's two following games in the NCAA Tournament, a 73–65 overtime win over Ohio in the Sweet 16 and the aforementioned 80–67 loss to Kansas in the Elite Eight. With the departures of several stars from the 2012 team, The Tar Heels would begin a slow climb back to the top following the Elite Eight loss. The 2012–13 season ended with a loss to Kansas in the tournament for the second year in a row. In 2013–14, the Tar Heels became the only team in men's college basketball history to beat every team ranked in the top 4 in the preseason.[15] The Tar Heels would finish 24–10 that year, ending the year by losing to Iowa State in the final seconds of the Round of 32. The 2014–15 team would improve, finishing the year 4th in the ACC and a Sweet 16 appearance, where they would lose to the Wisconsin. It was also the year that North Carolina would add Joel Berry II and Justin Jackson to the roster, who were both key contributors to the 2017 National Championship squad. In 2015–16, led by seniors Marcus Paige and Brice Johnson, the Tar Heels earned their 30th ACC regular season title, 18th ACC tournament title, and 19th Final Four.[15] They also appeared in their 10th NCAA title game, in which they lost on a buzzer beater to Villanova, despite Marcus Paige's dramatic three-pointer to tie the game with 4.7 seconds left.[47] The Tar Heels finished with a 33–7 overall record and a 14–4 ACC record. The following year, the Tar Heels were ranked No. 6 in the AP preseason poll, having lost Paige and Johnson but retaining 2016 ACC Tournament MVP Joel Berry II as well as forwards Kennedy Meeks and Isaiah Hicks. After early season losses to Indiana and Kentucky, the Tar Heels won their 31st ACC regular season title. Despite never being ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll and losing to Duke in the semifinals of the ACC tournament, the Heels earned a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. On March 26, 2017, Luke Maye hit a jump shot with 0.3 seconds left to beat second-seed Kentucky, 75–73, to advance to Carolina's record 20th Final Four. On April 3, 2017, Final Four MOP Joel Berry II scored 22 points as UNC beat Gonzaga, 71–65, to give Williams his 3rd national championship, surpassing mentor Dean Smith for NCAA Tournament championships.[48] Just as in the previous year, the Tar Heels finished with a 33–7 overall record and a 14–4 ACC record.[49] In 2017–18, the Tar Heels were ranked at No. 9 in the AP and Coaches poll. Forwards Isaiah Hicks, Kennedy Meeks, Tony Bradley,[50] and Justin Jackson had left, while the team added Cameron Johnson. This season, the team did not win the ACC regular season or tournament title. However, the Heels earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament and ended the season 26–11 after being eliminated by Texas A&M in the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament. In the 2018–19 season, the Tar Heels were led by freshman point guard Coby White, and seniors Luke Maye and Cameron Johnson. The Tar Heels were co-ACC regular season champions with Virginia, earned another Number 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, and made it to the Sweet Sixteen round before being eliminated by the Auburn Tigers.[51] 2019–20 was an unusually down year for the Tar Heels, only winning 14 games and being swept by arch-rival Duke in the regular season. Freshman point guard Cole Anthony's knee injury and a lack of depth on the bench proved devastating for the Tar Heels, as they were unable to carry momentum through ACC play, losing several games on last second shots after starting the season 6–1. The Tar Heels made it to the second-round of the ACC tournament before losing to Syracuse in what would turn out to be the final ACC tournament game played before the cancellation of the rest of the 2019–20 season due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.[52] Williams passed Smith's mark of 879 all-time wins in the COVID-shortened season. Heading into the 2020–21 season, expectations were high after the lackluster, injury-filled performance of the season prior. Coming into the season with a talented freshman recruiting class, the Tar Heels looked to rebound from their 14–19 record. Senior Garrison Brooks was picked as the preseason ACC Player of the Year yet failed to live up to the preseason hype. Sophomore forward Armando Bacot led the Tar Heels in scoring, and the emergence of freshman Kerwin Walton provided the Tar Heels with an outside shooter that had been missing on the previous year's team. However, the Heels stumbled out of the starting block, beginning conference play with an 0–2 record in the ACC. However, the Tar Heels rebounded, and returned the favor to the Blue Devils, sweeping them in the two regular season matchups. Freshman guard Caleb Love scored 25 points and 7 assists against Duke in Durham, breaking an at-Duke assist record set by Ty Lawson in 2009. On February 27, 2021, Williams earned his 900th career victory as a head coach against Florida State, becoming the fastest coach to reach that mark, over the fewest number of games. The Tar Heels finished with a record of 18–11, losing to Wisconsin in the first round of the NCAA tournament. On April 1, 2021, Roy Williams announced his retirement as the head coach of the Tar Heels after 48 years in coaching and 33 years as a collegiate head coach, 18 of which came at the helm of his alma mater.[53] Williams ended his coaching career with 903 career wins, 485 of which came at Carolina, and three national championships, all as the Tar Heel head coach. At the time of his retirement, Williams was third all-time in NCAA Division I victories. Williams is the first coach to earn 400 or more wins at two different schools. Athletic Director Bubba Cunningham announced that evening that a search for the next head coach would begin immediately, with the search being headed up by Cunningham and UNC-Chapel Hill chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz. Four days after Williams retired, assistant coach and former Tar Heel player Hubert Davis was hired as his successor. Davis, the nephew of Tar Heel and NBA great Walter Davis, became the first African-American to lead the program.[54] After an up-and-down start to the regular season that included some blowout losses, Davis' Tar Heels turned a corner in the latter part of ACC conference play. With a 70–63 victory against Louisville on February 21, 2022, Davis reached 20 wins in his first season as head coach. The team coupled the renewed energy and intensity with a shock 94–81 upset victory over Duke in Mike Krzyzewski's final home game at Cameron Indoor Stadium. The Tar Heels earned an 8 seed in the NCAA tournament and upset the defending champions and 1 seeded Baylor 93-86 in the second round, despite the ejection of UNC forward Brady Manek due to a flagrant-2 foul. The Tar Heels defeated UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen and Saint Peter's in the Elite Eight to earn a trip to the 2022 Final Four in New Orleans. In a rematch of the regular season finale against Duke, the Tar Heels defeated Duke 81–77 in the national semifinal in Mike Krzyzewski's final game as a head coach. The Tar Heels faced the Kansas Jayhawks in the National Championship game, during which they were unable to capitalize on a double-digit halftime lead and were defeated by a final score of 72–69, finishing the season as National Runner-Up. The team was preseason #1 the following season but never could find much consistency finishing with a disappointing 20–13 record and declining an NIT bid. Because of this, they became the first preseason #1 team to miss the tournament since it expanded to 64 teams in 1985. After Caleb Love and others decided to transfer after the season, Davis looked to the transfer portal to improve the team's fortunes. They landed Harrison Ingram from Stanford University, and Cormac Ryan, a graduate transfer student from Notre Dame University, while also landing Elliot Cadeau, who was considered the top point guard in the class of 2024. The changes in personnel definitely helped as the Tar Heels finished the regular season 25-6 and atop the ACC standings at 17-3 for their 33rd conference title in school history. Along with sweeping their archrivals, Duke Blue Devils Hubert Davis was voted ACC coach of the year while senior RJ Davis was voted ACC player of the year. Dean Smith was widely known for his idea of \"The Carolina Way\", in which he challenged his players to \"Play hard, play smart, play together\".[55] \"The Carolina Way\" was an idea of excellence in the classroom, as well as on the court. In Coach Smith's book The Carolina Way, former player Scott Williams said, regarding Dean Smith: \"Winning was very important at Carolina, and there was much pressure to win, but Coach cared more about our getting a sound education and turning into good citizens than he did about winning.\"[56] \"The Carolina Way\" was evident in many practices the players would implement, including pointing to the player who assisted in a basket, giving him credit as an act of selflessness. This \"Thank the Passer\" practice is used throughout basketball today.[57] The Tar Heels own several notable streaks in the history of college basketball. They appeared in either the NCAA Tournament or National Invitation Tournament (NIT) every year from 1967 to 2001. This includes 27 straight appearances in the NCAA tourney from 1975 (the first year that more than one team in each conference was assured of a tournament bid) to 2001—the longest such streak in tournament history until it was broken by Kansas in March 2017. The Tar Heels also notched 37 straight winning seasons from 1964 to 2001, the third-longest such streak in NCAA history, behind UCLA's streak of 54 consecutive winning seasons from 1948 to 2001, and Syracuse's streak of 46 seasons. They also finished .500 or better for 39 years in a row from 1962 (Dean Smith's second year) to 2001, the third-longest such streak in NCAA history, behind Kentucky's streak of 61 consecutive seasons from 1926 to 1988 (the Wildcats were barred from playing in 1952–53 due to NCAA violations) and UCLA's 54-season streak. From the ACC's inception in 1953 to 2001, the Tar Heels did not finish worse than a tie for fourth place in ACC play. By comparison, all of the ACC's other charter members finished last at least once in that time. From 1965 to 2001, they did not finish worse than a tie for third, and for the first 21 of those years they did not finish worse than a tie for second. All of these streaks ended in the 2001–02 season, when the Tar Heels finished 8–20 on the season under coach Matt Doherty. They also finished tied for 7th in conference play, behind Florida State and Clemson—only their second losing conference record ever (the first being in the ACC's inaugural season). Additionally, the Tar Heels went 59–0 all-time in home games played against the Clemson Tigers (the NCAA record for the longest home winning streak against a single opponent).[58] The Tar Heels' all-time home winning streak against Clemson lasted until the 2019–2020 season where Clemson stunned the Tar Heels in overtime, 79–76.[59] Until the 2010 ACC tournament, North Carolina was the only program to have never played a Thursday game in the ACC tournament since it expanded to a four-day format. The Tar Heels have three stretches of being ranked for more than 100 consecutive weeks in the AP Poll. They spent 172 consecutive weeks in the rankings from the start of the 1990–91 season until early in the 1999–2000 season, the second-longest streak in college basketball history at the time behind only UCLA's run of 231 consecutive weeks from 1966 to 1980. That streak has since been passed by Duke's run of 200 consecutive weeks from 1997 to 2007 and Kansas' 231 consecutive weeks from 2009 to 2021. They were also ranked for 171 consecutive weeks from 1973 to 1983, and for 106 consecutive weeks from 2014 to 2020.[60] North Carolina has 14 victories over the AP number one ranked team.[64][65][66][67] Eight players (including Jack Cobb, whose jersey did not have a number) have had their numbers retired. Tyler Hansbrough's number 50 is the eighth to be retired, after he won all six major player of the year awards during the 2007–08 season.[69] 51 former North Carolina men's basketball players are honored in the Smith Center with banners representing their numbers hung from the rafters. Of the 51 honored jerseys, eight are retired. In addition to the eight retired jerseys, an additional 43 jerseys are honored. Joel Berry II, Justin Jackson, and RJ Davis most recently qualified to have their jerseys honored.[71][72] To have his jersey honored, a player must have met one of the following criteria:[73] To date thirteen Tar Heels have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame Source:[95] UNC alumni defeated UCLA alumni 116–111 in an exhibition game in Los Angeles, CA on June 29, 1987.[102] The Carolina Basketball Museum[103][104] is located in the Ernie Williamson Athletics Center and contains 8,000 square feet (740 m2).[105] It was built to replace the old memorabilia room in the Dean Smith Center.[105] Designed by Gallagher & Associates, the cost of construction was $3.4 million.[105] The museum opened in January 2008.[106][107] The UNC junior varsity basketball team was originally used at North Carolina as freshmen teams because freshmen were not allowed to play on the varsity team until the NCAA granted freshmen eligibility in the Fall of 1972. After most schools decided to disband their J.V. squads, North Carolina's athletic department opted to keep the team so that non-scholarship students were given the chance to play basketball for UNC. North Carolina also uses their J.V. team as a way for varsity assistant coaches to gain experience as head coaches, such as the current coach, Hubert Davis. Roy Williams was a J.V. coach for eight years before he was hired at Kansas. Students at UNC are only allowed to play on the team for two years, and then they are given a chance to try out for the varsity. The J.V. team also serves as a way for coaches to evaluate players for two years on the J.V. so they will better know what to expect when they try out for varsity later in their careers. UNC's J.V. team plays a combination of teams from Division II and III schools, some community colleges, and a few prep schools from around the North Carolina area.",

                "content": "The Oklahoma City Thunder are an American professional basketball team based in Oklahoma City. The Thunder compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference.[8][9] The team plays its home games at Paycom Center.[10] The Thunder's NBA G League affiliate is the Oklahoma City Blue, which it owns.[11] The Thunder are the only team in the major professional North American sports leagues based in the state of Oklahoma.[12] Oklahoma City previously hosted the New Orleans Hornets for two seasons following devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.[13][14] The team was originally established as the Seattle SuperSonics, an expansion team that joined the NBA for the 1967–68 season. The SuperSonics relocated from Seattle to Oklahoma City on July 3, 2008, after a settlement was reached between the ownership group led by Clay Bennett and lawmakers in Seattle following a lawsuit.[15] In Seattle, the SuperSonics qualified for the NBA playoffs 22 times, won their division six times, advanced to three NBA Finals, and won the 1979 NBA Championship. In Oklahoma City, the Thunder qualified for their first playoff berth during the 2009–10 season. They won their first division title as the Thunder in the 2010–11 season and their first Western Conference championship as the Thunder in the 2011–12 season, appearing in the NBA Finals for the fourth time in franchise history and first time since 1996, when the team was based in Seattle. The Thunder's previous incarnation, the Seattle SuperSonics were formed in 1967. In their 41 seasons in Seattle, the SuperSonics compiled a 1,745–1,585 (.524) win–loss record in the regular season and went 107–110 (.493) in the playoffs. The franchise's titles include three Western Conference championships (1978, 1979 and 1996) and one NBA title in 1979. In their last season, they drafted franchise player Kevin Durant, setting up the Thunder for success. In 2006, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz sold the SuperSonics and its Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) sister franchise, the Seattle Storm, for $350 million to the Professional Basketball Club LLC, a group of Oklahoma City investors led by Clay Bennett.[16] The sale of the SuperSonics and Storm was approved by NBA owners the following October.[17][18] In 2007, Bennett announced that the franchise would move to Oklahoma City as soon as the lease with KeyArena expired.[19] In June 2008, a lawsuit brought by the city of Seattle against Bennett due to his attempts to break the final two years of the Sonics' lease at KeyArena went to federal court. Nearly a month later, the two sides reached a settlement agreement.[20] The terms awarded the city $45 million to get out of the remaining lease at KeyArena, and would have provided an additional $30 million payment to Seattle in 2013 if certain conditions had been met. The owners agreed to leave the SuperSonics name, logo, colors, banners, trophies, and records in Seattle for a possible future NBA franchise;[disputed – discuss][21][22] however, the items would remain the property of the Oklahoma City team along with other \"assets\", including championship banners and trophies.[disputed – discuss][23] On September 3, 2008, the team name, logo and colors for the Oklahoma City franchise were revealed to the public. The name \"Thunder\" was chosen in reference to Oklahoma's location in Tornado Alley and Oklahoma City as the home of the U.S. Army's 45th Infantry Division, the Thunderbirds.[24][25][26] The SuperSonics' final NBA draft was in 2008, and they used the fourth overall pick to select Russell Westbrook, a young point guard from UCLA, who would become the team's franchise player. The Thunder participated in the Orlando Pro Summer League featuring their second-year players, potential free agents and rookies. The players wore generic black and white jerseys reading \"OKC-NBA\" against an outline of a basketball. The Thunder's temporary practice facility was the Sawyer Center at Southern Nazarene University, which had been used by the New Orleans Hornets when they relocated to Oklahoma City after Hurricane Katrina.[27] The Thunder played several preseason games before the 2008–09 regular season, but only one of those games was in Oklahoma City. The Thunder made their first appearance in Billings, Montana on October 8, 2008, in an 88–82 preseason loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves.[28] The Thunder played their first Ford Center game on October 14 against the Los Angeles Clippers.[29] In their regular-season home opener, the Thunder faced (and lost to) the Milwaukee Bucks. Earl Watson scored the first points of the season with a layup. Three nights later on November 2, the Thunder won their first game by defeating the Timberwolves, improving their record to 1–3. The team then went on a 10-game losing streak before deciding on November 22 to fire head coach P. J. Carlesimo and assistant Paul Westhead. Assistant coach Scott Brooks then took over on an interim basis.[30] Oklahoma City lost its next four games to tie the franchise losing streak of 14 set in Seattle the previous season. But the team managed to prevent history by winning their next game on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies.[31] As the season continued, the Thunder began to improve. After starting 3–29, the Thunder finished the regular season 20–30 for the remaining fifty games. Not only were they winning more often, they played much more competitively than in the first part of the season. The team brought their record to 23–59 and improved upon their record of 20–62 from the team's final season in Seattle. The late-season successes of the Thunder contributed to the signing of Scott Brooks as the team's official head coach. After moving to Oklahoma City from Seattle, the team's operating situation improved markedly. In December 2008, Forbes magazine estimated the team's franchise value at $300 million—a 12 percent increase from the previous year's $268 million, when the club was located in Seattle.[32] Forbes also noted an increase in percentage of available tickets sold, from 78 percent in the team's last season in Seattle to 100 percent in 2008–09.[33] After an inaugural season filled with many adjustments, the Thunder hoped to improve during their second season in Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City did not make any major moves in the off-season, other than drafting James Harden from Arizona State University with the third overall pick in the NBA draft. The Thunder selected Rodrigue Beaubois with the 25th pick in the 2009 draft before immediately trading him to the Dallas Mavericks for the 24th pick, center Byron Mullens from Ohio State University. The team then added veteran center Etan Thomas and guard Kevin Ollie. The last major change to their roster occurred on December 22, 2009, when the team traded for Eric Maynor from the Utah Jazz. Maynor immediately supplanted Ollie as the backup point guard. From the outset the young team looked determined and cohesive. The increasing leadership of Kevin Durant, along with the growing experience of the Thunder's younger players, including future MVPs Westbrook and Harden, were signs of the Thunder's improvement. The 2009–10 season included several victories over the NBA's elite teams, including a 28-point win over the Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic and a 16-point win over the reigning NBA champion, the Los Angeles Lakers. Road victories over the San Antonio Spurs, Utah Jazz, Miami Heat, Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks further enhanced their reputation. Though they hovered around .500 for the first half of the season, they went on a 9-game winning streak that sent them into serious playoff contention. Kevin Durant became the youngest player in league history to win the scoring title, averaging 30.1 points per game while playing in all 82 games. The Thunder finished 50–32, more than doubling their win total from the previous season. The 50–32 record tied the 2008 Denver Nuggets for the most wins by an 8th seed in the modern playoffs era. The Oklahoma City Thunder also had the same record as the Boston Celtics in this season.[34] They finished fourth in the Northwest Division and eighth in the Western Conference playoff standings, and earned a spot in the 2010 NBA playoffs. On April 22, the team secured their first playoff win in Oklahoma City when they defeated the defending-champion Los Angeles Lakers 101–96. This was also the Thunder's first playoff win at the Ford Center. The Thunder would go on to tie the series at two games each, but the Lakers won the last two games in the series to win it 4–2. Oklahoma City ranked twelfth in overall attendance in the NBA, and seventh in percentage of available seats occupied (98.9 percent, including 28 sellouts in 41 home games).[35] The team's operating situation also continued to improve in 2009–10. Forbes magazine estimated the team's franchise value at $310 million (an increase of $10 million over the prior year) with an estimated operating profit of $12.7 million (the first operating profit in years for the franchise).[36] Financially, the Thunder organization continued to build on the positive returns experienced from relocating from Seattle to Oklahoma City. In January 2011, Forbes magazine estimated the franchise's worth at $329 million, up six percent from 2009–10 and ranking No. 18 in the NBA.[37] The magazine also estimated the franchise's revenue at $118 million and operating profit at $22.6 million—up 6.3 percent and 78 percent, respectively, from the previous year.[36][37] The Thunder finished the 2010–2011 season with a 55–27 record, a five-win increase from their breakout season the previous year. The team also captured their first division title since moving to Oklahoma City, and seventh in franchise history.[38] In the wake of a fourth-seed versus fifth-seed match-up against the Denver Nuggets, Kevin Durant scored 41 points in game 1 to set a new career playoff high. In the final game of the series, he again scored 41 and forward Serge Ibaka nearly tied the record for most blocks in a playoff game (10, set by Mark Eaton, Hakeem Olajuwon and Andrew Bynum) with nine blocks.[39] The Thunder won the series four games to one and were set to face off against the Memphis Grizzlies who achieved an eight-seed upset over the San Antonio Spurs just days before. The Thunder advanced to the Western Conference Finals with a seven-game series triumph over the Grizzlies. Durant was again the star, scoring 39 points in the clinching game 7, while Russell Westbrook also had a triple-double. Despite hard-fought battles with the eventual NBA champs, the Thunder fell to the Dallas Mavericks 4–1 in the Western Conference Finals. The Thunder had a chance to tie the series in game 4, but they were unable to hold a 15-point lead with five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. They ended up losing in overtime, 112–105. During the extended lockout, Thunder players played in exhibition games and even local pickup games to stay in shape.[40][41][42][43] When the abbreviated training camp began, Oklahoma City started with an intact roster and all players, except for Russell Westbrook. In addition, Kendrick Perkins lost more than 30 pounds during the lockout. The Thunder made their two pre-season appearances, after the lockout, against the Dallas Mavericks, winning both games. They won their first regular-season game against Orlando at home and went on a five-game winning streak. Kevin Durant became the sixth player to score 30 or more points in four consecutive games at the start of a season. In addition, the Thunder was the first to sweep their back-to-back-to-back games, winning a home-and-home series with the Houston Rockets, then routing the San Antonio Spurs. Thunder players Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Perkins and Ibaka made it onto the 2012 All-Star ballots. After the Thunder's win over the Utah Jazz on February 11, 2012, Scott Brooks was named as the head coach for the Western Conference All-Star squad for the 2012 NBA All-Star Game in Orlando, Florida. In the 2012 NBA playoffs, the Thunder swept the defending champion Dallas Mavericks in the first round to advance and face off against their first-round foes from 2010, the Los Angeles Lakers. They defeated the Lakers in five games and advanced to play the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals. The Thunder lost the first two games against the Spurs but won the next three including a game 5 road win, to take a commanding 3–2 game lead in the series. In game 6, the Thunder defeated the Spurs 107–99 and advanced to the 2012 NBA Finals. Durant led the way with 34 points, playing all of regulation time in the game. In the 2012 NBA Finals against the Miami Heat, the Thunder won the first game at home but then lost four in a row losing the series in five games. In the 2012 NBA draft, the Thunder selected Baylor University forward Perry Jones III with the 28th overall pick. The Thunder also signed free agents Hasheem Thabeet and Daniel Orton, and signed guards Andy Rautins and DeAndre Liggins. They re-signed forward Serge Ibaka to a four-year, $48 million extension. After failing to sign James Harden to an extension that was reportedly worth four years and $52 million, the team decided to trade Harden rather than having to pay the luxury tax penalty. On October 27, 2012, the Thunder traded Harden along with center Cole Aldrich and forwards Daequan Cook and Lazar Hayward to the Houston Rockets for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, first-round draft picks from Toronto and Dallas, and one second-round draft pick. Martin took over Harden's sixth-man role for the season. The Thunder finished with a 60–22 regular season, taking both the Northwest division title and top seed of the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced the 8th-seeded Houston Rockets, featuring former team member James Harden. In game two of the series, Russell Westbrook was struck by Rockets point guard Patrick Beverley, and fell down with an injury and missed the rest of the playoffs after having knee surgery. Without the team's second-leading scorer, the Thunder, who had a 3–0 lead, lost the next two games to bring the series to 3–2. In game 6, the Thunder defeated the Rockets to advance to the second round, facing a rematch of the 2011 second round, with the Memphis Grizzlies. The Thunder lost the series 4–1, losing four straight games after winning game 1 at home. In the 2013 NBA draft, the Thunder selected 12th pick Steven Adams, traded for the 26th pick André Roberson, and selected 47th pick Grant Jerrett. Kevin Martin was not re-signed, and he opted to join the Timberwolves, while the team were only able to add free agent Ryan Gomes and re-sign Derek Fisher to conclude their off-season movements. The team finished second in the Western conference with a 59–23 record. They met the Memphis Grizzlies for the third time in the playoffs, which set a record for most consecutive overtimes in a playoff series, with four. Oklahoma City prevailed in seven games to play the Los Angeles Clippers in the semi-finals, whom they defeated in six games. Their final playoff opponent, in the Western Conference Finals, was the San Antonio Spurs in a rematch of the 2012 Western Conference Finals, this time with the Spurs winning, 4–2. With the 21st and 29th picks in the 2014 NBA draft, the Thunder selected Mitch McGary from Michigan and Josh Huestis from Stanford. \"He brings energy, passion, and great basketball IQ and toughness what we value\" said Presti on drafting McGary.[44] Oklahoma City also signed Semaj Christon after acquiring his draft rights from the Charlotte Hornets.[45] On July 3, the Thunder signed Sebastian Telfair. But they lost shooting guard Thabo Sefolosha as his contract expired and he agreed to a three-year, $12 million contract with the Atlanta Hawks. Several weeks before the season started, the Thunder suffered a setback as Durant was diagnosed with a Jones fracture in his right foot and missed the first 17 games of the season. During the opening game against the Portland Trail Blazers, Westbrook scored 38 points, but found himself sidelined due to a small fracture in his right hand. He missed 16 games, during which Oklahoma City went 4–12. During the middle of the season Westbrook and Durant both came back, and similarly suffered more injuries. Durant was ruled out of the rest of the season in March, deciding to have foot surgery. Westbrook also had to undergo surgery in early March, to repair a fracture in the zygomatic arch bone of his right cheek. Several days later he returned and recorded several triple-doubles on his way to Western Conference Player of the Month honors from February to April. He also won the 2014–2015 NBA scoring title. However, despite the effort, the Thunder missed the playoffs due to a tiebreaker with the New Orleans Pelicans, and Westbrook fell short of the MVP award, finishing fourth in voting. They finished with a 45–37 record. On April 22, 2015, Scott Brooks was fired as the Thunder head coach. Billy Donovan was hired on April 30, 2015. This was Donovan's first major NBA coaching job, after he initially accepted and then left the Orlando Magic job in 2007.[46][47] With the 14th and the 48th picks in the 2015 NBA draft, the Thunder selected Cameron Payne from Murray State and Dakari Johnson from Kentucky. With Billy Donovan as the team's head coach the Thunder won the Northwest Division and clinched the third seed in the Western Conference. The team reached the Western Conference Finals for the fourth time in a span of six seasons, but was eliminated by the Golden State Warriors in seven games, after blowing a 3–1 series lead. After much speculation on the future of free agent superstar Kevin Durant, he announced on July 4, 2016, that he was joining the Warriors. The move to join the 73-win team from last season was heavily criticized by the public and sports media, with many comparing the move to LeBron James' 2010 off-season departure from Cleveland to the Miami Heat.[48] On July 7, Durant was officially introduced by the Warriors organization[49] and signed a two-year, $54.3 million contract,[50] with a player option after the first year.[51] On August 4, 2016, Westbrook agreed to a three-year extension to remain with the Thunder.[52] With an average of 31.6 points, 10.4 assists and 10.7 rebounds, Westbrook became the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double for an entire NBA regular season, and only the second in NBA history (the other being Robertson). On April 2, 2017, Westbrook tied Oscar Robertson's record for most triple-doubles in an NBA season (41); he broke the record on April 9 against the Denver Nuggets, marking his 42nd triple-double of the season. Westbrook, in that game, also hit the game-winning buzzer beater from 36 feet, ending the Nuggets' playoffs hopes and securing the Thunder's third-seed matchup with the Houston Rockets in the NBA playoffs. Oklahoma City lost the playoff series in the first round to the Rockets 4–1. Despite the team's loss, Westbrook averaged a +14 while on the court and a triple-double during the series and was named league MVP after the season. In the 2017 NBA draft, the Thunder selected guard Terrance Ferguson with the 21st pick, and signed him to a four-year rookie-scale contract.[53] To further bolster the roster and improve Westbrook's supporting cast, the Thunder's front office made a series of aggressive moves to reshape the team. On July 6, 2017, the Thunder acquired four-time All-Star forward Paul George in a trade with the Indiana Pacers in exchange for guard Victor Oladipo and forward Domantas Sabonis.[54] The team then signed veteran point guard Raymond Felton and sharp-shooting power forward Patrick Patterson in free agency on July 10.[55][56] Finally, on September 25, the Thunder acquired ten-time All-Star forward Carmelo Anthony from the New York Knicks in exchange for center Enes Kanter, forward Doug McDermott, and a 2018 second-round draft pick they had previously acquired from the Chicago Bulls in the Cameron Payne trade.[57][58] On September 29, 2017, the Thunder signed its star point guard Russell Westbrook to a five-year extension.[59] The Thunder finished the 2017–18 season with a 48–34 record and lost to the Utah Jazz 4–2 in the first round of the playoffs. In the 2018 NBA draft, the Thunder selected guard Devon Hall with the 53rd pick and forward Kevin Hervey with the 57th pick.[60] Hall did not sign with the Thunder, instead signing with the Cairns Taipans of the Australian National Basketball League.[61] Hervey signed with the Thunder's NBA G League affiliate, Oklahoma City Blue.[62] Additionally, the Thunder traded a 2019 second-round pick to acquire Hamidou Diallo, who had been selected by the Brooklyn Nets with the 45th pick.[63] Diallo signed a three-year contract with the Thunder.[64] On July 6, 2018, Paul George re-signed with the Thunder.[65] In July 2018, the Thunder traded forward Carmelo Anthony and a 2022 protected first-round pick to the Atlanta Hawks in a three-way trade. In the trade, the Thunder acquired guard Dennis Schröder from the Hawks and forward Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot from the Philadelphia 76ers.[66] The Thunder also acquired guard Deonte Burton, signing him to a two-way contract with the Oklahoma City Blue.[67] Additionally, the Thunder acquired center Nerlens Noel in free agency,[68] and traded for Abdel Nader from the Boston Celtics.[69] General manager Sam Presti traded Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers on July 10, 2019. In return, they received Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and a record collection of future first-round draft picks. It was reported after the trade was announced that George had privately requested the trade to the Clippers as a result of superstar free agent Kawhi Leonard convincing George to team up with him on the Clippers.[70] They also traded forward Jerami Grant to the Denver Nuggets for a 2020 protected first-round pick. After the George trade, general manager Presti sensed that the future of the franchise was in jeopardy as the team could not seriously contend with Westbrook as the lone star. On July 16, the Thunder traded Westbrook to the Houston Rockets. In exchange, the Thunder received Chris Paul, two future first-round draft picks, and the rights to two future pick swaps with the Rockets.[71] Paul made the 2020 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve, making it his tenth selection, and his first since 2016. Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Thunder were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season.[72] The Thunder were eliminated in 7 games vs Paul’s former team, the Houston Rockets. Following the season, Billy Donovan's contract was not renewed, and both sides agreed to mutually part ways.[73] On November 11, 2020, Mark Daigneault was promoted from the assistant coach position to become the new head coach.[74] Before the start of the 2020–21 NBA season, Chris Paul was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Kelly Oubre Jr., Ricky Rubio, two additional players and a 2022 first-round draft pick.[75] Oubre, Rubio and several Thunder veterans from the 2019–20 season, such as Steven Adams, Dennis Schröder and Danilo Gallinari, were traded away in the next several days as well, with Thunder receiving draft picks as part of compensation in most of those transactions. Overall, Thunder executed 14 separate trades after the end of the 2019–20 season and before the 2021 trade deadline. Five-time NBA All-Star Al Horford was one of the players acquired before the season.[76] After one season, he was also traded for four-time All-Star Kemba Walker,[77] with Thunder acquiring first-round draft picks as well in both transactions. By the summer of 2021, Thunder accumulated 36 total draft picks over the next seven years, 18 in the first round and 18 in the second.[78] In the 2021 NBA draft, Thunder drafted Josh Giddey, Alperen Şengün and Tre Mann with their first-round picks, Şengün was then traded for two future draft picks. On August 6, 2021, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander signed a 5-year maximum contract extension worth $172 million.[79][80] On the same day, Thunder waived Kemba Walker after he agreed to a buy-out.[81] On May 1, 2021, the Thunder lost at home to the Indiana Pacers by 57 points, 152–95, the largest regular-season home loss in NBA history and one point less than the record-holding New Orleans Hornets home playoff loss in 2009.[82] During the next season, on December 2, 2021, the Thunder lost on the road to the Memphis Grizzlies by 73 points, 79–152, the largest loss in NBA history. [83] At the 2022 NBA draft, the Thunder used their second overall pick to select Chet Holmgren and the twelfth pick to select Jalen Williams.[84] On August 25, 2022, it was announced that Holmgren would miss the entire 2022–23 NBA season due to a Lisfranc injury in his foot that occurred during a Pro-am game.[85] In the 2022–23 season, the Thunder finished regular season with the 10th-best record in the Western conference, qualifying for the play-in-tournament. After defeating the New Orleans Pelicans in their first play-in game,[86] the Thunder lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves and did not qualify for the playoffs despite SGA’s leap to superstardom, averaging 31.1 Points Per Game.[87] In the 2023–24 season, the Thunder acquired former All-Star Gordon Hayward. Chet Holmgren returned from injury and made an immediate impact as a rookie, Jalen Williams improved and Gilgeous-Alexander made his second All Star team and would later place second in MVP Voting. On March 31, against the New York Knicks, the Thunder officially clinched a playoff berth with a 113–112 victory. This is their first playoff berth since the 2019–20 season. The Thunder finished with a record of 57 wins and 25 losses, clinching the top seed in the Western Conference for the first time since 2013. Mark Daigneault won the Coach Of The Year Award as the Thunder swept the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round becoming the youngest team to ever win a playoff series at an average age of 25 years old, but would lose to Luka Doncic’s Dallas Mavericks in six games, even though they were up 17 points at one point in the deciding game six. Their first move in the offseason was trading starting guard Josh Giddey for the Chicago Bulls' elite defending guard Alex Caruso. Isaiah Hartenstein was also signed as a backup to Chet Holmgren who was now entering his Sophomore Year. The Thunder signed Nikola Topic and Dillon Jones to rookie contracts[88] as the Thunder went into the 2024-25 season with sky-high expectations.[89] After 10 game of exceptional play by Chet Holmgren, Chet went down with a pelvic fracture and was announced to miss at least 8 weeks of basketball leaving the Thunder short handed with Hartenstein also being out.[90] List of the last five seasons completed by the Thunder. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Oklahoma City Thunder seasons. Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage Note: All arenas used before 2008 were used by the defunct Seattle SuperSonics franchise. Seattle arenas had hosted two NBA All-Star Games; the 1974 game in Seattle Center Coliseum and the 1987 game in the Kingdome, where SuperSonics forward Tom Chambers grabbed MVP honors. Opened on June 8, 2002, as the Ford Center, Paycom Center was built without luxury accommodations but designed to accommodate luxury \"buildouts\" should a professional sports franchise make the Paycom Center their home arena. It was finished at a cost of $89.2 million.[92] A plan for such build-out improvements began in 2007. It came in the wake of the acquisition of the Seattle SuperSonics by an Oklahoma City-based ownership group the previous October. A city ballot initiative approved by a 62 percent margin on March 4, 2008, extended a prior one-cent city sales tax for a period of 15 months in order to fund $101 million in budgeted improvements to the arena and a separate $20 million practice facility for a relocated franchise.[93] Renovation work on the arena was delayed by a sales tax-receipts shortfall during the 2008–10 economic crisis.[94] Revised plans limited the size of a new glass entryway and eliminated a practice court to accommodate the shortfall.[95] Major construction work on the arena expansion was also delayed from the summer of 2010 to the summer of 2011. Seating capacity of the stadium is 18,203 for professional NBA basketball games. Similar revisions were made to the plans for the Thunder's separate practice facility, for a total savings of approximately $14 million.[96] The Thunder's practice facility completion date was pushed back to approximately March 2011.[97] Chesapeake Energy, which had naming rights after 2011 filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 28, 2020, with a debt of $9 billion, with the effect on the arena's naming rights not yet known at that time.[98] However, on April 20, 2021, the company terminated the deal as part of its corporate restructuring. The arena retained its name during the Thunder's search for a new sponsor.[99] On July 27, 2021, it was announced that Paycom will acquire the naming rights for the arena for a 15-year period, renaming it Paycom Center.[100] On September 12, 2023, Oklahoma City announced they were planning on building a new downtown arena for the Thunder at the cost of at least $900 million and with an estimated 2029 opening.[101] The team's owner requested that Oklahoma City provide most of the funding for the stadium construction cost. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt, an avid supporter of the stadium subsidy, stated that he was confident that the team would leave Oklahoma City unless the city paid for the new stadium.[102] In a December 2023 referendum, Oklahoma City voters voted to pay for at least $850 million of the cost of the stadium while the team, valued at $3 billion, would pay $50 million.[103][104] Economics professor J.C. Bradbury, who specializes in the study of stadium subsidies, wrote of the agreement, \"It is by far the worst stadium deal I've ever seen negotiated from a public standpoint.\"[103] Note: All mascots used before 2008 were used by the original Seattle SuperSonics franchise. On February 17, 2009, Rumble the Bison was introduced as the Oklahoma City Thunder mascot during halftime of a game against the New Orleans Hornets.[105] Rumble was the winner of the 2008–2009 NBA Mascot of the Year.[106] During the 2012 NBA Finals, sportswriter Bill Simmons published a piece on the team's fan base in his ESPN-sponsored Web outlet, Grantland.com, in which he noted the unusual enthusiasm of the city for its team: With the possible exception of Portland, no NBA team means more to its city. This goes beyond having the loudest fans. There's genuine devotion here. These people arrived a good 45 minutes early for last night's Game 1—and by \"these people\" I mean \"everyone with a ticket\"—then clapped their way through pregame warm-ups with such infectious enthusiasm that I remember saying to a friend, \"No way these yahoos keep this up for three hours, they're going to burn out.\" Wrong. You know what burned out? My eardrums. My head is still ringing.[107] Simmons speculated that the Oklahoma City bombing played a major part in the team's culture, noting that Thunder general manager Sam Presti has every new Thunder player visit the Oklahoma City National Memorial, and encourages players to look into the stands and consider that many of the team's fans were personally affected by the event. He also noted, however, that the fact that the Thunder is the only team from Oklahoma City (or indeed the state of Oklahoma) in one of the nation's four major leagues contributes mightily to the city's devotion.[107] Thunder fans are also reportedly much more likely to attend major home games than most other NBA fanbases. According to a source in the ticket industry, only five percent of tickets to the 2012 NBA conference finals listed for sale on secondary market sites such as StubHub were for Thunder home games, and for every ticket listed for a Thunder home game in the 2012 NBA Finals, 10 tickets for Heat home games were listed.[107] The team and its fanbase regularly use the slogan \"Thunder Up!\" which was prominently displayed on T-shirts during the 2012 playoffs. However, attendance has suffered as of late. The Thunder ranked 28th out of 30 teams in attendance in the 2021–22 season, only filling under 82 percent of their arena.[108] Roster Last transaction: December 10, 2024 The Thunder hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[109] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.

On March 20, 2019, the club officially retired number 4 in honor of Nick Collison, who played for the team from 2003 to 2018.[110] As the Thunder's original iteration, the Seattle SuperSonics had retired six numbers. In addition, the SuperSonics awarded an honorary microphone to longtime broadcaster Bob Blackburn, who had called the majority of the team's games from 1967 through 1992.[111][112] Notes: For the complete list of Seattle SuperSonics general managers, see: Seattle SuperSonics general managers. The Oklahoma City Thunder unveiled their first logo on September 3, 2008. According to majority owner Clay Bennett, the team's logo takes several of its elements from other Oklahoma sports teams, such as the Oklahoma Sooners and Oklahoma State Cowboys and Cowgirls.[24][115][116] The uniform design was unveiled on September 29, 2008.[117][118][119] An alternate uniform was unveiled on November 8, 2012, featuring only navy blue and white colors. Unlike their regular uniforms, the wordmarks on the alternate are written vertically.[120][121] A second alternate uniform was unveiled on March 1, 2015. A white uniform with sleeves, it features the Thunder partial logo in the center of the chest, and the shorts showcase bolts in light blue and sunset colors.[122] A third alternate uniform was unveiled on September 25, 2015. A sunset-colored uniform, it features the Oklahoma City abbreviation \"OKC\" in navy block letters trimmed in white. On the back of the jersey, player names sit below the numbers. The shorts display a sunset base with navy panels down the side showcasing the Thunder partial logo on each leg. The Thunder wore the sunset alternates for 18 games in the 2015–2016 season, including all 13 of its Sunday games.[123] Moving to Nike in 2017, the Thunder kept their existing white (\"Association\") and blue (\"Icon\") uniforms almost intact with the exception of the \"OKC\" abbreviation on the beltline and truncated shoulder stripes.[124] The team also released a new alternate \"Statement\" uniform with an italicized \"OKC\" lettering in sunset orange and a navy base with blue gradients that evoke sound waves generated from the team's fan base.[125] The Thunder also collaborated with Nike to produce annual \"City\" edition uniforms that intend to pay tribute to local cultures or team traditions. The 2017–18 \"City\" uniform featured a grey base with sunset orange and blue lines that were inspired by the Thunder's uptempo style.[126] For 2018–19, the Thunder's \"City\" uniform featured a turquoise base and bold white lettering with navy and sunset orange trim; the uniform was inspired by Oklahoma's Native American heritage.[127] Nike also released an \"Earned\" uniform starting with the 2018–19 season and were only given to the 16 teams who qualified in the 2018 NBA playoffs. The Thunder's \"Earned\" uniform was a basic palette swap of the team's \"Statement\" uniforms, featuring a sunset orange base and navy letters.[128] Beginning with the 2019–20 season, the Thunder unveiled new uniforms. The white \"Association\" uniform now featured the city name in front along with the outline of the state of Oklahoma on the beltline. The front of the blue \"Icon\" uniform now reads the team name in front while keeping the OKC acronym on the beltline. Their sunset orange \"Earned\" uniforms from the previous season became the basis of their new \"Statement\" uniform, albeit with lighter blue lettering. A new \"City\" uniform for the season commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing and it featured a black and gold palette.[3][129] The \"City\" uniform for 2020–21 contained a black base along with the Thunder's signature blue and orange colors splashed throughout. The uniform featured the state name \"Oklahoma\" in front as homage to the state itself.[130] As in 2019, the Thunder's appearance in the 2020 NBA playoffs gave them an \"Earned\" uniform for the 2021 season. The uniform featured a navy blue base with \"Thunder\" written in white with light blue drop shadows. Orange was noticeably absent on the uniform.[131] The Thunder's 2021–22 \"City\" uniform mixed various elements from their previous and current uniforms. The white and gray uniform featured the vertically arranged \"OKC\" lettering on the right chest (taken from the 2012–16 navy alternates), the white and gray patterns within the \"OKC\" lettering (taken from the 2017–19 \"Statement\" uniforms), the white and gray sash on the left leg (taken from the 2018–19 \"City\" uniforms), and the generic logo the Thunder first used in 2008 on the waist.[132] For the Thunder's 2022–23 \"City\" uniform, they went with a black base, blue letters and red, orange and white accents in honor of the people of Oklahoma.[133] The \"City\" uniform for the 2023–24 season is a black and blue base with orange \"OKC\" lettering and gold numbers. The uniform also featured sublimated images of various Thunder logos and wordmarks, and were meant to pay tribute to the city's renaissance.[134] This look was further developed for the 2024–25 \"City\" uniform, which like the 2022–23 \"City\" uniform, featured just the state name of \"Oklahoma\" in front. The black-based uniform had blue stripes with sublimated Thunder logos, along with gold letters.[135] All Thunder games are broadcast on the Thunder Radio Network, fronted by flagship stations WWLS-FM (98.1) and KWPN (640 AM) in Oklahoma City. Matt Pinto is the radio voice of the Thunder.[136] For their first two seasons, the Thunder's TV broadcasts were split between Fox Sports Oklahoma (a regional fork of Fox Sports Southwest), which broadcast most of the games, and independent station KSBI (channel 52), with around 65 Thunder games airing during the season and more than half of the games available in HD on Fox Sports Oklahoma, along with other team-related programming such as pre-game shows. Around 15 to 20 regular-season games were broadcast over the air on KSBI, which had a network of re-broadcasters spanning the entire state. All televised games are called by Brian Davis on play-by-play and Michael Cage as color commentator.[137][138] During the 2009–10 season, KSBI telecast all Thunder games it aired in high definition (KSBI had previously aired in HD the first regular-season game played at the Ford Center—against the Milwaukee Bucks on October 29, 2008—while all other games during the 2008–09 season were telecast on KSBI in standard definition). On August 3, 2010, the Thunder signed a new exclusive multi-year agreement with Fox Sports Oklahoma (since rebranded as Bally Sports Oklahoma as of 2021), beginning with the 2010–11 season, ending the team's broadcasts on KSBI.[139] On October 22, 2012, the Thunder announced that Lesley McCaslin would be the new Thunder sideline reporter.[140] On July 21, 2014, the Thunder announced that Long would not return to be its TV color commentator on Fox Sports Oklahoma.[141] On September 17, 2014, the Oklahoma City Thunder announced that 15-year NBA veteran Michael Cage would be the new color analyst, joining Brian Davis on television and Matt Pinto on the radio when the game is exclusive to a national television broadcast.[142] Davis was replaced as the television play-by-play announcer by Chris Fisher prior to the 2018–19 season.[143] As a result of the bankruptcy of Bally Sports parent company Diamond Sports Group, in January 2024, the Thunder reached an agreement with Griffin Media to air a package of eight Friday night games on local over-the-air stations within the team's territory during the remainder of the 2023–24 NBA season.[144] Games will air on Griffin-owned KSBI/Oklahoma City and KOTV-DT3/Tulsa, and syndicated to stations owned by Gray Television (KSWO-DT3/Lawton and KSCW-DT/Wichita) and Morgan Murphy Media (KOAM-TV–KFJX–KFJX-DT3/Joplin–Pittsburg).[145]",

            {
                "title": "Aaron Rodgers - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Aaron Charles Rodgers (born December 2, 1983) is an American professional football quarterback for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the California Golden Bears (where he set several career passing records, including lowest single-season and career interception rates[1]), before being selected in the first round of the 2005 NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers, spending 18 seasons with the team.[2] He is regarded among the greatest[3] and most talented quarterbacks of all time.[4] After backing up Brett Favre for the first three years of his NFL career, Rodgers became the Packers' starting quarterback in 2008. In the 2010 season, he led them to a victory in Super Bowl XLV, earning the Super Bowl MVP. He was named Associated Press Athlete of the Year in 2011,[5] and was voted league MVP by the Associated Press for the 2011, 2014, 2020, and 2021 NFL seasons. Rodgers is the fifth player to win NFL MVP in consecutive seasons, joining Peyton Manning, Favre, Joe Montana and Jim Brown. Rodgers has led the NFL six times in touchdown-to-interception ratio (2011, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2020, 2021);[6] six times in lowest passing interception percentage (2009, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021);[7] four times in passer rating (2011, 2012, 2020, 2021);[8] and four times in touchdown passing percentage (2011, 2012, 2020, 2021);[9] three times in total touchdowns (2011, 2016, 2020); twice in touchdown passes (2016, 2020)[10] and once in yards per attempt (2011) and completion percentage (2020).[11] Rodgers is first on the NFL's all-time regular-season career passer rating list, with a regular-season career passer rating of over 100 (the first to ever have a career rating over 100) while also having had the highest passer rating, the best touchdown-to-interception ratio and the lowest passing interception percentage in NFL history throughout the entire 2010s decade. In the postseason, he is second in both touchdown passes and touchdown-to-interception ratio, fourth in passing yards, and fifth in all-time passer rating. In the regular season, he has the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in NFL history at 4.53,[12] holds the league's lowest career interception percentage at 1.4 percent[13] and the highest single-season passer rating record of 122.5.[14] Rodgers is also a four-time winner of the Best NFL Player ESPY Award. Rodgers was born on December 2, 1983, in Chico, California,[15] the son of Darla Leigh (née Pittman) and Edward Wesley Rodgers. His father is a Texas-born chiropractor who played football as an offensive lineman for the Chico State Wildcats from 1973 to 1976.[16][17] Rodgers is of English, Irish and German ancestry.[16] The family moved to Ukiah, California, where he attended Oak Manor Elementary School.[18] Edward Rodgers tossed a football with his sons Luke, Aaron and Jordan Rodgers, and told them not to drink and not to party in college or they would limit themselves in sports like he did. Aaron took this advice to heart.[17] At the age of ten, he was featured on the front page of the Ukiah Daily Journal for his top performance at a local basketball free throw competition.[18] Later, the family moved to Beaverton, Oregon, where Rodgers attended Vose Elementary School and Whitford Middle School, and played baseball in the Raleigh Hills Little League at shortstop, center field and pitcher.[19] The Rodgers family returned to Chico in 1997, and Aaron attended Pleasant Valley High School, starting for two years at quarterback and garnering 4,421 passing yards.[20] He set single-game records of six touchdowns and 440 all-purpose yards. Rodgers set a single-season school record with 2,466 total yards in 2001.[21] He graduated from Pleasant Valley High School in spring 2002, after scoring 1310 in the SAT and with an A− average.[22][23][24] Despite his impressive high school record, Rodgers attracted little interest from Division I programs.[25] In a 2011 interview with E:60, he attributed the relative lack of attention in the recruiting process to his unimposing physical stature as a high school player at 5'10\" (1.78 m) and 165 lb (75 kg). Rodgers wanted to attend Florida State and play under head coach Bobby Bowden, but was rejected.[26] He was only offered an opportunity to compete for a scholarship as a walk-on from University of Illinois.[27] He declined the invitation, and considered quitting football to play baseball instead or giving up entirely on the idea of playing in professional sports and attending law school after completing his undergraduate degree.[28] He was then recruited to play football at Butte College in Oroville, a junior college about 15 miles (25 km) southeast of Chico.[29] Rodgers threw 26 touchdowns in his freshman season at Butte,[30][31] leading the school to a 10–1 record, the NorCal Conference championship,[32] and a No. 2 national ranking. While there, he was discovered by the California Golden Bears' head coach Jeff Tedford, who was recruiting Butte tight end Garrett Cross.[33] Tedford was surprised to learn that Rodgers had not been recruited earlier. Because of Rodgers' good high school scholastic record, he was eligible to transfer to the University of California, Berkeley after one year of junior college instead of the typical two.[34] As a junior college transfer, Rodgers had three years of eligibility at Cal. He was named the starting quarterback in the fifth game of the 2003 season, beating the only team that offered him a Division I opportunity out of high school, Illinois.[35] As a sophomore, he helped lead the Golden Bears to a 7–3 record as a starter.[1][36] In his second career start, Rodgers led the team to a 21–7 halftime lead against #3 USC. Due to injury, Rodgers was replaced in the second half by Reggie Robertson.[37][38] The Bears won in triple overtime, 34–31.[37][39] Rodgers passed for 394 yards and was named game MVP in the Insight Bowl against Virginia Tech.[40][41] In 2003, Rodgers tied the school season record for 300-yard games with five and set a school record for the lowest percentage of passes intercepted at 1.43%.[42] As a junior, Rodgers led Cal to a 10–1 record and top-five ranking at the end of the regular season, with their only loss a 23–17 loss at No. 1 USC.[43] In that game, Rodgers set a school record for consecutive completed passes with 26 and tied an NCAA record with 23 consecutive passes completed in one game.[44] He set a Cal single-game record for passing completion percentage of 85.3.[45][46] Rodgers holds the Cal career record for lowest percentage of passes intercepted at 1.95 percent.[42] Rodgers' performance set up the Golden Bears at first and goal with 1:47 remaining and a chance for the game-winning touchdown. On the first play of USC's goal line stand, Rodgers threw an incomplete pass. This was followed by a second-down sack by Manuel Wright.[47] After a timeout and Rodgers' incomplete pass on third down, USC stopped Cal's run play to win the game.[47] Rodgers commented that it was \"frustrating that we couldn't get the job done.\"[47] Overall, he finished the 2004 season with 2,566 passing yards, 24 touchdowns, and eight interceptions. His 66.1% pass completion percentage led the Pac-10.[48][49] He finished ninth in Heisman Trophy voting.[50] After Texas was picked over Cal for a Rose Bowl berth, the fourth-ranked Bears were awarded a spot in the Holiday Bowl, which they lost to Texas Tech, 45–31.[51] After the season, Rodgers decided to forgo his senior season to enter the 2005 NFL draft.[52] Rodgers was expected to be selected early in the 2005 NFL Draft as he had posted impressive numbers as a junior with Cal, throwing for 2,320 yards with a 67.5 completion rate in the regular season. He threw for 24 touchdowns and only eight interceptions in his last college season, impressing many NFL scouts. They commented that he was a \"talented strong-armed junior\"[54] who \"combines arm strength, mechanics and delivery to make all the throws\", but noted that his stats could be inflated due to playing in a quarterback-friendly system and that he would need to adjust to the more elaborate defensive schemes of the NFL.[54] Before the draft, Rodgers was confident that he would be drafted to the team he supported and grew up near,[58] the San Francisco 49ers, who possessed the No. 1 overall pick in the draft.[59] The 49ers, however, drafted quarterback Alex Smith out of Utah instead, and Rodgers slid all the way down to the 24th overall pick by the Green Bay Packers. Rodgers has said that he experienced much angst and restlessness when waiting to be selected several hours into the draft, as he had expected himself to be selected much sooner.[58] Rodgers' slip to the 24th selection and the Packers choosing to pick Brett Favre's future replacement became one of the biggest stories of the draft, though he was still the second quarterback selected. His drop in the draft was later ranked number one on the NFL Network's Top 10 Draft Day Moments.[60] Many teams drafting between the second and 23rd positions had positional needs more pressing than quarterback.[61][62] Rodgers is one of six quarterbacks coached by Jeff Tedford to be drafted in the first round of an NFL draft, joining Trent Dilfer, Akili Smith, David Carr, Joey Harrington and Kyle Boller.[63] In August 2005, Rodgers agreed to a reported five-year, $7.7 million deal that included $5.4 million in guaranteed money and had the potential to pay him as much as $24.5 million if all incentives and escalators were met.[64] Rodgers spent his rookie season as the Packers' backup quarterback behind Brett Favre.[65] The Packers were 4–12 at this point and he received his first extended look in the opening preseason game against the San Diego Chargers after replacing Favre.[66] In his first NFL game, Rodgers completed two out of seven passes and was sacked twice. He continued to struggle through the preseason, before ending the preseason by converting two third downs and throwing a touchdown pass to tight end Ben Steele against the Tennessee Titans.[67] Once the regular season began, Rodgers saw very little action that year. He played against the New Orleans Saints in the fourth quarter of a 52–3 victory, and completed his first career pass to fullback Vonta Leach for 0 yards.[68] On December 19, 2005, Rodgers entered the game against the Baltimore Ravens at the end of the third quarter in a 48–3 loss.[68] He completed eight of 15 passes for 65 yards and an interception.[69] After the Packers' losing season, head coach Mike Sherman was fired and replaced by Mike McCarthy.[70][71] Rodgers was then placed in McCarthy's \"Quarterback school\" for six hours a day several times a week.[72] This focused on working on Rodgers' motor skills such as hand-eye coordination, finger dexterity, and mechanics.[73] McCarthy also worked on Rodgers' release point, moving it from right beside the ear hole of his helmet to further below it, to give him a smoother release.[74] When the 2006 preseason began, Rodgers played as the backup in all four games; he completed 22 out 38 passes for 323 yards and three touchdowns.[68] Rodgers saw very little action during the 2006 season, but did step in briefly on October 2 against the Philadelphia Eagles when Favre left the game due to injury.[68] On November 19, 2006, Rodgers broke his left foot while playing against the New England Patriots in a 35–0 defeat at home, filling in for an injured Favre, and Rodgers missed the remainder of the 2006 season.[72] Following the team's season-ending victory at Chicago, Favre announced that he would stay with the Packers for the 2007 season, again postponing Rodgers' hopes of becoming the Packers' starting quarterback.[75] Prior to the 2007 season, rumors surfaced about a potential trade involving Rodgers in which he would be traded to the Oakland Raiders for wide receiver Randy Moss.[76] However, Moss was traded to the Patriots during the second day of the 2007 NFL draft, and Rodgers stayed in Green Bay.[77] Rodgers stepped in when Favre was injured in the second quarter against the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday Night Football on November 29, 2007.[78] Rodgers completed 18 passes for 201 yards, with no interceptions.[78] He also threw his first touchdown pass but was sacked three times.[78] Rodgers brought the team back from a 17-point deficit to a 3-point deficit, but the Cowboys went on to win 37–27.[78] Favre's retirement announcement on March 4, 2008, opened up the Packers' starting quarterback position to Rodgers for the 2008 season. Although Favre decided to return from retirement, he was traded to the New York Jets, which meant that Rodgers would become the starter.[79] Rodgers quickly proved that he was one of the best quarterbacks in the league by passing for 4,038 yards in his first season as a starter as well as throwing for 28 touchdowns and only 13 interceptions. As of the 2023 season, this still stands as the most interceptions he has thrown in a season.[80] With Rodgers making his debut as a starter, the Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings 24–19 at Lambeau Field. This marked the first time since 1992 that a quarterback other than Favre started a regular season game for the Packers. Rodgers ended the game with 178 yards passing and two touchdowns (one passing and one rushing).[81] In just his second NFL start the following week, Rodgers was voted the FedEx Air award winner after passing for 328 yards and three touchdowns in a win against the Lions.[82] During the fourth week of the season, Rodgers' streak of 157 consecutive pass attempts without an interception ended when he was intercepted by Derrick Brooks of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The streak was the third-longest in franchise history behind Bart Starr (294) and Brett Favre (163).[83] Rodgers suffered a severe shoulder sprain in the game but continued to start and played well in a win against the Seattle Seahawks two weeks later.[84] Despite early successes, Rodgers had been unable to win a close game during the season despite seven opportunities to do so.[84][85] On October 31, 2008, Rodgers signed a six-year, $65 million contract extension through the 2014 season.[86][87] In Rodgers' first full season with the team, the Packers finished with a 6–10 record and missed the playoffs.[88] For the opening game of the 2009 season, Rodgers recorded his first win in a comeback situation. The Packers were trailing at the beginning of the fourth quarter when Rodgers completed a fifty-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings with about a minute remaining in the game to contribute to the 21–15 victory over the Chicago Bears.[89] Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for October 2009, when he passed for 988 yards, completed 74.5 percent of his passes, and recorded a passer rating over 110 for all three games played during the month.[90] After a 4–4 start to the season and a 38–28 loss to the previously winless Buccaneers,[91] the team began to heat up. Rodgers led the Packers to five straight wins, in which he threw for a total of 1,324 yards, nine touchdowns, and two interceptions.[92] Rodgers and the Packers won two of their last three games, finishing the second half of the season with a 7–1 record and an overall 11–5 record; good enough to secure a wild card playoff berth and clinch the fifth seed in the playoffs.[93][94] The Packers set a new franchise record by scoring 461 total points (third in the league), breaking the previous record held by the 1996 Super Bowl team (456).[95][96] Rodgers became the first quarterback in NFL history ever to throw for 4,000 yards in both of his first two years as a starter.[97] He finished the season fourth in passing yards (4,434), touchdown passes (30), passer rating (103.2), and yards per attempt (8.2) as well as eighth in completion percentage (64.7%), while also coming second among quarterbacks in rushing yards (316).[98] His passing yardage made him second all-time in Packers history, behind only Lynn Dickey's all-time single-season record.[99] His passer rating of 103.2 was also third-highest in team history at the time, behind only Bart Starr's 105.0 rating in 1966 and 104.3 rating in 1968 (minimum 150 attempts).[100] In the Wild Card Round, the Packers played the Arizona Cardinals, the same team they had previously beaten the week before, 33–7.[101] Rodgers and Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner put on a show that later ranked second on NFL Network's Top 10 Quarterback Duels.[102] Rodgers' first pass was intercepted by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie.[103] Rodgers settled down after that miscue, however, and finished the game completing 28 of 42 passes for 423 yards, with four touchdown passes all in a second-half comeback. His 423 passing yards are the most by any quarterback in his first playoff game as well as his four touchdown passes and five total touchdowns.[104] Warner shredded the Packers' second-ranked defense, completing 29 of 33 passes for 379 yards, five touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 154.1. Despite Rodgers' offensive efforts, the Packers lost the game when he fumbled on a controversial play in overtime. The ball was returned by Karlos Dansby for the winning touchdown in the 51–45 Cardinals victory.[105] It was the highest scoring playoff game in NFL history.[106] Due to his regular season performance, Rodgers earned a trip to his first Pro Bowl as the NFC's third quarterback, behind Drew Brees and Brett Favre. However, after Favre dropped out due to injury and Brees was replaced due to his participation in Super Bowl XLIV, Rodgers became the NFC's starter.[107] In 2010, Rodgers led the Packers to a 2–0 start, but then lost three of their next four games, including back-to-back overtime losses. The two overtime defeats brought Rodgers' record in overtime games to 0–5.[108] At midseason, Rodgers had already thrown nine interceptions compared to only throwing seven all of the previous season, and was 16th in the league with an 85.3 passer rating.[109] Over the remainder of the regular season, however, his play improved as he threw 16 touchdowns to only two interceptions, completed 71.4% of his passes, and had a passer rating of 122.0.[110] In Week 13, in a 34–16 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, Rodgers had 298 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn his first career NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor.[111][112] In Week 14, he sustained his second concussion of the season. Backup Matt Flynn was put into the game as Rodgers' replacement. The Packers lost the game 7–3 to the Lions.[113] Against the Patriots, Rodgers missed the next week's regular season start, ending his streak of consecutive starts at 45, which is tied for the second longest in team history.[114] After their road loss to the Patriots, the Packers found themselves at 8–6 and had to win their final two regular season games to qualify for the playoffs. Rodgers turned around the team's performance; they won their final two regular season games, one of them against the New York Giants, where Rodgers completed 25 of 37 passes for 404 yards, with four touchdown passes, and with a passer rating of 139.9.[115] It was his first regular season 400-yard passing game. For his effort against the Giants, he earned his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2010 season.[116] In the next game, they defeated the Bears by a score of 10–3 in the regular season finale.[117] Rodgers was named the FedEx Air NFL Player of the Year for his passing performance in the 2010 season.[118] With a 10–6 record, the Packers entered the playoffs as a Wild Card and the No. 6 seed. In the Wild Card Round, they defeated the No. 3 seeded Eagles 21–16.[119] In the Divisional Round, Rodgers completed 31 of 36 pass attempts for 366 yards and four touchdowns in a 48–21 blowout victory over the No. 1 seeded Atlanta Falcons.[120] It was the most points scored in Packers postseason history.[121] During the contest, Rodgers tied an NFL record for consecutive playoff games with at least three touchdown passes (3 games). Rodgers also set an NFL record by becoming the only quarterback to pass for ten touchdowns combined through three consecutive playoff games. On January 23, 2011, Rodgers had a 55.4 passer rating as the Packers beat the No. 2 seed Chicago Bears 21–14 win to capture the NFC Championship.[122] After winning the NFC Championship, the Packers earned a trip to Super Bowl XLV against the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the game, Rodgers completed 24 of 39 pass attempts for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the 31–25 win, and was named Super Bowl MVP for his performance.[123][124] This would ultimately be his only Super Bowl appearance with the Packers. From his playoff performance, Rodgers became only the third player in NFL history to pass for over 1,000 yards in a single postseason and also became one of only four quarterbacks to record over 300 yards passing, with at least three touchdown passes, and no interceptions in a Super Bowl.[125] He finished with 1,094 passing yards, nine touchdown passes, two rushing touchdowns, and two interceptions, while completing 68.2% of his passes for a passer rating of 109.8.[126] From this postseason, Rodgers also became the only player to pass for at least 900 yards and rush for at least two touchdowns in a single postseason.[127] He was ranked 11th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.[128] Because of the 2011 NFL lockout, the Packers and Rodgers did not schedule unofficial off-season workouts, despite many teams doing so.[129] Rodgers and the Packers quickly quelled any concerns over their readiness by defeating the Saints, who had scheduled off-season workouts, 42–34. He had 312 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[130][131] After the game, Rodgers said in the press conference, \"I was going to ask myself, what would have happened if we had offseason workouts? I mean, could we have started any faster and scored more points tonight?\"[132] In Week 4, a 49–23 victory over the Denver Broncos, Rodgers had 408 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception and ran for two touchdowns to earn another NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor.[133][134] In Week 6, a 24–3 victory over the St. Louis Rams, Rodgers converted on a career-high 93-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson.[135] In Week 9, a 45–38 victory over the Chargers, he had 247 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn his third NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2011 season.[136][137] Rodgers and the Packers got off to a 13–0 start in 2011, tying the NFC record for most consecutive wins to start a season, but were upset by the Kansas City Chiefs 19–14 in week 15, ending their winning streak at 19 games, the second-longest winning streak in NFL history.[138][139] Rodgers finished the season with 4,643 passing yards, 45 touchdown passes, and six interceptions, good for a passer rating of 122.5, which as of 2024 is the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history.[140] His passing yards, touchdown passes, and passer rating set single-season franchise records.[141] In addition to passer rating, Rodgers led the league in touchdown to interception ratio (7.5, fourth-best all-time), touchdowns passing % (9.0%, second highest all-time), and yards per attempt (9.2, fourth-highest all-time since becoming an official stat in 1970), while finishing second in both touchdown passes (45, sixth-highest all-time) and completion percentage (68.3%), as well as fifth in passing yards. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month awards for September, October, and November, and FedEx Air Player of the Week six times (Weeks 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 13). In week four, against the Denver Broncos, Rodgers became the only quarterback in NFL history to record over 400 passing yards with four touchdown passes, while also rushing for two touchdowns in the same game.[142] He was the winner of the 2011 Galloping gobbler as MVP of the Thanksgiving game between the Packers and the Lions, a 27–15 Green Bay victory, and tied an NFL record for consecutive games with at least two touchdown passes (13). The Packers became the fifth team in NFL history to finish the regular season with a 15–1 record.[143] Rodgers played in 15 of the 16 games, with the only exception being Week 17 against the Lions, a game in which Rodgers was rested after the club clinched home-field advantage for the playoffs the previous week. In the game, Rodgers assisted backup quarterback Matt Flynn in his stellar 480-yard, six-touchdown performance by helping call some plays.[144] The Packers' offense set franchise record for points scored in a season with 560, which as of 2016 is the third-most ever behind only the 2007 Patriots and 2013 Broncos.[145] Rodgers set numerous NFL records in 2011. He recorded a passer rating of over 100.0 in thirteen games during the season, including twelve games in a row (both records), and a passer rating of 110.0 or higher in twelve games, including eleven in a row (also records). Rodgers also won the league's MVP award, receiving 48 of the 50 votes (the other two going to Drew Brees). He also finished second, behind Brees, for the AP Offensive Player of the Year award.[146] Rodgers' 2011 season was later ranked as the third greatest passing season of all time by ESPN in 2013, and was regarded as the most efficient.[147] The Packers were upset by the eventual Super Bowl champion Giants in the Divisional Round by the score of 37–20. The Packers' receiving corps dropped six passes in the loss and Rodgers finished the game with 264 passing yards, two touchdown passes, and an interception on his last pass attempt.[148] The 2011 Packers became the only team in NFL history to go 15–1 and not win a playoff game, as well as being the fourth consecutive team to win at least 15 games and not win the Super Bowl.[149] Rodgers was named to the Pro Bowl for his 2011 season to go along with a First-team All-Pro honor.[150][151] He was voted by his fellow players as the best player in the league on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.[152] Rodgers and the Packers started off the 2012 season with a 30–22 loss to the 49ers.[153] With the loss, Rodgers lost his bet with the music group Boyz II Men, and had to wear an Alex Smith jersey during the next week of practice.[154] Had the Packers won the game, Boyz II Men would have sung the national anthem during their next home game at Lambeau.[154] In Week 4, a 28–27 victory over the Saints, Rodgers had 319 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[155][156] In Week 6, against the undefeated Houston Texans, he tied the franchise record by throwing six touchdown passes, in a 42–24 victory, to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[157][158] The Texans had allowed only six total touchdowns passes during the season up to that point.[159] This sparked a five-game winning streak which Rodgers completed 65.7% of his passes for 1,320 yards, 17 touchdowns, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 119.1.[160] During that stretch, Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for October.[161] In Week 15, Rodgers threw for 291 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Packers past the Bears, 21–13, making them NFC North champions for the second consecutive year.[162] In the season finale, despite Rodgers going 28 of 40 for 365 yards, four touchdowns, no interceptions and a passer rating of 131.8, the Packers lost 37–34 against the Vikings.[163] This ended the Packers' twelve-game winning streak against NFC North opponents. The Packers finished with an 11–5 record, first in the NFC North, and clinched the #3-seed in the NFC playoffs.[164] Rodgers led the league for the second straight year in passer rating (108.0) touchdowns passing % (7.1%), and touchdown-to-interception ratio (4.875), while finishing second in touchdown passes (39), third in completion percentage (67.2%), fifth in yards per attempt (7.78), and eighth in passing yards (4,295).[165] In the playoffs, the Packers defeated the Minnesota Vikings 24–10 in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers completed 23 of 33 passes to ten different players for 274 yards and a touchdown.[166] They were beaten 45–31 by the 49ers in the Divisional Round.[167] Rodgers completed 26 of 39 passes for 257 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception, while also rushing for 28 yards, in the losing effort. He earned his third career Pro Bowl nomination for his performance in the 2012 season.[168] He was ranked sixth by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.[169] On April 26, 2013, the Packers and Rodgers agreed to a 5-year, $110 million contract extension making him the highest paid player in NFL history.[170] The Packers began their 2013 season against the reigning NFC champions, the 49ers, the team that also ended their playoff run the previous season. Rodgers went 21 for 37 in completions, 333 yards, three touchdowns and an interception in the 34–28 loss.[171] The following week, Rodgers had a career-high 480 passing yards to tie the franchise record in the 38–20 home-opener win against the Washington Redskins. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort against the Redskins.[172][173] His 335 passing yards in the first half set a club record.[174] He also became the first quarterback since Y. A. Tittle in 1962 to throw for at least 480 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions in a game.[175] The following week, Rodgers saw his NFL record of 41 consecutive games without throwing multiple interceptions come to an end in a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals by the score of 34–30.[176][177] After the loss to the Bengals, the Packers started rolling, winning their next four games. Against the Ravens, the Packers lost two receivers: Randall Cobb and James Jones. Cobb was sidelined with a broken leg and Jones with a sprained PCL.[178] Against the Cleveland Browns, tight end Jermichael Finley was carted off the field with a bruised spinal cord, leaving Rodgers without three of his top four offensive weapons.[179] The next week against the Vikings, Rodgers completed 24 of 29 passes in a 44–31 victory.[180] At home against the Bears in Week 9, Rodgers was sacked by Shea McClellin. He fractured his left clavicle in the process, and the speculation for his return ranged from a few weeks to an indefinite timetable that became a weekly spectacle of whether or when he might be cleared to play again.[181][182][183] Before Rodgers had broken his collarbone, the Packers had won four straight games to climb to the top of the NFC North division with a 5–2 record. With Rodgers injured and unable to play, the Packers went winless over the next five weeks to fall to 5–6–1 on the season.[184] After rallying in December behind re-acquired backup quarterback Matt Flynn,[185] the Packers had fought their way back to a 7–7–1 record going into the final week of the season. On December 26, Packers head coach Mike McCarthy announced Rodgers would return and start in the season-finale showdown against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field for the NFC North championship.[186] Returning from the injury, Rodgers threw for 318 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the regular season finale against the Bears.[187] Trailing 27–28 with under a minute to go in the game and facing the third 4th down of the drive, a 4th & 8 from the 48-yard line, Rodgers connected with Cobb, who was also returning for his first game since breaking his leg in Week 6, for a 48-yard game-winning touchdown to clinch the NFC North and earn the right to host a home playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers as the fourth seed.[188] Rodgers won the 2013 GMC Never Say Never Award for the come-from-behind, division-winning touchdown pass. Rodgers finished fifth in the league in passer rating (104.9), completion percentage (66.6%), and yards per game (282) while also finishing second in yards per attempt (8.75).[189] Rodgers led the Packers to the playoffs again, this time with an 8–7–1 record and were up against the team that eliminated them last year in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, the 49ers.[190] The Packers lost to the 49ers for the fourth consecutive time, 23–20 on a last second field goal at Lambeau Field, in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers recorded only 177 yards passing, his lowest in a playoff game, and one touchdown pass.[191] He was ranked No. 11 by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.[192] The Packers' 2014 regular season debut came against the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks—a game in which they would go on to lose 36–16.[193] In Week 2, the team began the game with a 21–3 deficit against the Jets, but came back and won 31–24.[194] The 18-point comeback marked the biggest comeback in Rodgers' career.[195] In the third week of the season, the Packers offense was shut down by the Lions' defense, 19–7.[196] The Packers' 7 points were the fewest points allowed in a game Rodgers finished; the 223 yards of total Packer offense were the lowest since Rodgers took over at quarterback and his 162 passing yards were also a career low. For the third consecutive season, the Packers were off to a 1–2 start. In those three games, Rodgers threw five touchdowns and one interception combined, with a passer rating of 95.1. Amid widespread concern, Rodgers told the fans and the media, \"R-E-L-A-X. Relax. We're going to be OK.\"[197] After their loss to the Lions, the Packers went on a four-game win streak, during which, Rodgers threw 13 touchdowns with no interceptions.[198] In Week 4, a 38–17 victory over the Bears, he had 302 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[199][200] In Week 6, against the Miami Dolphins, Rodgers led the Packers to a game-winning drive with less than two minutes remaining. He completed a 4th & 10 pass to wide receiver Jordy Nelson and mimicked Dan Marino's famous fake spike play by completing a pass to wide receiver Davante Adams to get to within four yards of the endzone later in the drive.[201] Rodgers then completed a touchdown pass to tight end Andrew Quarless to win the game 27–24.[202] This play would later win Rodgers the GMC Never Say Never Moment of the Year Award.[202] In Week 7, a 38–17 victory over the Carolina Panthers, he was 19-of-22 for 255 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[203][204] In a Week 8 loss against the Saints, Rodgers finished 28 of 39 for 418 yards, with one touchdown pass and two interceptions, ending his 212 consecutive attempts without an interception streak[205]—the second longest in team history. In the game, Rodgers injured his hamstring which appeared to have an effect on his play for the remainder of the game.[206] In Week 10, against the Chicago Bears, Rodgers became the second player in NFL history and the first since Daryle Lamonica in 1969 to throw six touchdown passes in the first half.[207] Rodgers finished 18 of 27 for 315 yards and six touchdowns despite only playing one drive in the second half to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[208][209] Rodgers set multiple records during the game: most touchdown passes of 70 or more yards with 16—breaking the record held by Brett Favre and Peyton Manning, most consecutive touchdown passes without an interception at home—breaking the record also held by Favre and Manning, and became the first quarterback to ever have 10 touchdown passes against the same team in a season.[208] The 55–14 victory tied the Packers' 55–7 win vs. the Titans in 2009 for the most points scored by a Rodgers-led offense. In a Week 11 game against the 7–2 Eagles, Rodgers set a record for most consecutive attempts at home without an interception, breaking Tom Brady's record of 288 consecutive attempts.[210] In the 53–20 victory, he finished going 22 of 36, with 341 passing yards, three touchdown passes and no interceptions.[211] The 8–3 Packers met the 9–2 Patriots in Week 13, at Lambeau Field in what was Brady and Rodgers' first time playing against each other as starters.[212] Rodgers finished going 24 of 38, with 368 passing yards and two passing touchdowns in the 26–21 Packers victory.[213] For his efforts in the month of November, he earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month.[214] Rodgers suffered a calf injury in Week 16, against the Buccaneers, due to severe dehydration he endured from flu-like symptoms he suffered during the week.[215] In the Week 17 game against the Lions, Rodgers re-injured his left calf while extending a play and throwing a touchdown pass to Randall Cobb, then was helped off the field, and carted off to the locker room. After missing a series, Rodgers re-entered the game with the score tied 14–14. Despite being less mobile with the injury, Rodgers completed 13 of 15 passes for 129 yards and two scores against the league's second-ranked defense. The Packers won 30–20, winning their fourth straight NFC North title. Rodgers finished 17 of 22 for 226 yards, two touchdown passes, no interceptions, a 139.6 passer rating, and a rushing touchdown to earn his fourth NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2014 season.[216][217] The Packers secured the second seed in the NFC, rewarding them with a playoff bye and a week off which helped Rodgers rest and rehabilitate his injured left calf.[218] In the Divisional Round, the Packers were scheduled to play the 13–4 Cowboys, which marked the first time in NFL playoff history when a team which went undefeated at home (Packers) played against a team which went undefeated away (Cowboys).[219] Rodgers helped secure a 26–21 victory by finishing 24 of 35 for 316 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions, and a 125.4 passer rating.[220] The Packers then traveled to Seattle to face the top-seeded Seahawks in a rematch of the regular season opener.[221] In the NFC Championship Game, the Packers were leading 19–7 with just over five minutes to go, but the home team's offense finally woke up and, with the assistance of a crucial Packers special teams gaffe on an onside kick, the Seahawks led 22–19, with 44 seconds remaining. Rodgers quickly drove downfield to set up a tying field goal, only to watch from the sidelines as the Seahawks won the coin toss in overtime and proceeded to score the game-winning touchdown on their first possession. Rodgers was 19-for-34 for 178 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions in the losing effort.[222] Rodgers finished the regular season first in touchdown-to-interception ratio (7.6), lowest interception percentage (1.0%), second in passer rating (112.2), yards per attempt (8.4), and touchdown passing percentage (7.1%), third in touchdown passes (38), seventh in passing yards (4,381), and ninth in completion percentage (65.6%).[223] He set an NFL record for most consecutive pass attempts (512) at home without an interception, and touchdown passes (41). Rodgers was voted the AP NFL Most Valuable Player for the 2014 season, receiving 31 votes,[224] and was named NFC Offensive Player of the Year by the Kansas City Committee of 101[225] and Fed-Ex Air NFL Player of the Year.[226] He was also named to the AP All-Pro team as the first quarterback, receiving 44 votes while runner-up Tony Romo received three.[227] He was named to the Pro Bowl for the 2014 season.[228] He was ranked as the second best player in the league among his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.[229] In 2015, Rodgers had a down year by his standards. He threw for a career low 3,821 yards in which he played for at least 15 games, although he had 31 touchdowns to just eight interceptions.[230] Rodgers completed only 60.7 of his passes, averaged only 6.7 yards per attempt and finished with a passer rating of 92.7, all career lows. Pro Bowl wide receiver Jordy Nelson's absence due to injury for the season was considered a contributing factor in Rodgers' statistical drop compared to previous seasons.[231][232][233] In Week 3, a 38–28 victory over the Chiefs, Rodgers had 333 passing yards and five touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[234][235] During Week 9 against the Panthers, he finished with 369 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception. The interception came with only 1:47 left in the fourth quarter, and following the interception, Rodgers expressed frustration by throwing down a Microsoft Surface tablet.[236] The Packers ended up losing the game 29–37.[237] On December 3, 2015, in a Week 13 match-up against the Lions, Rodgers threw a Hail Mary pass caught by Richard Rodgers II for 61 yards with 0:00 left to beat the Lions 27–23, after the game was extended due to a facemask penalty called on Detroit.[238] The play was quickly dubbed as \"The Miracle in Motown.\"[239][240] The Packers made the playoffs as the fifth seed in the NFC with a 10–6 record.[241] They defeated the Redskins 35–18 on the road in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs. Rodgers finished the game with 210 yards and two passing touchdowns.[242] In the Divisional Round against the Cardinals, Rodgers threw a 41-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass to Jeff Janis as time expired to send the game into overtime. However, the Packers lost 26–20 in overtime. Rodgers finished the game 24 for 44 for 261 yards with two touchdowns and an interception.[243] He was named to his fifth Pro Bowl and was ranked as the sixth best player by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[244][245] Throughout the first five games of the 2016 season, Rodgers' struggles from the 2015 season appeared to continue.[246] Through those games, he completed 60.2% of his passes, averaged 6.5 yards per attempt, and posted a passer rating of 88.4—all of which were similar to his 2015 numbers.[247] He also fumbled five times, and lost two. His lackluster performance through those games caused much speculation about the causes of his problems.[248][246][249][250] In a Week 7 Thursday Night Football game against the Bears, Rodgers rebounded by recording a franchise record and career-high 39 completions, breaking Brett Favre's previous record of 36 in 1993, also against the Bears.[251] Rodgers recorded 326 passing yards for his first 300-yard passing game since Week 10 of the 2015 season in the 26–10 win.[252] The following week against the Atlanta Falcons, Rodgers recorded a career regular season high of 60 rushing yards,[252] and finished with four touchdown passes and a 125.5 passer rating.[253] After a Week 11 loss to the Redskins—the Packers' fourth in a row, putting them at 4–6—Rodgers was optimistic about the remainder of the season, saying, \"I feel like we can run the table, I really do.\"[254] Despite widespread doubt over the likelihood of such a run,[255][256][257] the Packers would go on to finish the season with six straight wins—as Rodgers said they could. In a Week 12 Monday Night Football game Rodgers appeared to injure his hamstring on a scrambling play against the Eagles.[258] After the play, Rodgers went into an injury tent on the sideline to get his leg taped up.[258] Rodgers, however, did not miss any snaps in the game and finished 30 out of 39 for 313 yards with no sacks or interceptions.[259] His 300-yard performance was his fourth of the season and the first allowed by the Eagles' defense all season.[259] The Packers won, 27–13, snapping their four-game losing streak. In a 38–10 victory over the Seahawks in a Week 14 game, Rodgers and the Packers continued their recent offensive and defensive success.[260][261] Rodgers finished with 246 passing yards, three touchdown passes and a 150.8 passer rating. The 150.8 passer rating was the best recorded against Seattle's defense since head coach Pete Carroll took over in 2010.[260] Rodgers did this despite suffering a calf injury early in the game.[260] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Seahawks.[262] On December 20, 2016, Rodgers was selected to his third consecutive Pro Bowl and his sixth overall in his career.[263] During Week 16, Rodgers and Drew Brees tied the NFL record for most seasons with at least 35 touchdown passes with four—a record shared with Peyton Manning and Tom Brady.[264][265] In the game against the Vikings, Rodgers finished 28 of 38 for 347 yards, four touchdown passes and a rushing touchdown to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[266][267] His 300-yard performance was the first allowed by the Vikings' defense all season.[266] He also set Packer regular season records for most 4,000-yard passing seasons (6), most completions in a season (374), and—with Jordy Nelson—most touchdowns by a quarterback/wide receiver combination with (59).[266] Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.[268] Rodgers helped lead the Packers to a NFC North title and a playoff berth in 2016.[269] The Packers defeated the Giants in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers completed 25 of 40 passes for 364 yards and four touchdowns in the victory. They defeated the #1-seed Cowboys in the Divisional Round. With the game tied at 31 with only 18 seconds remaining with the ball on their own 32-yard line, Rodgers threw a 36-yard completion to tight end Jared Cook to put the Packers in Mason Crosby's field goal range. Crosby converted the 51-yard attempt as time expired to win the game.[270] Overall, Rodgers completed 28 of 43 passes for 355 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in the victory.[271][272] The Packers lost to the Falcons in the NFC Championship in the final game at the Georgia Dome. Rodgers completed 27 of his 45 passing attempts for 287 yards with three touchdowns and an interception in the losing effort.[273] In 2016, Rodgers finished with 401 completions and 610 attempts (both career highs), a 65.7% completion percentage, 4,428 passing yards, 40 touchdown passes, seven interceptions, a passer rating of 104.2, 369 rushing yards (career-high), and four rushing touchdowns.[274] With his 40 touchdown passes, he led the league in the statistic for the first time in his career[275] and became one of only four quarterbacks to pass for at least 40 touchdowns in multiple seasons.[276] Rodgers also finished fourth in passing yards, completions, attempts, and passer rating.[277] Among quarterbacks, he finished third in rushing yards and fifth in rushing touchdowns.[278] He was ranked sixth by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[279] In a Week 1 victory over the Seahawks, Rodgers had his 50th career game with at least 300 passing yards. He finished the game with 311, but his streak of 251 consecutive passes without an interception came to an end when defensive tackle Nazair Jones picked him off in the first quarter.[280] In the next game, a 34–23 loss to the Falcons in Week 2, he had 343 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the first game in the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.[281] In Week 5, down by 28–31 against the Cowboys with less than two minutes on the clock, Rodgers led a nine-play, 75-yard touchdown drive in the 35–31 victory, earning him NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[282] During Week 6 against the Vikings, Rodgers was taken off the field by his coaches and medical personnel after suffering a shoulder injury on a hit from Anthony Barr. Shortly thereafter, it was revealed that Rodgers suffered a fractured right collarbone.[283][284] The next day, on October 16, it was announced that Rodgers would have surgery on his broken collarbone.[285] On October 19, he underwent surgery on his collarbone, and was officially placed on injured reserve the next day.[286][287] A total of 13 screws were inserted to stabilize his collarbone.[288][289] Rodgers returned to practice on December 2, 2017, making him eligible to play in the upcoming Week 15 game.[290] On December 12, 2017, it was announced that Rodgers was medically cleared by doctors and was set to start the next game against the Panthers.[291] He was officially activated on December 16, 2017.[292] Rodgers returned during Week 15 against the Panthers, where he finished with 290 passing yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions as the Packers lost 24–31.[293] However, two days later, on December 19, Rodgers was placed back on injured reserve after the Packers were eliminated from playoff contention.[294][295][296] He was ranked No. 10 by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.[297] On August 29, 2018, Rodgers signed a four-year extension with the Packers worth $134 million featuring a $57.5 million signing bonus.[298][299] During Sunday Night Football against the Bears in Week 1, Rodgers left the game with a knee injury but returned in the third quarter. Down by 20 points, Rodgers finished with 286 passing yards and three touchdowns, leading the Packers rally to a 24–23 win.[300] Despite a nagging knee injury, Rodgers had at least 40 pass attempts in each of the next three games. In the last of these, he threw his first interception in 150 attempts.[301] In Week 5, Rodgers passed for 442 yards (the second-best of his career) and three touchdowns, but also two fumbles, in a 31–23 loss to the Lions.[302] In the following game, a 33–30 victory over the 49ers, he had 425 passing yards and two passing touchdowns.[303] Following the bye-week, despite a continuing knee injury,[304] Rodgers had his third consecutive week with a 100+ quarterback rating,[305] which included 286 yards passing, no interceptions, and a go-ahead 40-yard touchdown pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling in a 29–27 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.[306] In Week 14, against the Falcons, Rodgers set an NFL record by converting his 359th consecutive pass without an interception, breaking Tom Brady's previous record.[307] In Week 15, against the Chicago Bears, Rodgers threw for 274 yards and an interception in a 24–17 loss.

Trailing at one point by 15 points, Rodgers and the Packers won 44–38 in overtime.[309] He matched his own feat of achieving at least 400 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and two rushing touchdowns in a single game. The only other time in NFL history that occurred was when Rodgers accomplished it in 2011 against the Denver Broncos.[310] On December 18, 2018, Rodgers was named to his seventh Pro Bowl.[311] He declined the appearance due to injury and was replaced by Russell Wilson.[312] In the regular season finale against the Detroit Lions, Rodgers suffered a concussion early in the game and would not return.[313] He was then sent to the hospital to test for concussion symptoms.[314] Because the Packers had already been eliminated from playoff contention, Rodgers answered questions about whether he should be playing, for fear of injury, by saying: \"That's just not the way I lead, and I'm super-competitive, and I want to be out there with the guys and I look forward to being out there.\"[314] Rodgers was later spotted at the Packers' facility after the game.[314] Rodgers finished the season with 372 completions, 597 attempts, 4,442 passing yards, 25 passing touchdowns, two interceptions and a passer rating of 97.6.[315] His touchdown to interception ratio of 25:2 (12.5) ranks third best all-time (min. 300 attempts).[316] In addition to setting the record for consecutive passes without an interception during the season, Rodgers set NFL records for interception percentage for a season, with only 0.335% of his passes being intercepted, and for the amount of thrown away passes.[317][318] He was ranked eighth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[319] Rodgers started the 2019 season with a new head coach in Matt LaFleur following the departure of Mike McCarthy.[320] The Packers offense relied less on Rodgers' trademark passes and more on heavy formations and play-action throws to take advantage of running back Aaron Jones.[321] Rodgers helped lead the Packers to a 3–0 start with victories over the Bears, Vikings, and Broncos.[322][323][324] In Week 4, against the Eagles on Thursday Night Football, he had 422 passing yards and two passing touchdowns, but also threw the game-ending interception as the Packers were handed their first loss of the season by a score of 34–27.[325] In Week 7, against the Raiders, Rodgers posted his first-ever game with a perfect passer rating of 158.3, the first quarterback in team history to do so.[326] He completed 25-of-31 passes for 429 yards and five touchdowns in the 42–24 victory.[327] He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[328] In Week 17, against the Lions, Rodgers helped lead the team to a 23–20 comeback win.

Instead, he had received homeopathic treatment from his personal doctor. While unvaccinated, he committed multiple violations of NFL COVID-19 protocols for unvaccinated players, including attending parties with teammates while not using PPE and appearing unmasked at multiple postgame press conferences.[360][361][362][363][364] After a review, he was fined $14,650 for violations of the agreed protocols and his team was fined $300,000.[365][366] Rodgers was activated off the reserve/COVID-19 list on November 13, and returned to play the next day against the Seahawks, a game the Packers won 17–0.[367] In Week 15, Rodgers threw for 268 yards and three touchdowns in a 31–30 win over the Ravens, which clinched the NFC North title for the Packers for a third consecutive season and earned him NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[368] On December 23, 2021, Rodgers was named to his tenth Pro Bowl.[369] In a Week 16 victory over the Browns, Rodgers threw his 443rd career touchdown pass, passing Brett Favre for the most all-time career touchdown passes in Packers history.[370] For his play in the month of December, Rodgers earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month honors.[371] He finished the 2021 season with 4,115 passing yards, 37 touchdowns, and four interceptions.[372] On January 14, 2022, Rodgers earned his fourth career First-team All-Pro selection.[373] In the Divisional Round against the 49ers, Rodgers threw for 225 yards, but a poor performance by the special teams unit haunted the Packers, losing 13–10. It was Rodgers' fourth loss in as many games to the 49ers in the postseason and Rodgers' second home divisional loss.[59] After the season, Rodgers won the AP NFL Most Valuable Player Award for the second consecutive season and the fourth time overall.[374] Rodgers became the fifth player to win consecutive MVPs and first since Peyton Manning between 2008 and 2009.[375] Rodgers joined Manning as the only players in NFL history to win at least four MVPs.[376] He was ranked third by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[377] On March 8, Rodgers confirmed that he would return and play for the Packers for the 2022 season after speculations that Rodgers could retire or demand a trade to another team.[378] There were reports that Rodgers and the Packers had agreed to terms on a 4-year, $200 million contract extension that would have made him the highest-paid player in NFL history, but Rodgers denied those reports on Twitter, stating that the numbers on the proposed contract were inaccurate, and that he had yet to sign such a contract. He did confirm, however, that he would return to play his 18th NFL season with the Packers.[379][380] On March 16, he officially signed his contract extension. The final terms of the contract was a 3-year contract (which replaced the final year of his existing contract) worth $150.8 million, with $101.5 million guaranteed. The new contract made him the highest paid player in North American sports history on an annual basis, surpassing the NBA's Damian Lillard's $49 million per annum contract.[381] In the season opener against the Vikings, Rodgers threw for 195 yards and an interception in the 23–7 loss.[382][383] In Week 4 against the Patriots, Rodgers threw for 251 yards and two touchdowns, but also threw his fourth career pick-six to Jack Jones in the 27–24 overtime win.[384] In Week 5 at London, Rodgers threw for 222 yards and two touchdowns in an upset loss against the Giants.[385] In Week 8 against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday Night Football, Rodgers threw for 203 yards, two touchdowns and one interception as the Packers lost their fourth consecutive game in the 27–17 defeat.[386] The next week against the Lions, Rodgers threw for 291 yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions in the 15–9 loss. It was the first time since Week 15 of the 2017 season that Rodgers threw three interceptions in a game.[387] Rodgers bounced back the following week against the Cowboys, completing 14-of-20 passes for 224 yards and three touchdowns in 31–28 overtime victory.[388][389] Following a Week 11 loss to the Titans, Rodgers confirmed he has been playing with a broken thumb on his throwing hand he suffered in Week 5.[390][391] A Week 12 loss to the Eagles left the Packers with a 4–8 record, but the team rallied off four consecutive wins to get to 8–8 before the regular season finale.[392] The Packers finished with an 8–9 record and missed the postseason following a Week 18 loss to the Detroit Lions in a win-and-in scenario for Green Bay.[393][394] Rodgers finished the 2022 season with 3,695 passing yards, 26 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, which marked the most for Rodgers in a single season since 2008.[395][396] He was ranked 51st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[397] On April 26, 2023, Rodgers was traded to the Jets, along with the Packers' first and fifth-round selections in the 2023 NFL draft, in exchange for the Jets' first, second (via Cleveland) and sixth-round selections in the 2023 draft and a conditional second-round selection (which would have converted to a first if Rodgers played 65% of the offensive snaps in 2023, but it did not happen) in the 2024 NFL draft.[398] The move echoed the career path of his predecessor Brett Favre, who similarly spent over fifteen years as quarterback of the Packers before being traded to the Jets.[399] Although Joe Namath granted Rodgers permission to wear his retired No. 12 jersey, Rodgers announced that he would return to wearing the No. 8 jersey, which he had worn throughout his college career with the California Golden Bears.[400] On July 26, 2023, Rodgers took a pay cut and agreed to a reworked contract with the Jets.[401] Making his Jets debut in Week 1 on Monday Night Football against the Bills at MetLife Stadium, Rodgers injured his left ankle on just his fourth offensive snap after being sacked by Bills' defensive end Leonard Floyd. Rodgers was helped off the field and later carted to the locker room for further evaluation.[402] Rodgers' backup Zach Wilson went on to lead the Jets to a 22–16 win in overtime.[403] The next day, Rodgers was diagnosed with an Achilles tendon rupture and was later placed on injured reserve.[404][405] Rodgers underwent surgery on September 13, with Dr. Neal ElAttrache placing an internal brace in his left Achilles with the goal of a mid-January return at the earliest.[406] On November 29, the New York Jets opened the 21-day practice window for Rodgers. Limited in practice, Rodgers was cleared for functional activity but not contact.[407] He was activated off injured reserve on December 20, but the Jets announced he would not play again this season after their Week 15 loss to the Dolphins mathematically eliminated them from playoff contention.[408][409] After playing just four offensive snaps in his first season with the Jets due to an Achilles injury, Rodgers made his return on Monday Night Football in Week 1 to kick off the 2024 campaign. In his highly anticipated return, Rodgers completed 13 of 21 passes for 167 yards, one touchdown and one interception in a 32–19 loss to the defending NFC champion San Francisco 49ers.[410] In the Jets' home opener against the New England Patriots, Rodgers completed 27 of 35 passes for 281 yards and two touchdowns as the Jets cruised to a 24–3 victory.[411] In Week 5 in London, Rodgers became the ninth quarterback in NFL history to reach 60,000 passing yards but tied his career-high with three interceptions, including a game-sealing pick with under a minute left as the Jets lost 23–17 to the Vikings.[412] Jets head coach Robert Saleh was unexpectedly fired after the London loss, with some analysts perceiving that he did not get along with Rodgers.[413] When asked about it on The Pat McAfee Show, the quarterback firmly denied accusations that he had a role in Saleh's termination.[414] In Week 6, the Jets' first game after Saleh’s termination, Rodgers threw for 294 yards and two touchdowns, including a 52-yard Hail Mary pass to Allen Lazard to close out the first half, his fourth career such pass completion.[415] However, another interception on the Jets' final drive doomed them as they lost 23–20 to the Buffalo Bills.[416] Following the loss, the Jets traded for Davante Adams, with whom Rodgers had previously combined for over 600 receptions and 68 touchdowns during their eight seasons together in Green Bay.[417] However, the Jets continued to struggle, as Rodgers threw two interceptions and led the offense to zero points in the second half of their Week 7 matchup against the Steelers, losing their fourth consecutive game.[418] After a loss to the Patriots, Rodgers helped the Jets snap their five-game losing streak in Week 9 against the Houston Texans, throwing for 179 yards and three touchdowns in the second half after being shutout in the first half as the Jets won 21–13.[419] In Week 11 against the Colts, Rodgers threw two touchdowns and led the Jets to a season-high in points, but they fell short in a 28–27 loss, dropping to 3–7.[420] During their bye week, it was revealed that Rodgers had been playing through hamstring, knee, and ankle injuries but had refused to get scans done in fear of how severe they would be.[421] Despite this, he remained the starter following the bye week.[422] Entering Week 14, Rodgers held an NFL-record 34-game drought without a 300-yard passing performance, which he broke on December 8 against the Dolphins.[423] Despite recording his first 300-yard game in three years, the Jets fell 32–26 in overtime, eliminating them from playoff contention.[424] Since becoming a starter in 2008, Rodgers has become known for his unique touchdown celebration, which he and his teammates have dubbed the \"Championship Belt.\" After a scoring play, Rodgers celebrates by making a motion as if he is putting an invisible championship belt on around his waist.[425][426] Teammate Greg Jennings said of the celebration: \"It's just something fun that he does. We get excited when we see it cause we know that he's made a play or we've made a play as offense.\"[427] The gesture drew the praise of WWE wrestler Triple H and has become common for Green Bay fans to mimic during games.[428] He has also celebrated by doing the shoryuken, a jumping uppercut move from the Street Fighter series.[429] Rodgers has been vocal about his use of alternative medicine,[463][464] and is a proponent of the legalization of psychedelic drugs.[465] He revealed in 2022 that he had previously made offseason trips to Peru, where he consumed ayahuasca.[466] Rodgers is one of the most prominent American athletes to choose not to get vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus,[467] and was critical of the NFL's health and safety protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic.[468] His stances on the COVID-19 vaccine were criticized by scientists, health officials, and some former players and commentators, due to concerns that Rodgers was spreading vaccine misinformation and potentially was risking the health of his teammates.[469] During the NFL season, Rodgers frequently appears on The Pat McAfee Show.[470] One such interview in 2021 made headlines after Rodgers made several false and misleading statements about COVID-19,[471][472] implying that unvaccinated people were not the group most affected by the pandemic and that ivermectin was beneficial for people with COVID-19.[467][473][474][475] These and similar claims led some reporters to describe Rodgers as a conspiracy theorist.[471][476] Rodgers has voiced support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his presidential campaign of 2024.[477] Kennedy reportedly included Rodgers on his \"short list\" of possible vice presidential running mates, along with others, including Jesse Ventura and Nicole Shanahan.[478][479] On Adam Breneman's podcast in 2022, former Packers backup quarterback DeShone Kizer said that Rodgers had expressed interest in 9/11 conspiracy theories at one of the first meetings between the two quarterbacks. Kizer described their discussion of conspiracy theories as \"a real thought experiment\".[480][481] Rodgers has also promoted the Tartarian architecture conspiracy theory.[482] In a January 2024 appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, Rodgers, without evidence, implied that comedian Jimmy Kimmel was an acquaintance of disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and that Kimmel's name would possibly appear in soon to be released court documents listing Epstein's associates.[483] Kimmel denied the allegations and threatened to sue Rodgers for defamation if he repeated the claim.[484] In a follow-up appearance on McAfee's show the following week, Rodgers stated: \"I'm glad that Jimmy is not on the list. I really am. I don't think he's the P-word [pedophile].\"[485] During a February 2024 appearance on the conspiracy-focused Look Into It podcast hosted by Eddie Bravo, Rodgers espoused numerous conspiracy theories on medicine, immigration, and John F. Kennedy.[486] His claims included that AIDS and COVID were created by the government for the sake of pharmaceutical industry profits (see also discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories and Operation Denver).[487] In 2024, CNN reporter Pamela Brown reported that Rodgers had in 2013 shared false conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook massacre, claiming that the attack was an \"inside job\" perpetrated by the government. CNN simultaneously reported an allegation by an anonymous source that Rodgers had several years prior said \"Sandy Hook never happened....All those children never existed. They were all actors.\"[488] In response, Rodgers said, \"I am not and have never been of the opinion that the events did not take place\" but did not say whether he had ever believed the Sandy Hook massacre was an \"inside job.\"[477] Rodgers has two brothers; the younger, Jordan, played quarterback at Vanderbilt University and had a brief NFL career with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[489][490][491] Although Rodgers and his brothers were raised Christian, in an interview in 2017 he stated that he no longer affiliated himself with any organized religion.[492] Rodgers is the godfather to Cade Cobb, the second son of his long-time NFL teammate, Randall Cobb.[493] Rodgers was in a relationship with actress Olivia Munn from 2014 to 2017 and with former professional racing driver Danica Patrick from 2018 to 2020.[494][495][496] He started dating actress Shailene Woodley in the second half of 2020.[497] In an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2021, Woodley confirmed that she was engaged to Rodgers.[498] On February 16, 2022, Rodgers and Woodley called off their engagement.[499] Rodgers was initiated as an honorary member of Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) on January 5, 2012, at the Sigma-Xi Chapter at St. Norbert College.[500] In April 2018, Rodgers was announced as a limited partner in the Milwaukee Bucks ownership group, making him the first active NFL player with an ownership stake in an NBA franchise.[501] Rodgers was a longtime spokesperson for State Farm Insurance and was frequently featured in their commercials. In the commercials, Rodgers often highlights his \"Championship Belt\" touchdown celebration, which State Farm renamed as the \"Discount Double Check\".[502] Rodgers has also been featured in Pizza Hut advertisements,[503] as well as numerous local Wisconsin-based advertisements.[504] In May 2015, Rodgers appeared as a contestant on Celebrity Jeopardy!; he defeated Shark Tank investor Kevin O'Leary and astronaut and future United States Senator Mark Kelly, winning $50,000 for his charity. In April 2021, Rodgers had a two-week stint as guest host on Jeopardy! from April 5–16.[505][506] Rodgers has also made numerous cameo appearances on television, including in a 2013 episode of The Office, a 2019 episode of Game of Thrones, and a 2015 episode of the sketch comedy television series Key & Peele.[507][508][509] He also taped a cameo as Jeopardy! host for an episode of The Conners.[510] In 2021, Rodgers took part in The Match IV, which was the fourth installment in the exhibition match play golf series. He was paired with professional golfer Bryson DeChambeau. The team went up against Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady.[511] DeChambeau and Rodgers won the match 3 and 2.[512] Rodgers also took part in the sixth edition of The Match, where he teamed up with Brady against fellow quarterbacks Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes.[513] Rodgers and Brady defeated Mahomes and Allen 1 up.[514] Rodgers is the founder, and the co-creator, along with David Gruber, of itsAaron,[515] a charity with a mission of \"creating awareness for organizations and people who are changing the world\".[516][517] He is also a supporter of the MACC Fund,[518][519] Raise Hope for Congo,[520] and other humanitarian and charitable efforts.[521][522] Rodgers' Celebrity Jeopardy! win earned $50,000 for the MACC Fund.[523][524] During his 2021 appearance as Jeopardy! guest host, the show made a charitable donation equal to the cumulative winnings of the contestants (including the runners-up) for those ten shows.[506] Rodgers is a supporter of his alma mater, University of California, Berkeley. He has donated funds to renovate the athletic facilities[525] and also established an endowed scholarship for transfer students at the school. In 2021, he was honored by the school for his charitable work.[526] In 2021, Rodgers donated $1 million to help small businesses in Chico and Butte County, California.[527] In 2024, Rodgers raised $3 million for charities with a flag football tournament.[528]",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/new-york-jets The documentary \"Enigma\" delves into the life and work of the oldest player in the NFL today. With a 19-year career and 41 years of age, Aaron Rodgers is the oldest active player in the NFL. Although this is a cause for respect, it also has its downside, as it often makes him the target of all kinds of jokes regarding his age, as revealed by the quarterback himself. Rodgers began his professional career in 2005 with the Green Bay Packers, with whom he played 18 seasons before signing in 2023 with the New York Jets. Although the veteran continues to play at the highest level, his most recent two years have been tougher than expected. In 2023, an injury kept him from playing the entire season, while in 2024, several persistent injuries and a slump in his play intensified the debate regarding his age. Off the field, it's not easy either, although Rodgers tries to take it with humor, comments and \"jokes\" about his age are more frequent than he would like. Related: In a newly released Netflix docuseries, the Jets signal-caller recalled an unusual conversation with Willie Randolph. In an elevator encounter, the former MLB executive asked Rodgers, \"Were you in Green Bay in 1991?\" to which the quarterback humorously replied, \"No, I was not. I was 7 in '91 for most of the year, but thank you.\" The Super Bowl XLV champion revealed that it is common for people to confuse him with players from past decades. In similar conversations, he explained, he has been asked if he played with legends like Steve Young or John Elway, who retired in 1999 and 1998, respectively. Rodgers seems relatively comfortable with being the punchline of elderly jokes. In fact, he is also aware that he has played longer than most of his contemporaries, \"But never in 1991.\" The \"Enigma\" docuseries delves into Rodgers' life, exploring his playing career and lesser-known facets of his life. Among these, his controversial use of ayahuasca as an aid in his spiritual awakening, and the estrangement from his family. Religion of Sports, Skydance Sports, and NFL Films produced the documentary, which is available on Netflix starting this week. Beyond the senior citizen jokes, the series is a journey into the life of one of the most polarizing names in the NFL. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

                "content": "Rayful Edmond III (November 26, 1964 – December 17, 2024) was an American drug trafficker in Washington, D.C. in the 1980s. Edmond was largely responsible for having introduced crack cocaine into the Washington, D.C. area during the crack epidemic, resulting in an escalating crime rate in the city which became known as the \"murder capital of the United States\".[1] Edmond was alleged to have moved large amounts of cocaine. In an indictment involving two of Edmond's associates Dwayne (D.C. Scorpio), it was said that they bought between 1,000 and 2,000 kilos per week in 1992 from the Trujillo-Blanco brothers, who were associated with the Medellin cartel, and sold the drugs to Washington area wholesalers. He was known to have spent some $457,619 in an exclusive Georgetown store (Linea Pitti, specializing in Italian men's clothing) owned by Charles Wynn who was later convicted on 34 counts of money laundering. Edmond's estimated revenue was approximately $300 million annually.[2] In one year, Edmond's organization, which employed 150 people, committed 30 murders.[3] Remarking on Edmond, longtime D.C. mayor Marion Barry wrote in his autobiography: He was a young, likable guy, good-looking, with a good personality, and a lot of his friends he played basketball with had no idea that he was involved in drug selling. He was basically pulled into it from his family. That doesn't make it right, but Rayful had a lot of people who liked him and were very loyal to him.[4] Edmond was an avid fan of the Georgetown Hoyas, and frequently sat courtside with his entourage at the Capital Centre for home games. At the height of his empire, he became very friendly with several Hoyas players. When Georgetown University basketball coach (and D.C. native) John Thompson confirmed what was happening, he sent word through his sources to have Edmond meet him at his office at McDonough Gymnasium. When Edmond arrived, Thompson was initially cordial, and informed Edmond that he needed to cease all contacts with his players,[5] specifically John Turner and Alonzo Mourning, both of whom had befriended Edmond.[6] However, Thompson's parting words to Edmond were that Edmond would face serious consequences if he did not stay away from his players.[7] It is believed that Thompson is the only person to stand up to Edmond without consequence,[8] initially causing some shock and surprise that there was no reprisal against Thompson for it. However, in a memoir published posthumously in December 2020, Thompson characterized the encounter very differently, calling it very respectful. Thompson asked Rayful if he would make sure that Alonzo and John were not wrapped up in any of the illegal activity. Rayful told Thompson that he would take care of it and both men left the meeting in agreement and with respect for each other as human beings. Rayful is quoted as saying afterwards, \"Coach Thompson is cool as hell\".[9] Edmond was arrested on April 15, 1989,[10] at the age of 24. His arrest and subsequent trial were widely covered by local and national media. Judicial officials, fearful of reprisals from members of Edmond's gang, imposed unprecedented security during the trial. Jurors' identities were kept secret before, during, and after trial, and their seating area was enclosed in bulletproof glass. The presiding judge even barred the public from the trial in an effort to protect the jury.[3] Edmond was jailed at the maximum security Marine Corps Brig at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia and flown to the Federal Court House in Washington, D.C. by helicopter each day for his trial. Authorities took this unusual step due to heightened fears of an armed escape attempt. Edmond was convicted of numerous federal violations: (1) Engaging in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise, under 21 U.S.C. §§ 848(b), 853 (Count One); (2) Conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than 5 kilograms of cocaine and more than 50 grams of cocaine base, under 21 U.S.C. § 846 (Count Two); (3) Unlawfully employing a person under 18 years of age, under 21 U.S.C. § 845b (Count Five); (4) Interstate travel in aid of racketeering, under 18 U.S.C. § 1952(a) (Count Eleven); (5) Unlawful use of a communications facility, under 21 U.S.C. § 843(b) (Counts Fourteen, Fifteen, Sixteen, and Eighteen).[11] On September 17, 1990, the District Court imposed sentences of mandatory life without parole on Count One, life without parole on Counts Two and Five, 60 months on Count Eleven, and 48 months on Counts Fourteen, Fifteen, Sixteen, and Eighteen. Edmond's sentences were to run concurrently.[11] Edmond was eventually sentenced to life in prison without parole. His mother, Constance \"Bootsie\" Perry,[12] was sentenced to 14 years in prison for participating in his criminal enterprise. Several of his sisters and cousins also received sentences.[11] Edmond continued to deal after being incarcerated in the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, in Pennsylvania. He hooked up with Dixon Dario and Osvaldo \"Chiqui\" Trujillo-Blanco (son of Griselda \"Godmother\" Trujillo Blanco) who shared the same cell block with him. Edmond was setting up deals between D.C. area traffickers and his Colombian connection while incarcerated. In 1996, Edmond and another drug dealer from Atlanta, named Lowe, were convicted after conducting drug business from a federal prison phone. Edmond received an additional 30-year sentence. In an interview with the Bureau of Prisons, Edmond said he had spent several hours every day on the telephone, occasionally using two lines simultaneously to conduct his drug business. Attorney General Eric Holder criticized the Federal Bureau of Prisons for its lax management that allowed drug deals to be conducted from inside prison.[13] In 1996, federal authorities revealed that Edmond had become a government informant.[13][14] With Edmond's cooperation, the government arrested 11 alleged drug dealers working in Washington D.C. In exchange, federal prosecutors agreed to seek a reduced sentence for Edmond's mother.[14] Edmond remained incarcerated but later became part of the United States Federal Witness Protection Program. The prison where he was held was not publicly disclosed by the government.[15] In 2019, Edmond returned to D.C. for hearings on whether his life sentence should be reduced to time served based on the information he provided to authorities concerning 20 homicides. At the time, a survey by the District of Columbia Attorney General showed that half of D.C. residents thought Edmond should be released.[15] In 2021, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted the government's request for early release, although Edmond has a separate 30-year sentence for running his operation from prison.[16] On July 31, 2024, Edmond was transferred from prison to a halfway house at an undisclosed location in Kentucky or Tennessee under the supervision of the Bureau of Prisons Nashville Residential Reentry Management Office.[17][18] He died in Florida on December 17, 2024, only a few months after his release from prison, from a heart attack. He was 60.[19]",

He was 60 years old. Known as the “king of cocaine,” Edmond was transferred from prison to community confinement only five months ago and was set to be released in November of next year, after more than 35 years in federal custody. Edmond oversaw a sprawling drug network that fueled the city’s devastating crack epidemic, contributing to a dramatic rise in homicides and harming the lives of countless people. Armed enforcers, wielding Uzi submachine guns, protected Edmond’s territory as he ran an operation linked to at least 30 murders, although none were directly attributed to him. During the 1980s, law enforcement said Edmond was making up to $2 million each week and moving up to 1,700 pounds of cocaine per month. He was a household name in D.C., living a lavish lifestyle that included sponsoring local basketball tournaments and frequent trips to Las Vegas for high-profile boxing matches. Edmond was arrested in April of 1989 and had been serving a life sentence in prison without parole for drug distribution, and was sent to a maximum-security prison in Pennsylvania. He continued to run a drug distribution network from inside the prison, and when he was caught, Edmond received an additional 30-year sentence. After his arrest, Edmond cooperated with the government for 17 years, helping them prosecute over 100 drug dealers. His D.C. life sentence was reduced to 20 years in 2021, and the additional 30 years came from sentencing out of Pennsylvania. However, the Bureau of Prisons said he got a sentence reduction of 288 months, which he served. The Bureau of Prisons did not release details about the cause of Edmond’s death.

                "content": "Conor Anthony McGregor (born 14 July 1988) is an Irish professional mixed martial artist, professional boxer, businessman and actor. He is a former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Featherweight and Lightweight Champion, becoming the first UFC fighter to hold UFC championships in two weight classes simultaneously.[10] He is also a former simultaneous Cage Warriors Fighting Championship (CWFC) Featherweight and Lightweight Champion. In 2008, McGregor began competing on the professional mixed martial arts (MMA) circuit in the lightweight and featherweight divisions. In 2012, he won the vacant CWFC Featherweight and Lightweight Championships. A year later, he signed with the UFC. After five straight wins, he challenged for the Interim Featherweight Championship and defeated Chad Mendes at UFC 189. After he knocked out featherweight champion José Aldo in 13 seconds at UFC 194, his fame catapulted tremendously.[11] He made his welterweight debut at UFC 196 where he was defeated by Nate Diaz via submission, marking his first loss in the UFC. In November 2016, he defeated Eddie Alvarez at UFC 205 and won the UFC Lightweight Championship. He briefly transitioned to boxing in 2017, making his professional debut against Floyd Mayweather Jr., where he was defeated via TKO in the 10th round. He returned to MMA and challenged for the UFC Lightweight Championship at UFC 229, losing to lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov via submission. McGregor is the biggest pay-per-view (PPV) draw in MMA history, having headlined the five highest-selling UFC PPV events.[12] His bout with Nurmagomedov at UFC 229 drew 2.4 million PPV buys, the most ever for an MMA event.[13] His 2017 boxing bout with Floyd Mayweather Jr.[14] drew over 5.3 million buys across the United States and the United Kingdom, and became the second highest buy rate in pay-per-view history.[15][16][17] McGregor was ranked as the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2021, earning a reported $180 million.[18] He also featured in the list in 2018, when he was ranked fourth, with a reported income of $99 million.[19] Outside of his fighting career, McGregor has ventured into business, and is best known for his alcohol-related ventures. Throughout his career, McGregor has become the subject of many controversies due to his behaviour, ranging from driving offences to assault, disorderly conduct and rape. He has made controversial comments about the 2023 Dublin riots, the Irish government's immigration policy and race. In November 2024, the Irish High Court, in a civil case, found that he assaulted and raped a woman in December 2018, ordering him to pay over €248,000 in damages.[20] In December 2024, he was further ordered to pay the entirety of her legal costs, approximately €1,500,000.[21] After the verdict, McGregor was widely condemned, losing several partnership deals. Conor Anthony McGregor[22] was born in Dublin, Ireland.[1] He was raised in Crumlin and attended Irish-language schools — the Gaelscoil Scoil Mológa, in Harold's Cross, at primary level, and Gaelcholáiste Coláiste de hÍde in Tallaght at secondary level, where he also developed his passion for sport, playing football.[23] In his youth, he played football for Lourdes Celtic Football Club.[24] At the age of 12, he also began boxing at Crumlin Boxing Club,[25][26] as a way to defend himself against bullies and raise his confidence. In 2006, McGregor moved with his family to Lucan, Dublin, attending Gaelcholáiste Coláiste Cois Life. Following that, he commenced a plumbing apprenticeship.[27] While in Lucan, he met future UFC fighter Tom Egan and they soon started training mixed martial arts (MMA) together.[28] Among his inspirations growing up were Naseem Hamed, Muhammad Ali and Bruce Lee.[29][30] On 17 February 2007, at the age of 18, McGregor made his mixed martial arts debut in an amateur fight against Kieran Campbell for the Irish Ring of Truth promotion in Dublin. He won via technical knockout (TKO) in the first round. Following the fight, he turned professional and was signed by the Irish Cage of Truth promotion. In 2008, McGregor began training at the Straight Blast Gym (SBG) in Dublin under John Kavanagh.[31] On 9 March 2008, McGregor had his first professional MMA bout, as a lightweight, defeating Gary Morris with a second-round TKO. After McGregor won his second fight against Mo Taylor, he made his featherweight debut in a loss via kneebar against submission specialist Artemij Sitenkov. After a victory at featherweight in his next bout against Stephen Bailey, McGregor contemplated a different career path before his mother contacted his coach John Kavanagh and reinvigorated him to continue pursuing mixed martial arts.[32] McGregor then won his next fight, also at featherweight, against Connor Dillon, before moving back to lightweight for a fight against Joseph Duffy, in which he received his second professional loss after submitting to an arm-triangle choke. Following this, during 2011 and 2012, McGregor went on an eight-fight winning streak,[33] during which he won both the CWFC Featherweight and Lightweight championships, making him the first European professional mixed martial artist to hold titles in two divisions simultaneously.[34] In February 2013, UFC president Dana White made a trip to Dublin, Ireland to receive a Gold Medal of Honorary Patronage from Trinity College and was inundated with requests to sign McGregor to the UFC. After a meeting with McGregor and talking with UFC CEO Lorenzo Fertitta, White offered him a contract days later.[35] In February 2013, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) announced that they had signed McGregor to a multi-fight contract.[36] In joining, he became only the second fighter from Ireland to compete for the company, following team member Tom Egan. On 6 April 2013, McGregor made his UFC debut against Marcus Brimage at UFC on Fuel TV: Mousasi vs. Latifi.[37] He won the fight by knockout in round one.[38] The win also earned McGregor his first \"Knockout of the Night\" award.[39] McGregor was expected to face Andy Ogle on 17 August 2013 at UFC Fight Night 26, but Ogle pulled out of the bout citing an injury and was replaced by eventual UFC Featherweight Champion Max Holloway.[40] McGregor won the fight by unanimous decision (30–27, 30–27, 30–26). Following the bout with Holloway, an MRI scan revealed that McGregor had torn his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) during the bout and would require surgery, keeping him out of action for up to ten months.[41] McGregor was expected to face Cole Miller on 19 July 2014, at UFC Fight Night 46 in his comeback bout after recovering from his ACL injury.[42] However, Miller pulled out of the bout citing a thumb injury and was replaced by Diego Brandão.[43] McGregor fought Brandão in front of a loud, rowdy crowd of 9,500 at The O2 in his hometown of Dublin, Ireland. The fight was officially halted by referee Leon Roberts at 4:05 of the first round. The win earned McGregor his first Performance of the Night award.[44] Prior to his next bout, McGregor met with Lorenzo Fertitta and signed a new multi-fight contract with the UFC. McGregor next faced Dustin Poirier on 27 September 2014, at UFC 178.[45] Despite McGregor landing only 9 significant strikes to Poirier's 10, he managed to secure a victory early on in the first round, by pressuring Poirier onto his back foot, before exploding with a left hook behind Poirier's ear, forcing referee Herb Dean to step in to end the fight. The finish officially came at 1:46 into the first round.[46][47] This marked Poirier's first UFC loss via KO/TKO and earned McGregor his second straight \"Performance of the Night\" award.[48] McGregor faced Dennis Siver on 18 January 2015 at UFC Fight Night 59.[49][50] He won the fight via TKO in the second round.[51] The victory also earned McGregor his third straight \"Performance of the Night\" award.[52] The highly anticipated bout with Aldo was announced on 30 January 2015, at the UFC 183 Q&A. McGregor declared that he was expected to face Aldo on 11 July 2015 at UFC 189 for the undisputed UFC Featherweight Championship, during the UFC's annual International Fight Week. The fight took place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.[53] The UFC, confident that the fight would exceed expectations, increased the promotional budget for the event, with company Dana White stating that \"[the UFC] spent more money promoting Aldo–McGregor than any fight in UFC history.\"[54] The fight against Aldo was announced on 30 January 2015, at the UFC 183 and both McGregor and Aldo embarked on a 12-day world tour, during which eight cities in five countries were visited, including Aldo's home country of Brazil (Rio de Janeiro) and McGregor's hometown of Dublin. The tour began in Rio de Janeiro on 20 March and ended in Dublin on 31 March.[55] However, on 23 June, it was reported that Aldo had suffered a rib fracture and had pulled out of the bout as a consequence.[56][57] McGregor remained on the card and was rescheduled to face Chad Mendes for the Interim Featherweight Championship.[58] The official attendance for the event, 16,019, broke the record in Nevada, while the gate of $7,200,000 broke the record for a mixed martial arts event in the United States.[59] Prior to the fight, McGregor's entrance song, \"The Foggy Dew\", was sung live by Irish singer-songwriter Sinéad O'Connor.[60] McGregor won the fight via TKO, winning the UFC Interim Featherweight Championship.[61][62] McGregor then took part in UFC's The Ultimate Fighter, in which he coached against Urijah Faber.[63] Faber's team member Ryan Hall ended up winning the competition. On 10 August, it was announced that the event would take place on 12 December, when McGregor would face José Aldo for the UFC Featherweight Championship.[64] At the weigh-ins, both McGregor and Aldo achieved the weight limit of 145 pounds.[65][66] McGregor knocked out Aldo thirteen seconds into the first round with a left hook, ending his seven-year-long WEC and UFC title reign and eighteen-fight win streak to claim the title, earning the \"Performance of the Night\" bonus as well.[67][68] This finish marked the fastest knockout in a title bout in UFC history.[69] McGregor faced The Ultimate Fighter Season 5 winner and former UFC Lightweight Championship challenger Nate Diaz on 5 March 2016 at UFC 196 in a welterweight bout.[70] On 24 February 2016, a press conference was held to help promote the new main event, with both men trading insults.[71] At the Thursday pre-fight press conference on 3 March, McGregor and Diaz engaged in a brief scuffle during a face-off, after McGregor landed a strike on Diaz's lead hand.[72] The fight began with combination in the first round, Diaz returned fire with two consecutive hooks, one a slap, a signature of Nate and his brother, Nick Diaz, termed the \"Stockton Slap\". McGregor had success with his bodywork, but Diaz began to land combinations of his own. After a one-two punches from Diaz, McGregor attempted a double leg takedown, which Diaz defended by sprawling. Diaz then threatened the guillotine choke, which forced McGregor onto his back after stopping McGregor from scrambling and Diaz secured the mount and secured a rear naked choke. McGregor tapped to the submission at 4:12 into the second round.[73][74][75] Both competitors were awarded \"Fight of the Night\" bonuses, and McGregor received the highest disclosed purse of any fighter in the history of the company to that point, at $1,000,000.[76][77] McGregor was critical of his own performance while praising Diaz, saying \"I was inefficient with my energy. It was a battle of energy and he got the better of that.\"[78] A rematch with Diaz was scheduled for 9 July at UFC 200; however, on 19 April, the UFC announced that McGregor had been pulled from the event after failing to fulfil media obligations related to the fight.[79][80][81] In turn, the fight with McGregor was rescheduled and took place the following month, contested again at welterweight, at UFC 202.[82] McGregor won the rematch via majority decision (48–47, 47–47, 48–47).[83] The bout was once again awarded \"Fight of the Night\" honours.[84] The event broke the record previously held by UFC 100 for the highest selling pay-per-view in UFC history, with 1,650,000 buys.[85] On 27 September, it was officially announced that McGregor's next bout would be against Eddie Alvarez for the UFC Lightweight Championship on 12 November at UFC 205.[86] After dropping Alvarez multiple times throughout the first round, McGregor landed a multiple-punch combination to stop his opponent via technical knockout in the second round.[87] This result marked the first time a competitor had held UFC championships in two different weight classes, and it also repeated McGregor's feat during his career at Cage Warriors.[88][89] This win earned McGregor the \"Performance of the Night\" and is widely considered one of his best performances inside the octagon.[90][91][92] On 26 November, due to his inactivity in the division, it was initially announced that McGregor had vacated the Featherweight Championship, therefore promoting José Aldo to undisputed champion.[93] McGregor's coach, however, confirmed further reports which stated that McGregor had actually been stripped of the title.[94] After winning the lightweight championship at UFC 205, McGregor announced he would take time off from the UFC to wait for the birth of his first child due in 2017.[95] McGregor spent the majority of his public appearances in early-2017 campaigning for a boxing match with Floyd Mayweather Jr.[96] After months of negotiations, the two finally came to terms on 14 June 2017 and announced the match to take place on 26 August.[97] The match ultimately ended in the 10th round with a victory by TKO for Mayweather.[14] After the conclusion of UFC 223 on 7 April, McGregor was stripped of the UFC Lightweight Championship due to inactivity[10] and Khabib Nurmagomedov was crowned the undisputed champion after defeating Al Iaquinta at the event.[98] On 3 August, it was announced that McGregor would return to the octagon for the first time since November 2016 at UFC 229 to challenge the undefeated Khabib Nurmagomedov for the UFC Lightweight Championship on 6 October.[99] This bout was considered one of the biggest contests in the history of the sport and it was filled with pre-fight hype.[100][101][102] Nurmagomedov submitted McGregor with a neck crank in the fourth round.[103][104] On 26 March 2019, McGregor announced his retirement on social media.[105][106] However, Dana White viewed this announcement as a ploy to secure an ownership stake in the company,[107][108] with White later suggesting his retirement would not last and that he had been in regular contact with him and stated he would fight again in the future.[109] McGregor had previously tweeted that he wanted a rematch with Khabib Nurmagomedov and that he would see him in the Octagon.[110][111] After over a year away from the Octagon, McGregor faced Donald Cerrone in a welterweight bout on 18 January 2020 at UFC 246.[112] He won the fight via technical knockout 40 seconds into the first round.[113] This win earned him a Performance of the Night award.[114] The win made McGregor the first UFC fighter to hold knockout finishes in the featherweight, lightweight and welterweight divisions.[115] On 6 June 2020, McGregor announced once more that he was retiring from fighting.[116] Despite talks of retirement, McGregor was booked to face former UFC Lightweight Championship challenger Dustin Poirier in a rematch of their 2014 bout at UFC 257 on 24 January 2021.[117] He lost the fight via technical knockout in the second round, marking the first knockout loss in his career.[118] McGregor was later handed a 6–month medical suspension after the knockout.[119] McGregor faced Dustin Poirier for a third time on 10 July 2021 at UFC 264.[120] McGregor lost the fight via technical knockout in round one after the ringside doctor stopped the bout. McGregor had rolled his ankle while stepping back, resulting in a broken lower tibia which rendered him unable to continue.[121][122][123] After the layoff nursing his leg injury, McGregor coached The Ultimate Fighter 31 for the second time with the opposing coach being Michael Chandler. Filming of the show started in February 2023[124] and aired on television from May to August 2023.[125] The show led to McGregor being scheduled to fight in a welterweight bout against Chandler at UFC 303 on June 29, 2024.[126] Following speculation on the fight's status due to an abruptly cancelled press conference,[127][128] the UFC officially announced the fight's cancellation on June 13, 2024, citing an injury (broken toe) sustained by McGregor.[129] McGregor is known mostly as a counter-striker[130][131] and prefers to fight standing up, as opposed to on the ground. He is known for his striking precision and knockout power.[132] McGregor is left-handed and primarily fights out of the southpaw stance, but often switches to an orthodox stance. He will frequently try to be the aggressor in his bouts.[1] McGregor's boxing is typically considered his best skill, with the majority of his victories coming by way of knockout or technical knockout via punches.[26] Many pundits cite McGregor's pull-back left-handed counter as his most dangerous strike.[133][134][135] McGregor's signature style off arena is to repeatedly engage in trash talk and \"psychological warfare\" against his opponents, which has led to earning him the moniker 'The Notorious'[136] and has brought comparisons with Muhammad Ali, whom McGregor cites as one of his early inspirations.[137][138][139][140] After Ali died in June 2016, McGregor opined that \"nobody will ever come close to [Ali's] greatness\".[141][142] McGregor has also cited Bruce Lee as an inspiration,[143] and compared himself to Lee.[144] During the buildup to his bout against Donald Cerrone and the rematch against Dustin Poirier, McGregor was respectful towards his opponents and refrained from trash talking.[145][146] However, McGregor heavily used trash talk in the build up to his trilogy fight with Poirier.[147] On 14 June 2017, it was announced that McGregor would compete in his first professional boxing match against the undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr., on 26 August 2017 at T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada. The fight was broadcast on Showtime PPV in the US and Sky Sports Box Office in the UK.[148] The bout was contested at super welterweight (154 pounds) with 8 oz. gloves.[149][150] The fight was expected to be the richest in boxing history.[151] On 24 August 2017, it was announced that Mayweather and McGregor would compete for the WBC Money Belt.[152] According to the Nevada State Athletic Commission, Mayweather would earn a guaranteed purse of $100 million and McGregor was guaranteed $30 million.[153] The match resulted in Mayweather winning via TKO in the 10th round, with the scorecards reading 87–83, 89–82, 89–81, all in favour of Mayweather. The Nevada State Athletic Commission announced the live gate for the event was $55,414,865.79 from 13,094 tickets sold.[154] Given the success in pay-per-views, Mayweather reportedly earned around $280 million overall, while McGregor came out with earning $130 million.[155] On 23 November 2023, in response to the stabbing of a woman and three children in Dublin, McGregor made multiple anti-immigration statements, tweeting that \"Ireland is at war\". In response to a tweet by Britain First leader Paul Golding calling on McGregor to lead a \"freedom march\", McGregor condemned the riots that followed the stabbings but tweeted \"Ashling Murphy murdered. Two Sligo men decapitated. This is NOT Ireland's future! If they do not act soon with their plan of action to ensure Ireland's safety, I will.\" He also called for the man who perpetrated the stabbings to be \"tortured and killed\".[156] It was reported on 28 November that McGregor was being investigated as part of a criminal probe into incitement to hatred, following his social media statements following the stabbings.[157] On 26 November 2023, McGregor criticised Taoiseach Leo Varadkar for his views on immigration and for his failure to mention the Palestinian militant group Hamas when he wrote about an Irish hostage released by the group, in which he described her as \"an innocent child who was lost\".[158] It was reported in December 2023 that McGregor was considering running for the office of President of Ireland,[159] to which Elon Musk posted on X \"Not a bad idea.\"[160] As to why he would run, McGregor said, \"Among many other things, the allocation of our nation's funds has been nothing short of criminal, and without an iota of consideration for the public's thinking. ... Our people feel ignored. Unheard. Until of course election time. Then the waffle begins.\"[159] A poll that month found that eight percent of people polled would vote for McGregor for office, while 89 percent said they would not.[161] McGregor has endorsement deals with Beats by Dre, Monster Energy, Reebok and Bud Light.[162][163] In 2017, his endorsement deals rounded up to $7 million.[164] In early 2018, McGregor signed a deal with Burger King.[165] In light of a 2024 Dublin court case, in which McGregor was found to have assaulted and raped a woman in December 2018, McGregor lost his first sponsor when the IO Interactive video game company ceased its collaboration with him.[166][167] After the court case, Rape Crisis Network Ireland called for retailers to stop selling his stout and whiskey brands.[168] Musgrave delisted McGregor-linked drinks,[169] resulting in SuperValu, Costcutter, Centra and Carry Out ceasing to sell McGregor's Forged Irish Stout and Proper No. Twelve whiskey.[170] Tesco and Ocado additionally pulled all alcoholic products associated with McGregor from their stores,[171][172] alongside Wetherspoons, Asda, and BWG Group who stopped stocking Proper No. Twelve whiskey.[173][174] Irish airports in Cork and Dublin also pulled McGregor-related alcohol products from their airport bars.[175] Just ahead of his fight with Mayweather, McGregor announced a fashion partnership with tailoring brand David August; the brand is named \"August McGregor\" and is aimed at providing modern men's suits to millennials.[176] August had met McGregor about three years earlier, via Dana White.[177] In September 2018, McGregor launched Proper No. Twelve Irish whiskey in Ireland and the United States.[178] The whiskey is named after the Crumlin neighbourhood in Dublin 12, in which McGregor grew up.[179] In 2021, it was reported that McGregor and his business partners sold their majority stake in the Proper No. Twelve company to Proximo Spirits, who previously had a 49% stake, for a deal worth a reported $600 million.[180][181] In the aftermath of a 2024 Dublin court case, in which McGregor was found to have assaulted and raped a woman in December 2018, Proximo Spirits announced it would no longer use McGregor's name or image on the drink.[182] In an August 2022 interview Artem Lobov alleged that McGregor was initially headed towards creating a vodka product, but it was Lobov who pitched the idea of doing a whiskey instead.[183] In the same interview, Lobov also stated that he was the one who did the background study and conducted business deals for the product.[183] In late November 2022, news surfaced that Lobov had sued McGregor, seeking five percent of the proceeds of the $600 million deal conducted in 2021.[184] Following the suing, McGregor aimed several social media messages at Lobov, who subsequently filed another lawsuit against McGregor for defamation, intimidation and harassment.[185] In January 2023, the latter lawsuit was denied by the judge and Lobov was ordered to pay the legal fees.[186] In 2020, McGregor purchased a pub in South Dublin, renaming it to the Black Forge Inn.[187] In 2022, the Black Forge Inn was targeted by petrol bombs.[188] He purchased a second pub in 2021, the Marble Arch.[189] McGregor had previously assaulted a man at the Marble Arch on 6 April 2019.[190] McGregor officially launched Forged Irish Stout in 2021. In 2024, complaints about the sexualised nature of its advertising were upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland.[191] In 2022, McGregor was cast along with the actor Jake Gyllenhaal in a remake of the 1989 film Road House.[192] On April 27, 2024, it was announced that McGregor and his company \"McGregor Sports and Entertainment\" were now part-owners of Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship (BKFC).[193][194][195] McGregor has since appeared at multiple BKFC events. McGregor has two sisters named Erin and Aoife.[196] He has been in a relationship with his fiancée, Dee Devlin, since 2008.[197] They have four children.[198] McGregor often trains at the Mjölnir gym in Reykjavík, alongside fellow UFC fighter Gunnar Nelson.[199][200][201] He has stated that he does not adhere to any pre-fight rituals or superstitions because he believes them to be \"a form of fear\".[202][203] McGregor is a Catholic.[204] McGregor is a football fan and a supporter of both Celtic and Manchester United.[205][206] He has also expressed support for Paris Saint-Germain, being a friend of Sergio Ramos.[207] In November 2017 McGregor pleaded guilty to exceeding the speed limit in Rathcoole, County Dublin.[208] He was fined €400.[208] In November 2018 he pleaded guilty to speeding in Kill, County Kildare,[209] and was fined €1,000 and disqualified from driving for six months.[209] On 22 March 2022, McGregor was arrested in Dublin and charged with six driving offences, including two counts of dangerous driving, being uninsured, having no licence and failing to produce his documents. His car was seized by the Irish police.[210] He was released on bail and his car was returned to him. He was scheduled to appear before Blanchardstown district court in April 2022, and, if convicted, could be subject to a fine of up to €5,000, six months' imprisonment or both.[211][212][213] On 23 June 2022, McGregor appeared in Blanchardstown District Court in relation to events on 22 March 2022.[214][215] He was remanded on continuing bail pending \"further charges\" as part of a dangerous driving prosecution.[214][215] He has not yet indicated a plea and the judge remanded him to appear on 8 September 2022 for directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions.[214][215] On 8 September he was charged with an additional charge of careless driving, adding to the six charges he already faced over the incident: two charges of dangerous driving, two of allegedly driving with no license or insurance and two of failing to produce either license or insurance.[216] The trial was originally set to begin in January 2023, but after McGregor's defence argued to the court that he could not attend the trial then due to being unwell,[217] the judge in the case ordered the trial to start on 31 July 2024.[217] Ahead of his 2015 bout with Brazilian fighter José Aldo, McGregor was accused of racially taunting Aldo.[218] In 2017, McGregor was accused of racism, after taunting boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. ahead of their August 26 boxing match. McGregor told the 46-year-old to \"Dance for me, boy,\" at a promotional event in Los Angeles, before urging the crowd to yell obscenities at Mayweather, his wife and children. Mayweather told reporters at a fan meet in London: \"He totally disrespected Black women, he called Black people monkeys, and he was disrespectful to my [13-year-old] daughter.\"[219] McGregor responded in a lengthy post via Instagram, stating: \"Floyd Mayweather, don't ever bring race into my success again. I am an Irishman. My people have been oppressed our entire existence. And still very much are. I understand the feeling of prejudice. It is a feeling that is deep in my blood. In my family's long history of warfare there was a time where just having the name 'McGregor' was punishable by death. Do not ever put me in a bracket like this again...\"[220] On 10 November 2017, McGregor's SBG Ireland teammate Charlie Ward made his debut at Bellator 187 in Dublin against John Redmond.[221] Ward knocked out Redmond in round one,[222] and McGregor jumped the cage (he was not a licensed cornerman) to celebrate Ward's win while the fight was not yet officially declared over.[223] McGregor was separated by referee Marc Goddard, as Goddard needed to verify if the knockout was before the bell, and to ensure lock down of the cage for medical staff to assess the health of the knocked out Redmond. McGregor charged towards Goddard: while he pushed and confronted Goddard in a wild melee, he also checked on the downed Redmond and knocked him down while he was trying to get up.[224] McGregor did a lap around the cage after he exited the cage a few minutes later, then climbed and straddled the cage apron to continue the celebration of Ward's win. He was stopped by a commissioner and McGregor, agitated, slapped the commissioner's face.[225][226] Redmond stated after the fight that Goddard intended to let the fight continue to round two, but the Mohegan Sun commission, which oversaw the event, elected to end the fight due to McGregor's behaviour in the ring.[227] A day after the incident, the head of the commission for Bellator 187, Mike Mazzulli, the president of both the Mohegan Tribe Department of Athletic Regulation (MTDAR) and Association of Boxing Commissions, issued a statement, stating that \"McGregor's conduct jeopardized the health and safety\" of fighters who were in the cage during the Ireland event. In addition, Mr McGregor assaulted Referee Mark Goddard and a (member of) Bellator staff.\"[228] On 3 April 2018, Khabib Nurmagomedov and his entourage cornered and slapped Artem Lobov at a hotel in Brooklyn, New York.[229][230] Lobov is known to be close to McGregor, with whom Nurmagomedov has had altercations and trash talk exchanges.[231] The two groups have a lengthy history of insults and confrontations. On 5 April 2018, during promotional appearances for UFC 223, McGregor and a group of about twenty others were let into the Barclays Center by credentialled members of his promotional team. They attempted to confront Nurmagomedov, who was on a bus leaving the arena with \"red corner\" fighters for UFC 223 on it, such as Rose Namajunas, Al Iaquinta, Karolina Kowalkiewicz, Ray Borg and Michael Chiesa.[232] McGregor ran up alongside the slowly moving bus and then ran past it to grab a metal equipment dolly, which he then threw at the bus's window, before trying to throw other objects in the vicinity.[233] Chiesa and Borg were injured by the shattered glass and sent to hospital. They were soon removed from the card on the advice of the NYSAC and the UFC's medical team.[234] Lobov was also pulled from his fight for his involvement in the dispute. Dana White said there was a warrant out for McGregor's arrest and the NYPD said McGregor was a person of interest.[235] White said McGregor had told him via text message: \"This had to be done.\"[236] \"You can imagine he's going to be sued beyond belief\", White said, and denied suggestions that the violence was a publicity stunt intended to generate interest in the UFC.[237] McGregor and others involved initially fled the Barclays Center after the incident,[238] although he and a fellow accused turned themselves in that night. McGregor was charged with three counts of assault and one count of criminal mischief.[239][240] He was further charged with menacing and reckless endangerment at his arraignment and was released on $50,000 bail until 14 June 2018.[241][242] Under the bail conditions negotiated by his then attorney, Jim Walden, and set by the judge, McGregor was allowed to travel without restriction.[243][244] On 12 April 2018, McGregor hired lawyer Bruce Mafeo of Cozen O'Connor to represent him in this matter.[245] McGregor pleaded no contest to a count of disorderly conduct and was ordered to perform five days of community service and attend anger management classes.[246] On 12 September 2018, Chiesa announced a lawsuit against McGregor, saying that he \"experienced pain, suffering and a loss of enjoyment of life\" as a result of the attack.[247] Following the fight at UFC 229 on 6 October 2018, Khabib Nurmagomedov jumped out of the cage and charged towards McGregor's training partner Dillon Danis. Soon afterwards, McGregor and Abubakar Nurmagomedov, Khabib's cousin, also attempted to exit the octagon, but a scuffle broke out after McGregor punched Abubakar, who then punched him back.[248] Two of Nurmagomedov's cornermen retaliated: Esed Emiragaev and Zubaira Tukhugov.[249] Tukhugov was scheduled to fight on 27 October 2018 at UFC Fight Night: Volkan vs. Smith against Artem Lobov, the McGregor team member who was confronted by Nurmagomedov in April 2018. Nurmagomedov's payment for the fight was withheld by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) as a result, pending an investigation into his actions. Nurmagomedov appeared at the post-fight interview and apologized to the NSAC.[250] The NSAC filed a formal complaint against both McGregor and Nurmagomedov, and on 24 October, the NSAC voted to release half of Nurmagomedov's $2 million fight payout immediately.[251] Both Nurmagomedov and McGregor received indefinite bans, at least until the official hearing, which took place in December 2018.[252] On 29 January 2019, the NSAC announced a six-month suspension for McGregor (retroactive to 6 October 2018) and a $50,000 fine. He became eligible to compete again on 6 April 2019.[253] In March 2019, The New York Times reported that McGregor was under investigation by the Garda Síochána (police), following allegations of a sexual assault on a woman in a Dublin hotel in December 2018.[254][255] A second allegation of sexual assault was reported in October 2019, regarding an assault on a woman in a car alleged to have taken place earlier that month.[256] In January 2021, after prosecutors declined to prosecute McGregor for the 2018 alleged sexual assault, a civil claim for damages was launched in the High Court. A spokeswoman for McGregor said in a statement that the allegations against him were \"categorically rejected\" and that he was \"confident that justice will prevail\" in the civil case.[257][258] In March 2022, the High Court made a pre-trial discovery order against McGregor requiring the Gardaí to disclose certain information and documents gathered by them.[259] The civil action was taken against McGregor by Nikita Hand, who alleged he violently beat and raped her in Dublin in December 2018. The trial began in the High Court in Dublin on 5 November 2024, with Mr Justice Alexander Owens as judge.[260][261][262] On 22 November 2024, the jury returned their verdict and found that McGregor had raped Hand. Accordingly, McGregor was ordered to pay Hand nearly €250,000 in damages.[263][264][265][266] On 5 December 2024, Justice Owens ordered McGregor to pay the entirety of Hand's legal costs, approximately €1,500,000, and said that he may begin contempt of court proceedings against McGregor for his comments about the case on social media after it concluded.[267][268][269] After the trial, McGregor indicated on social media that he planned to appeal the verdict, and Hand said she hoped that the case would encourage victims of assault to continue \"pushing forward for justice\". The Irish Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee, praised Hand's bravery and determination, and the Taoiseach, Simon Harris, had a phone conversation with Hand before complimenting her \"bravery and courage\" when speaking to the media.[270][271][272] It also emerged that Hand's partner had been stabbed and windows were smashed when attackers wearing balaclavas invaded their home in June 2024. This information was withheld from the jury during the trial.[273] In light of the court ruling, IO Interactive ceased its collaboration with McGregor, removing content that featured him from their Hitman video game series.[274] The Rape Crisis Network Ireland also called for retailers to stop selling his stout and whiskey brands.[275] Various retailers and Irish wholesalers, including the Musgrave Group, announced that they would no longer stock his beer brand or whiskey, which would see the brands removed from SuperValu, Centra, Tesco Ireland, Spar, Mace and Londis stores, among others.[276] A few days after the verdict, Proper No. Twelve-parent company Proximo Spirits announced it would no longer feature McGregor in association with the brand.[277] Wetherspoons and other pub chains likewise stopped selling McGregor's stout brand.[278] On 11 March 2019, McGregor was arrested outside of the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, after he attacked a fan taking a picture with a cellphone. In an incident that was caught on a security camera, McGregor lunged to hit the man, grabbed his device and smashed it on the ground with his feet. Subsequently, he was arrested and charged with strong-armed robbery and criminal mischief.[279] McGregor was held in custody for several hours before being released on a $5,000 bond. On 14 March 2019, news surfaced that McGregor was also facing a civil lawsuit from the fan involved in the incident.[280] On 8 April, the civil lawsuit against McGregor was dropped by the fan.[281] On 13 May, it was revealed that the criminal charges against McGregor had also been dropped after the accuser's attorney said that his client had \"been made whole\" by McGregor, in a reference to an out-of-court settlement that was reached.[282][283] On 15 August 2019, TMZ Sports published a video that showed McGregor punching an older man at The Marble Arch Pub in Dublin.[190] The incident happened on 6 April and was originally reported by Irish media, although without the video that showed the attack.[284] McGregor had repeatedly offered the victim a shot of his whiskey, which the victim repeatedly declined, then McGregor had punched him.[284] Irish police stated that they had opened an investigation.[285] McGregor was charged with assault and first appeared in court on 11 October 2019.[284] The court heard that McGregor had 18 prior convictions from 2018 going back to 2009.[284] The majority were for driving offences, but he was given the Probation Act in 2009 when he was an apprentice plumber for an assault causing harm offence.[284] On 1 November, McGregor pleaded guilty to the assault and was fined €1,000.[286][284] On 10 September 2020, McGregor was arrested on the French island of Corsica on suspicion of attempted sexual assault and indecent exposure for an incident alleged to have taken place in a bar. After being held in custody for two days while being interviewed by police, he was released without charge.[287][288][289] Eight months later, French authorities dropped the investigation due to insufficient evidence.[290][291] On 17 October 2021, McGregor allegedly assaulted Francesco Facchinetti, an Italian musician and TV presenter, in a nightclub in Rome, breaking Facchinetti's nose in front of witnesses and bodyguards. A few days later, Facchinetti filed charges against McGregor for the attack.[292][293][294][295][296] In January 2023, McGregor was accused of assaulting a 42-year-old woman aboard his yacht in Ibiza, Spain, during his birthday party on 22 July 2022. The woman claimed she was berated by McGregor before being physically assaulted. She further claimed that she was forced to jump from the yacht to escape McGregor and that she sustained a broken arm in the process. The woman did not file a formal statement with Spanish police at the time of the incident. In January, she gave a formal statement with Irish police, who then shared that statement with their Spanish counterparts. The woman has also filed a civil suit against McGregor over the alleged incident.[297][298][299] After making her formal statement, the woman's car was set ablaze outside of her Dublin home.[300] In February, a brick was reportedly thrown through a window of that residence.[301] In late February 2023, news surfaced that the lawsuit was discontinued by the plaintiff, with no further information provided.[302] On 10 June 2023, McGregor appeared at Game Four of the 2023 NBA Finals in Miami, Florida, to promote his pain relief spray in a planned skit with the Miami Heat's mascot, Burnie. McGregor proceeded to punch the man wearing the mascot costume (Heat dancer Chris Brown) once and \"knock him out\", but then he dealt a second, powerful and apparently off-script punch to Brown's jaw while Brown was on the ground. Brown was subsequently treated in a local hospital emergency room and later released. Most of the crowd in attendance booed McGregor for his actions.[303][304] On 13 June, three days after the incident, McGregor claimed that \"it was a skit\" and that \"all is well\" between the two.[305][306] On 11 June 2023, Miami police received a report that McGregor had sexually assaulted a woman the previous night in a restroom at the Miami Heat arena after Game Four of the NBA Finals.[307] McGregor released a statement via the Kessler PR Group, a public relations and crisis management group, denying the allegation.[308] On 18 October, the case was dropped.[309] [369]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. There was ultimately not much \"show\" to The Showdown on Tuesday night as the PGA Tour pairing of Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy took it to the LIV Golf duo of Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka to win the inaugural event in decisive fashion. Scheffler & McIlroy raced through the initial four-ball match, eked out the foursomes match and cruised through the singles matches to win the 2.5 points necessary to reign supreme in Las Vegas. Scheffler & McIlroy jumped out the gates and never looked back at Shadow Creek Golf Club. Leaning primarily on McIlroy in the four-ball match, the PGA Tour team won the first two holes thanks to birdies from the blade of the Northern Irishman. After both teams made pars on the ensuing hole, McIlroy maneuvered the par-5 4th in effective fashion to set up a match-clinching moment. Rolling in his eagle putt from roughly 40 feet, McIlroy turned the tables on DeChambeau, who was in tight with a chance to extend the match. When the U.S. Open champion's putt veered left, the first match point was had by Scheffler & McIlroy to the tune of 3&2. The foursomes match was a tighter affair as Scheffler missed a birdie bid on the first hole with McIlroy doing the same on the second. The PGA Tour team was unable to take advantage of their scoring opportunities until Scheffler stuffed a wedge in tight on the third hole. McIlroy was never forced to hit his birdie putt, however, as Koepka & DeChambeau played putt-putt on the green and gifted the lead to their opponents. Staying in the holiday spirit, the two sides continued to present gifts to one another. After Scheffler missed a 5-foot birdie putt on the fourth hole, failing to secure at least another half point as Koepka rolled in a birdie on No. 5 to win his side's first hole of the evening and tie the second match. Unfortunately for Koepka & DeChambeau, they needed three putts again on the pivotal sixth hole of the match and gave away the full point in favor of Scheffler & McIlroy. With two of the possible four points already obtained, Scheffler & McIlroy were required to only tie one of the two singles matches. Scheffler squared off against Koepka leaving McIlroy and DeChambeau to duke it out in a mini rematch of this summer's U.S. Open. McIlroy's firepower persisted until the end allowing him to surge past DeChambeau in a commanding manner. Meanwhile, the world No. 1 made easy work of the five-time major champion as Scheffler's steady nature was too much for an up-and-down Koepka to overcome and put the finishing touches on a dominant night for the two players from the PGA Tour. Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy both make par on the first hole of the singles matches, and they are enough to command leads in both matches. They just need to tie one of the two matches to take care of this bad boy. Well, it was not pretty, but the PGA Tour wins another point in the foursomes match. Winning 1 UP thanks to a par on the last hole, the PGA Tour team needs to only tie one of the two singles matches in order to win the competition. Neither team could make a putt in the second match. This match could be over by now, but the putters have not cooperated for the PGA Tour team in the foursomes format. They lead 1 UP with two holes to play after Scheffler missed a snapping right-to-left 5-foot putt to win the hole. They have let the LIV Golf guys off the hook a few times in this portion of the match. The two teams have exchanged pars on the first two holes of the six-hole alternate shot match. The PGA Tour team had chances on both holes to claim the lead as Scheffler missed a birdie chance from 7 feet on the first hole and McIlroy just missed one from roughly 13 feet on the second hole. The ol' Mongolian reversal. Rory McIlroy makes an eagle from 40 feet on No. 4 and put the pressure on Bryson DeChambeau who was inside 5 feet with an eagle look of his own. The U.S. Open champion pulls his eagle putt which means the PGA Tour team grabs the four-ball match 3 and 2. They will now transition to alternate shot. McIlroy and Scheffler remain 2 UP as the two teams tie the par-4 3rd at Shadow Creek. With three holes remaining in the four-ball format, another hole win from the PGA Tour side will give them the first match. The second match — holes Nos. 7-12 — will be alternate shot. It is an opening birdie from the PGA Tour side in the four-ball format. They take a 1 UP lead with five holes remaining in this portion of the match. The early lead is courtesy of Rory McIlroy who split the fairway and hit his second to roughly 5 feet before cashing in the birdie effort. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

LIVE: Follow LIV vs. PGA Tour Showdown updates Instead of going after each other in the media, four of golf's biggest names — two on the PGA Tour and two belonging to LIV Golf — are facing off in an exhibition match on Tuesday. Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy will do battle with Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka, combining 13 major championships and personalities that have clashed in the past. Not only has McIlroy been heavily critical of those who joined LIV Golf, but DeChambeau and Koepka themselves butted heads in the past before reconciling. Fans will finally get to see PGA Tour golfers face off with LIV Golfers outside of a major, and the action will go down at Las Vegas' Shadow Creek Golf Club. Here's a look at the format for Tuesday's LIV Golf vs. PGA Tour Showdown. MORE: Complete guide to LIV vs. PGA Tour Showdown The Showdown between the LIV Golf and PGA Tour pairs will 18 holes, which are broken down into three different stages. The first six holes will be played as four-balls. In this style of play, each golfer uses their own ball to play the hole. However, only the teammate with the lower score counts. Whichever team has the lower score wins the round. Holes No. 7-12 will be played in a foursomes format. Each team plays only one ball, with teammates alternating shots. The group will also switch who tees off the hole, with one player assigned the odd numbers and the other with the evens. The team with the lower score wins the hole. The final six holes will feature two one-on-one matches between a player from each team. The matchups are not yet known. The team that wins more of the three stages will win the event and earn a payment in the form of CRO Cryptocurrency. MORE: How much prize money will LIV vs. PGA Tour Showdown winners make? The four players will play a standard 18 holes on Tuesday, but the holes will be broken into stages. Golfers will play a four-ball format for the first six holes, foursomes on holes No. 7-12 and singles matches on holes No. 13-18. That means the scoring won't break down the same way it would for 18 traditional holes, with emphasis instead being placed on winning each individual stage of play. Four-ball play, which will be how the first six holes are played, simply allows a team of two to take the lowest score from each round. For example, Scheffler and McIlroy will each play their own ball on the first hole, but only the better score between the two will count. That means a major mistake by one of the two golfers wouldn't cost the team, assuming the other player doesn't similarly post a disappointing score. Four-ball always involves four players, as the name indicates. The players will use the foursomes scoring format for holes No. 7-12. Rather than use two balls as they will during the four-ball portion, each team only uses one ball. The players on each team alternate shots. If Scheffler takes the tee shot, for example, McIlroy will take the next shot, followed by Scheffler again. The two alternate shots until the ball is in the hole. Team members typically alternate tee shots, with one taking the tee shots on even-numbered holes and the other taking the odd-numbered holes.

                "content": "The much ballyhooed match between PGA Tour vs. LIV Golf took place tonight as Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy locked horns with Bryson DeChambeau and Brook Koepka in \"The Showdown\" on TNT. While LIV Golf may be the new, fun brand, it was the PGA Tour that walked away with the victory, and in dominant fashion. The match itself offered an opportunity to get into the minds of the golfers, with each of them mic'd up throughout the night. Unfortunately, the matchup itself wound up finishing sooner than we'd expected, as Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy dominated from the get-go, taking home the $10 million cryptocurrency prize purse. Here's everything that happened at Shadow Creek Golf Course in North Las Vegas. THE SHOWDOWN PURSE:Golfers will be paid in crypto. In sports, they won't be the first From early on, it was evident that Scheffler and McIlroy were playing a level above Koepka and DeChambeau. Perhaps DeChambeau's parka was a giveaway that LIV was not ready to play in the cold Vegas air. McIlroy's heroics with the putter combined with Scheffler's consistency and DeChambeau's struggles allowed the PGA Tour to secure the win in just 16 holes. If you though it couldn't get worse for DeChambeau and Koepka, you'd be mistaken. The 16th hole saw LIV spend more time in the trees than the fairway. Still, despite the time in the woods, LIV had an opportunity to stay alive if Koepka could've sunk a 10-foot putt. Unfortunately, Koepka left the putt to the right, allowing Scheffler to take a two hole lead with only two holes to play. Given that LIV Golf needed both Koepka and DeChambeau to win their singles matches to have a chance, Koepka's missed putt gave the win to the PGA Tour. It was a fitting end to a forgettable day for LIV Golf. With three holes to play, both PGA Tour golfers are one up. DeChambeau actually won Hole 15 after McIlroy left his shot short of the creek on 15, forcing a very tough shot onto the green, while DeChambeau was already near the pin. However, it may not be enough for DeChambeau to overcome his deficit. Hole 14 saw LIV Golf win one of their matchups as Koepka defeated Scheffler, but DeChambeau continued to struggle, missing a putt that would've tied the hole with McIlroy. Following the missed putt, DeChambeau was noticeably upset. He put his head in his hands and covered his face for a few seconds before walking over and picking up his ball. While Scheffler and Koepka are tied through two holes of the final segment, DeChambeau is down two with only four holes to play. LIV Golf needs both DeChambeau and Koepka to win their matchups for any shot at the $10 million grand prize. LIV Golf needs to win each of their singles matchups – Scheffler vs. Koepka, McIlroy vs. DeChambeau – for any shot to win The Showdown, but the third and final segment got off to a rocky start. Hole 13 is a tough Par 3, but both McIlroy and Scheffler were able to earn pars. DeChambeau and Koepka each lipped out their par putts. It was close, but as has been the case all night, LIV Golf is constantly coming up just short. They are at a huge disadvantage with only five holes to play. Although it was much closer than the first segment, the PGA Tour duo of Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy walked away from Hole 12 with a 2 segment to none lead over LIV Golf. DeChambeau and Koepka gave the PGA Tour a run for their money, winning Hole 11 to knot the score up, but after a missed putt opened the door, McIlroy's ever-faithful putter sealed the victory for his team. The PGA Tour only needs to halve the final segment – singles play – to secure the grand prize. LIV Golf finally got on the board with a win on Hole 11. PGA Tour's Rory McIlroy had an opportunity to earn a birdie with a mid-range putt, but missed. McIlroy was flabbergasted, and visibly upset with himself. That opened the door for Koepka to win the hole. He did just that. We head into Hole 12, the final hole of the second segment, with the teams knotted up. Each team needs 2.5 segments to win the event, meaning if DeChambeau and Koepka cannot win this last hole, their only hope for a win would be each of them winning their singles matches and forcing a playoff. It hasn't been a great showing for LIV Golf tonight, and Hole 10 was no different, but it could've been much worse. DeChambeau had an opportunity to birdie the hole and knot the second segment back up, but he lipped out. Over the broadcast, you could hear DeChambeau audibly say \"Are you kidding me?\" after the miss. Luckily, Scheffler lipped his birdie putt out as well, giving Koepka an opportunity to tie the hole, which he drained. Through four holes in the second segment, Scheffler and McIlroy are up one. After a terrific second shot by Scheffler, McIlroy was set up for an easy birdie to take the lead in the second segment. McIlroy's putter has been money all night, so it was nearly a guarantee as soon as Scheffler hit the green. Through three holes in the second segment, PGA Tour is up one. LIV Golf needs to win this segment for any hope at the prize money. Once again, McIlroy and Scheffler had an opportunity to take a lead in the second segment, but McIlroy's impressive putter failed them as he rolled the ball right of the hole on what would've been the hole-clinching putt. Through two in the second segment, it's still tied. LIV Golf was all over the yard on the first hole of the second segment, going from the rough off the tee to behind a bunker, but the pair did eventually earn a par to put the pressure on McIlroy and Scheffler. The PGA Tour had an opportunity to clinch it with a six-foot birdie putt for Scheffler, but Scheffler missed. Through one hole in the second segment, it's all knotted up. LIV Golf must win this segment to have any hope of winning the prize. After a terrific second shot by Bryson DeChambeau put him mere feet away from the pin, McIlroy rose to the occasion, opting for the ol' Texas wedge from way off the green. McIlroy drilled it, earning him an eagle, and putting the pressure on DeChambeau to nail his putt. DeChambeau lipped it left, and the PGA Tour (or solely McIlroy) won the first six-hole segment of the event in just four holes with a 3-hole lead with only two to play. The golfers will skip holes 5 and 6, jumping straight to 7 for the second segment, where each team will alternate shots. LIV Golf's comeback attempt hit another hurdle on the fourth hole as Koepka teed off into the water on the left side. Hole No. 4 is a Par 5, giving Koepka an opportunity for an up-and-down with two fantastic shots, but the odds of him making a difference here are slim. It appears up to DeChambeau to keep LIV Golf in the running for the first segment of this event. After the PGA Tour pair won each of the first two holes, Hole 3 went to neither group, making the odds of a LIV Golf comeback all the more improbable with only three holes to play. LIV Golf had an opportunity to win the hole with a birdie putt from DeChambeau, but it was left just right, enabling McIlroy and Scheffler to putt for par and earn a push. During the third hole, as the golfers walked to their shots, the TV crew and Koepka were poking fun at DeChambeau's big coat, saying that it looked big enough to fit both DeChambeau and Koepka. Afterwards, the crew mentioned that while DeChambeau and Koepka are \"good now,\" perhaps hopping in the same coat would be too much. For casual golf fans, that statement may have been confusing. But for folks who have followed golf over the last few years, the pair's feud was sure to be brought up at some point during the night. Here's a quick explainer: Emotions between DeChambeau and Koepka started running high after Koepka criticized DeChambeau's play at the 2019 Dubai Desert Classic. The pair continued taking subtle jabs at one another throughout the 2020 season, with the most viral moment coming after Koepka appeared visibly annoyed with DeChambeau after the latter walked through the former's interview and said something that the cameras couldn't pick up, but Koepka clearly heard. Their feud came to a head in 2021 after DeChambeau was showered with \"Brooksie\" chants throughout the PGA Tour season. It got so bad that the PGA Tour itself had to get involved, threatening to eject fans who taunted DeChambeau. Their differences have reportedly been squashed since, and the pair's decision to each sign with LIV Golf certainly helped them look past their grievances. With only six holes in the match play segment of this event, Rory McIlroy is putting the PGA Tour on his back, giving them an almost insurmountable two-hole lead after two holes. He's now birdied twice in a row and reminded everyone why you should never doubt Rory in match play. After both LIV and Scheffler parred the first hole, the pressure was on McIlroy to win the hole for the PGA Tour. McIlroy is not known for his clutch gene, but he came up big on this occasion, drilling the putt for the early lead. As a reminder, only the first six holes will be match play. The following six will be alternating shots, while the final six will be singles. After Scheffler was the only golfer to miss the fairway off the tee, the PGA Tour golfers bounced back on their second shots, each of them hitting the green. The same can't be said for the LIV duo. Koepka's shot bounced over the back of the green, just off the edge in the rough, while DeChambeau's shot fell short. After a coin toss on the first tee, it was revealed that the PGA Tour team of Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy would have honors to start the event. Scheffler took the first shot ahead of McIlroy, and smoked an iron onto the right side rough, just off the fairway. Shadow Creek Golf Course is a notoriously narrow course, so we should expect to see a lot more play out of the thick stuff as the event unfolds. That said, Scheffler was the only player not to hit the fairway off the first tee. The Showdown golf event will be broadcast on TNT, and coverage will start at 6 p.m. The actual time to tee off has not yet been announced. Bryson DeChambeau, the 2024 U.S. Open champion, will team up with former rival Brooks Koepka, a five-time major winner, to represent LIV Golf. On the other side, 2024 Masters champion Scottie Scheffler will compete with four-time major champion Rory McIlroy, representing the PGA Tour. Scheffler, who won the 2022 and 2024 Masters tournament, is the world's No. 1 ranked golfer and just won PGA Tour Player of the Year in a landslide vote. McIlroy, currently ranked No. 3, won the PGA Champonship in 2012 and 2014, the U.S. Open in 2011 and the British Open in 2014. DeChambeau won the U.S. Open earlier this year after winning it for the first time in 2020. Koepka has won the PGA Championship three times (2018, 2019 and 2023) and the U.S. Open twice (2017 and 2018). But it could be a large hill to climb for DeChambeau and Koepka to stand a chance. The pair currently rank 10th and 86th, respectively. This will indeed be a lively event as the network is bringing on familiar faces from \"Inside the NBA.\" Ernie Johnson will be alongside Charles Barkley to call the action. As for commentary from the course, two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson will be alongside Lauren Jbara. The broadcast also gets a boost with experts Trevor Immelman and David Feherty. Odds via Draftkings. Golfweek: Scheffer/McIlroy: -155 Riley Hamel writes, \"This pick is pretty simple: one team has Scottie Scheffler, the other doesn't. He's on a different level than any other golfer on the planet at the moment, and he's a gamer. He wants to win no matter what he's competing in. I have a hard time seeing Scheffler and McIlroy losing this match, but it is Vegas — anything can happen.\" Bleacher Report: Scheffler and McIlroy win Kristopher Knox writes, \"McIlroy hasn't been as consistent this year, but he's still ranked third in the World Golf Rankings. DeChambeau and Koekpa are both elite golfers with Majors wins on their resumes. However, it's hard to envision anyone unseating Scheffler, even in a team event.\" Sports Illustrated: McIlroy/Scheffler Iain MacMillan writes, \"I'm going to lean with the favorites in the Showdown almost solely due to their recent form. Both Rory McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler are fresh off wins ahead of Tuesday’s event. McIlroy won the DP World Tour Championship last month and Scottie Scheffler captured his ninth victory of 2024, winning the Hero World Challenge. Not only is the No. 1-ranked golfer in the world coming off his win, but his new claw grip led to his best putting performance of the year. If his putting becomes a strength of his, he's going to be near invincible.\" According to TNT, the tee time should commence at 6 p.m. ET. However, it's safe to assume that there will be some fodder at the start of coverage, with actual golf taking place moments after the broadcast begins. Although most renditions of The Match are 12 holes long, this battle between the PGA Tour and LIV will be a full 18. Those 18 holes will be divided into three sections of six, with the first six being best ball, holes 7-12 being alternate shot, and singles closing out the final six holes. A whopping $10 million in prize money will be up for grabs, according a report last month by Front Office Sports. And, in a bit of a twist, it will be distributed to the participating golfers in the form of cryptocurrency. Title sponsor Crypto.com said in a news release that the event will be \"the first ever major golf tournament with a multimillion dollar purse to be paid in CRO cryptocurrency.\" (CRO stands for Cronos, which is the primary cryptocurrency of Crypto.com, a Singapore-based crypto exchange.) — Tom Schad SHOWDOWN PURSE:Golfers will be paid in crypto. In sports, they won't be the first The Showdown tees off from picturesque Shadow Creek Golf Course in North Las Vegas, Nevada. It is distinguished as the state's premier public access course by Golfweek. The Showdown will put the spotlight on one of architect Tom Fazio’s best courses, Shadow Creek in North Las Vegas, Nevada. Fazio has been one of the most prolific and successful golf course architects of the past 65 years, having either created or renovated 47 of the top 200 Golfweek’s Best modern courses in the United States.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The PGA Tour and LIV Golf are finally coming together -- at least for one night in Las Vegas. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler and No. 3 Rory McIlroy will join forces against No. 10 Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka for an 18-hole match dubbed The Showdown set to take place Tuesday night at Shadow Creek Golf Club in Sin City. The first iteration in the newest exhibition golf series, The Showdown will feature not only four of the biggest names in the sport but also some of the most exciting playing formats. Drawing clear inspiration from the Ryder Cup, this de facto PGA Tour vs. LIV Golf bout will feature four-ball, foursomes and singles matches across the 18 holes of competition. Scheffler rolls into Las Vegas as the headliner having won nine tournaments in 2024, but he also has the least experience in these exhibition matches as he makes his debut. His teammate, McIlroy, was the winner of The Match 9 over Max Homa, Lexi Thompson and Rose Zhang played at The Park Golf Course earlier this year. Meanwhile, DeChambeau and Koepka are no strangers to this playing style as the two played against one another down the road at The Wynn Golf Club. Koepka came away victorious in their battle, but they will now look to align their efforts against a duo which raised a combined 13 trophies in 2024. That total could have been 14 for the PGA Tour side had DeChambeau not claimed his second major championship title at the U.S. Open over McIlroy. It is a conversation point which will surely be brought up with his counterpart as bragging rights and a whole lot of cryptocurrency (yes, you read that correctly) will be on the line in the Sin City. Follow live updates and highlights from The Showdown golf match Tuesday night on CBS Sports. Date: Tuesday, Dec. 17 | Time 6 p.m. ET Location: Shadow Creek Golf Club — Las VegasTV: TNT, TBS, truTV, HLN | Live stream: Bleacher Report app The Showdown will feature three different playing formats across 18 holes of competition. The first third of the match, holes Nos. 1-6, will consist of the four-ball format where each competitor will play his own golf ball with the lowest score from each team being counted. The next third, holes Nos. 7-12, will see competitors team up in foursomes which is commonly known as alternate shot. Following the two team-style formats, players will compete in a singles match across holes Nos. 13-18. One player from each team will be matched up against one from the other as the match comes to an end. All players have experience in each playing format as the three played in The Showdown are the same three played in the Ryder Cup. Scottie Scheffler & Rory McIlroy: Scheffler is the clear No. 1 player in the world, let alone in this match. Deploying a saw-style putting grip at the Hero World Challenge, Scheffler surged past a field filled with some of the world's best and should pick up where he left off in Las Vegas. The steady nature of his game should pair nicely with McIlroy's firepower across the two team-style formats. Bryson DeChambeau & Brooks Koepka: There are more unknowns when it comes to the LIV Golf team, but DeChambeau and Koepka have proven throughout their career they can win no matter the preparation. While it is an exhibition match, both will play with a chip on their shoulders as they normally do. DeChambeau the longest player in the field and the best putter which could put this side over the edge. If you need to scratch an itch on a random Tuesday night, I could see the plus-money side drawing appeal, but the wiser decision is to lay the juice. There's no reason to overthink it: Go with the top two players in the competition. Scheffler is fresh off a victory at the Hero World Challenge, and McIlroy claimed the DP World Tour Championship last month in Dubai. Outside of his hole-in-one challenge, DeChambeau has not teed it up competitively since the LIV Golf Team Championship in Dallas while Koepka's last start came at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in October.
