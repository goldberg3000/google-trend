                "content": "The Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team is the college football team representing the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, north of the city of South Bend, Indiana. The team plays its home games at the campus's Notre Dame Stadium, which has a capacity of 77,622. Notre Dame is one of three schools that competes as an Independent at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) level; however, they play five games a year against opponents from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), of which Notre Dame is a member in all other sports except ice hockey.[5] The Fighting Irish are among the most prestigious college football teams of all time. Since their inaugural season in 1887, Notre Dame has claimed 11 national championships, including 8 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll.[6] Seven Notre Dame players have won the Heisman Trophy. Notre Dame has 948 official victories, with an additional 21 having been vacated by the NCAA in 2016 for self-reported academic misconduct.[7] Notre Dame has had 22 undefeated seasons including 12 perfect seasons.[8] Notre Dame home games have been televised by NBC since 1991.[9][10] Football did not have an auspicious beginning at the University of Notre Dame. In their inaugural game on November 23, 1887, the Irish lost to Michigan by a score of 8–0.[11] Their first win came in the final game of the 1888 season when the Irish defeated Harvard Prep School of Chicago by a score of 20–0.[12] At the end of the 1888 season, they had a record of 1–3 with all three losses being at the hands of Michigan. Between 1887 and 1899, Notre Dame compiled a record of 31 wins, 15 losses, and 4 ties against a diverse variety of opponents ranging from local high school teams to other universities.[13] In 1894, James L. Morrison was hired as Notre Dame's first head football coach.[14] Notre Dame took a significant step toward respectability, prominence, and stability when they hired Morrison.[15] He wrote an acquaintance after his first day on the job: \"I arrived here [Notre Dame] this morning and found about as green a set of football players that ever donned a uniform... They want to smoke, and when I told them that they would have to run and get up some wind, they thought I was rubbing it in on them. \"One big, strong cuss remarked that it was too much like work. Well, maybe you think I didn't give him hell! I bet you a hundred no one ever makes a remark like that again.\"[15] In 1908, the win over Franklin saw end Fay Wood catch the first touchdown pass in Notre Dame history.[16] Notre Dame continued its success near the turn of the century and achieved their first victory over Michigan in 1909 by the score of 11–3, after which Michigan refused to play Notre Dame again for 33 years. By the end of the 1912 season they had amassed a record of 108 wins, 31 losses, and 13 ties.[17] Jesse Harper became head coach in 1913, coaching for five years until retiring in 1917.[18] During his tenure, the Irish began playing only intercollegiate games and posted a record of 34 wins, five losses, and one tie.[19] This period would also mark the beginning of the rivalry with Army and the continuation of rivalry with Michigan State.[20][21] In an effort to gain respect for a regionally successful but small-time Midwestern football program, Harper scheduled games in his first season with national powerhouses Texas, Penn State, and Army.[22] That year, Notre Dame burst into the national consciousness and helped to transform the collegiate game in a single contest. On November 1, 1913, the Notre Dame squad stunned the Black Knights of the Hudson 35–13 in a game played at West Point.[23] Led by quarterback Gus Dorais and end Knute Rockne, the Notre Dame team attacked the Cadets with an offense that featured both the expected powerful running game but also long and accurate downfield forward passes from Dorais to Rockne. This game has been miscredited as the invention of the forward pass.[24] Prior to this contest, receivers would come to a full stop and wait on the ball to come to them, but in this contest, Dorais threw to Rockne in stride, changing the forward pass from a seldom-used play into the dominant ball-moving strategy that it is today.[24][23] Irish assistant Knute Rockne became head coach in 1918.[25] During his 13 years, the Irish won three national championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925,[26] and produced players such as George Gipp and the \"Four Horsemen\".[27] Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran a 7–2–2 scheme.[28][29] Rockne took over in the war-torn season of 1918[30] He made his coaching debut on September 28, 1918, against Case Tech in Cleveland, Ohio, and earned a 26–6 victory.[31] Leonard Bahan, George Gipp, and Curly Lambeau were in the backfield.[32][33] With Gipp, Rockne had an ideal handler of the forward pass.[34][35] The Irish posted a 3–1–2 record for the season, losing only to the Michigan Agricultural Aggies. The 1919 team had Rockne handle the line and Gus Dorais handle the backfield.[36] The Irish went undefeated and were one of four teams to be selected for the national championship, although Notre Dame does not claim it.[37][38] Gipp died at age 25 on December 14, 1920,[39] just two weeks after Walter Camp elected him as Notre Dame's first All-American.[40][39] Gipp likely contracted strep throat and pneumonia while giving punting lessons after his final game on November 20 against Northwestern.[40] Since antibiotics were not available in the 1920s, treatment options for such infections were limited and they could be fatal even to young, healthy individuals.[41] Rockne was speaking to Gipp on his hospital bed when he was purported to have delivered the famous \"Win one for the Gipper\" line.[42][39][43][44][45] John Mohardt led the 1921 Notre Dame team to a 10–1 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns.[46] Grantland Rice wrote that \"Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space\" and noted that the 1921 Notre Dame team \"was the first team we know of to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game.\"[47] Mohardt had both Eddie Anderson and Roger Kiley at end to receive his passes.[48][49] The national champion 1924 team included the \"Four Horsemen\" backfield of Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Jim Crowley, and Elmer Layden.[50][51] The line was known as the \"Seven Mules\".[52] The Irish capped an undefeated, 10–0 season with a victory over Stanford in the Rose Bowl.[26] The 1926 team beat Army and was led by Christie Flanagan,[53][54] but was undone by a loss to Carnegie Tech in the penultimate game of the season. In this game, Rockne made what an Associated Press writer called \"one of the greatest coaching blunders in history\" by traveling to Chicago for the Army–Navy Game to \"write newspaper articles about it, as well as select an All-America football team.\" Carnegie Tech used the coach's absence as motivation for a 19–0 win; the upset likely cost the Irish a chance for a national title.[55] The 1928 team lost to national champion Georgia Tech.[56] \"I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man–Peter Pund,\" said Rockne. \"Nobody could stop him. I counted 20 scoring plays that this man ruined.\"[57] Among the events that occurred during Rockne's tenure none may be more famous than the Rockne's \"Win one for the Gipper\" speech.[58] Army came into the 1928 matchup undefeated and was the clear favorite.[59] Notre Dame, on the other hand, was having their worst season under Rockne's leadership and entered the game with a 4–2 record.[59] At the end of the half Army was leading and looked to be in command of the game. Rockne entered the locker room and gave his account of Gipp's final words: \"I've got to go, Rock. It's all right. I'm not afraid. Some time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are going wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go in there with all they've got and win just one for the Gipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Rock. But I'll know about it, and I'll be happy.\"[60] The speech inspired the team and they went on to upset Army and win the game 12–6.[61] The 1929 and 1930 teams both went undefeated,[62][63] winning national championships,[64][65] and the 1930 team was led by the likes of Frank Carideo, Joe Savoldi, Marchy Schwartz and Marty Brill.[65] It featured the first and only example of all four members of a backfield being named to an All-American team during the same season. The 1929 team played all of its games on the road while the new Notre Dame Stadium was being built.[66] In 1930, \"Jumping Joe\" Savoldi scored the first Notre Dame touchdown in the new stadium on a 98-yard kickoff return.[67] Savoldi is also known as \"the first hero in the lore of Notre Dame's Stadium\" based on scoring three touchdowns in the official stadium dedication game against Navy the following week.[68] Rockne coached his last game on December 14, 1930, when he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New York City.[69][70] The game raised funds for the Mayor's Relief Committee for the unemployed and needy of the city.[71] 50,000 fans turned out to see the reunited \"Four Horsemen\" along with players from Rockne's other championship teams take the field against the pros.[72] On March 31, 1931, Rockne died at age 43 in the crash of a Transcontinental & Western Air airliner in Kansas; he was on his way to help in the production of the film The Spirit of Notre Dame.[73][74][75] The crash site is located in a remote expanse of Kansas known as the Flint Hills and now features a Rockne Memorial.[76] As Notre Dame's head coach from 1918 to 1930, Rockne posted what has remained for decades the all-time highest winning percentage (.881) for a football coach in the NCAA's flagship FBS division.[77][78] During his 13-year tenure as head coach of the Fighting Irish, Rockne collected 105 victories, 12 losses, 5 ties and 3 national championships.[79][80] Rockne also coached Notre Dame to 5 undefeated and untied seasons.[79][80] Through game broadcasts during the Golden Age of Radio, Notre Dame football gained a nationwide following of \"subway alumni\", Catholics who became fans whether or not they attended the university.[81] Former Saint Louis head coach Heartley \"Hunk\" Anderson was promoted from assistant coach and took the helm of the Irish after Knute Rockne's death, leading them to a record of 16 wins, nine losses, and two ties.[82] Anderson was a former Irish player under Rockne and was serving as an assistant coach at the time of Rockne's death. Notre Dame finished 6–2–1 in 1931.[83] The Irish lost a heartbreaker by a score of 16–14 to USC on November 21 that snapped the program's 26-game unbeaten streak.[84] 1933 was a tough year for the Irish as they finished with a 3–5–2 record, the first losing season for the program since 1888. ND suffered a four-game losing streak, failing to score a point in all four losses to Carnegie Tech, Pittsburgh, Navy, and Purdue.[85] Anderson resigned as Irish head coach after the 1933 season to accept the position of head football coach at NC State.[86] Anderson was replaced by Elmer Layden, who was one of Rockne's \"Four Horsemen\" in the 1920s. After graduating, Layden played professional football for one year and then began a coaching career.[87] Layden's 1935 squad posted one of the greatest wins in school history by rallying to defeat Ohio State by a score of 18–13 in a game billed as the \"Game of the Century\".[88][89] His 1938 team finished 8–1, losing only to USC in the season finale.[90] This loss cost them a possible consensus national championship, but the team was named national champion by the Dickinson System.[91] Like Rockne before him, Layden was a goodwill ambassador for Notre Dame during his time as head coach.[92][93] He was able to schedule a home-and-home series with Michigan after meeting with Fielding H. Yost, healing a rift between the two schools.[94] The two teams had not met since 1909, when, after eight straight losses to the Wolverines, the Irish posted their first win.[95][96] They were scheduled to meet again in 1910, but Michigan canceled the game and refused to play the Irish again.[96] By the time they met again in 1943, Layden had left Notre Dame and Frank Leahy had taken his place.[96] The Irish posted a record of 47 wins, 13 losses, and three ties in seven years under Layden,[97] the most successful record of a Notre Dame coach not to win a national championship.[98] He left Notre Dame after the 1940 season to become Commissioner of the National Football League.[98][87] Boston College head coach Frank Leahy was hired by Notre Dame to take over for Layden in 1941 and was another former Irish player who played during the Rockne era. After graduating from Notre Dame, Leahy held several coaching positions, including line coach of the Seven Blocks of Granite of Fordham University that helped that team win all but two of their games between 1935 and 1937.[99] He then coached the Boston College Eagles to a win in the 1941 Sugar Bowl and a share of the national championship.[100][101] His move to Notre Dame began a new period of gridiron success for the Irish and ensured Leahy's place among the winningest coaches in the history of college football.[102] Leahy coached the team for 11 seasons from 1941 to 1943 and 1946 to 1953.[99] After finishing in the AP top 10 each of his first two seasons, Leahy's 1943 team went 9–1 and captured Notre Dame's fourth national championship (and first since the advent of the AP Poll). Quarterback Angelo Bertelli became Notre Dame's first Heisman Trophy winner. From 1944 to 1945, Leahy served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was honorably discharged as a captain.[103] Edward McKeever, Leahy's assistant coach, became interim head coach when Leahy left for the Navy.[104] During 1944, his one year at the helm, the Irish managed 8 wins and 2 losses.[105] McKeever left Notre Dame in 1945 to take over as head coach of Cornell.[106] For the 1945 season, he was replaced by Hugh Devore, who led the Irish to a 7–2–1 record.[107] Upon Leahy's return in 1946 and due to his status as a veteran himself, the Irish heavily recruited returning veterans who were often much older than incoming freshmen. Largely thanks to this influx of talent, Notre Dame went four consecutive seasons after World War II without losing a game, winning the 1946, 1947, and 1949 national championships in the process.[108] The 1946 game against Army, ending in a 0–0 tie, pitted two of the greatest teams of all time against each other and included three consecutive Heisman Trophy winners (Army's Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis and Notre Dame's Johnny Lujack, who quarterbacked the 1946 and 1947 Irish). The 1948 team missed out on a national championship due only to a 14–14 tie at USC in the final game of the season. In 1949, Notre Dame went unbeaten and untied for the second time in three seasons behind Heisman Trophy-winning end Leon Hart, who would later be selected first overall in the 1950 NFL Draft. A fifth national championship was lost because of a 1953 tie against Iowa, in a game that featured 1953 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lattner[109] that caused a minor scandal at the time, when it appeared that some Irish players had faked injuries to stop the clock, leading some to nickname those players the \"Fainting Irish\".[110][111][112] Leahy retired in 1954 reportedly due to health issues.[113] Perhaps the best example of this occurred during the Georgia Tech game in 1953. Leahy fell ill during the game, which led to him collapsing during halftime.[114][self-published source] The situation was so dire that a priest was called in to give Leahy Catholic last rites.[115] However, Leahy recovered, and the consequent diagnosis was that he was suffering from nervous tension and pancreatitis.[116] Leahy has the second highest winning percentage (.864) of any college coach in history. He led the Irish to a record of 87 wins, 11 losses, and nine ties including 39 consecutive games without a loss (37–0–2), four national championships, and six undefeated seasons.[102][117] The departure of Frank Leahy ushered in a downward slope in Notre Dame's performance.[118] 25-year old assistant coach Terry Brennan was hired as Frank Leahy's successor as the Notre Dame head coach in 1954 and would stay until 1958. Brennan was a former player under Leahy. Before joining the Irish, he had coached the Mount Carmel High School team in Chicago.[119] His first two seasons the Irish were ranked fourth and ninth respectively in the AP poll, with a loss to Purdue the only blemish on the 1954 team's schedule.[119][120] It was the 1956 season that began to darken Brennan's reputation, for it became one of the most dismal in the team's history and saw them finish the season with a mere two wins, including losses to Michigan State, Oklahoma, and Iowa.[121] One bright spot in the 1956 season was the awarding of the Heisman Trophy to Paul Hornung, who would go on to a legendary NFL career with the Green Bay Packers. Hornung is the only Heisman winner to win the award while playing for a team that had a losing record.[122] The Irish would recover the following season, posting a record of 7–3[123] and including in their wins a stunning upset of Oklahoma, in Norman, Oklahoma, that ended the Sooners' still-standing record of 47 consecutive wins.[124] In Brennan's final season, though, the Irish finished 6–4,[125] leading to Brennan's firing in mid-December.[126] Brennan's tenure can only be properly framed with the understanding that in a time of zero scholarship limitations in college football, Notre Dame's administration inexplicably began a process of de-emphasizing football, severely cutting scholarships and hindering Brennan from building a roster of any meaningful depth.[127] He departed with a total of 32 wins and 18 losses.[128] Former San Francisco, Chicago Cardinals and Washington Redskins head coach Joe Kuharich took the head coaching position at Notre Dame in 1959, realizing a longtime ambition to return to his alma mater.[129][130] He had earlier been courted by Notre Dame after the 1956 season, after the Irish finished 2–8, but before he had a chance to accept an offer, Terry Brennan was given a reprieve.[131] Kuharich brought a professional touch to Irish football, putting shamrocks on the players' helmets and shoulder stripes on their jerseys.[131][132] However, his tenure became one of the worst stretches in program history, including a school-record eight-game losing streak in 1960, a year in which the Irish finished 2–8.[133] The consensus opinion was that Kuharich never made the adjustment from pro football to college football, attempting to use complicated pro coaching techniques with collegiate players, and never adapted to the limited substitution rules in effect at the time, having big, immobile linemen playing both ways in an era where smaller, quicker players were preferred. He often said, \"You win some and you lose some\", and seemed perfectly content finishing 5–5 every year. This did not sit well with the Irish faithful, who expected Notre Dame to beat everybody.[134] When the pressure of winning became too much to bear, Kuharich resigned in the spring of 1963 and assumed the post of supervisor of NFL officials.[131] Because it was so late in the spring, the freshman team's coach Hugh Devore was named head coach for the 1963 season while the search for a permanent replacement was being conducted.[135] Kuharich compiled a 17–23 record over four non-winning seasons and remains to this day the only coach ever to have an overall losing record at Notre Dame. Despite his unsuccessful tenure, Kuharich remains the only Irish coach to post back-to-back shutouts over their greatest rival, the USC Trojans, in 1960 (17–0) and 1961 (30–0).[136] In 1964, Ara Parseghian left his job as the Northwestern head football coach when he was hired to take over the coaching duties at Notre Dame.[137] He immediately brought the team back to a level of success in Irish football history that was comparable only to Rockne and Leahy. These three coaches have an 80% or greater winning percentage while at Notre Dame – Rockne at .881, Leahy at .864, and Parseghian at .836. Parseghian's teams never won fewer than seven nor lost more than three games during the ten-game regular seasons of the era.[138] In his first year, the Irish improved their record to 9–1 behind Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback John Huarte, but they lost any hope for a national championship in the last game of the season at USC when Craig Fertig connected with a touchdown pass to Rod Sherman.[139] Parseghian earned coach of the year honors from the American Football Coaches Association, the Football Writers Association, and The Sporting News, as well as several others, and a cover story in Time magazine.[140][141] The 1966 team did finish unbeaten, finishing #1 in the AP Poll and winning the national championship in the process. The Irish had six shutout wins, each by 30 or more points. This includes a season-ending 51-0 win at #10 USC, the largest margin of victory by either side in the rivalry's history. This season is most remembered for a 10–10 tie at #2 Michigan State in the \"Game of the Century\" in which the injury-plagued Irish played for a tie rather than risking a loss.[142] It was under Parseghian as well that Notre Dame lifted its 40-plus year-old \"no bowl games\" policy,[143] beginning with the season of 1969, after which the Irish played the #1 Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl Classic, losing in the final minutes in a closely contested game.[144] The following year, Parseghian's 9–1 squad[145] ended Texas' Southwest Conference record 30-game winning streak in the Cotton Bowl.[144] In 1971, Cliff Brown became the first African-American quarterback to start a game for the program.[146] The Irish returned to glory by winning Parseghian's second national championship in 1973, sweeping through their regular-season schedule 10–0 and defeating #1 Alabama 24-23 in the Sugar Bowl by taking advantage of a fourth-quarter missed extra point by the Crimson Tide. Due to health issues, Parseghian was forced to retire from coaching after another bowl win over Alabama to conclude the 1974 season.[147] During Parseghian's eleven-year career, the Irish amassed a record of 95–17–4 and captured two national championships. The Irish finished in the AP Top 10 nine times and never ranked lower than #14 at the end of a season. Parseghian was also named coach of the year by several selectors in his national championship years of 1966 and 1973 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980.[148][149] Dan Devine was hired to take over as head coach upon Parseghian's retirement from Notre Dame in 1975.[150] Devine was already a highly successful coach and had led Arizona State, Missouri, and the NFL's Green Bay Packers.[150] Devine had been a leading candidate for the head coaching job at Notre Dame in 1964, when Ara Parseghian was hired.[151] When approached for the job following Parseghian's resignation, Devine accepted immediately, joking that it was probably the shortest job interview in history.[152] When he arrived at Notre Dame he already had a college coaching record of 120 wins, 40 losses, and eight ties and had led his teams to victory in four bowl games.[153] At Notre Dame he would lead the Irish to 53 wins, 16 losses, and a tie as well as three bowl victories.[153] His lasting achievement came midway through this run, when the 1977 Notre Dame team won the national championship, led by junior quarterback Joe Montana.[154] Before the game against USC, played at home on October 22, Devine changed the team's jerseys from navy blue & white to kelly green & gold, later known as the \"green jersey game\", resulting in a 49–19 victory over the Trojans.[155] The Irish continued to wear green for the rest of Devine's tenure at the school.[155] The championship season climaxed with a 38–10 win in the 1978 Cotton Bowl Classic over previously top-ranked Texas, led by Heisman Trophy winner Earl Campbell.[156] The win vaulted the Irish from fifth to first in the polls. The following season, the Irish lost their first two games including a shocking 3–0 loss to Missouri in South Bend, but would recover to finish the regular season 8–3 and earn a berth in the Cotton Bowl against Houston. The Irish used three Montana touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) to recover from a 22-point deficit in the fourth quarter and win 35–34, the largest fourth-quarter comeback in college football history at the time. The game became known as the \"Chicken Soup Game\" after Montana ate a bowl of chicken soup at halftime while battling the flu.[157] The 1979 and 1980 Irish did not live up to the standards set by earlier Devine teams, although the former season did see Vagas Ferguson set the single-season program rushing record (1,437 yards) that still stands today. Because he had the unenviable task of following a legend, Devine came under heavy scrutiny while at Notre Dame and it was felt that he was never fully embraced by the Notre Dame community, despite winning a national championship.[158] After a 5–2 start in his first season, rumors of incompetence were circulated and that Devine would be dismissed and replaced by Don Shula or even Ara Parseghian (who went so far as to say he would not return to Notre Dame under any circumstances).[159] Even on the day of the 1977 USC game, \"Dump Devine\" bumper stickers were being sold outside Notre Dame Stadium.[159] On August 15, 1980, Devine announced that he would be leaving Notre Dame at the end of season, saying he wanted to be able to spend more time with his wife.[158] Gerry Faust was a surprise choice when hired to replace Devine in 1981.[160] Prior to Notre Dame, Faust had been one of the more successful high school football coaches in the country. As coach of Moeller High School in Cincinnati he amassed a 174–17–2 record over 19 seasons.[161] Many of his players had gone on to play for Notre Dame; indeed, when he arrived in South Bend, he was reunited with nine of his former players from Moeller. Despite his success in the high school ranks, Faust's success at Notre Dame was mixed. In his first season, the Irish finished 5–6.[162] In Faust's second season, Notre Dame improved slightly to 6–4–1.[163] The most successful years under Faust were the 1983 and 1984 campaigns where the Irish finished 7–5 and made trips to the Liberty Bowl and Aloha Bowl respectively.[164][165] His final record at Notre Dame was 30–26–1.[166] To avoid being fired, Faust resigned at the end of the 1985 season.[167][168] He announced his resignation prior to the final game of the year, where Notre Dame suffered a humiliating 58–7 loss at Miami; Allen Pinkett scored the Irish TD. Faust proceeded to take over as head coach at Akron.[169] Lou Holtz had 17 years of head coaching experience by the time he was hired to lead the Irish.[170] He had previously been head coach of William & Mary, North Carolina State, the NFL's New York Jets, Arkansas, and Minnesota.[170] In contrast to Faust, Holtz was well known as a master motivator and a strict disciplinarian.[171][172] The tone was set with Holtz's first meeting with his team as Irish head coach in 1986, immediately demanding his players sit up straight in their chairs and look him in the eye as he spoke.[173] Holtz began in 1986 where his predecessor left off in 1985, finishing with an identical record of 5–6.[174] However, unlike the 1985 squad, which was generally outcoached and outplayed, Holtz's 1986 edition was competitive in nearly every game, losing five out of those six games by a combined total of 14 points. That would be his only losing season as he posted a record of 95–24–2 over the next ten seasons adding up to a 100–30–2 record overall.[175][176] In 1987, Holtz led the Irish to an 8–4 record.[177] Notre Dame's best player was star wide receiver Tim Brown, who would win the Heisman Trophy that season and is Notre Dame's seventh and most recent Heisman winner.[178][179] The 1988 campaign began with high hopes, as former Notre Dame coaches Rockne, Leahy, Parseghian, and Devine all won their first national championship in their third season with the program. The Irish defeated their first five opponents, ascending to the #4 ranking in the lead-up to a visit from the reigning national champion Miami Hurricanes. In a game which became known as Catholics vs. Convicts due to a popular T-shirt design on Notre Dame's campus, the Irish upset the Hurricanes 31–30 when Pat Terrell knocked down Steve Walsh's two-point conversion attempt with no time on the clock. When star players Ricky Watters and Tony Brooks showed up late for dinner right before the then top-ranked Irish played second-ranked USC in the final regular season game of 1988,[180] in a controversial move, Holtz took his 10–0 Irish squad to Los Angeles without them.[181] His move was vindicated when the Irish defeated USC anyway.[182] Holtz was named national coach of the year,[170] and a win over No. 3 West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl captured the Irish's 11th-all time national championship.[183] 1988 remains Notre Dame's most recent undefeated season and national championship.[184][185] In 1989, Holtz led the Irish to a 12–1 record. The Irish began the season in the Kickoff Classic game in East Rutherford, New Jersey, against Virginia.[186] The Irish won by a score of 36–13 and ascended to the #1 spot in the AP Poll.[187] Next, top-ranked Notre Dame defeated #2 Michigan by a score of 24–19.[188] After nine more consecutive victories to begin the season 11–0, the Irish would lose to #7 Miami in the final week of the season, ending Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak.[189] Holtz would lead the Irish to a victory in the Orange Bowl over #1 Colorado to end the season, finishing #2 in the AP poll behind Miami.[190] After beginning the 1990 season with a #1 ranking and a victory over #4 Michigan by a score of 28–24 and two more wins for a 3–0 start, the Irish took their first loss of the season, losing to Stanford by a score of 36–31. The Irish would ascend back to #1 on the strength of a home win over #2 Miami, a game that saw the end of the series between the two until 2010.[191] However, late-season losses to Penn State and Colorado in the Orange Bowl would eliminate the Irish from national championship contention.[192] The 1991 Fighting Irish began the season 8-1, but lost back-to-back games for the first time since 1987 when they again lost to Penn State. The Irish would receive a berth in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, where they defeated Florida by a score of 39–28.[193][194] In 1992, Notre Dame finished 10–1–1. After defeating Northwestern to start the season,[195] the Fighting Irish tied #5 Michigan, their first tie of the Holtz era.[196] This season saw the Irish's largest win in history against Purdue, a 48–0 win at Notre Dame Stadium, and a 28–3 Cotton Bowl against previously unbeaten #4 Texas A&M.[197][198] The Irish enjoyed another successful season in 1993, finishing the season at 11–1. After scoring 27 points in wins over Northwestern and #2 Michigan to start the season, the Irish defeated their next six opponents to enter a matchup with undefeated #1 Florida State 8–0 and ranked just behind the Seminoles at #2. For the first time, ESPN's College GameDay decided to make a visit to campus to host the show live on Saturday morning.[199] In a classic, the Irish defeated the Seminoles 31–24, ascending to the #1 ranking a day later. However, a loss to #17 Boston College on a game-winning field goal as time expired by a score of 41–39 ended the Irish's national championship aspirations.[200] The Irish would face a rematch with #6 Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl to finish the season, a game the Irish won by a score of 24–21.[201][202] Controversially, Notre Dame finished #2 in the AP poll behind a team in Florida State it had beaten. In 1994, Holtz led Notre Dame to a 6–5–1 record, the Irish's worst record since Holtz's first season in 1986.[203] The team lost three of four games midseason to drop out of the rankings for the first time since 1986. The Irish would improve to 9–3 in 1995, but lost to #8 Florida State in the Orange Bowl.[204][205] Lou Holtz's final season at Notre Dame in 1996 resulted in an 8–3 record. The season notably saw Notre Dame's first participation in the Emerald Isle Classic in Ireland, a 54–27 win over Navy, and an overtime loss to USC, snapping the Irish's 13-game non-losing streak against the Trojans.[206][207] Holtz's option offense, which helped catapult Notre Dame to many victories in the late 1980s and early 1990s, also helped rack up impressive recruiting classes. During the 1989 season, Holtz had the following future NFL players on offense: QB Rick Mirer, RB Ricky Watters, RB Anthony Johnson, RB Rodney Culver RB Dorsey Levens, and WR Raghib Ismail. In 1990, he added RB Jeff Burris (who would later move to safety), FB Jerome Bettis and TE Irv Smith. 1991 saw the additions of RB Reggie Brooks and FB Ray Zellars. 1992 saw the addition of WR Derrick Mayes. For 1993, he added FB Marc Edwards. In 1995, he added RB Autry Denson. From the 1987–1995 NFL Drafts, there were a total of 65 Notre Dame players selected.[208] Overall, Holtz took Notre Dame to one undefeated season, nine consecutive New Year's Day bowl games, and top 10 finishes in the AP poll in five seasons,[209] as well as overseeing the majority of the longest winning streak against USC in program history (11 games). Holtz retired from Notre Dame following the 1996 season,[210] but would unretire in 1999 to accept the head coaching position at South Carolina where he would serve until the completion of the 2004 season.[211][212] Bob Davie, who had been Holtz's defensive coordinator from 1994 to 1996, was promoted to head coach when Holtz retired.[213] Davie, who turned down a head coaching offer from Purdue to accept the Irish's head coaching position,[214] was a well-respected defensive mind who had also served as defensive coordinator at Tulane and Texas A&M.[215] Davie had also filled in as head coach for one game during the 1995 season when Lou Holtz was dealing with a health issue.[216] One of his first major decisions was to fire long-time offensive line coach Joe Moore, who then successfully sued the university for age discrimination.[217] On Davie's watch, the team suffered three bowl game losses (1997 Independence Bowl,[218] 1999 Gator Bowl,[219] and 2001 Fiesta Bowl),[220] and it failed to qualify for a bowl game in two others (1999 and 2001). The highlight of Davie's tenure was a 36–20 upset win in 1998 over #5 Michigan, the defending national champions.[221][222] On December 17, 1999, Notre Dame was placed on probation by the NCAA. The association's Committee on Infractions found two series of violations. The New York Times reported \"the main one involved the actions of a booster, Kimberly Dunbar, who lavished gifts on football players with money she later pleaded guilty to embezzling.\" In the second series of events, a football player was accused of trying to sell several complimentary game tickets and of using others as repayment of a loan. The player was also said \"to have been romantically involved with a woman (not Dunbar), a part-time tutor at the university, who wrote a term paper for another player for a small fee and provided players with meals, lodging and gifts.\"[223] The Dunbar violation began while Lou Holtz was head coach: \"According to the NCAA committee report, Dunbar, the woman at the center of the more serious violations, had become romantically involved with several Notre Dame football players from June 1995 to January 1998 and had a child with one, Jarvis Edison.\"[223] Notre Dame was placed on probation for two years and lost one of its 85 football scholarships each year in what the Times termed \"minor\" penalties.[223][224] Davie nearly defeated top-ranked Nebraska in 2000, with the Irish comeback bid falling short in overtime 27–24.[225] The aforementioned 2001 Fiesta Bowl was Notre Dame's first invitation to the Bowl Championship Series. The Irish lost by 32 points to Oregon State,[226] but would finish No. 15 in the AP Poll, Davie's highest ranking as head coach. Despite Davie's rocky tenure, new athletic director Kevin White gave the coach a contract extension following the 2000 season,[227] then saw the team start 0–3 in 2001 – the first such start in school history.[228] Disappointed by the on-field results, coupled with the Joe Moore and Kim Dunbar scandals, the administration decided to dismiss Davie after the 2001 season.[229] His final record at Notre Dame was 35–25.[230] On December 9, 2001, Notre Dame hired George O'Leary, the head coach at Georgia Tech, to replace Davie.[231] However, while researching a story on O'Leary, New Hampshire Union Leader reporter Jim Fennell uncovered misrepresentations in O'Leary's resume that had influenced the administration's decision to hire him.[232] The resulting media scandal embarrassed Notre Dame officials and tainted O'Leary; he resigned five days later, before coaching a single practice, recruiting a single player, or hiring a single assistant coach.[233] O'Leary's tenure is the shortest of any head coach in FBS history.[234] O'Leary would go on to become the head football coach at the University of Central Florida.[235] Once again in need of a new head coach, the school turned to Tyrone Willingham, the head coach at Stanford.[236] Willingham's hiring made him the first African American head coach in Notre Dame football history.[237] Bringing a feeling of change and excitement to campus, Willingham led the 2002 squad to a 10–2 regular season record, including an 8–0 start with wins over #7 Michigan and #11 Florida State, and a #4 ranking. This great early start, however, would be the lone highlight of Willingham's tenure, as Notre Dame finished the year with a loss to Boston College, then lopsided losses to USC and North Carolina State in the Gator Bowl.[238] The program faltered over the next two seasons under Willingham, compiling an 11–12 record.[239] During this time, Notre Dame lost a game by at least 30 points on five occasions. Furthermore, Willingham's 2004 recruiting class was judged by analysts to be the worst at Notre Dame in more than two decades.[240] Citing Notre Dame's third consecutive four-touchdown loss to arch-rival USC[241] compounded by another year of subpar recruiting efforts, the Willingham era ended on November 30, 2004 (after the conclusion of the 2004 season) when the university chose to terminate him and pay out the remainder of Willingham's six-year contract.[242] After Willingham's firing, Notre Dame initially pursued Utah head coach Urban Meyer, who had been an Irish assistant from 1996 to 2000 and had a clause in his Utah contract that stated he could take the Notre Dame head coaching job without paying a buyout.[243][244] After Meyer accepted the Florida head coaching position and turned down the Irish,[245] Charlie Weis left the NFL's New England Patriots, where he won three Super Bowls as offensive coordinator,[246] to become head football coach for the Irish beginning with the 2005 season.[247] A first-time head coach when he was hired by Notre Dame,[248] Weis was officially introduced on December 12, 2004.[249] Weis' hiring as the Irish's 30th head football coach made him the first Notre Dame graduate to hold the football head coaching position on a full-fledged basis since Joe Kuharich.[250] Weis signed a six-year contract worth about $2 million annually excluding incentives.[251][252][253] To kick off his inaugural season, Weis led the Irish to back-to-back road wins over ranked teams, the first time that had been done by a Notre Dame coach since Knute Rockne. On September 25, Weis and the Irish traveled to Seattle to face Washington and former head coach Tyrone Willingham, who was hired by the Huskies to be their head coach two weeks after getting fired at Notre Dame.[254] The Irish won by a score of 36–17.[255] Entering the rivalry game with USC, defending national champions and owners of a 27-game winning streak, the Irish had risen to #9 in the AP Poll. In one of the most famous games in the rivalry's history, USC defeated Notre Dame 34–31. The game is most remembered for Trojan running back and eventual Heisman winner Reggie Bush, who had already scored three touchdowns that day, illegally pushing quarterback Matt Leinart into the end zone on the final play of the game, in a play now known as the \"Bush Push\". The Irish won their remaining five games to earn an appearance in the Fiesta Bowl. There, they were defeated by the Ohio State Buckeyes 34–20[256] to finish the season 9–3 and #9 in the AP poll, their highest final ranking since 1993. Quarterback Brady Quinn broke numerous team passing records that season and became a top Heisman Trophy contender.[257] Wide receiver Jeff Samardzija was the team's leading receiver and also broke Notre Dame's single-season records for receiving yards and touchdowns.[258] During the 2005 season, Notre Dame signed Weis to a big raise and ten-year contract extension that was set to keep the coach in South Bend through the 2015 season.[259][260] Weis and the Irish went into the 2006 season with a No. 2 preseason ranking in the ESPN/Coaches Poll.[261] They finished the regular season with a 10–2 record, losing only to Michigan and USC. Notre Dame accepted a bid to the 2007 Sugar Bowl, losing to LSU 41–14. This marked their ninth consecutive postseason loss, the longest drought in NCAA history.[262] As a result, Notre Dame dropped to #17 in the final rankings.[263][264] In the wake of a graduating class that sent eleven players to the NFL,[265] the 2007 season included various negative milestones: the most losses in a single year (9);[266] two of the ten worst losses in program history (38–0 losses to both Michigan[267] and USC);[268] and the first 6-game losing streak for home games.[269] The Naval Academy recorded their first win over the Irish since 1963, breaking Notre Dame's NCAA-record 43-game win streak.[270] In 2008, the Irish started 4–1, but completed the regular season with a 6–6 record,[271] including a 24–23 home loss to Syracuse, the first time that Notre Dame had fallen to an eight-loss team.[272] Quarterback Jimmy Clausen was the team's star player, completing over 60% of his passes.[273][274] Despite speculation the university might fire Weis, it was announced he would remain head coach.[275] Weis's Notre Dame squad ended the season breaking the Irish's NCAA bowl losing streak by beating Hawaii, 49–21, in the Hawaii Bowl.[276] Weis entered the 2009 season with the expectation from the Notre Dame administration that his team would be in position to compete for a BCS Bowl berth.[277] Notre Dame started the first part of the season 4–2, with close losses to Michigan and USC. Sitting at 6–2, however, Notre Dame lost to Navy for the second time in three years,[278] which became the first loss in a four-game losing streak to finish the season. Quarterback Jimmy Clausen and wide receiver Golden Tate would forgo their senior seasons and enter the NFL Draft.[279] Weis was fired on November 30, 2009.[280] According to Weis' buyout, he was to be paid $6 million then $2.05 million annually until the contract ran out in December 2015 for a total of about $19 million.[281] During that time, Weis made more money annually not to coach the Irish than his successor, Brian Kelly, made to coach the team.[282] On December 10, 2009, Cincinnati head coach Brian Kelly became the 31st head coach of the Fighting Irish after leading the Bearcats to a 12–0 record and BCS bowl-game berth, but he left the team before the bowl game.[283][284] Kelly's hiring surprised very few as he was a northern Irish Catholic who was considered one of college football's rising stars.[285] In his first season, Kelly led the Fighting Irish to an 8–5 record.[286] Tragedy struck early in the season when Declan Sullivan, a junior working for the athletic department, died while filming a practice on a scissor lift in dangerously high winds.[287] Dayne Crist started the season at quarterback but was injured for a second consecutive year, this time in the Tulsa game, which the Irish lost.[288] Kelly turned to freshman quarterback Tommy Rees, who led the Irish to victories in the last three games against #15 Utah, Army in Yankee Stadium, and breaking an eight-year losing streak to USC in the LA Coliseum. Kelly guided the Irish to a 33–17 win over Miami (FL) in the 2010 Sun Bowl to finish 2010 with an 8–5 record.[289] With senior wideout Michael Floyd returning for his senior season and an outstanding recruiting class that included several highly touted defensive linemen,[290] Kelly and the Irish looked to improve on their 8–5 record from the prior year. However, an early season upset to a Skip Holtz-led South Florida team and a last-second loss to Michigan in Ann Arbor, games in which the Irish committed 10 total turnovers, left the Irish at 0–2 to start the season. The Irish bounced back to beat #15 Michigan State and had two 4-game winning streaks, with the only loss during that stretch coming at the hands of USC.[291] The Irish also broke Navy's 2-game winning streak over Notre Dame. Notre Dame lost 18–14 to Florida State in the 2011 Champs Sports Bowl, concluding the 2011 campaign with an 8–5 record overall, identical to the 2010 season.[292] In the team's losses, multiple turnovers from the quarterback position were often the culprit, and as a whole turnovers at critical times in the game often derailed potential Irish comebacks. On September 12, 2012, during the football program's 125th season, Notre Dame announced that it would leave the Big East Conference for the Atlantic Coast Conference, excluding the football and hockey programs.[293] This move became official on July 1, 2013. While the Fighting Irish football team remained an FBS independent, it agreed to play five games per season against ACC teams starting with the 2014 football season. In return, Notre Dame became eligible to participate in the ACC's sub-BCS level bowl arrangements.[294] The 2012 season was another entry in historic third seasons for Notre Dame head coaches. The Irish began the season 7–0, including wins over ranked rivals in Michigan State, Michigan, and Stanford. The game against the Cardinal required a goal-line stand against running back Stepfan Taylor in overtime to preserve the win for the Irish.[295] The season's signature win came at #8 Oklahoma with ESPN's College GameDay in town. On November 18, after a loss by #1 Oregon, Notre Dame became ranked #1 in the nation in both the AP and Coaches' polls after reaching 11–0 during the regular season for the first time since 1993, also ranking #1 in the BCS standings for the first time in the 14-year history of the selection system.[296] After defeating USC on November 24,[297] Notre Dame concluded its first 12–0 regular season, and the Irish were soon formally named to appear in the BCS National Championship Game for the first time. In that game, on January 7, 2013, the Irish lost to Alabama 42–14.[298] The strength of the 2012 Fighting Irish was its defense, captained by senior leader Manti Te'o, who broke the school record for interceptions by a linebacker with 7 and finished second to Johnny Manziel in Heisman Trophy voting. Coming off the previous year's national title game appearance, the Fighting Irish were dealt a blow when 2012 starting quarterback, Everett Golson, was suspended from the University due to an academic violation.[299] Senior Tommy Rees then took over. Notre Dame's 2013 season ended with a record of 9–4,[300] a victory over Rutgers in the Pinstripe Bowl, and a #20 AP poll ranking.[301][302] The 2014 season started off with 6 straight victories and a #5 national ranking heading into a showdown with #2 Florida State in Tallahassee, Florida. FSU won that game 31–27, on a controversial offensive pass interference call that brought back a last-second Notre Dame touchdown. The Fighting Irish bounced back with a win against Navy before dropping their final 4 games of the season. They did win the Music City Bowl by defeating the LSU Tigers and finished the season at an 8–5 record.[303] The 2015 Fighting Irish began its season with another new offensive coordinator, Mike Sanford Jr.[304] Led for most of the year by sophomore quarterback DeShone Kizer, the Irish had fourteen plays of over 50 yards during the season, which was a school record, including two touchdowns of over 90 yards (a 91-yard touchdown run by C. J. Prosise and a 98-yard touchdown run by Josh Adams). The Irish only had two in the previous 126 years of Notre Dame football. They finished the regular season averaging 34 points per game, including a 62-point effort against UMass, the most points in a game since 1996. The Irish began the season 10–1 and were in position for a College Football Playoff appearance, but lost a last-second game to Stanford to finish with a 10–2 record and a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.[305] Star linebacker Jaylon Smith was injured early in the game which became a loss to Ohio State.[306] The 2016 season ended with a 4–8 record, Brian Kelly's worst win–loss record at Notre Dame. The tone for the season was set early, with a heartbreaking double overtime loss to Texas in the season opener.[307] Just 4 games into the season, Brian Kelly fired defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder.[308] At the end of the season, starting quarterback DeShone Kizer declared for the NFL Draft[309] and backup quarterback Malik Zaire announced he would be transferring in the winter after graduation.[310][311] Amidst speculation that Kelly's job was in jeopardy and that Kelly was looking to leave Notre Dame, athletics director Jack Swarbrick announced that Kelly would return for the 2017 season.[312] The 2017 season was one of Kelly's strongest seasons at ND. An early one-point loss to #2 Georgia was the only blemish on an 8-1 start, keyed by a 49-14 blowout over rival USC. The tough running of running back Josh Adams behind an experienced and talented offensive line, which included future top-10 picks Quenton Nelson and Mike McGlinchey and won the Joe Moore Award as the best offensive line in that nation, allowed Notre Dame to string together 6 consecutive 20+ point victories. However, when #3 Notre Dame visited #7 Miami in South Florida on November 7, an embarrassing 41-8 loss effectively ended the Irish hopes of a playoff run. They ended the season with a win over LSU in the Music City Bowl.[313] The Irish opened the 2018 season at home against Michigan and won, 24–17.[314] After benching quarterback Brandon Wimbush in favor of Ian Book, the Irish then won the remainder of their regular season games, including victories over #7 Stanford, #24 Virginia Tech, #12 Syracuse, and Northwestern.[315] This led to Notre Dame's first undefeated regular season since 2012.[316] They were ranked #3 in the nation by the College Football Playoff committee and selected to play in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Cotton Bowl against Clemson.[317] Notre Dame's undefeated streak came to an end after losing to the eventual national champions 30–3 to finish the season at 12–1.[318] Kelly was named AP Coach of the Year and Home Depot Coach of the Year for the 2018 season.[319][320] Kelly and the Fighting Irish started off the 2019 season with a #9 ranking in the AP Poll. Notre Dame won their first two games before dropping a 23–17 result to #3 Georgia. Notre Dame won their next three games before dropping a 45–14 game to #19 Michigan. Notre Dame closed out the regular season with victories in their last five games, followed by a win in the Camping World Bowl 33–9 over Iowa State.[321] In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the cancellation of regular season scheduled games, Notre Dame joined the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in football for a single season in 2020 and played a full slate of conference matches.[322] The Irish won all ten of their games, including a mid-season contest against perennial conference power and top-ranked Clemson. The Fighting Irish defeated the Tigers 47–40 in double overtime. However, Clemson defeated the Irish in a rematch in the ACC Championship Game 34–10. Notre Dame qualified for the College Football Playoff as the #4 seed.[323] In the College Football Playoff Semifinals against Alabama at the Rose Bowl, Notre Dame lost 31–14 to finish with a 10–2 record.[324] In what would become Kelly's final season as head coach in 2021, the Fighting Irish were ranked #9 to begin the season, but struggled in their first two games, beating Florida State 41–38 and Toledo 32–29. Following a 24–13 loss to #7 Cincinnati, Kelly helped lead the Fighting Irish to a seven-game winning streak to finish the regular season 11–1 and earn a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.[325] On November 29, 2021, Kelly resigned as Notre Dame head coach to accept a ten-year, $95 million contract offer to become head coach at LSU.[326] In so doing, Kelly became the first Irish head coach since Thomas A. Barry in 1907 to leave Notre Dame for another coaching job.[327] Kelly left the Irish as the program's all-time winningest head coach.[328][329] On December 3, 2021, Notre Dame's defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman was promoted to the head coaching position to replace Brian Kelly, becoming the 32nd head coach in program history.[330][331] The second African American head coach in the history of the Irish football program, Freeman signed a five-year contract worth $4 million annually excluding incentives.[332][333][334] Freeman took control immediately, coaching the Irish in their Fiesta Bowl loss to Oklahoma State.[335][336] Freeman opened the 2022 season with losses to Ohio State (his alma mater) and Marshall, thus becoming first head coach in Notre Dame history to start his tenure with three losses.[337] He gained his first win the following week against the California.[338][339] Freeman's Irish would go on to finish the regular season ranked 19th with a record of 8-4, including an upset win over No. 5 Clemson.[340][341] They were awarded a berth in the Gator Bowl where they defeated South Carolina 45–38.[342][343] For the 2023 season, Freeman guided the Notre Dame program to a 10-win season. Safety Xavier Watts received the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for college football's best defensive player and the team earned victories over #17 Duke, #10 USC and #19 Oregon State in the Sun Bowl. Notre Dame finished the year ranked #14 in the final AP Top 25. Freeman and the Fighting Irish held their first home game of the 2024 season against the Northern Illinois Huskies as the #5 ranked team in the AP Top 25 and as a 28.5-point favorite to win. They fell to the Huskies 16-14, throwing two interceptions and giving up two blocked field goals. It was the second early-season home loss for the Irish against a heavy underdog in three years (following the 2022 loss to Marshall), was the first-ever win by a Mid-American Conference football program against a top 5 team, the first-ever Huskie win against a top 10 team, and one of the largest point-spread upsets in modern college football.[344] The Irish went on to complete the regular season 11-1 and will host a home game in the first year of the expanded college football playoffs. Notre Dame's 11 claimed national championships are: Following its appearance in the 1925 Rose Bowl, Notre Dame did not play in a post-season game for 44 consecutive years (1925–1968), including after many of the team's most successful seasons from the Rockne era in the 1920s and the Leahy era in the 1940s. The university's stated reasons for its self-imposed hiatus were that bowl games were \"glorified exhibitions\" that played no part in national championship selections and that they extended the season too far to the detriment of players' academic progress.[351] Notre Dame has made 874 appearances in the Associated Press poll over 71 seasons. Notre Dame has spent 591 weeks in the Top 10, 318 weeks in the Top 5, and 98 weeks at No. 1.[352] Notre Dame has finished the year ranked in the final Associated Press poll of the season 56 times: Notre Dame has participated in eleven \"No. 1 vs No. 2\" matchups since the AP poll began in 1936.[369] They have a record of 5–3–2 in such games, with a 4–1–1 record as the No. 1 team in such matchups. Here's a list of such games: Notre Dame has played in many regular season games that have been widely regarded by both the media[370] and sports historians[371] as historic or famous games. Notre Dame has played in many games labeled \"Game of the Century\" as well as several No. 1 vs No. 2 matchups.[372] Notre Dame has also played in several bowl games considered by many sportswriters to be among the best bowl games played:[384][385] Notre Dame's all-time record after the 2023 season stands at 948 wins, 338 losses, and 42 ties. † George O'Leary did not coach a single practice or game, resigning five days after being hired for misrepresenting his academic credentials.‡ Kent Baer served as interim head coach for one game at the 2004 Insight Bowl after Tyrone Willingham was fired. Notre Dame has made 41 bowl game appearances, winning 20 and losing 21, with one game vacated.[387] After an initial appearance in a postseason contest in the 1925 Rose Bowl, the Fighting Irish refused to participate in bowl games for more than four decades;[388] Sports Illustrated's Dan Jenkins speculated that Notre Dame might have gone to as many as twenty bowl games during the self-imposed forty-five-year hiatus.[388] From 1994 to the 2006 football seasons, Notre Dame lost 9 consecutive bowl games, tied with Northwestern for the most in NCAA history. That streak ended with a 49–21 win over Hawaii in the 2008 Hawaii Bowl. In the process, Notre Dame scored its highest point total in postseason play. The record of 9 consecutive bowl losses was later tied by Northwestern in 2011, then that streak was snapped a year later. Currently, the Fighting Irish are in a skid with winless 0-8 record in BCS/Playoff games and 0-10 in their last 10 major bowl games. Notre Dame's last major bowl win came against Texas A&M in the 1994 Cotton Bowl. Between 2009 and 2016, and resuming again in 2018, Notre Dame has hosted an annual off-site home football game known as the Shamrock Series. The series promotes Notre Dame's athletic and academic brand, and has brought the Fighting Irish to San Antonio, New York, Greater Washington, D.C., Chicago, Indianapolis, Boston and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Notre Dame has yet to lose a game in the Shamrock Series with a record of 11-0 (including the later-vacated win over Arizona State in the 2013 season). Prior to the 2012 season, Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick announced at a news conference of plans to continue the series through 2016. He confirmed after his news conference that New York is expected to fall in that rotation and then continue to be the one consistently repeating venue for Shamrock Series games. The Shamrock Series was not held in 2017, but resumed in 2018. One of the unique aspects of the Shamrock Series is its inclusion of academic and other non-football activities in the area of that year's host city the days and hours leading up to the game, which include pep rallies, drummers' circles, and academic lectures.[389][390][391] The Shamrock Series held in Las Vegas was the largest crowd for a college athletic event in Nevada history.[392] Seven Notre Dame football players have won the Heisman Trophy, which ties them with the University of Oklahoma for the second most by any university. (Ohio State also has seven trophies that were won by only six players, while USC has the most winners with eight). Heisman voting:[394] 50 former Notre Dame players and 6 coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, located in Atlanta, Georgia.[364] Notre Dame leads all universities in players inducted. Notre Dame's home jersey is navy blue with white numerals, gold outlining, and a small interlocking \"ND\" logo on each sleeve. The away jersey is white with navy numerals, gold outlining, and the interlocking \"ND\" on the sleeves. These uniforms were introduced by Lou Holtz in 1986 and retained during the tenures of Bob Davie (1997-2001) and Tyrone Willingham (2002–04). In 2005, Charlie Weis removed the interlocking \"ND\" from the sleeves, replacing it with the player's number, the first time the Irish had worn \"TV numbers\" since 1986, when they were located on the shoulders. These jerseys remained throughout Weis' tenure. When Brian Kelly succeeded Weis in 2010, the interlocking \"ND\" returned to the sleeves, and it has remained since. The Irish traditionally have not worn player names on their jerseys during regular season games, but they were included during the coaching tenures of Dan Devine (1975–80) and Gerry Faust (1981-85). When Notre Dame appeared in the 1970 Cotton Bowl Classic, its first bowl game in 45 years, Ara Parseghian had player names placed on the backs of the jerseys, a tradition which was retained for four other bowl appearances under Parseghian. Holtz, Davie, Willingham and Weis (in the 2006 Fiesta Bowl and 2007 Sugar Bowl) did not adhere to this tradition for bowl games they coached, but it returned under Weis for the 2008 Hawaii Bowl and has been continued by Kelly and Marcus Freeman. Notre Dame's helmets are solid gold with gray facemasks, the gold being emblematic of the University's famed \"Golden Dome\". Notre Dame's tradition for the team's student managers to spray-paint the team's helmets prior to each game ended in 2011 when the football equipment staff, along with Notre Dame Athletics Director Jack Swarbrick and head coach Brian Kelly outsourced the painting process to Hydro Graphics Inc. During Gerry Faust's tenure (1981–85), Notre Dame's blue jerseys switched from the traditional navy (although Notre Dame wore green jerseys full-time between the 1977 game vs. USC and the end of the 1980 season) to royal blue with gold and white stripes on the sleeves (they also wore a green jersey with sleeve stripes for the 1983 game vs. USC). The navy blue jerseys returned for the 1984 season (the Irish wore a redesigned white jersey during the 1983 Liberty Bowl without sleeve stripes and navy blue names and numbers which was carried over to 1984). No uniform numbers have been retired by Notre Dame. Upon being issued a number, each player is given a card that lists some of the more famous players who have worn that particular number. Number 3 is perhaps the most famous number in Irish football history, having been worn by Ralph Guglielmi, George Izo, Daryle Lamonica, Coley O'Brien, Joe Montana, Michael Floyd, Rick Mirer and Ron Powlus, among others.[425] Number 5 is also notable, as it is the only number to be worn by one of the Four Horsemen (Elmer Layden) a Heisman Trophy Winner (Paul Hornung) and a National Title winning Quarterback (Terry Hanratty).[425] Number 7 has been worn by such Irish greats as 1964 Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte, 1970 Heisman runner-up Joe Theismann, Steve Beuerlein, Jimmy Clausen and Jarious Jackson.[425] In 2011, both Michigan and Notre Dame wore throwback uniforms in their game against each other. For each Shamrock Series game, Notre Dame wears specially-designed helmets, jerseys, and pants. Champion supplied football jerseys for Notre Dame for over 50 years until the Irish switched to Adidas in 2001. On July 1, 2014, the Notre Dame athletic department began wearing uniforms and footwear supplied by Under Armour. Over the years, Notre Dame has occasionally worn green instead of blue as its home jersey, sometimes adopting the jersey for an entire season – or more – at a time. Notre Dame is confirmed to have worn green as far back as 1926 against Penn State, and in 1942 they officially became an alternate color for the team.[426] Currently, Notre Dame reserves its green jerseys for special occasions. Sometimes on such occasions, the Irish will take the field for warmups dressed in blue, only to switch to green when they go back to the locker room before kickoff. This tradition was started by Dan Devine in 1977 before the USC game. Notre Dame has also been known to switch jerseys at halftime, as during the 1985 USC game and in the loss to Nile Kinnick-led Iowa in 1939, although this was to help avoid confusion between their navy uniforms and Iowa's black ones. The current design of the jersey is kelly green with gold numbers and white outlining. For the 2006 Army game, Coach Charlie Weis broke out the green jerseys as a reward to his senior players and in an attempt to end the string of losses by the Irish when wearing green. Notre Dame wore throwback green jerseys in 2007 against USC in honor of the 30th anniversary of the 1977 National Championship team but lost the game 38-0.[427] As of 2023, Notre Dame's record in green is 42-15-1, going back to 1975.[426] On at least one occasion (1992 Sugar Bowl) Notre Dame has worn an away variant of the jersey, a white jersey with green numbers. Notre Dame Stadium is the home football stadium for the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. Located on the southeast part of the university's campus in Notre Dame, Indiana and with a seating capacity of 77,622, Notre Dame Stadium is one of the most renowned venues in college football.[428] The Sporting News ranks Notre Dame Stadium as #2 on its list of \"College Football Cathedrals\".[429] and the stadium experience evokes a more traditional feel. Notre Dame Stadium is used for football-related activities and for Commencement (since 2010). Notre Dame Stadium had no permanent lighting until the expansion project in 1997. NBC paid for the lighting as they have televised all Notre Dame home football games since 1991. On April 12, 2014, it was announced during the annual Blue-Gold Spring Game that a FieldTurf synthetic surface would replace the grass field after the 2014 Commencement Weekend. In November 2014 the University of Notre Dame embarked on a $400 million stadium expansion called the Crossroads Campus Project, which was completed in time for the 2017 season. Cartier Field was the original playing field of the Fighting Irish. In 1930, it was replaced by Notre Dame Stadium, due to the growing popularity of ND football. Known by fans as \"The Gug\" (pronounced \"goog\"), The Guglielmino Athletics Complex is Notre Dame's football headquarters. The Gug houses the offices for all team staff members, an auditorium, a weight room, a training room, the equipment room, the practice locker room, a brand new napping room, and various other spaces for the football team to utilize. The complex was underwritten by Don F. Guglielmino and his family. The indoor practice facility has a synthetic turf field and a video board at midfield for replay and graphics. On the second level of the facility, there is a 1,600-square-foot recruiting lounge. In all, the facility totals 111,400 square feet, and the ceiling is 95 feet at its peak. Notre Dame has rivalries with several universities. Although the Fighting Irish competes as an Independent, they play a national schedule that includes annual or otherwise regularly scheduled rivalry games. Army, Boston College, Michigan, Michigan State, Navy, Northwestern, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Stanford, and USC are among Notre Dame's rivals. Notre Dame and the Miami Hurricanes first met during the 1955 college football season.[430] They met three times during the 1960s (1960, 1965, and 1967) and proceeded to play each other annually from 1971 to 1990 (except in 1986). Notre Dame consistently dominated the series in the 1970s, but in the 1980s, Miami began to dominate as the once docile rivalry intensified significantly. Both teams were national contenders in the later part of the decade, and both teams cost each other at least one national championship. Hostilities were fueled when the Hurricanes routed the Fighting Irish in the 1985 season finale 58–7, with Miami widely accused of running up the score in the second half. The rivalry gained national attention and both teams played their most famous games from 1988 to 1990. The game known as Catholics vs. Convicts in South Bend was won by the Fighting Irish 31–30. The following year, Miami ended Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak with a 27–10 victory. The rivalry ended after the Fighting Irish dashed #2 Miami's hopes for a repeat national championship with a 29–20 victory in South Bend. Notre Dame dropped Miami from its schedule due to the intensified rivalry. The two teams are next scheduled to meet during a yet to specified date during the 2025 season. They also will play each other in yet to be scheduled dates in the 2031, 2032, 2034, and 2037 seasons.[431] The first meeting between Notre Dame and Michigan was in 1887, the first official football game in Notre Dame's history.[432] The two schools have met 44 times in total, the latest matchup in 2019. Through the 2021 season, the two schools are both in the top five in all-time Division I winning percentage, with Notre Dame fourth and Michigan third Meeting for the first time in 1897, Notre Dame and Michigan State play for the Megaphone Trophy. The two schools played in 64 out of 70 seasons from 1948 to 2017, but have not met since. Their next scheduled game is in 2026.[433] Notable games in the series include the 1966 \"Game of the Century\". Through the 2023 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 48–28–1 and the trophy series 33–27–1.[434] Navy and Notre Dame played 93 games without interruption from 1927 to 2019. Notre Dame had a 43-game win streak during this time frame, the longest streak by one team over another in Division I-A football, which ended in 2007.[435] While the 2020 contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the series resumed in 2021. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the series 83–13–1.[436] USC is Notre Dame's primary rival, and the schools compete annually for the Jeweled Shillelagh. The rivalry has produced 39 national championships,[437]: 113–118 15 Heisman Trophy winners,[438] and 184 Consensus All-Americans through the 2021 season.[439] It is considered one of the most prominent rivalries in college football,[440][441][442][443] and has been called the greatest rivalry not dictated by conference affiliation or geography.[444] The teams have played each other annually since 1926, except from 1943 to 1945 and 2020. Notable games in the series include the 1977 \"Green Jersey\" game and the 2005 \"Bush Push\" game. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 50–37–5 and the trophy series 35–30–3.[445] Due to its long and storied history, Notre Dame football boasts many traditions unique to Notre Dame. Some of these are: Since the NFL began drafting players in 1936, 495 Notre Dame football players have been selected by NFL teams. Additionally, Notre Dame has had 65 players selected in the first round of the NFL draft, including five overall number one picks. Of the 46 Super Bowls competed, as of 2012, only 14 teams have won the event without an Irish player on the roster.[457] Looking at both participating team rosters, there have only been five Super Bowls that did not feature at least one former Notre Dame player on either team's roster – Denver vs. Atlanta, 1999; Dallas vs. Buffalo, 1994; Washington vs. Denver, 1988; Dallas vs. Denver, 1978; and Baltimore vs. Dallas, 1971.[457] Eleven former players have won multiple Super Bowls: Mark Bavaro, Rocky Bleier, Nick Buoniconti, Eric Dorsey, Dave Duerson, David Givens, Terry Hanratty, Bob Kuechenberg, Joe Montana, Steve Sylvester and Justin Tuck.[457] 13 former Notre Dame players, plus 1 non-player alumnus, have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, tying it for first with USC among all college football programs.[458][459] *McNally graduated from St. John's (MN), but started his career at Notre Dame and is listed as a hall of famer under both schools in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[460] The Fighting Irish are the only team, professional or collegiate, to have all their games broadcast nationally on the radio and their home games on television.[462] Notre Dame famously left the College Football Association, a consortium that administered television broadcast rights on behalf of over 64 schools, in 1990, in order to establish its own broadcasting deal with NBC. From 1968 to 2007, Westwood One served as the official radio partner for the Irish, broadcasting their games for 40 consecutive years.[463] Until the 2006 Air Force game, Notre Dame had a record 169 consecutive games broadcast nationally on either NBC, ABC, ESPN, or CBS.[464] The 2006 ND vs. Air Force game was broadcast on CSTV, a college sports channel owned by CBS who had an exclusive contract with the Mountain West Conference, of which Air Force is a member. Radio rights to the Fighting Irish are held by Skyview Networks, who began distributing the broadcasts as part of a multi-sport arrangement in 2020.[465] NBC has been televising Notre Dame Home football games since the 1991 season.[9] In addition to TV broadcasts, NBC also maintains several dedicated websites to ND football and Notre Dame Central,[466] which provides complete coverage, full game replays and commentary of the Notre Dame team. NBC's television contract with Notre Dame was renewed in April 2013 and was set to continue through the 2025 football season,[467] before another contract renewal was made in 2023. NBC is now set to be the home of Notre Dame football through the 2029 season. It also aired football games on NBC's streaming service Peacock started in the 2021 season, with the home opener on September 11, 2021, against Toledo aired exclusively on the streaming service.[468][469] Internationally Sky Sports has been covering Notre Dame Football home games in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Germany since 2018 as a result of Comcast's takeover of Sky Although the Notre Dame football program is not a full member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), it has an agreement to play an average of five ACC schools per season. In return Notre Dame has access to the non-College Football Playoff ACC bowl line-up.[470][471] Notre Dame utilizes a format of six home games in South Bend, five away games, and one major metropolitan area neutral site \"Shamrock Series\" home game for scheduling.[389] This includes preserving traditional yearly rivalries with USC, Stanford, and Navy,[472] five rotating ACC opponents (two away ACC games will coincide in even years with away games at Navy and three away ACC games will coincide in odd years with home games against Navy),[473] two home and home series (one home game and one away game), one one-time opponent home game, and the traveling \"Shamrock Series\" home game.[474][475] TBA: 1 additional ACC away game will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC home game and 1 additional non-ACC home game will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 3 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 3 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled.

                "content": "Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. (/ˈrɒbɪnɪt ˈbaɪdən/ ⓘ ROB-in-it BY-dən; born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who has been the 46th and current president of the United States since 2021. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate from 1973 to 2009. Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Delaware in 1965 and a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University in 1968. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the 1988 and 2008 Democratic presidential nominations. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and he was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, the Democratic Party nominated Biden for president. He selected Kamala Harris as his running mate, and they defeated Republican incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. He became the oldest president in U.S. history and the first to serve with a female vice president. As president, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure and manufacturing. He proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that he signed into law in 2022. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He worked with congressional Republicans to resolve the 2023 debt-ceiling crisis by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In his foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban seizing control. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the Israel–Hamas war, Biden condemned the actions of Hamas as terrorism and sent military aid to Israel, as well as limited humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. In April 2023, Biden announced his reelection campaign and, after the Democratic primaries, became the party's presumptive nominee in the 2024 presidential election. Concerns about Biden's age and health persisted throughout his term, with renewed scrutiny after his performance during the first presidential debate on June 27. On July 21, he withdrew his candidacy, becoming the first U.S. president to decline to seek reelection after securing enough delegates to win renomination. Biden endorsed Vice President Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris won the nomination but lost the general election to Trump. Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942,[1] at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania,[2] to Catherine Eugenia \"Jean\" Biden (née Finnegan; 1917–2010) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr. (1915–2002)[3][4] The oldest child in a Catholic family of mostly Irish descent, along with English and French; he has a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Francis and James. The Biden surname traces back to William Biden, an ancestor of his who emigrated from England to Maryland around 1820.[5] Biden's father had been wealthy and the family purchased a home in the affluent Long Island suburb of Garden City in the fall of 1946,[6] but he suffered business setbacks around the time Biden was seven years old,[7][8][9] and for several years the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents in Scranton.[10] Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s and Biden's father could not find steady work.[11] Beginning in 1953 when Biden was ten,[12] the family lived in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, before moving to a house in nearby Mayfield, Delaware.[13][14][8][10] Biden Sr. later became a successful used-car salesman, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle.[10][11][15] At Archmere Academy in Claymont,[16] Biden played baseball and was a standout halfback and wide receiver on the high school football team.[10][17] Though a poor student, he was class president in his junior and senior years.[18][19] He graduated in 1961.[18] At the University of Delaware in Newark, Biden briefly played freshman football,[20][21] and, as an unexceptional student,[22] received a Bachelor of Arts degree with a double major in history and political science in 1965.[23][24] Biden had a stutter and has mitigated it since his early twenties.[25] He has described his efforts to reduce it by reciting poetry before a mirror.[19][26] Biden married Neilia Hunter, a student at Syracuse University, on August 27, 1966,[23][27] after overcoming her parents' disinclination for her to wed a Catholic. Their wedding was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles, New York.[28] They had three children: Joseph R. \"Beau\" Biden III, Robert Hunter Biden, and Naomi Christina \"Amy\" Biden.[23] Biden earned a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law in 1968. In his first year of law school, he failed a course because he plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote, but the failing grade was later stricken. His grades were relatively poor, and he graduated 76th in a class of 85 students.[22] He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969.[1] Biden clerked at a Wilmington law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett in 1968 and, he later said, \"thought of myself as a Republican\".[29][30] He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor Charles L. Terry's conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968.[29] Local Republicans attempted to recruit Biden, but he registered as an Independent because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon.[29] In 1969, Biden practiced law, first as a public defender and then at a law firm headed by a locally active Democrat,[31][29] who named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party;[32] Biden subsequently reregistered as a Democrat.[29] He and another attorney also formed a law firm.[31] Corporate law did not appeal to him, and criminal law did not pay well.[10] He supplemented his income by managing properties.[33] Biden ran for the 4th district seat on the New Castle County Council in 1970 on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs.[34][35] The seat had been held by Republican Henry R. Folsom, who was running in the 5th District following a reapportionment of council districts.[36][37][38] Biden won the general election, defeating Republican Lawrence T. Messick, and took office on January 5, 1971.[39][40] He served until January 1, 1973, and was succeeded by Democrat Francis R. Swift.[41][42] During his time on the county council, Biden opposed large highway projects, which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods.[42] Biden had not openly supported or opposed the Vietnam War until he ran for Senate and opposed Richard Nixon's conduct of the war.[43] While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University, Biden obtained five student draft deferments at a time when most draftees were sent to the war. Based on a physical examination, he was given a conditional medical deferment in 1968; in 2008, a spokesperson for Biden said his having had \"asthma as a teenager\" was the reason for the deferment.[44] Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware in 1972. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs and, with minimal campaign funds, he was thought to have no chance of winning.[31][10] Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers,[45] an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size.[33] He received help from the AFL-CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell.[31] His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care and public dissatisfaction with \"politics as usual\".[31][45] A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points,[31] but his energy, attractive young family, and ability to connect with voters' emotions worked to his advantage,[15] and he won with 50.5% of the vote.[45] A few weeks after Biden was elected senator, his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in Hockessin, Delaware, on December 18, 1972.[23][46] Neilia's station wagon was hit by a semi-trailer truck as she pulled out from an intersection. Their sons Beau (aged 3) and Hunter (aged 2) were in the car and were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries.[47] Biden considered resigning to care for them,[15] but Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield persuaded him not to.[48] Biden contemplated suicide and was filled with anger and religious doubt.[49][50] He wrote that he \"felt God had played a horrible trick\" on him[51] and had trouble focusing on work.[52][53] Biden met teacher Jill Tracy Jacobs in 1975 on a blind date.[54] They married at the United Nations chapel in New York on June 17, 1977,[55][56] and spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian People's Republic.[57][58] Biden credits her with the renewal of his interest in politics and life.[59] The couple attends Mass at St. Joseph's on the Brandywine in Greenville, Delaware.[60][61][62] In 1981, the couple had a daughter, Ashley Biden.[23] She is a social worker and married to physician Howard Krein.[63] Jill helped raise her stepsons, Hunter and Beau, who were seven and eight respectively at the time of her marriage. Hunter has worked as a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser; his business dealings, personal life, and legal troubles have come under significant scrutiny during his father's presidency. In December 2024, Biden pardoned Hunter following his conviction on gun and tax charges despite repeated promises that he would not do so.[64][65][66][67] Beau became an Army judge-advocate in Iraq and later Delaware attorney general;[68] he died of brain cancer in 2015.[69][70] From 1991 to 2008, as an adjunct professor, Biden co-taught a seminar on constitutional law at Widener University School of Law.[71][72] He sometimes flew back from overseas to teach the class.[73][74][75] Secretary of the Senate Francis R. Valeo swore Biden in at the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center in January 1973.[76][47] Present were his sons Beau (whose leg was still in traction from the automobile accident) and Hunter and other family members.[76][47] At age 30, he was the seventh-youngest senator in U.S. history.[77] To see his sons, Biden traveled by train between his Delaware home and D.C.[78]—74 minutes each way—and maintained this habit throughout his 36 years in the Senate.[15] Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972, Biden was reelected in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008, regularly receiving about 60% of the vote.[79] He was junior senator to William Roth, who was first elected in 1970, until Roth was defeated in 2000.[80] As of 2024[update], he was the 19th-longest-serving senator in U.S. history.[81] During his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability.[82] In a 1974 interview, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens' concerns and healthcare, but conservative on other issues, including abortion and military conscription.[83] Biden was the first U.S. senator to endorse Jimmy Carter for president in the 1976 Democratic primary.[84] Carter went on to win the Democratic nomination and defeat incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election. Biden also worked on arms control.[85][86] After Congress failed to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Biden met with Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko to communicate American concerns and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's objections.[87] He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administration's support of South Africa despite its continued policy of apartheid.[29] In a congressional hearing in 1984, he objected to the Strategic Defense Initiative plan to construct autonomous systems of ICBM defense.[88][89] In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's strongest opponents of race-integration busing. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies.[90] In his first Senate campaign, Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely.[91] Biden supported a 1976 measure forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them.[90] He co-sponsored a 1977 amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Carter signed into law in 1978.[92] Biden became ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. He was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act in 1984. His supporters praised him for modifying some of the law's worst provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time.[93] In 1994, Biden helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which included a ban on assault weapons,[94][95] and the Violence Against Women Act,[96] which he has called his most significant legislation.[97] The 1994 crime law was unpopular among progressives and criticized for resulting in mass incarceration;[98][99] in 2019, Biden called his role in passing the bill a \"big mistake\", citing its policy on crack cocaine and saying that the bill \"trapped an entire generation\".[100] Biden voted for a 1993 provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life, thereby banning gay people from serving in the armed forces.[101][102] In 1996, he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring people in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same.[103] In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges.[104] Biden was critical of Independent Counsel Ken Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and Lewinsky scandal investigations, saying \"it's going to be a cold day in hell\" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers.[105] He voted to acquit during the impeachment of President Clinton.[106] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers.[15] Clinton vetoed the bill in 2000, but it passed in 2005 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act,[15] with Biden being one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it, while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it.[107] As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased Amtrak funding and rail security.[79][108] In February 1988, after several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain, Biden underwent surgery to correct a leaking intracranial berry aneurysm.[109][110] While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism, a serious complication.[110] After a second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May,[110][111] his recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months.[112] Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a ranking minority member from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997.[113] As chair, Biden presided over two highly contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[15] When Robert Bork was nominated in 1988, Biden reversed his approval‍—‌given in an interview the previous year‍—‌of a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered,[114] but at the hearings' close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage.[114][115] Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents,[15] Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork's strong originalism and the view that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text.[115] Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 5–9 vote[115] and then in the full Senate, 42–58.[116] During Clarence Thomas's nomination hearings in 1991, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them,[117] and Thomas later wrote that Biden's questions were akin to \"beanballs\".[118] After the committee hearing closed, the public learned that Anita Hill, a University of Oklahoma law school professor, had accused Thomas of making unwelcome sexual comments when they had worked together.[119][120] Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify.[15] The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment.[121] The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52–48 vote, with Biden opposed.[15] Liberal legal advocates and women's groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill.[121] In 2019, he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her, but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied.[122] Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009.[123] His positions were generally liberal internationalist.[85][124] He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party.[123][124] During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations, becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy.[125] Biden voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991,[124] siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators. He said the U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition.[126] Biden became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991.[85] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the \"lift and strike\" policy.[85][123] The George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were both reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement.[85][124] In April 1993, Biden held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević.[127] Biden worked on several versions of legislative language urging the U.S. toward greater involvement.[127] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkan policy in the mid-1990s his \"proudest moment in public life\" related to foreign policy.[124] In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia.[85] He and Senator John McCain co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milošević over Yugoslav actions toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.[124][128] Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan, saying, \"Whatever it takes, we should do it.\"[129] As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to \"eliminate\" that threat.[130] In October 2002, he voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, approving the U.S. invasion of Iraq.[124] As chair of the committee, he assembled a series of witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his secular government, which was an avowed enemy of al-Qaeda, and touted Iraq's fictional possession of weapons of mass destruction.[131] Biden eventually became a critic of the war and called his vote and role a \"mistake\", but did not push for withdrawal.[124][127] He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should \"level with the American people\" about its cost and length.[123][128] By late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the troop surge of 2007,[124][127] saying General David Petraeus was \"dead, flat wrong\" in believing the surge could work.[132] Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states.[133] Rather than continue the existing approach or withdrawing, the plan called for \"a third way\": federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis \"breathing room\" in their own regions.[134] In September 2007, a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate,[135] but the idea failed to gain traction.[132] Biden formally declared his candidacy for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination on June 9, 1987.[136] He was considered a strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability, his high profile as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings, and his appeal to Baby Boomers; he would have been the second-youngest person elected president, after John F. Kennedy.[29][137][138] He raised more in the first quarter of 1987 than any other candidate.[137][138] By August his campaign's messaging had become confused due to staff rivalries,[139] and in September, he was accused of plagiarizing a speech by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.[140] Biden's speech had similar lines about being the first person in his family to attend university. Biden had credited Kinnock with the formulation on previous occasions,[141][142] but did not on two occasions in late August.[143]: 230–232 [142] Kinnock himself was more forgiving; the two men met in 1988, forming an enduring friendship.[144] Earlier that year, Biden had also used passages from a 1967 speech by Robert F. Kennedy (for which his aides took blame) and a short phrase from John F. Kennedy's inaugural address; two years earlier he had used a 1976 passage by Hubert Humphrey.[145] Biden responded that politicians often borrow from one another without giving credit, and that one of his rivals for the nomination, Jesse Jackson, had called him to point out that he (Jackson) had used the same material by Humphrey that Biden had used.[15][22] A few days later, an incident was publicized in which, while in law school, Biden had taken text from a Fordham Law Review article with inadequate citations.[22] He was required to repeat the course and passed with high marks.[146] At Biden's request the Delaware Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility reviewed the incident and concluded that he had violated no rules.[147] Biden has made several false or exaggerated claims about his early life: that he had earned three degrees in college, that he attended law school on a full scholarship, that he had graduated in the top half of his class,[148][149] and that he had marched in the civil rights movement.[150] The limited amount of other news about the presidential race amplified these disclosures[151] and on September 23, 1987, Biden withdrew his candidacy, saying it had been overrun by \"the exaggerated shadow\" of his past mistakes.[152] After exploring the possibility of a run in several previous cycles, in January 2007, Biden declared his candidacy in the 2008 elections.[79][153][154] During his campaign, Biden focused on the Iraq War, his record as chairman of major Senate committees, and his foreign-policy experience.[155] Biden was noted for his one-liners during the campaign; in one debate he said of Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani, \"There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11.\"[156] Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton.[157] He never rose above single digits in national polls of the Democratic candidates. In the first contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses, garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates.[158] He withdrew from the race that evening.[159] Despite its lack of success, Biden's 2008 campaign raised his stature in the political world.[160]: 336 In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama. Although they had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they had not been close: Biden resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom,[132][161] while Obama viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.[160]: 28, 337–338 Having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaign style and appeal to working-class voters, and Biden said he became convinced Obama was \"the real deal\".[161][160]: 28, 337–338 Shortly after Biden withdrew from the presidential race, Obama privately told him he was interested in finding an important place for Biden in his administration.[162] In early August, Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss the possibility,[162] and developed a strong personal rapport.[161] On August 22, 2008, Obama announced that Biden would be his running mate.[163] The New York Times reported that the strategy behind the choice reflected a desire to fill out the ticket with someone with foreign policy and national security experience.[164] Others pointed out Biden's appeal to middle-class and blue-collar voters.[165][166] Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 by voice vote at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver.[167] Biden's vice-presidential campaigning gained little media attention, as the press devoted far more coverage to the Republican nominee, Alaska governor Sarah Palin.[168][169] Under instructions from the campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks, such as one he made about Obama's being tested by a foreign power soon after taking office, which had attracted negative attention.[170][171] Privately, Biden's remarks frustrated Obama. \"How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid?\", he asked.[160]: 411–414, 419 Obama campaign staffers called Biden's blunders \"Joe bombs\" and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which in turn irked Biden.[172] Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized on a call to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership.[160]: 411–414 As the 2007–2008 financial crisis reached a peak in September 2008, and the proposed Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 became a major factor in the campaign, Biden voted for the $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which passed in the Senate, 74–25.[173] On October 2, he participated in the vice-presidential debate with Palin at Washington University in St. Louis. Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters' expectations, Biden had won the debate overall. [174] On November 4, Obama and Biden were elected with 53% of the popular vote and 365 electoral votes to McCain and Palin's 173.[175][176][177] At the same time Biden was running for vice president, he was also running for reelection to the Senate,[178] as permitted by Delaware law.[79] On November 4, he was reelected to the Senate, defeating Republican Christine O'Donnell.[179] Having won both races, Biden made a point of not resigning from the Senate before he was sworn in for his seventh term in January 2009.[180] He cast his last Senate vote on January 15, supporting the release of the second $350 billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program,[181] and resigned from the Senate later that day, after which Ted Kaufman took office as his successor.[182][183] In October 2010, Biden said Obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the 2012 presidential election,[184] but with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research in late 2011 on the idea of replacing Biden on the ticket with Hillary Clinton.[185] The notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama,[185] and White House officials later said Obama himself had never entertained the idea.[186] Biden's May 2012 statement that he was \"absolutely comfortable\" with same-sex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to Obama's position, which had been described as \"evolving\".[187] Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were quite irked, since Obama had planned to shift position several months later, in the build-up to the party convention.[172][188][189] Gay rights advocates seized upon Biden's statement,[188] and within days, Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage, an action in part forced by Biden's remarks.[190] Biden apologized to Obama in private for having spoken out,[191][192] while Obama acknowledged publicly it had been done from the heart.[188] The Obama campaign valued Biden as a retail-level politician, and he had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the reelection campaign began in earnest in spring 2012.[193][194] An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that Republican proposals to relax Wall Street regulations would \"put y'all back in chains\" once again drew attention to Biden's propensity for colorful remarks.[193][195][196] In the first presidential debate of the general election, President Obama's performance was considered surprisingly lackluster.[197] Time magazine's Joe Klein called it \"one of the most inept performances I've ever seen by a sitting president\".[198] Over the next few days, Obama's lead over Romney collapsed,[199] putting pressure on Biden to stop the bleeding with a strong showing against the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Paul Ryan.[200][201] Some political analysts considered Biden's performance against Ryan in the October 11 vice-presidential debate one of the best of his career[202][203] and a key factor in Obama's rebound in the polls and eventual victory over Romney.[204][205] The debate also became memorable for the popularization of Biden's use of the phrase \"a bunch of malarkey\" in response to an attack by Ryan on the administration's response to the September 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi.[206][207] Biden reused the phrase during his 2020 presidential campaign.[208] On November 6, Obama and Biden won reelection[209] over Romney and Ryan with 332 of 538 Electoral College votes and 51% of the popular vote.[210] Biden said he intended to eliminate some explicit roles assumed by George W. Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, and did not intend to emulate any previous vice presidency.[211] He was sworn in as the 47th vice president of the United States on January 20, 2009.[212] He was the first vice president from Delaware[213] and the first Roman Catholic vice president.[214][215] Obama was soon comparing Biden to a basketball player \"who does a bunch of things that don't show up in the stat sheet\".[216] Biden visited Kosovo in May and affirmed the U.S. position that its \"independence is irreversible\".[217] Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about sending 21,000 new troops to Afghanistan,[218][219] but his skepticism was valued,[220] and in 2009, Biden's views gained more influence as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy.[221] Biden visited Iraq about every two months,[132] becoming the administration's point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress there.[220] More generally, overseeing Iraq policy became Biden's responsibility: Obama was said to have said, \"Joe, you do Iraq.\"[222] By 2012, Biden had made eight trips there, but his oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq receded with the exit of U.S. troops in 2011.[194][223] Biden oversaw infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession.[224] During this period, Biden was satisfied that no major instances of waste or corruption had occurred,[220] and when he completed that role in February 2011, he said the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent.[225] Biden's off-message response to a question in late April 2009, during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak, led to a swift retraction by the White House.[226] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes.[227][221][228] Confronted with rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had \"misread how bad the economy was\", but maintained confidence the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up.[229] A hot mic picked up Biden telling Obama that his signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was \"a big fucking deal\" on March 23, 2010. Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together.[172] Members of the Obama administration said Biden's role in the White House was to be a contrarian and force others to defend their positions.[230] Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff, said that Biden helped counter groupthink.[216] Obama said, \"The best thing about Joe is that when we get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that is very valuable for me.\"[220] The Bidens maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in Washington, often entertaining their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware.[231] Biden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections, maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of predictions of large-scale losses for the party.[184] Following big Republican gains in the elections and the departure of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, Biden's past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important.[232][233] He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty.[232][233] In December 2010, Biden's advocacy for a middle ground, followed by his negotiations with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise tax package that included a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts.[233][234] The package passed as the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Obama delegated Biden to lead negotiations with Congress in March 2011 to resolve federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown.[235] The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next few months, but Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved key in breaking a deadlock and bringing about a deal to resolve it, in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011, signed on August 2, 2011, the same day an unprecedented U.S. default had loomed.[236][237][238] Some reports suggest that Biden opposed proceeding with the May 2011 U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden,[194][239] lest failure adversely affect Obama's reelection prospects.[240][241] Obama named Biden to head the Gun Violence Task Force, created to address the causes of school shootings and consider possible gun control to implement in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, in December 2012.[242] Later that month, during the final days before the United States fell off the \"fiscal cliff\", Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 being passed at the start of 2013.[243][244] It made many of the Bush tax cuts permanent but raised rates on upper income levels.[244] Biden was inaugurated to a second term on January 20, 2013, at a small ceremony at Number One Observatory Circle, his official residence, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor presiding (a public ceremony took place on January 21).[245] Biden played little part in discussions that led to the October 2013 passage of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved the federal government shutdown of 2013 and the debt-ceiling crisis of 2013. This was because Senate majority leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cut him out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.[246][247][248] Biden's Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized again in 2013. The act led to related developments, such as the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden and Valerie Jarrett as co-chairs.[249][250] He talked about sexual violence while introducing Lady Gaga at the 88th Academy Awards in 2016, receiving a standing ovation from the audience.[251] Biden favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[252] As the ISIL insurgency in Iraq intensified in 2014, renewed attention was paid to the Biden-Gelb Iraqi federalization plan of 2006, with some observers suggesting Biden had been right all along.[253][254] Biden himself said the U.S. would follow ISIL \"to the gates of hell\".[255] Biden had close relationships with several Latin American leaders and was assigned a focus on the region during the administration; he visited the region 16 times during his vice presidency, the most of any president or vice president.[256] In August 2016, Biden visited Serbia, where he met with the Serbian Prime Minister, Aleksandar Vučić, and expressed his condolences for civilian victims of the bombing campaign during the Kosovo War.[257] Biden never cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate, making him the longest-serving vice president with this distinction.[258] During his second term, Biden was often said to be preparing for a bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.[259] With his family, many friends, and donors encouraging him in mid-2015 to enter the race, and with Hillary Clinton's favorability ratings in decline at that time, Biden was reported to again be seriously considering the prospect and a \"Draft Biden 2016\" PAC was established.[259][260][261] By late 2015, Biden was still uncertain about running. He felt his son Beau's recent death had largely drained his emotional energy, and said, \"nobody has a right ... to seek that office unless they're willing to give it 110% of who they are.\"[262] On October 21, speaking from a podium in the Rose Garden with his wife and Obama by his side, Biden announced his decision not to run for president in 2016.[263][264][265] After leaving the vice presidency, Biden became an honorary professor at the University of Pennsylvania, developing the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Biden remained in that position into 2019, before running for president.[266][267] In 2017, Biden wrote a memoir, Promise Me, Dad, and went on a book tour.[268] By 2019, he and his wife reported that they had earned over $15 million since the end of his vice presidency from speaking engagements and book sales.[269] Biden remained in the public eye, endorsing candidates while continuing to comment on politics, climate change, and the presidency of Donald Trump.[270][271][272] He also continued to speak out in favor of LGBT rights, continuing advocacy on an issue he had become more closely associated with during his vice presidency.[273][274] In 2018, he gave a eulogy for Senator John McCain, praising McCain's embrace of American ideals and bipartisan friendships.[275] Biden continued to support cancer research.[276] Between 2016 and 2019, media outlets often mentioned Biden as a likely candidate for president in 2020.[277] When asked if he would run, he gave varied and ambivalent answers, saying \"never say never\".[278] A political action committee known as Time for Biden was formed in January 2018, seeking Biden's entry into the race.[279] He finally launched his campaign on April 25, 2019,[280] saying he was prompted to run because he was worried by the Trump administration and felt a \"sense of duty\".[281] As the 2020 campaign season heated up, voluminous public polling showed Biden as one of the best-performing Democratic candidates in a head-to-head matchup against President Trump.[282][283][284] With Democrats keenly focused on \"electability\" for defeating Trump,[285] this boosted his popularity among Democratic voters.[286] It also made Biden a frequent target of Trump.[287][288] In September 2019, it was reported that Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate alleged wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter Biden.[289] Despite the allegations, no evidence was produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.[290][291][292] Trump's pressure to investigate the Bidens was perceived by many as an attempt to hurt Biden's chances of winning the presidency.[293] Trump's alleged actions against Biden resulted in a political scandal[294] and Trump's impeachment by the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of congress.[295] In March 2019 and April 2019, eight women accused Biden of previous instances of inappropriate physical contact, such as embracing, touching or kissing.[296] Biden had previously called himself a \"tactile politician\" and admitted this behavior had caused trouble for him.[297] Journalist Mark Bowden described Biden's lifelong habit of talking close, writing that he \"doesn't just meet you, he engulfs you... scooting closer\" and leaning forward to talk.[298] In April 2019, Biden pledged to be more \"respectful of people's personal space\".[299] Throughout 2019, Biden stayed generally ahead of other Democrats in national polls.[300][301] Despite this, he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses, and eight days later, fifth in the New Hampshire primary.[302][303] He performed better in the Nevada caucuses, reaching the 15% required for delegates, but still finished 21.6 percentage points behind Bernie Sanders.[304] Making strong appeals to Black voters on the campaign trail and in the South Carolina debate, Biden won the South Carolina primary by more than 28 points.[305] After the withdrawals and subsequent endorsements of candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, he made large gains in the March 3 Super Tuesday primary elections. Biden won 18 of the next 26 contests, putting him in the lead overall.[306] Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg soon dropped out, and Biden expanded his lead with victories over Sanders in four states on March 10.[307] In late March 2020, Tara Reade, one of the eight women who in 2019 had accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact, accused Biden of having sexually assaulted her in 1993.[308] There were inconsistencies between Reade's 2019 and 2020 allegations.[308][309] Biden and his campaign denied the sexual assault allegation.[310][311] When Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, Biden became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for president.[312] On April 13, Sanders endorsed Biden in a live-streamed discussion from their homes.[313] Former president Barack Obama endorsed Biden the next day.[314] On August 11, Biden announced U.S. senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first African American and first South Asian American vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket.[315] On August 18, 2020, Biden was officially nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2020 election.[316][317] Biden was elected the 46th president of the United States in November 2020. He defeated the incumbent, Donald Trump, becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been \"stolen\" from him through \"voter fraud\", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results.[318] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[319] On November 23, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[320] On January 6, 2021, during Congress's electoral vote count, Trump told supporters gathered in front of the White House to march to the Capitol and refused to concede the election.[321] Soon after, some of his supporters attacked the Capitol. During the attack, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events \"an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times\".[322][323] After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session and officially certified the election results with Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as President of the Senate, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[324] Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021.[325][326] At 78, he was the oldest person to have assumed the office.[325][327] He is the second Catholic president (after John F. Kennedy)[328][329] and the first president whose home state is Delaware.[330] He is also the first man since George H. W. Bush to have been both vice president and president, and the second non-incumbent vice president (after Richard Nixon in 1968) to be elected president.[331] He is also the first president from the Silent Generation.[332][333] Biden's inauguration was \"a muted affair unlike any previous inauguration\" due to COVID-19 precautions as well as massively increased security measures because of the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Trump did not attend, becoming the first outgoing president since 1869 to not attend his successor's inauguration.[334] In his first two days as president, Biden signed 17 executive orders. By his third day, orders had included rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, ending the state of national emergency at the border with Mexico, directing the government to rejoin the World Health Organization, face mask requirements on federal property, measures to combat hunger in the United States,[335][336][337][338] and revoking permits for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.[339][340][341] On March 11, the first anniversary of COVID-19 having been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus and relief package that he had proposed to support the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[342] The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the child tax credit. Biden's initial proposal included an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, but after the Senate parliamentarian determined that including the increase in a budget reconciliation bill would violate Senate rules, Democrats declined to pursue overruling her and removed the increase from the package.[343][344][345] Also in March, amid a rise in migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico, Biden told migrants, \"Don't come over.\" In the meantime, migrant adults \"are being sent back\", Biden said, in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations.[346] Biden earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children; the rise in arrivals of such children exceeded the capacity of facilities meant to shelter them (before they were sent to sponsors), leading the Biden administration in March to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help.[347] On April 14, Biden announced that the United States would delay the withdrawal of all troops from the war in Afghanistan until September 11, signaling an end to the country's direct military involvement in Afghanistan after nearly 20 years.[348] In February 2020, the Trump administration had made a deal with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1, 2021.[349] Biden's decision met with a wide range of reactions, from support and relief to trepidation at the possible collapse of the Afghan government without American support.[350] On April 22–23, Biden held an international climate summit at which he announced that the U.S. would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%–52% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Other countries also increased their pledges.[351][352] On April 28, the eve of his 100th day in office, Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress.[353] On June 17, Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which officially declared Juneteenth a federal holiday.[354] Juneteenth is the first new federal holiday since 1983.[355][356][357] In July 2021, amid a slowing of the COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, Biden said that the country has \"a pandemic for those who haven't gotten the vaccination\" and that it was therefore \"gigantically important\" for Americans to be vaccinated.[358] In 2022, Biden endorsed a change to the Senate filibuster to allow for the passing of the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act, on both of which the Senate had failed to invoke cloture.[359] The rules change failed when two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, joined Senate Republicans in opposing it.[360] In April 2022, Biden signed into law the bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act of 2022 to revamp the finances and operations of the United States Postal Service agency.[361] In the summer of 2022, several other pieces of legislation Biden supported passed Congress. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act aimed to address gun reform issues following the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas.[362] The act's gun control provisions include extended background checks for gun purchasers under 21, clarification of Federal Firearms License requirements, funding for state red flag laws and other crisis intervention programs, further criminalization of arms trafficking and straw purchases, and partial closure of the boyfriend loophole.[363][364][365] Biden signed the bill on June 25, 2022.[366] The Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 was introduced in 2021 and signed into law by Biden on August 10, 2022.[367] The act intends to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, including burn pits, during military service.[368] In 2022, Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and requires the federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex and interracial marriages.[369] In June 2024, Biden issued an executive action offering amnesty to unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens. The program included a pathway to U.S. residency and citizenship and was expected to initially affect about 500,000 people. It was later struck down due to a lack of legislation empowering the president to enact the program.[370][371] Biden entered office nine months into a recovery from the COVID-19 recession and his first year in office was characterized by robust growth in real GDP, employment, wages, and stock market returns, amid significantly elevated inflation. Real GDP grew 5.9%, the fastest rate in 37 years.[372][373] Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year.[374][375][376] By the end of 2021, inflation reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1%, which was partially offset by the highest nominal wage and salary growth in at least 20 years.[377][378][379][380] In his third month in office, Biden signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour, an increase of nearly 37%. The order went into effect for 390,000 workers in January 2022.[381][382] Amid a surge in inflation and high gas prices, Biden's approval ratings declined, with his disapproval rating surpassing his approval rating in early 2022.[384][385][386] After 5.9% growth in 2021, real GDP growth cooled in 2022 to 2.1%, after slightly negative growth in the first half spurred recession concerns. Job creation and consumer spending remained strong through the year, as the unemployment rate fell to match a 53-year low of 3.5% in December. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June before easing to 3.2% by October 2023. Stocks had had their worst year since 2008[387][388][389] before recovering. Widespread predictions of an imminent recession did not materialize in 2022 or 2023, and by late 2023 indicators showed sharply lower inflation with economic acceleration. GDP growth hit 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023 and the year ended with stocks near record highs, with robust holiday spending.[390][391][392] Biden signed numerous major pieces of economic legislation in the 117th Congress, including the American Rescue Plan, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act.[393] He signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law on August 9, 2022.[394] It provided billions of dollars in new funding to boost domestic research on and manufacture of semiconductors, to compete economically with China.[395] In 2022, Biden blocked a national railroad strike planned by multiple labor unions.[396] During the United Auto Workers strike, he expressed support for the workers in negotiations.[397] Biden joined striking UAW workers' picket line in Michigan, becoming the first president to join a picket line.[398] He refused to block a port strike from the International Longshoremen's Association in October 2024.[399] Over the course of five days in March 2023, three small- to mid-size U.S. banks failed, triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global contagion. After Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, the first to do so, Biden expressed opposition to a bailout by taxpayers.[400] He claimed that the partial rollback of Dodd-Frank regulations contributed to the bank's failure.[401] At the beginning of the 118th Congress, Biden and congressional Republicans engaged in a standoff after the U.S. hit its debt limit, which raised the risk that the U.S. would default on its debt.[402] Biden and House speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a deal to raise the debt limit, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which suspended the debt limit until January 2025. Biden signed it on June 3, averting a default.[403] The deal was generally seen as favorable to Biden.[404][405] Biden extended the COVID-19 student loan pause through September 2023, with an \"on ramp\" period that extended some of the pause's protections against credit reporting, collection efforts, and late payment fees through September 30, 2024.[406] The Biden administration's attempts to implement student loan forgiveness and relief programs have faced legal challenges from a coalition of Republican-led states.[407] By the end of 2021, 40 of Biden's nominees to the federal judiciary had been confirmed, more than any president in his first year in office since Ronald Reagan.[408] Biden has prioritized diversity in his judicial appointments more than any president in U.S. history, with most of his appointees being women and people of color.[409] In January 2022, Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer, a moderate liberal nominated by Bill Clinton, announced his intention to retire from the Supreme Court. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if a vacancy occurred,[410] a promise he reiterated after Breyer announced his retirement.[411] On February 25, Biden nominated federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.[412] She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on April 7[413] and sworn in on June 30.[414] By May 2024, Biden had confirmed more than 200 federal judges, about two-thirds of them women.[415] In July 2024, during a speech at the LBJ Presidential Library, Biden expressed interest in judicial term limits and a binding ethics code for Supreme Court justices.[416] As part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, in late March 2021, he proposed the American Jobs Plan, a $2 trillion package addressing issues including transport infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, broadband infrastructure, housing, schools, manufacturing, research and workforce development.[417][418] After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,[419][420] while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband.[421] Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021.[422] The other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the Build Back Better Act, a $3.5 trillion social spending bill that expands the social safety net and includes major provisions on climate change.[423][424] The bill did not have Republican support, so Democrats attempted to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, but struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin, even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion.[425] After Manchin rejected the bill,[426] the Build Back Better Act's size was reduced. It was comprehensively reworked into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform.[427] The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was introduced by senators Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin.[428][429] The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and climate change, $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and tax reform.[430] According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower U.S. greenhouse gas emissions between 31 percent and 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.[431] On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51–50 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. The bill was passed by the House on August 12[431] and was signed by Biden on August 16.[432][433] Before and during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the European Union cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort.[434] Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024.[435] Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The two countries are responsible for 40 percent of global emissions.[436] In July 2023, when the 2023 heat waves hit the U.S., Biden announced several measures to protect the population and said the heat waves were linked to climate change.[437][438] In April 2024, Biden unveiled a plan to protect and restore natural water sources (3.2 million hectares of wetlands and 161,000 km of rivers and streams).[439] Illegal border crossings at the Mexico–United States border began to surge in 2021 when Biden assumed office,[440][441][442][443] following a pandemic-era lull, amid a global rise in migration. From 2021 to 2023, they increased to record highs, reaching an all-time monthly high in December 2023.[444][445] Throughout 2024, crossings began to significantly decline from the December record, after Biden implemented restrictions on asylum claims from migrants who cross the border between ports of entry and urged Mexico to crack down on migrants.[446][447][448] He has also used humanitarian parole to an unprecedented degree to mitigate illegal border crossings, allowing migrants to fly into the U.S. or schedule their entries through official entry points in the U.S.-Mexico border. Over a million migrants have been admitted to the U.S. under humanitarian parole as of January 2024.[449][450][451] In January 2024, Biden expressed support for a proposed bipartisan immigration deal led by Senators Kyrsten Sinema and James Lankford.[452][453] The proposed bill would allow DHS to close the border when encounters reach a seven-day average of 5,000 or exceed 8,500 in a single day.[454][455] In addition, the bill mandates the detention of migrants seeking asylum and undergoing asylum interviews, with those failing the process repatriated to their home countries.[456] While not addressing the status of \"Dreamers\", it would change immigration law to allow the children of those with H-1B visas to get work authorizations and freeze their legal ages while waiting for green cards, rather than face deportation once they hit age 21, and would provide additional funding for immigration judges.[457] In late January, former president Donald Trump announced his opposition to the legislation, calling on Congressional Republicans to oppose it; subsequently, leaders such as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson announced their opposition, halting further legislative action.[458][459] As a result of continued high immigration levels throughout his tenure, some lawmakers and pundits have criticized Biden's handling of the southern border.[460][461][462] Criticism of the bill and broader immigration policy continued to be expressed by both sides, with some liberals considering his policies too harsh while some conservatives considered them too lax.[463][464] In the final year of his presidency, the Biden administration worked to extend at least 14 contracts with private prison companies to run immigrant detention centers, despite his 2020 campaign promise to end the practice.[465] On October 6, 2022, Biden pardoned all Americans convicted of \"small\" amounts of cannabis possession under federal law.[466] On December 22, 2023, he pardoned Americans for cannabis use or possession on federal lands regardless of whether they had been charged or prosecuted.[467][468] On December 12, 2024, in the largest single-day clemency act in history, Biden granted clemency to about 1,500 nonviolent felons in home confinement who had previously been released from prison.[469][470] The act generated controversy, as it included felons such as Michael Conahan, a judge involved in the kids for cash kickback scandal, and Rita Crundwell, a comptroller responsible for the single largest municipal fraud in U.S. history. The Biden administration said the offenders who received clemency \"deserve a second chance\" and were selected based on meeting certain criteria in a uniform decision.[471][472] On December 1, 2024, Biden issued a \"full and unconditional\" pardon to Hunter Biden that covered all federal offenses Hunter committed or may have committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024. The pardon's sweeping extent was \"unprecedented\",[473] with legal experts citing Richard Nixon as the only other person given similar terms for a pardon, for his tenure as president from 1969 to 1974.[474][475][476][64] According to Reason magazine, Hunter Biden's pardon was even more far-reaching than Nixon's or other \"controversial\"[473] pardons: The Hunter pardon is far more comprehensive...in that it covered not just his convictions for drug-related activities and tax fraud, but any other criminal behavior since 2014—the year that Hunter joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. It has been alleged that Hunter's job was essentially to trade on the family name and sell his access to dad. This may not have been illegal, but it does mean that the pardon is clearly designed to offer preemptive protection not just to Hunter, but to Joe Biden himself. These features make the pardon unprecedented, though perfectly in line with the president's executive powers. Hunter had been convicted on charges related to tax and gun offenses, after which Joe made numerous promises not to pardon him. He and his staff continued to say that Hunter would not be pardoned as late as November, although internal staff discussions affirmed that the option remained on the table even as Biden said otherwise.[477][478][64] Biden and his family finalized the decision to pardon Hunter without consulting senior staff.[479] In a statement announcing the pardon, Biden said he believed his son was \"selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted\", blaming \"political pressure\" for the collapse of a plea bargain. The plea bargain actually fell apart after the presiding judge asked about its unusual construction.[67][480][481] Biden's pardon came amid incoming December sentencing dates for Hunter for his convictions and concerns about the succeeding Trump administration potentially targeting political rivals for prosecution.[479] No future president can rescind the pardon.[482] Biden also said, \"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.\"[482] Critics called out the pardon for seeming self-serving and corrupt.[483][484] On September 2, 2022, in a nationally broadcast Philadelphia speech, Biden called for a \"battle for the soul of the nation\". Off camera, he called Trump supporters \"semi-fascists\", which Republican commentators denounced.[485][486][487] A predicted Republican wave election did not materialize and the race for U.S. Congress control was much closer than expected, with Republicans securing a slim majority of 222 seats in the House of Representatives,[488][489][490][491] and the Democratic caucus keeping control of the U.S. Senate, with 51 seats, a gain of one seat from the last Congress.[492][b] It was the first midterm election since 1986 in which the party of the incumbent president achieved a net gain in governorships, and the first since 1934 in which the president's party lost no state legislative chambers.[496] Democrats credited Biden for their unexpectedly favorable performance,[497] and he celebrated the results as a strong day for democracy.[498] In June 2021, Biden took his first trip abroad as president. In eight days he visited Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. He attended a G7 summit, a NATO summit, and an EU summit, and held one-on-one talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin.[499] In September 2021, Biden announced AUKUS, a security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ensure \"peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific over the long term\"; the deal included nuclear-powered submarines built for Australia's use, undercutting a prior Australian contract for submarines with France.[500] In February 2021, the Biden administration announced that the United States was ending its support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen and revoked the designation of Yemen's Houthis as terrorists.[501][502] In early February 2022, Biden ordered the counterterrorism raid in northern Syria that resulted in the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the second leader of the Islamic State.[503] In late July, Biden approved the drone strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second leader of Al-Qaeda, and an integral member in the planning of the September 11 attacks.[504] The 2022 OPEC+ oil production cut caused a diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia, widening the rift between the two countries, and threatening a longstanding alliance.[505][506] In August 2024, Biden negotiated and oversaw the 2024 Ankara prisoner exchange, the largest prisoner exchange since the end of the Cold War. It involved the release of 26 people, including American journalist Evan Gershkovich and former United States Marine Paul Whelan. In November 2024, the Biden administration announced that it had helped broker a ceasefire agreement in the Israel–Hezbollah conflict. American forces began withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2020, under the provisions of a February 2020 US-Taliban agreement that set a May 1, 2021, deadline.[507] The Taliban began an offensive on May 1.[508][509] By early July, most American troops in Afghanistan had withdrawn.[349] Biden addressed the withdrawal in July, saying, \"The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.\"[349] On August 15, the Afghan government collapsed under the Taliban offensive, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.[349][510] Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist with evacuating American personnel and Afghan allies.[511] He faced bipartisan criticism for the manner of the withdrawal,[512] with the evacuations described as chaotic and botched.[513][514][515] On August 16, Biden addressed the \"messy\" situation, taking responsibility for it, and admitting that the situation \"unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated\".[510][516] He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be \"dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves\".[516][517] On August 26, a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghans. On August 27, an American drone strike killed two ISIS-K targets, who were \"planners and facilitators\", according to a U.S. Army general.[518] On August 29, another American drone strike killed ten civilians, including seven children. The Defense Department initially claimed the strike was conducted on an Islamic State suicide bomber threatening Kabul Airport, but admitted the suspect was harmless on September 17, calling its killing of civilians \"a tragic mistake\".[519] The U.S. military completed withdrawal from Afghanistan on August 30. Biden called the extraction of over 120,000 Americans, Afghans and other allies \"an extraordinary success\".[520] He acknowledged that up to 200 Americans who wanted to leave did not, despite his August 18 pledge to keep troops in Afghanistan until all Americans who wanted to leave had left.[521] After the withdrawal, the U.S. continued to send aid to Afghanistan, remaining the country's biggest aid donor as of August 2024 and spending at least $20.7 billion post-withdrawal. U.S. funding has helped support the Taliban government and stabilize Afghanistan's economy.[522][523] In February 2022, the Russian Armed Forces under President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. After warning for several weeks that an attack was imminent, Biden responded to the invasion by imposing severe sanctions on Russia and authorizing over $8 billion in weapons shipments to Ukraine.[524][525][526] On April 29, he asked Congress for $33 billion for Ukraine,[527][528] but lawmakers later increased it to about $40 billion.[529][530][531] Biden blamed Putin for the emerging energy and food crises.[532][533][534] On February 20, 2023, four days before the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden visited Kyiv and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[535] While there, he promised more military aid to Ukraine and denounced the war.[536][537][538] In 2022, Congress approved about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine.[539] In October 2023, the Biden administration requested an additional $61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine for the year ahead,[540] but delays in the passage of further aid by the House of Representatives inhibited progress, with the additional $61 billion in aid to Ukraine added in April 2024.[541][542][543] Throughout the conflict, Biden has consistently refused Ukrainian requests to allow them to utilize weapons against Russian military targets inside Russia. An exception was granted in May 2024 for targets in the vicinity of Kharkiv for \"counter-fire\" purposes.[544][545][546][547] The Solomon Islands-China security pact caused alarm in late 2022, as China could build military bases across the South Pacific. Biden sought to strengthen ties with Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the deal, as Anthony Albanese succeeded to the premiership of Australia and Jacinda Ardern's government took a firmer line on Chinese influence.[548][549][550] In a September 2022 interview with 60 Minutes, Biden said that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the event of \"an unprecedented attack\" by the Chinese,[551] which is in contrast to the long-standing U.S. policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" toward China and Taiwan.[552][553][554] The September comments came after three previous comments by Biden that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.[555] Amid increasing tension with China, Biden's administration has repeatedly walked back his statements and asserted that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has not changed.[555][556][552] In late 2022, Biden issued several executive orders and federal rules designed to slow Chinese technological growth, and maintain U.S. leadership over computing, biotech, and clean energy.[557] On February 4, 2023, Biden ordered the United States Air Force to shoot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[558][559] The State Department said the balloon carried antennas and other equipment capable of geolocating communications signals, and similar balloons from China have flown over more than 40 nations.[560] The Chinese government denied that the balloon was a surveillance device, instead claiming it was a civilian (mainly meteorological) airship that had blown off course.[561][562] Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his planned visit to China as the incident further damaged U.S.-China relations.[563][564][565] In May 2024, the Biden administration doubled tariffs on solar cells imported from China and more than tripled tariffs on lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries imported from China.[566] It also raised tariffs on imports of Chinese steel, aluminum, and medical materials.[566] In October 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that devolved into an intensified conflict, jeopardizing the administration's push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.[567] Biden stated his unequivocal support for Israel and condemned the attack by Hamas.[568] He deployed aircraft carriers in the region to deter others from joining the war,[569] and called for an additional $14 billion in military aid to Israel.[570] He later began pressuring Israel to address the growing humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.[571] Biden rejected calls for a ceasefire but said he supported \"humanitarian pauses\" to deliver aid to the people of the Gaza Strip.[572] He asked Israel to pause its invasion of Gaza for at least three days to allow for hostage negotiations; Israel agreed to daily four-hour pauses.[573] He also directed the U.S. military to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.[574] Biden has said he is a Zionist.[575][576] He has faced criticism for his unwavering support for Israel. Officials have urged him to take a harder stance against Israel, criticizing his administration's leniency and support despite the Israeli government's contentious offensive, which has led to significant civilian casualties and humanitarian crises.[577][578][579] Following the killing of Palestinian civilians receiving food aid on February 29, 2024, Biden said the current level of aid flowing into Gaza was insufficient.[580] On March 3, the U.S. military began airdropping food aid into Gaza.[581] Several experts called the U.S. airdrops performative and said they would do little to alleviate the famine in Gaza.[582] As of May 2024, Biden has continued to support Israel during the course of the war despite significant domestic opposition to American involvement in it and subsequent widespread protests. A March 2024 Gallup poll found that a strong majority of Americans disapproved of Israeli conduct during the war.[583] It found that 36% approved \"of the military action Israel has taken in Gaza\" and 55% disapproved.[583] Young Americans have been significantly less supportive of Israel than older generations.[584][585] Beginning in April 2024, widespread Israel–Hamas war protests emerged on university campuses, denouncing Biden.[586] On May 31, 2024, Biden announced his support for an Israeli ceasefire proposal, saying that Hamas was \"no longer capable\" of another large-scale attack.[587][588][589] The proposal, which would establish a permanent ceasefire, release all hostages, and reconstruct the Gaza Strip, was supported by Hamas officials after mediation by Egypt and Qatar.[590][591] The Netanyahu administration responded that Israel's goals regarding \"the destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities\" had not changed and that conditions would need to be met before it would agree to a ceasefire.[592][593][594] In the first year of the war, it was estimated that the Biden administration had sent Israel at least $17.9 billion in military aid, a record.[595] In about the same period, it sent Palestinians $1.2 billion in humanitarian aid.[596] Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Biden expressed support for expanding NATO to cover Sweden and Finland.[597][598] On August 9, 2022, he signed the instruments of ratification stipulating U.S. support for the two countries' entry into NATO.[599][600] Finnish ascension occurred on April 4, 2023, but opposition by Turkey and Hungary to Swedish entry led to a stalemate.[601] Biden led diplomatic talks resulting in formal Swedish ascension into NATO on March 7, 2024.[602][603] He has also expressed openness to Ukrainian entry into NATO following the end of the conflict,[604] supporting an expedited timetable in its ascension and the removal of steps such as the Membership Action Plan typically required for NATO entry.[605][606] On November 2, 2022, while packing files at the Penn Biden Center, Biden's attorneys found classified documents dating from his vice presidency in a \"locked closet\".[607][608] According to the White House, the documents were reported that day to the U.S. National Archives, which recovered them the next day.[608] On November 14, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed U.S. attorney John R. Lausch Jr. to conduct an investigation.[609][610] On December 20, a second batch of classified documents was discovered in the garage of Biden's Wilmington, Delaware residence.[611] The findings broke news on January 9, 2023, after CBS News published an article on the Lausch investigation.[608][612][613] On January 12, Garland appointed Robert K. Hur as special counsel to investigate \"possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or other records\".[614] On January 20, after a 13-hour consensual search by FBI investigators, six more items with classified markings were recovered from Biden's Wilmington residence.[615] FBI agents searched Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach on February 1 and collected papers and notes from his time as vice president, but did not find any classified information.[616] On February 8, 2024, Hur concluded the special counsel investigation and announced that no charges would be brought against Biden.[617] On January 11, 2023, the House of Representatives launched an investigative committee into the foreign business activities of Biden's son, Hunter, and brother, James.[618] The committee's chair, Representative James Comer, simultaneously investigated alleged corruption related to the Hunter Biden laptop controversy.[619] On September 12, House speaker Kevin McCarthy initiated a formal impeachment inquiry against Biden, saying that the recent House investigations \"paint a picture of corruption\" by Biden and his family.[620][621][622][623] Congressional investigations, most notably by the House Oversight committee, have discovered no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden as of December 2023.[624][625][626][627] On December 13, 2023, the House of Representatives voted 221–212 to formalize an impeachment inquiry into Biden.[628][629][630] In February 2024, Alexander Smirnov, a former intelligence informant who was prominent in the bribery allegations against Biden, was charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).[631] Smirnov admitted he had publicized a false story given to him by Russian intelligence officials with the goal of damaging Biden's reelection campaign.[632][633][634] Ending months of speculation,[635][636] on April 25, 2023, Biden confirmed he would run for reelection as president in the 2024 election, with Harris again as his running mate. The campaign launched four years to the day after the start of his 2020 presidential campaign.[637] On the day of his announcement, a Gallup poll found that Biden's approval rating was 37 percent, with most of those surveyed saying the economy was their biggest concern.[638] During his campaign, Biden promoted higher economic growth and recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic.[639][640] He frequently stated his intention to \"finish the job\" as a political rallying cry.[637][641][642] U.S. Representative Dean Phillips ran against Biden in the 2024 Democratic presidential primaries.[643] Biden was not on the ballot in the January 23 New Hampshire primary, but won it in a write-in campaign with 63.8% of the vote to Phillips's 19.6%.[644] He had wanted South Carolina to be the first primary, and won that state on February 3 with 96.2% of the vote.[645] Biden received 89.3% of the vote in Nevada and 81.1% of the vote in Michigan, with \"none of these candidates\" and \"uncommitted\" coming in second in each state, respectively. On March 5 (\"Super Tuesday\"), he won 15 of 16 primaries, netting 80% or more of the vote in 13 of them.[646][647] On March 6, Phillips suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden.[648] On March 12, Biden reached more than the 1,968 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination, becoming the presumptive nominee.[649][650] The first presidential debate was held on June 27, 2024, between Biden and Trump. Biden's performance was widely criticized, with commentators saying he frequently lost his train of thought and gave meandering answers.[651][652][653] Several newspaper columnists declared Trump the winner,[654][655][656][657] and polling indicated the majority of debate watchers believed Trump won.[658] After the debate raised questions about his health and age, Biden faced calls to withdraw from the race, including from fellow Democrats[659] and the editorial boards of several major news outlets.[660][661] Biden initially insisted that he would remain a candidate,[662] but on July 21, he withdrew his candidacy, writing that this was \"in the best interest of my party and the country\".[663][664] He endorsed Harris as his successor.[665][666] His announcement came 29 days before the beginning of the 2024 Democratic National Convention.[667][668] On August 6, 2024, Harris was confirmed as the Democratic presidential nominee after securing 99% of the delegates in a virtual roll call vote.[669] This was the first time an eligible incumbent had declined to run for reelection since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968.[670] In the general election, Trump defeated Harris, flipping six states Biden had won in 2020. The Senate went Republican for the first time since 2018. In a nationally televised speech after the election, Biden congratulated Trump and promised a \"peaceful and orderly\" transition of power.[671] As a senator, Biden was regarded as a moderate Democrat.[672] As a presidential nominee, Biden's platform had been called the most progressive of any major party platform in history, although not within his party's ideological vanguard.[673] Biden says his positions are deeply influenced by Catholic social teaching.[674][675][676] According to political scientist Carlo Invernizzi Accetti, \"it has become second nature to describe his politics with such ready-made labels as centrist or moderate.\"[677] Accetti says that Biden represents an Americanized form of Christian democracy, taking positions characteristic of both the center-right and center-left.[677] Biden has cited the Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain, credited with starting the Christian democratic movement, as immensely influential in his thinking.[678] Other analysts have likened his ideology to traditional liberalism, \"a doctrine of liberty, equality, justice and individual rights that relies, in the modern age, on a strong federal government for enforcement\".[679][680] Such analysts distinguish liberals, who believe in a regulated market economy, from the left, who believe in greater economic intervention or a planned economy.[679][680] In 2022, journalist Sasha Issenberg wrote that Biden's \"most valuable political skill\" was \"an innate compass for the ever-shifting mainstream of the Democratic Party\".[681] Biden has proposed partially reversing the corporate tax cuts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying that doing so would not hurt businesses' ability to hire.[682][683] He supported raising the corporate tax only up to 28% from the 21% established in the 2017 bill, not back to 35%, the corporate tax rate until 2017.[684] He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).[685] as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[686] Biden is a staunch supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).[687][688] He has promoted a plan to expand and build upon it, paid for by revenue gained from reversing some Trump administration tax cuts.[687] Biden's plan aims to expand health insurance coverage to 97% of Americans, including by creating a public health insurance option.[689] Biden did not support national same-sex marriage rights while in the Senate and voted for the Defense of Marriage Act,[690] but opposed proposals for constitutional amendments that would have banned same-sex marriage nationwide.[691] Biden has supported same-sex marriage since 2012.[103][692] As a senator, Biden forged deep relationships with police groups and was a chief proponent of a Police Officer's Bill of Rights measure that police unions supported but police chiefs opposed.[693][694] In 2020, Biden also ran on decriminalizing cannabis,[695] after advocating harsher penalties for drug use as a U.S. senator.[696][697] Biden believes action must be taken on climate change. As a senator, he co-sponsored the Boxer–Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate.[698] Biden supports nature conservation. According to a report from the Center for American Progress, he broke several records in this domain.[699] He took steps to protect old-growth forests.[700] Biden opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[701] He wants to achieve a carbon-free power sector in the U.S. by 2035 and stop emissions completely by 2050.[702] His program includes reentering the Paris Agreement, green building and more.[703] Biden supports environmental justice, including climate justice and ocean justice.[704][705] A major step is increasing energy efficiency, water efficiency and resilience to climate disasters in low-income houses for mitigate climate change, reduce costs, improve health and safety.[706][707] Biden has called global temperature rise above the 1.5 degree limit the \"only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a nuclear war\".[708] Despite his clean energy policies and congressional Republicans characterizing them as a \"War on American Energy\", domestic oil production reached a record high in October 2023.[709] Biden has said the U.S. needs to \"get tough\" on China, calling it the \"most serious competitor\" that poses challenges to the United States' \"prosperity, security, and democratic values\".[710][711] Biden has spoken about human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region to the Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, pledging to sanction and commercially restrict Chinese government officials and entities who carry out repression.[712][713] Biden has said he is against regime change but is for providing non-military support to opposition movements.[714] He opposed direct U.S. intervention in Libya,[715][230] voted against U.S. participation in the Gulf War,[716] voted in favor of the Iraq War,[717] and supports a two-state solution in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[718] Biden has pledged to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and to reevaluate the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia.[271] Biden supports extending the New START arms control treaty with Russia to limit the number of nuclear weapons deployed by both sides.[719][720] In 2021, Biden officially recognized the Armenian genocide, becoming the first U.S. president to do so.[721][c] Biden has supported abortion rights throughout his presidency, though he personally opposes abortion because of his Catholic faith.[724][725] In 2019, he said he supported Roe v. Wade and repealing the Hyde Amendment.[726][727] After Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, he criticized near-total bans on abortion access passed in a majority of Republican-controlled states,[728] and took measures to protect abortion rights in the United States.[729] He has vowed to sign a bill codifying the protections of Roe into federal law; such a bill passed the House in 2022, but was unable to clear the Senate filibuster.[730][731] Biden was consistently ranked one of the least wealthy members of the Senate,[732][733] which he attributed to having been elected young.[734] Feeling that less-wealthy public officials may be tempted to accept contributions in exchange for political favors, he proposed campaign finance reform measures during his first term.[93] As of November 2009[update], Biden's net worth was $27,012.[735] By November 2020[update], the Bidens were worth $9 million, largely due to sales of Biden's books and speaking fees after his vice presidency.[736][737] Political columnist David S. Broder wrote that Biden has grown over time: \"He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much, much better.\"[33] Journalist James Traub has written that \"Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself\".[132] In recent years, especially after the 2015 death of his elder son Beau, Biden has been noted for his empathetic nature and ability to communicate about grief.[738][739] In 2020, CNN wrote that his presidential campaign aimed to make him \"healer-in-chief\", while The New York Times described his extensive history of being called upon to give eulogies.[740] Journalist and TV anchor Wolf Blitzer has called Biden loquacious;[741] journalist Mark Bowden has said that he is famous for \"talking too much\", leaning in close \"like an old pal with something urgent to tell you\".[298] He often deviates from prepared remarks,[742] and sometimes \"puts his foot in his mouth\".[168][743][744] Biden has a reputation for being prone to gaffes,[745] and in 2018 called himself \"a gaffe machine\".[746][747] The New York Times wrote that Biden's \"weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything\".[168] According to The New York Times, Biden often embellishes elements of his life or exaggerates, a trait also noted by The New Yorker in 2014.[748][749] For instance, he has claimed to have been more active in the civil rights movement than he actually was, and has falsely recalled being an excellent student who earned three college degrees.[748] The Times wrote, \"Mr. Biden's folksiness can veer into folklore, with dates that don't quite add up and details that are exaggerated or wrong, the factual edges shaved off to make them more powerful for audiences.\"[749] Biden is the oldest sitting president in U.S. history.[750] During his presidency, Republicans and media pundits have raised questions about his cognitive health in reaction to his public speaking. These narratives were amplified and widely covered by the media after his weak performance in a June 2024 presidential debate.[751] Biden has repeatedly said he is fit for the presidency.[752] On July 21, 2022, Biden tested positive for COVID-19 with reportedly mild symptoms.[753][754] According to the White House, he was treated with Paxlovid.[754][755] He worked in isolation in the White House for five days[756] and returned to isolation when he tested positive again on July 30, 2022.[757][758] On July 17, 2024, Biden again tested positive for COVID-19.[759][760] According to Morning Consult polling, Biden maintained an approval rating above 50% during his presidency's first eight months. In August 2021, it began to decline, reaching the low forties by December.[761] This was attributed to the Afghanistan withdrawal, increasing hospitalizations from the Delta variant, high inflation and gas prices, disarray within the Democratic Party, and a general decline in popularity customary in politics.[762][763][764][765] In 2023, Biden's approval rating was the lowest of any modern[d] U.S. president's after three years in office.[766] The Gallup Organization found Biden's approval ratings to be consistently above 50% during his first few months in office,[767][768] but by August his ratings began to decline.[769] He had a 98% approval rating from Democrats in February 2021, but by December only 78% approved of his presidency.[770][767] By October 2023, his rating among Democrats had reached a record low of 75%.[766][771] His approval rating among Republicans has been consistently in the single digits, aside from his first few months in office.[770] Additionally, Gallup noted that Biden's public support eroded each year he was in office: he averaged 49% approval in his first year,[772] 41% in his second,[773] and 40% in his third.[774] In July 2024, just before he withdrew from the 2024 presidential election, Gallup found his approval rating had fallen to an all-time low of 36%.[775] Nine men have portrayed Biden on Saturday Night Live, starting with Kevin Nealon in 1991. Jason Sudeikis portrayed Biden during the 2008 election season and reprised the role many times. During the 2020 election season, Biden was played by John Mulaney, Alex Moffat, Mikey Day, Woody Harrelson, and Jim Carrey. In 2024, Dana Carvey played the role.[776][777] In 2016, Greg Kinnear portrayed Biden in the HBO television film Confirmation, about the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings.[778]",

                "content": "Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the first of four children of Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden and Joseph Robinette Biden, Sr. In 1953, the Biden family moved to Claymont, Delaware. President Biden graduated from the University of Delaware and Syracuse Law School and served on the New Castle County Council. At age 29, President Biden became one of the youngest people ever elected to the United States Senate. Just weeks after his Senate election, tragedy struck the Biden family when his wife Neilia and daughter Naomi were killed, and sons Hunter and Beau were critically injured, in an auto accident. Biden was sworn into the U.S. Senate at his sons’ hospital bedsides and began commuting from Wilmington to Washington every day, first by car, and then by train, in order to be with his family. He would continue to do so throughout his time in the Senate. Biden married Jill Jacobs in 1977, and in 1980, their family was complete with the birth of Ashley Blazer Biden. A lifelong educator, Jill earned her doctorate in education and returned to teaching as an English professor at a community college in Virginia. Beau Biden, Attorney General of Delaware and Joe Biden’s eldest son, passed away in 2015 after battling brain cancer with the same integrity, courage, and strength he demonstrated every day of his life. Beau’s fight with cancer inspires the mission of President Biden’s life — ending cancer as we know it. As a Senator from Delaware for 36 years, President Biden established himself as a leader in facing some of our nation’s most important domestic and international challenges. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for 16 years, Biden is widely recognized for his work writing and spearheading the Violence Against Women Act — the landmark legislation that strengthens penalties for violence against women, creates unprecedented resources for survivors of assault, and changes the national dialogue on domestic and sexual assault. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years, Biden played a pivotal role in shaping U.S. foreign policy. He was at the forefront of issues and legislation related to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, post-Cold War Europe, the Middle East, Southwest Asia, and ending apartheid. As Vice President, Biden continued his leadership on important issues facing the nation and represented our country abroad. Vice President Biden convened sessions of the President’s Cabinet, led interagency efforts, and worked with Congress in his fight to raise the living standards of middle-class Americans, reduce gun violence, address violence against women, and end cancer as we know it. Biden helped President Obama pass and then oversaw the implementation of the Recovery Act — the biggest economic recovery plan in the history of the nation and our biggest and strongest commitment to clean energy. The President’s plan prevented another Great Depression, created and saved millions of jobs, and led to 75 uninterrupted months of job growth by the end of the administration. And Biden did it all with less than 1% in waste, abuse, or fraud — the most efficient government program in our country’s history. President Obama and Vice President Biden also secured the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which reduced the number of uninsured Americans by 20 million by the time they left office and banned insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions. He served as the point person for U.S. diplomacy throughout the Western Hemisphere, strengthened relationships with our allies both in Europe and the Asia-Pacific, and led the effort to bring 150,000 troops home from Iraq. In a ceremony at the White House, President Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction — the nation’s highest civilian honor. Joe Biden and Barack Obama both in dark suits, holding each other and smilingBarack Obama announces Biden as his vice-presidential running mate in Springfield, Illinois After leaving the White House, the Bidens continued their efforts to expand opportunity for every American with the creation of the Biden Foundation, the Biden Cancer Initiative, the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, and the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware. On April 25, 2019, Biden announced his candidacy for President of the United States. Biden’s candidacy was built from the beginning around 3 pillars: the battle for the soul of our nation, the need to rebuild our middle class — the backbone of our country, and a call for unity, to act as One America. It was a message that would only gain more resonance in 2020 as we confront a pandemic, an economic crisis, urgent calls for racial justice, and the existential threat of climate change.

                "content": "Cryptocurrency sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, refers to digital or virtual currency that utilizes cryptographic techniques for secure transactions. It exists solely in electronic form, independent of any central authority, and operates on decentralized networks, such as blockchain technology. Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It’s a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets. Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety. The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was founded in 2009 and remains the best known today. Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward. Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders. Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from brokers, then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets. If you own cryptocurrency, you don’t own anything tangible. What you own is a key that allows you to move a record or a unit of measure from one person to another without a trusted third party. Although Bitcoin has been around since 2009, cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain technology are still emerging in financial terms, and more uses are expected in the future. Transactions including bonds, stocks, and other financial assets could eventually be traded using the technology. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies. Some of the best known include: Bitcoin: Founded in 2009, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the most commonly traded. The currency was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto – widely believed to be a pseudonym for an individual or group of people whose precise identity remains unknown. Ethereum: Developed in 2015, Ethereum is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency, called Ether (ETH) or Ethereum. It is the most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Litecoin: This currency is most similar to bitcoin but has moved more quickly to develop new innovations, including faster payments and processes to allow more transactions. Ripple: Ripple is a distributed ledger system that was founded in 2012. Ripple can be used to track different kinds of transactions, not just cryptocurrency. The company behind it has worked with various banks and financial institutions. Tether (USDT): Launched in 2014, Tether is a stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, providing stability in the volatile cryptocurrency market. It is widely used as a trading pair on exchanges. Binance Coin (BNB): Binance Coin was created in 2017 as the native token of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. It offers reduced trading fees and can be used for various purposes within the Binance ecosystem. Solana (SOL): Developed in 2017, Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform that utilizes proof-of-history (PoH) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms to achieve fast transaction speeds and low fees. US Dollar Coin (USDC): US Dollar Coin, launched in 2018, is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar and issued by Circle. It is fully backed by US dollar reserves held in regulated financial institutions. Dogecoin (DOGE): Created in 2013 as a meme-inspired cryptocurrency, Dogecoin has gained popularity due to its low price and endorsements from prominent figures. It is often used for tipping content creators and charitable donations. Cardano (ADA): Launched in 2017, Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform that aims to address scalability, interoperability, and sustainability issues. It uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros. Non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies are collectively known as \"altcoins\" to distinguish them from the original. You may be wondering how to buy cryptocurrency safely. There are typically three steps involved. These are: Step 1: Choosing a platform The first step is deciding which platform to use. Generally, you can choose between a traditional broker or dedicated cryptocurrency exchange: When comparing different platforms, consider which cryptocurrencies are on offer, what fees they charge, their security features, storage and withdrawal options, and any educational resources. Step 2: Funding your account Once you have chosen your platform, the next step is to fund your account so you can begin trading. Most crypto exchanges allow users to purchase crypto using fiat (i.e., government-issued) currencies such as the US Dollar, the British Pound, or the Euro using their debit or credit cards – although this varies by platform. Crypto purchases with credit cards are considered risky, and some exchanges don't support them. Some credit card companies don't allow crypto transactions either. This is because cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and it is not advisable to risk going into debt — or potentially paying high credit card transaction fees — for certain assets. Some platforms will also accept ACH transfers and wire transfers. The accepted payment methods and time taken for deposits or withdrawals differ per platform. Equally, the time taken for deposits to clear varies by payment method. An important factor to consider is fees. These include potential deposit and withdrawal transaction fees plus trading fees. Fees will vary by payment method and platform, which is something to research at the outset. Step 3: Placing an order You can place an order via your broker's or exchange's web or mobile platform. If you are planning to buy cryptocurrencies, you can do so by selecting \"buy,\" choosing the order type, entering the amount of cryptocurrencies you want to purchase, and confirming the order. The same process applies to \"sell\" orders. There are also other ways to invest in crypto. These include payment services like PayPal, Cash App, and Venmo, which allow users to buy, sell, or hold cryptocurrencies. In addition, there are the following investment vehicles: The best option for you will depend on your investment goals and risk appetite. Once you have purchased cryptocurrency, you need to store it safely to protect it from hacks or theft. Usually, cryptocurrency is stored in crypto wallets, which are physical devices or online software used to store the private keys to your cryptocurrencies securely. Some exchanges provide wallet services, making it easy for you to store directly through the platform. However, not all exchanges or brokers automatically provide wallet services for you. There are different wallet providers to choose from. The terms “hot wallet” and “cold wallet” are used: Typically, cold wallets tend to charge fees, while hot wallets don't. When it was first launched, Bitcoin was intended to be a medium for daily transactions, making it possible to buy everything from a cup of coffee to a computer or even big-ticket items like real estate. That hasn’t quite materialized and, while the number of institutions accepting cryptocurrencies is growing, large transactions involving it are rare. Even so, it is possible to buy a wide variety of products from e-commerce websites using crypto. Here are some examples: Technology and e-commerce sites: Several companies that sell tech products accept crypto on their websites, such as newegg.com, AT&T, and Microsoft. Overstock, an e-commerce platform, was among the first sites to accept Bitcoin. Shopify, Rakuten, and Home Depot also accept it. Luxury goods: Some luxury retailers accept crypto as a form of payment. For example, online luxury retailer Bitdials offers Rolex, Patek Philippe, and other high-end watches in return for Bitcoin. Cars: Some car dealers – from mass-market brands to high-end luxury dealers – already accept cryptocurrency as payment. Insurance: In April 2021, Swiss insurer AXA announced that it had begun accepting Bitcoin as a mode of payment for all its lines of insurance except life insurance (due to regulatory issues). Premier Shield Insurance, which sells home and auto insurance policies in the US, also accepts Bitcoin for premium payments. If you want to spend cryptocurrency at a retailer that doesn’t accept it directly, you can use a cryptocurrency debit card, such as BitPay in the US. Unfortunately, cryptocurrency crime is on the rise. Cryptocurrency scams include: Fake websites: Bogus sites which feature fake testimonials and crypto jargon promising massive, guaranteed returns, provided you keep investing. Virtual Ponzi schemes: Cryptocurrency criminals promote non-existent opportunities to invest in digital currencies and create the illusion of huge returns by paying off old investors with new investors’ money. One scam operation, BitClub Network, raised more than $700 million before its perpetrators were indicted in December 2019. \"Celebrity\" endorsements: Scammers pose online as billionaires or well-known names who promise to multiply your investment in a virtual currency but instead steal what you send. They may also use messaging apps or chat rooms to start rumours that a famous businessperson is backing a specific cryptocurrency. Once they have encouraged investors to buy and driven up the price, the scammers sell their stake, and the currency reduces in value. Romance scams: The FBI warns of a trend in online dating scams, where tricksters persuade people they meet on dating apps or social media to invest or trade in virtual currencies. The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Centre fielded more than 1,800 reports of crypto-focused romance scams in the first seven months of 2021, with losses reaching $133 million. Otherwise, fraudsters may pose as legitimate virtual currency traders or set up bogus exchanges to trick people into giving them money. Another crypto scam involves fraudulent sales pitches for individual retirement accounts in cryptocurrencies. Then there is straightforward cryptocurrency hacking, where criminals break into the digital wallets where people store their virtual currency to steal it. Cryptocurrencies are usually built using blockchain technology. Blockchain describes the way transactions are recorded into \"blocks\" and time stamped. It's a fairly complex, technical process, but the result is a digital ledger of cryptocurrency transactions that's hard for hackers to tamper with. In addition, transactions require a two-factor authentication process. For instance, you might be asked to enter a username and password to start a transaction. Then, you might have to enter an authentication code sent via text to your personal cell phone. While securities are in place, that does not mean cryptocurrencies are un-hackable. Several high-dollar hacks have cost cryptocurrency start-ups heavily. Hackers hit Coincheck to the tune of $534 million and BitGrail for $195 million, making them two of the biggest cryptocurrency hacks of 2018. Unlike government-backed money, the value of virtual currencies is driven entirely by supply and demand. This can create wild swings that produce significant gains for investors or big losses. And cryptocurrency investments are subject to far less regulatory protection than traditional financial products like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. According to Consumer Reports, all investments carry risk, but some experts consider cryptocurrency to be one of the riskier investment choices out there. If you are planning to invest in cryptocurrencies, these tips can help you make educated choices. Research exchanges: Before you invest, learn about cryptocurrency exchanges. It’s estimated that there are over 500 exchanges to choose from. Do your research, read reviews, and talk with more experienced investors before moving forward. Know how to store your digital currency: If you buy cryptocurrency, you have to store it. You can keep it on an exchange or in a digital wallet. While there are different kinds of wallets, each has its benefits, technical requirements, and security. As with exchanges, you should investigate your storage choices before investing. Diversify your investments: Diversification is key to any good investment strategy, and this holds true when you are investing in cryptocurrency. Don't put all your money in Bitcoin, for example, just because that's the name you know. There are thousands of options, and it's better to spread your investment across several currencies. Prepare for volatility: The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, so be prepared for ups and downs. You will see dramatic swings in prices. If your investment portfolio or mental wellbeing can't handle that, cryptocurrency might not be a wise choice for you. Cryptocurrency is all the rage right now, but remember, it is still in its relative infancy and is considered highly speculative. Investing in something new comes with challenges, so be prepared. If you plan to participate, do your research, and invest conservatively to start. One of the best ways you can stay safe online is by using a comprehensive antivirus. Kaspersky Premium defends you from malware infections, spyware, data theft and protects your online payments using bank-grade encryption. Related articles: © 2024 AO Kaspersky Lab",

                "title": "Stephen Curry - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Wardell Stephen Curry II (/ˈstɛfən/ STEF-ən;[1] born March 14, 1988) is an American professional basketball player and point guard for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Near-unanimously considered the greatest shooter of all time,[2][3] Curry is credited with revolutionizing the sport by inspiring teams and players at all levels to more prominently utilize the three-point shot.[4][5][6][7] He is a four-time NBA champion, a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), an NBA Finals MVP, an NBA All-Star Game MVP, an NBA Clutch Player of the Year, and the inaugural NBA Western Conference finals MVP. He is also a two-time NBA scoring champion, a ten-time NBA All-Star, and a ten-time All-NBA selection (including four on the First Team). Internationally, he has won two gold medals at the FIBA World Cup and a gold medal at the 2024 Summer Olympics as part of the U.S. men's national team. Curry is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and the older brother of current NBA player Seth Curry. He played collegiately for the Davidson Wildcats, where he set career scoring records for Davidson and the Southern Conference, and helped the Wildcats advance to the Elite Eight in 2008. He was named Conference Player of the Year twice, and set the NCAA single-season record for three-pointers made (162) during his sophomore year. Curry was selected by the Warriors as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft. In 2014–15, Curry won his first league MVP award and led the Warriors to their first championship since 1975. The following season, he became the first player to be elected MVP by a unanimous vote and lead the league in scoring while shooting above 50–40–90. That same year, the Warriors broke the record for the most wins in a regular season in NBA history (73) en route to the 2016 NBA Finals, which they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 7. Curry helped the Warriors win back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018, and reach the 2019 NBA Finals, losing to the Toronto Raptors in six games. Following injury struggles and missed playoff appearances in 2020 and 2021, Curry won his fourth championship with the Warriors and first Finals MVP award, defeating the Boston Celtics in the 2022 NBA Finals. The same season, he became the all-time leader in three-pointers made in NBA history, surpassing Ray Allen.[8] Curry is the holder of numerous other records, notably for his efficiency and three-point shooting. He has the highest career free-throw percentage in NBA history (91.0%) and has led the league in three-pointers made a record eight times. In 2013, he set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season with 272, surpassed that record in 2015 (286), and again in 2016 (402). Curry was born on March 14, 1988,[9] at the Akron General Medical Center in Akron, Ohio, to Sonya (née Adams) and Dell Curry.[10][11] He grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father spent most of his NBA career with the Charlotte Hornets.[11][12] Dell often took Curry and his younger brother Seth to his games, where they would shoot with the Hornets during warm-ups.[13] The family briefly moved to Toronto, where Dell finished out his career as a member of the Raptors.[12] During this time, Curry played for the Queensway Christian College boys' basketball team, leading them to an undefeated season.[14][15] He was also a member of Toronto 5–0, a club team that plays across Ontario,[16][17] pitting him against fellow future NBA players Cory Joseph and Kelly Olynyk.[17] Curry led the team to a 33–4 record, en route to winning the provincial championship.[18] After Dell's retirement, the family moved back to Charlotte and Curry enrolled at Charlotte Christian School,[19] where he was named all-conference and all-state, and led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. Because of his father's storied career at Virginia Tech, Curry wanted to play college basketball for the Hokies, but was only offered a walk-on spot due in part to his slender 160-pound frame.[20] He ultimately chose to attend Davidson College, who had aggressively recruited him from the tenth grade.[21] Before Curry even played in his first game for the Wildcats, head coach Bob McKillop praised him at a Davidson alumni event, saying: \"Wait 'til you see Steph Curry. He is something special.\"[22] In his first collegiate game against Eastern Michigan, Curry finished with 15 points but committed 13 turnovers. In the next game against Michigan, he scored 32 points, dished out four assists, and grabbed nine rebounds. Curry finished the season leading the Southern Conference in scoring with 21.5 points per game. He was second in the nation among freshmen in scoring, behind only Kevin Durant of Texas. Curry's scoring helped the Wildcats to a 29–5 overall record and a Southern Conference regular-season title. On March 2, 2007, in the Southern Conference tournament semi-finals against Furman, Curry made his 113th three-point field goal of the year, breaking Keydren Clark's NCAA freshman season record for three-pointers.[23] Curry eclipsed the school freshman scoring record with his 502nd point against Chattanooga on February 6, 2007.[24] On March 15, 2007, Davidson marched into the NCAA tournament as a 13th seed set to play Maryland; despite Curry's game-high 30 points, Davidson lost 82–70.[25] At the end of his freshman season, Curry was named Southern Conference Freshman of the Year, SoCon Tournament MVP, and selected to the SoCon All-tournament team, All-freshman team, and All-SoCon First Team.[26] He was also an honorable mention in Sports Illustrated's All-Mid-Major. After the season ended, he was selected for the USA team to appear at the 2007 FIBA U-19 World Championships in which he averaged 9.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.2 assists in 19.4 minutes, helping Team USA to a silver medal finish.[27] In his sophomore season in 2007–08, Curry had grown to his adult height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) and again led the Southern Conference in scoring, averaging 25.5 points per game while adding 4.7 rebounds per game and 2.8 assists per game. He led the Wildcats to a 26–6 regular-season record and a 20–0 conference record. As a result of Curry's exceptional play, Davidson earned its third straight NCAA tournament bid. On March 21, 2008, Davidson matched up with seventh-seeded Gonzaga. Gonzaga led by 11 points early in the second half but Curry went on to score 30 points in the half[28] to push Davidson to their first NCAA Tournament win since 1969 with a score of 82–76. Curry ended the game with 40 points while also going 8-for-10 from three-point range.[29] On March 23, Davidson played second-seeded Georgetown in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Georgetown was ranked eighth nationally and entered the game as a heavy favorite after an appearance in the Final Four in 2007. Curry managed just five points in the first half of the game as Davidson trailed by as many as 17 points, but his 25 second-half points led Davidson to a 74–70 comeback victory.[28] On March 28, 2008, Curry led Davidson to another win, against third-seeded Wisconsin. Curry scored 33 points as Davidson won 73–56 to advance to the Elite 8.[30] Curry joined Clyde Lovellette, Jerry Chambers, and Glenn Robinson as the only college players to score over 30 points in their first four career NCAA tournament games.[30] Curry also tied Darrin Fitzgerald of Butler for the single-season record for most three-pointers with 158.[31][32] On March 30, 2008, he set the record, against the top-seeded Kansas Jayhawks, with his 159th three-pointer of the season. Curry scored 25 points in the game but Davidson lost 59–57, and the Jayhawks went on to win the championship.[33] Curry finished the season averaging 25.9 points, 2.9 assists, and 2.1 steals per game. He was named to the Associated Press' All-America Second Team on March 31, 2008.[34] He also was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Midwest Region of the 2008 NCAA tournament, becoming the first player from a team not making the Final Four to do so since Juwan Howard of Michigan in 1994.[35] Curry was nominated for an ESPY in the Breakthrough Player of the Year category.[36] After Davidson's loss against Kansas in the NCAA Regional Finals, Curry announced that he would return for his junior year.[31] He stated that he wanted to develop as a point guard, his likely position in the NBA. On November 18, 2008, Curry scored a career-high 44 points in Davidson's 82–78 loss to Oklahoma.[37] He extended a career-long streak by scoring at least 25 points for the seventh straight game.[37] On November 21, Curry registered a career-high 13 assists, to go along with 30 points in Davidson's 97–70 win over Winthrop.[38] On November 25, against Loyola, Curry was held scoreless as Loyola constantly double-teamed him. It was Curry's only scoreless collegiate game and just his second without double-digit points. He finished 0-for-3 from the field as Davidson won the game 78–48.[39] In Davidson's next game 11 days later, Curry matched his career high of 44 in a 72–67 win over North Carolina State.[40] Curry surpassed the 2000-point mark for his career on January 3, 2009, as he scored 21 points against Samford.[41] On February 14, 2009, Curry rolled his ankle in the second half of a win over Furman. The injury caused Curry to miss the February 18 game against The Citadel, the first and only game he missed in his college career.[42] On February 28, 2009, Curry became Davidson's all-time leading scorer with 34 points in a 99–56 win against Georgia Southern. That gave Curry 2,488 points for his career, surpassing previous school leader John Gerdy.[43] Davidson won the 2008–09 Southern Conference regular season championship for the south division, finishing 18–2 in the conference.[44][45] In the 2009 Southern Conference tournament, Davidson played Appalachian State in the quarterfinals and won 84–68. Curry scored 43 points, which is the third most points in Southern Conference tournament history.[46] In the semifinals, against the College of Charleston, Curry had 20 points but Davidson lost 52–59. Despite lobbying from Davidson head coach Bob McKillop and Charleston coach Bobby Cremins,[47] the Wildcats failed to get an NCAA tournament bid. Instead, they received the sixth seed in the 2009 NIT. Davidson played the third seed, South Carolina, on the road in the first round. Curry scored 32 points as the Wildcats beat the Gamecocks 70–63.[48][49] Davidson then lost 80–68 to the Saint Mary's Gaels in the second round. Curry registered 26 points, nine rebounds, and five assists in what was his final game for the Wildcats.[50] In his final season at Davidson, Curry averaged 28.6 points, 5.6 assists, and 2.5 steals. He was the NCAA scoring champion and was named a consensus first team All-American.[51] Curry opted out of his senior year at Davidson, but he stated that he still planned to earn his degree.[52] He completed his bachelor's degree in sociology in May 2022.[53] Curry's completion of his degree qualified him for jersey or number retirement; Davidson reserves that honor for players who complete their degrees at the school. In a ceremony held on August 31, 2022, Curry became the first Davidson player to have his number retired (six others have jerseys retired, but their numbers remain in circulation). At the ceremony, he also entered Davidson's athletic hall of fame and physically received his Davidson diploma.[54][55] On June 25, 2009, his father's 45th birthday, Curry was selected as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors.[56] Although the Warriors already had another lean, 6-foot-3, offensive-minded guard in Monta Ellis, coach Don Nelson had a penchant for using small lineups in his Nellie Ball system, and had warmed to the idea of selecting Curry.[57][58] However, Ellis announced at a media session that he and Curry were too small to play together.[59] Curry appeared in 80 games (77 starts) during the 2009–10 season, averaging 17.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 1.90 steals in 36.2 minutes.[60] His second half of the season vaulted him into the rookie of the year race.[61] He was named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for January, March, and April, finishing as the only Western Conference rookie to win the award three times.[60] He finished runner-up for the NBA Rookie of the Year behind Tyreke Evans[61] and was a unanimous NBA All-Rookie First Team selection, becoming the first Warriors player since Jason Richardson in 2001–02 to earn All-Rookie First Team honors.[60] He scored 30-plus points eight times, setting the most 30-point games by any rookie in 2009–10 and the most since LeBron James had 13 and Carmelo Anthony had 10 in 2003–04. Curry had five 30-point/10-assist games, which tied Michael Jordan for the second-most 30-point/10-assist games by a rookie (Oscar Robertson is first with 25). He became just the sixth rookie in NBA history to post a 35-point, 10-assist, 10-rebound game when he registered his first career triple-double with 36 points, 13 assists, and 10 rebounds against the Los Angeles Clippers on February 10. In the Warriors' season finale against the Portland Trail Blazers on April 14, Curry recorded a then- career-high 42 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, becoming the first rookie since Robertson in February 1961 to register at least those numbers in each category in the same game. Curry finished his rookie season with 166 three-pointers, which were, at the time, the most ever by a rookie in NBA history.[60] In 2010–11, Curry appeared in 74 games (all starts), averaging 18.6 points, 3.9 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 1.47 steals in 33.6 minutes per contest.[60] His free throw percentage of .934 (212–227 FT) set a new Warriors single-season record, surpassing the previous mark of .924 set by Rick Barry in 1977–78. He also became the first Warriors player to lead the NBA in free throw percentage since Mark Price in 1996–97.[60] Curry registered 20-or-more points 35 times, including seven 30-plus performances. He posted a season-high 39 points and a then- career-high 14 made field goals (on 20 attempts) against the Oklahoma City Thunder on December 5. In February 2011, during All-Star Weekend, Curry won the Skills Challenge[62] and registered 13 points, eight assists, and six rebounds in 28 minutes as a member of the Sophomore squad in the Rookie Challenge.[60] In May 2011, he was named the recipient of the NBA Sportsmanship Award,[63] and underwent surgery on his right ankle.[64] In the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, Curry appeared in 26 games (23 starts), averaging 14.7 points, 3.4 rebounds, 5.3 assists, and 1.50 steals in 28.2 minutes per contest. He missed 40 games due to right ankle and foot injuries,[60] including the last 28 games with a sprained right ankle and subsequent surgery on the ankle, which was performed on April 25.[65] In 2012, Golden State included Curry in a trade offer to the Milwaukee Bucks for Andrew Bogut, which the Bucks rejected due to Curry's history with bad ankles. Ellis was traded instead.[66][67][68] According to then- Warriors general manager Larry Riley, they offered Curry with the intention of steering the deal to Ellis.[67] The deal opened an opportunity for Curry to lead the team.[59] Prior to the start of the 2012–13 season, Curry signed a four-year, $44 million contract extension with the Warriors.[69][70] At the time, many basketball writers considered the move risky for Golden State because of Curry's injury history.[71] Over the course of the year, Curry and former backcourt teammate Klay Thompson gained a reputation for their perimeter scoring, earning them the nickname the \"Splash Brothers\".[72] In 2012–13, Curry appeared in 78 games (all starts), averaging then-career highs of 22.9 points (seventh in NBA) and 6.9 assists to go with 4.0 rebounds and 1.62 steals in 38.2 minutes.[60] He set a new NBA single-season three-point record with 272 three-pointers, eclipsing the previous mark set by Ray Allen (269 in 2005–06), doing so on 53 less attempts than Allen did with Seattle.[60] Curry earned Western Conference Player of the Month honors for the month of April. During this time he averaged 25.4 points, 8.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds, and 2.13 steals in eight games in the final month of the season to become the third Warrior to win the award, joining Chris Mullin (November 1990 and January 1989) and Bernard King (January 1981). He tallied two of the NBA's top six scoring games with 54 points on February 27 at New York and 47 on April 12 at Los Angeles, becoming the first Warrior to score 45-plus at New York and Los Angeles in the same season since Rick Barry in 1966, joining Barry, Guy Rodgers, and Wilt Chamberlain as the only four Warriors to do so. Curry's 54 points against the Knicks included a then- career-best and then- franchise-record 11 three-pointers, becoming the first player in NBA history to score 50-plus points while hitting 10-plus three-pointers in a game. It was the most scored by a Warrior since Purvis Short tallied 59 points in 1984. In 2013, he appeared in the playoffs for the first time in his career, with the Warriors earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference. In 12 playoff games (all starts), he averaged 23.4 points, 8.1 assists, and 3.8 rebounds. He set a new franchise record with 42 playoff three-pointers, eclipsing the Warriors' career playoff mark of 29 previously held by Jason Richardson, giving him a total of 314 three-pointers for the season to become the first player in NBA history to make at least 300 three-pointers in a single season.[60] In 2013–14, Curry appeared in 78 games (all starts), averaging career highs of 24.0 points (seventh in the NBA) and 8.5 assists (fifth in the NBA) to go with 4.3 rebounds and 1.63 steals, becoming the first player in Warriors franchise history to average 24 points and eight assists in a single season (ninth player in NBA history). He led the league in three-pointers made for a second consecutive season with 261, becoming the first player since Ray Allen in 2001–02 and 2002–03 to lead the league in three-pointers in back-to-back seasons. He was named Western Conference Player of the Month for April and earned All-NBA Second Team honors, becoming the first Warriors player named to the First or Second Team since 1993–94.[60] On December 7 against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry eclipsed Jason Richardson (700) as the franchise's leader in career three-pointers.[73] In February, he made his first All-Star appearance,[74] becoming the Warriors' first All-Star starter since Latrell Sprewell in 1995.[60] He scored a season-high 47 points on April 13 against the Portland Trail Blazers for his third 40-point game of the year. He finished the regular season tied for second in the NBA in triple-doubles with four, the most by a Warrior in a single season since Chamberlain had five in 1963–64.[60] Seeded sixth for the second consecutive postseason, the Warriors were defeated in seven games by the Los Angeles Clippers.[75] Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, the Warriors hired former NBA player and general manager Steve Kerr as their new head coach.[77] Kerr implemented significant changes to Golden State's schemes, including playing at a faster pace and giving Curry more freedom to shoot, helping the team evolve into a title contender.[78] On February 4, Curry scored a season-high 51 points in a win over the Dallas Mavericks.[79] He was the leading vote-getter for the All-Star Game and won the Three-Point Contest on All-Star Saturday night.[80][81] On April 9, he broke his own league record for three-pointers made in a season during a game against the Portland Trail Blazers.[82] The Warriors finished the year with 67 wins and Curry was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player after posting averages of 23.8 points, 7.7 assists, and 2 steals per game.[83] Over the course of the season, he sat out 17 fourth quarters due to Golden State's wide margins of victory.[84] In Game 5 of the Conference Semifinals against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry became the first player in league history to register six three-pointers and six steals in a game.[85] In Game 6, he made a playoff career-high 8 three-pointers en route to a series-clinching victory.[86] In Game 3 of the Conference Finals against the Houston Rockets, he broke the NBA record for most three-pointers made in a single postseason.[87][88] The Warriors went on to defeat the Rockets to earn a Finals matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers, where Curry struggled to start the series, converting on only 22 percent of his field goals in Game 2.[89] In Game 5, he scored 37 points,[90] and in Game 6, Golden State closed out the series to win their first championship in 40 years.[91] For the Finals, Curry averaged 26 points and 6.3 assists per game.[90] The Warriors' playoff run was the first in which an All-NBA first team selection eliminated all other first team selections en route to a championship.[92] To start the 2015–16 season, Curry became the first player since Michael Jordan in 1989–90 to score 118 points in his team's first three games,[93] including a season-high 53 points against the New Orleans Pelicans in the third game.[94] The Warriors made NBA history on November 24 when they became the first team ever to start 16–0 with a win over the Los Angeles Lakers,[95] before improving to 24–0 on December 11 with a double-overtime win over the Boston Celtics.[96] Their streak was broken the following day against the Milwaukee Bucks.[97] On December 28, Curry recorded his sixth career triple-double with 23 points, a career-high 14 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 122–103 win over the Sacramento Kings.

His 51 points tied Gilbert Arenas and Michael Jordan for the Verizon Center record.[100] During the 2016 NBA All-Star Weekend, Curry competed in his third straight All-Star game for the West, and competed in the Three-Point Contest, where he lost in the final round to former teammate Klay Thompson. At 48–4, the Warriors entered the All-Star break with the best record through 52 games in NBA history, one win better than the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls and 1966–67 Philadelphia 76ers.[101] On February 25, Curry scored 51 points and made 10 three-pointers to lead the Warriors past the Orlando Magic 130–114, becoming the first player to record at least three 50-point games since LeBron James and Dwyane Wade in 2008–09. He also became the first player in NBA history to score at least 50 points in a game with only one free throw attempted.[92] Curry surpassed Kyle Korver's record of 127 consecutive games with a made three-pointer.[102] In the following game, two days later, the Warriors defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in overtime 121–118, owing to a long-distance game-winning shot made by Curry with 0.6 seconds remaining. In doing so, he tied the then- NBA single-game record (12) with Kobe Bryant and Donyell Marshall and finished with 46 points.[103] He also broke his own NBA record for made three-pointers in a season, setting a new mark at 288.[104] In February 2016, Curry averaged over 35 points per game, while shooting at least 50% from both the field and three-point range, becoming the first player in NBA history to achieve this feat in a calendar month.[105] On March 7, in a win over the Magic, Curry scored 41 points and became the first player in NBA history to make 300 regular-season three-pointers.[106] On April 1, Curry missed a three-pointer to tie the game against the Celtics with 5.3 seconds left, as the Warriors suffered their first home defeat since January 27, 2015, snapping an NBA-record 54-game winning streak in the regular season at Oracle Arena.[107] On April 7, Curry scored 27 points to help the Warriors become the second team in NBA history to win 70 games in a season with a 112–101 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[108] Three days later in a rematch against the Spurs, Curry scored 37 points in a 92–86 win, not only tying the 1996 Bulls, but snapping San Antonio's undefeated home streak and also ending a long losing streak in AT&T Center.[109] In the Warriors' regular-season finale on April 13 against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry scored 46 points with 10 made three-pointers, becoming the first player in NBA history to make 400 three-pointers in a season (finishing with 402).[110] With a 125–104 win over the Grizzlies, the Warriors became the first 73-win team in NBA history, surpassing the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls' 72–10 record to finish the 2015–16 season with just nine losses.[111] With the conclusion of the regular season, Curry became the seventh player in NBA history to join the 50–40–90 club and the first to achieve this feat while averaging over 30 points per game.[112][113] Curry led the league in scoring (30.1 points per game), steals (2.14), and free throw percentage (90.8), becoming the first player to lead all three statistics in a season.[114] For his record-breaking season, Curry was named the league's first ever unanimous MVP, becoming the 11th player in history to win the award in consecutive seasons and the first guard to do so since Steve Nash in 2004–05 and 2005–06.[115] His scoring average increase of 6.3 is the largest ever by a reigning MVP.[112] In the 2016 playoffs, the Warriors defeated the Houston Rockets in the first round despite Curry only playing in the first half of Games 1 and 4 due to injury.[116][117][118] A right MCL injury kept him out of the first three games of the second round.[119] In Game 4 of the second-round series against the Portland Trail Blazers, Curry came off the bench to score 40 points in a 132–125 overtime win;[120] 17 of those points came in the extra period, an NBA record for points scored by an individual in overtime.[121] Curry led the Warriors to a 4–1 victory over the Trail Blazers, as they moved on to the Western Conference Finals to face the Oklahoma City Thunder. After going down 3–1, he helped the Warriors rally to win the series 4–3 and advance to their second straight NBA Finals.[122] In the Finals, Curry's play relative to his regular season performance remained inconsistent, as it had been since he returned from injury against Portland;[123] still, he broke Danny Green's record of 27 three-pointers made in a Finals.[124] Despite being up 3–1 in the series, the Warriors were defeated by the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games and became the first team in NBA Finals history to lose a series after leading 3–1.

He had hit a three-pointer in every regular-season game since November 11, 2014.[127] Three days later, he hit 13 three-pointers against New Orleans, becoming the first player in NBA history to make as many three-pointers in a regular-season game.[128] Curry shot 16-of-26 overall against the Pelicans for his first 40-point game of the season, finishing with 46 in a 116–106 win.[129] On December 11, Curry hit 2 three-pointers against the Minnesota Timberwolves to pass Steve Nash for 17th on the NBA's career three-pointers list.[130] With 14 points against the Dallas Mavericks on December 30, Curry (11,903) passed Purvis Short (11,894) for seventh place on the Warriors' all-time scoring list.[131] In a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on January 6, 2017, Curry had his second 40-point game of the season and reached the 12,000-point threshold, becoming the seventh player in Warriors franchise history to score 12,000 career points.[132] On January 19, Curry was named a starter on the Western Conference All-Star team for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game.[133] On February 2, he hit his 200th three-pointer of the season in the Warriors' 133–120 win over the Los Angeles Clippers, making him the first player in NBA history to have 200 or more three-pointers in five consecutive seasons.[134] On March 5, he scored 31 points and moved into the top 10 on the NBA's career three-point list in a 112–105 win over the New York Knicks.

They went up 3–0 in the series, becoming the third team in NBA history to win their first 11 playoff games.[139] His 36 points in Game 4 led to a 129–115 victory that saw the Warriors advance to the NBA Finals for a third straight year while becoming the first team in league history to start the playoffs 12–0.[140] In Game 2 of the 2017 NBA Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Curry recorded his first career postseason triple-double with 32 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds to help the Warriors go up 2–0 in the series with a 132–113 win.[141] Curry helped the Warriors clinch the series and the championship in Game 5 with 34 points, 10 assists, and six rebounds, as Golden State claimed its second title in three years.[142] On July 1, 2017, Curry agreed to a five-year, $201 million extension with the Warriors, becoming the first NBA player to sign a supermax contract worth over $200 million.[143] He officially signed the contract on July 25.[144] On December 1, he scored 23 points and passed Jason Kidd for eighth place on the career three-pointers made list in a 133–112 win over the Orlando Magic.[145] On December 4, in a 125–115 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, Curry hit 5 three-pointers to become the fastest NBA player to achieve the milestone of 2,000 career three-pointers, achieving that mark in just 597 games, 227 less than the previous fastest player to achieve that mark, Ray Allen.[146][147] In that same game, Curry injured his right ankle and subsequently missed 11 games,[148] returning to action on December 30 and scoring 38 points with a season-high 10 three-pointers in a 141–128 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. Curry shot 13 of 17 and 10 of 13 from deep in 26 minutes for his ninth 30-point game of the season.

Three titles ... Wherever that puts us in the conversation in the history of the NBA ... I'm a three-time champ.\"[164] Rohan Nadkarni of Sports Illustrated argued that \"the Golden State dynasty started with Stephen Curry.

He became the first player in Finals history to make 5+ three-pointers in four consecutive games.[230] Curry (at age 34 years, 88 days) also became the second-oldest player in NBA Finals history to record a 40-point, 10-rebound game behind only LeBron James in 2020 (at age 35 years, 284 days).[231] In Game 5 of the Finals, Curry passed Boston Celtics legend John Havlicek for 10th on the all-time Finals assists list.[232] In Game 6 of the Finals, Curry scored 34 points along with seven rebounds, seven assists, and led the Warriors to a 103–90 victory over the Celtics.

He became the first player to score 50 points in a Game 7 and tied Karl Malone for the most points in a playoff game at age 35 or older.[249][250] He also became the first player in playoff history to score at least 20 points from behind the arc and in the paint in the same game.[251] Following the series' completion, Curry joined Jordan as the only players in playoff history to record at least 200 points in a series at age 35 or older.[252] His 50 points also set a record for the most points scored in a Game 7.[253][c] In Game 4 of the Conference Semifinals against the Lakers, Curry logged his third postseason career triple-double with 31 points, 10 rebounds, 14 assists, and three steals in a 104–101 loss.[255][256] The Warriors were eliminated in six games, despite Curry's 32-point outing in a 122–101 closeout loss in Game 6.[257] On November 1, 2023, Curry became the first player in NBA history to make a three-pointer in 250 consecutive regular season games.[258] On November 3, he scored a game-winning layup in a 141–139 win against the Oklahoma City Thunder.[259] On December 16, Curry scored 37 points on 14-for-22 shooting, including 6-for-8 from beyond the arc in a 124–120 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. He became the first player in NBA history to record at least 3,500 career three-pointers.[260][261] On January 27, 2024, Curry recorded 46 points and nine made three-pointers, in a 145–144 double-overtime loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.[262] On February 1, Curry was named to his tenth All-Star Game and his first as a reserve.[263] On February 3, Curry scored a season-high 60 points on 22-of-38 shooting from the field with 10 three-pointers made in a 141–134 overtime loss to the Atlanta Hawks, setting several NBA records; he joined Kobe Bryant as the only players in history to record a 60-point game after turning 35 years old; he became the second player after Rick Barry to score at least 60 points with at most six free throws attempted; he joined Damian Lillard and Karl-Anthony Towns as the only players to record at least 60 points and 10 made three-pointers in a regular season game; he became the first player in history to average over 40 points per game on 50–40–100 splits in a four-game span.[264][265] On February 8, Curry scored 42 points on 15-of-22 shooting from the field, including a season-high 11-of-16 shooting from three, in a 131–109 win over the Indiana Pacers.[266] On February 10, Curry put up 30 points and nine rebounds, alongside a game-winning three-pointer in a 113–112 win over the Phoenix Suns.[267] On April 25, Curry was named the 2023–24 NBA Clutch Player of the Year over DeMar DeRozan and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander after leading the league in clutch points that season.[268] On August 30, 2024, Curry signed a one-year, $62.6 million contract extension with the Warriors throughout the 2026–27 season, becoming the first NBA player to earn $60 million in a single season.[269] He also joined LeBron James and Kevin Durant as the only players in history to amass $500 million in career earnings.[270] On November 10, 2024, Curry recorded 36 points and seven assists in a 127–116 road victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder.[271] Two days later, he scored all of Golden State's final twelve points as part of a 37-point, 6-rebound and 9-assist outing in a 120–117 win over the Dallas Mavericks in Klay Thompson's first return to the Bay Area after leaving for Dallas in a sign-and-trade during the offseason.[272] Curry's first experience with the United States national team came at the 2007 FIBA Under-19 World Championship, where he helped Team USA capture the silver medal.[273] In 2010, he was selected to the senior squad, playing limited minutes at the 2010 FIBA World Championship (later known as the FIBA Basketball World Cup) as the United States won the gold medal in an undefeated tournament.[274] In 2012, Curry was excluded from the list of 20 finalists selected for consideration for the 2012 U.S. Olympic team in London, which reportedly left him \"very disappointed\" but motivated to improve his game for future opportunities.[275][276] In 2014, he took on a larger role with the team, helping them to another undefeated tournament at the 2014 World Cup and scoring 10 points in the final game.[277] On June 6, 2016, Curry withdrew from consideration for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, citing ankle and knee ailments as the major reason behind the decision.[278] Curry made his Olympic debut with the 2024 U.S. Olympic team in Paris, alongside his longtime head coach Steve Kerr.[279] He initially struggled from the field. In a tightly contested semifinal game against Serbia, Curry led a 17-point comeback in a 95–91 win, finishing with a tournament-high 36 points, 8 rebounds, and 9-of-14 shooting from three-point range.[280] In the final two minutes, Curry made a successful steal, layup, and two clutch free throws to maintain a lead of four points.[281] He set a national record for most points scored in an Olympic knockout game and an Olympic record for most three-pointers made in a knockout game, respectively.[282][283] His 36 points are the second-most ever scored in a game by an American, behind Carmelo Anthony's 37-point performance against Nigeria in 2012. In a postgame interview, teammate Kevin Durant called Curry's performance \"one of the greatest games I've ever seen him play\".[281] Curry followed up his performance with another successful outing in the final match against France, tallying 24 points, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 8-of-12 shooting from three-point range.[284] He made 4 consecutive three-pointers within the final 3 minutes to help seal the game and secure the United States' 5th straight Olympic gold medal and his career-first.[285] Curry finished the tournament as the team's leading scorer, averaging 14.8 points per game, and set a new Olympic record for most three-pointers made in a final.[286] For his performances, Curry was named to the Olympics All-Star Five team.[287] He joined LeBron James, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan as the fourth player in NBA history to win at least four championships, two league MVP awards, a Finals MVP award, and an Olympic gold medal in a career.[288][289] Listed at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) and 185 pounds (86 kg), Curry plays almost exclusively at the point guard position combined with the signature play style of an elite shooting guard. He has career averages of 24.8 points, 6.4 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 1.5 steals per game (through the end of the 2023–24 season),[83] His career free throw percentage of 91.0% is the highest in NBA history, and he has led the league in annual free-throw percentage four times.[290][291] He has been named league MVP twice, including the first unanimous selection in league history (2015–16).[83] Known for his three-point shooting, athleticism, and playmaking, Curry is an offensive threat from underneath the rim to near half-court.[292][293] Using an unorthodox jump shot, he is capable of releasing the ball in under half a second upon jumping, adding greater arc to his shots and making them difficult to block.[294] Therefore, Curry is able to adjust his release and balance to make shots from virtually anywhere on the court. For his high shooting proficiency and ball-handling, he has been referred to as the \"Baby-Faced Assassin\" since his collegiate basketball years[295] and \"Chef Curry\" while playing in the NBA.[296] For their shooting abilities, Curry and former teammate Klay Thompson are often referred to as the Splash Brothers. In the 2013–14 season, they set the record for combined three-pointers made in a season with 484, a record they broke the following season (525), and again in the 2015–16 season (678).[297] Curry is also known for putting pressure on defenses with his long range and led the league in field goals made from beyond 28 feet in the 2015–16 season.[298] A clutch scorer, he often shoots at his best in high-pressure moments and takes game-winning shots.[299][300] Curry has made 10 game-winning shots[d] in his career, the most by any player since the 2012–13 season.[302] He was named the 2023–24 NBA Clutch Player of the Year after leading the league in clutch points, made clutch field goals, and made clutch three-pointers.[301] His career three-point field goal percentage (3P%) of .425% ranks as the 12th highest in NBA history.[303] In 2015–16, Curry posted the highest eFG% (.630) and 3P% (.454) ever recorded in a season while averaging over 30 points per game.[304] He holds four of the top-five seasons with most three-pointers made, led by his NBA record 402 three-pointers from the 2015–16 season, and has served as the annual leader a record eight times.[305][306] He is also the fastest player in league history to make 2,000 career three-pointers, doing so in 227 fewer games than the previous record-holder, Ray Allen.[146] Additionally, Curry is the fastest player to make 100 three-pointers in a season, doing so in just 19 games, breaking his own previous record of 20 games.[307] Owing to his offensive presence, Curry's scoring creates a \"gravity\" effect that forces opposing defenders to frequently double-team him during both on-ball and off-ball movement, creating mismatches that his teammates exploit.[308][309] With Curry, the Warriors average 10.8 isolations per game; without Curry, they average 15.3 isolations per game. His absence slows the Warriors offense and leads to less passing and ball movement. With Curry, the Warriors average 1.05 points every shot that comes after an off-ball screen; without Curry, it drops to 0.95 points per game. His absence makes it much easier for defenders to switch on screens. Of Curry's success with or without other elite teammates, NBC Sports' Tom Haberstroh said, \"You can pluck All-Star after All-Star off the court like flower petals, and the Steph-led Warriors will still dominate like a champion. He's that transcendent of a player.\"[310] Curry's short stature relative to the rest of the league impeded his defensive abilities for the majority of his career.[311][312] With a low center of gravity, he leverages his fast pace and reflexes to break defenses.[312] Some analysts, including Ethan Sherwood Strauss of ESPN, have complimented his defensive play or called it underrated.[311][313] Strauss said in 2015 that Curry became \"one of the NBA's most effective defenders – ranking fifth among point guards in defensive real plus-minus.\"[313] Curry led the league in total steals in the 2014–15 season and steals per game in the following season.[314] Curry is often considered the greatest shooter[2][3] and one of the greatest players in NBA history.[4][315][316] He is credited with revolutionizing the game of basketball by inspiring teams, from high school to the NBA, to regularly use the three-point shot.[5][6][7] Analysts have referred to him as \"the Michael Jordan of the three-point era\", saying that he did for the three-point shot what Jordan did for the slam dunk.[317][318][319] The Guardian's Robert O'Connell cites Curry's February 27, 2013, game against the New York Knicks, in which he made 11-of-13 shots from behind the arc en route to a 54-point performance, as the start of the three-point era.[320] The era has been referred to as \"the Steph Effect\"[7] or \"the NBA's Three-Point Revolution\".[321] Curry is also often compared to Magic Johnson in debates over the greatest point guard of all time, owing to their generational impact, winningness, and diverse skillsets.[322][323][324] Regarded as the face of the Warriors dynasty,[325][326] Curry helped redefine three-point scoring as a central element of modern-day basketball strategy rather than a mere novelty.[316][327] His influence has inspired the league to transition from physical play around the basket to a \"pace and space\" approach that emphasizes three-point shooting.[327] This transformation can be attributed, in part, to teams attempting to counter the Warriors' dominance and young players aspiring to emulate Curry's range.[7][320] Curry regularly attempts shots from 30 to 35 feet at an efficiency of .54, compared to the league average of under .22 from this range and .35 for made three-pointers overall.[316] Kirk Goldsberry of ESPN opined that \"Curry isn't just the best 3-point shooter ever, he's the best deep 3-point shooter ever.\"[316] As Curry himself noted, \"I'm sure coaches tell their high school players that shooting the way I do takes work and time;\" Jesse Dougherty of The Washington Post stated that \"coaches have to explain that while Curry's skill set is something to aspire to, his game is built on fundamentals.\"[7] His ability to make these shots is complemented by a high degree of ball-handling skills, release, and capacity to shoot effectively with one or more defenders contesting his attempts.[316] Sally Jenkins, also of The Washington Post, highlighted the degree of difficulty of Curry's shooting, citing a period in which he achieved a .67 success rate on shots taken from 28 to 50 feet.[293] Jeff Austin of Octagon noted that Curry \"had to develop tremendous strength in his wrists to shoot and maintain that form from 40 and 50 feet.\"[293] Goldsberry concludes that \"no player in the history of the NBA has combined range, volume, and efficiency from downtown as well as Curry,\" making him \"the most efficient volume scorer on the planet.\"[316] The developers of the NBA 2K video game series have even expressed concerns about accurately replicating Curry's unique abilities.[327] Where Curry ranks as one of the greatest NBA players has been more subject to debate.[328] Steve Nash, a two-time NBA MVP and one of the league's all-time efficient shooters, said Curry is \"already an all-time great\" and that people question his greatness \"because he doesn't dominate the game physically. He dances. He pays a tax for that. He pays a tax for his great teammates.\"[328] Scottie Pippen, a six-time NBA champion with the Chicago Bulls, said that Curry's \"willingness to sacrifice\" for Durant is \"one of the great stories in history.\" Crediting Curry as \"one of the greatest guards the game has ever seen\", he said: \"If you have a mind for the game, you know that it takes sacrifice to be great. All the greats have to sacrifice something. Otherwise you can't win.\"[328] In 2018, CBS Sports ranked Curry at No. 19 in their list of \"50 greatest NBA players of all time\".[329] In a 2019 feature, Sports Illustrated stated that \"Curry and the Warriors are a great match of player and system\" and that \"the entire ecosystem is predicated on the idea that a player doesn't need to dominate the ball to dominate a game. Curry took that noble idea and elevated it beyond any reasonable expectation.\"[330] In 2020, ESPN ranked Curry as the 13th greatest basketball player of all time, the second-highest active player behind LeBron James. Nick Friedell of ESPN described Curry as \"the greatest shooter of all time\", noting his game-changing influence \"is seen on every level of basketball as younger generations shoot more than ever while trying to replicate his game.\"[331] In October 2021, Curry was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time as a member of the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[332] In an \"NBA 75\" feature, Marcus Thompson II of The Athletic opined that \"in 20 years, Curry will be talked about with excitement reserved for the most legendary. Like the elders of today talk about Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell, and how their children revere Larry Bird and Charles Barkley.\"[333] After winning his fourth NBA championship and first Finals MVP award in 2022, Complex ranked Curry as the 10th greatest player in NBA history the following year. Angel Diaz cited his generational impact with \"nothing left (for Curry) to accomplish\" as reasons for his place among the sport's greats.[334] On July 30, 2011, Curry married longtime girlfriend and Toronto-area native Ayesha Alexander in Charlotte.[15][16][335] Curry and Alexander met at their church in Charlotte when they were 15 and 14 years old, respectively.[336] Together, they have two daughters who were born in 2012 and 2015,[337][338] and two sons who were born in 2018 and 2024, respectively.[339][340] In July 2019, Curry paid $31 million for a home in Atherton, California.[341] Curry's younger brother, Seth, is also a professional basketball player,[342] and his younger sister, Sydel, played volleyball at Elon University.[343] Curry is a Pentecostal Christian and has been outspoken about his faith.[344][345] He spoke about his faith during his MVP speech by saying: \"People should know who I represent and why I am who I am, and that's because of my Lord and Savior.\" He also said the reason that he pounds his chest and points up is that he has a \"heart for God\" and as a reminder that he plays for God.[346] On some of his \"Curry One\" basketball shoes, there is a lace loop scripted \"4:13\". It is a reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13, which reads: \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\"[347][348] Curry has a tattoo of First Corinthians 13:8 in Hebrew on his wrist (\"Love never fails...\").[349] Curry is also an investor in Active Faith, a Christian sports apparel brand.[350][351] During the 1992 NBA All-Star Game weekend, Curry's father entrusted him to Biserka Petrović, mother of future Hall of Fame player Dražen Petrović, while Dell competed in the Three-Point Contest. Following the 2015 NBA Finals, Curry gave Biserka one of his Finals-worn jerseys, which will reportedly be added to the collection of the Dražen Petrović Memorial Center, a museum to the late player in the Croatian capital of Zagreb.[352] Curry is diagnosed with keratoconus and wears contact lenses to correct his vision.[353] He is also an avid golfer; he started playing golf at the age of 10, played golf in high school, and frequently plays golf with former teammate Andre Iguodala.[354][355][356] A 5-handicap golfer, Curry participates in celebrity golf tournaments and has played golf alongside Barack Obama.[357][358][359] In August 2017, Curry competed in the Ellie Mae Classic on an unrestricted sponsor exemption.[360] Although he missed the first cut, he scored 4-over-74 for both days he participated, surpassing most expectations for an amateur competing in the pro event.[361] In July 2023, Curry won the American Century Championship, an annual celebrity golf tournament held at the Edgewood Tahoe Resort in Stateline, Nevada. He shot a hole-in-one during the second round and won the tournament on the final hole with a walk-off eagle putt.[362] In August 2019, Curry and Howard University, a historically black institution in Washington, D.C., jointly announced that the school would add NCAA Division I teams in men's and women's golf starting in the 2020–21 school year, with Curry guaranteeing full funding of both teams for six years.[363] Curry is also a fan of English soccer club Chelsea F.C.[364][365] \"No NBA athlete has a larger contingent of fans at every arena, lining up 20- and 30-deep hoping for a glimpse, if not an autograph. This crazy popularity is why his jersey sales consistently rank No. 1, why he was voted to be the captain of the [2018] Western Conference All-Star team and why 9-year-old girls feel comfortable enough to write letters asking for his help – and actually get it.\" Curry is one of the most successful players in the NBA, and has also become an international celebrity, on par with four-time MVP LeBron James.[367][368] Like James, he has been considered the face of the NBA, but has said that he is not motivated by that and is not looking \"to take LeBron's throne or whatever. You know, I'm trying to chase rings, and that's all I'm about. So that's where the conversation stops for me.\"[369] His flashy play and penchant for coming up big in the clutch have made him a fan favorite, and his smaller physique is said to have made his success seem more attainable for younger fans of the NBA.[370][371] Memorabilia associated with Curry is highly sought after; his 2009 rookie card ranks among the most expensive sports cards of all-time and is the most expensive basketball card ever sold, purchased by Alt Fund II for a record $5.9 million in July 2021.[372][373] Curry has led the NBA in jersey sales for five cumulative years; three consecutive times from the 2015–16 to 2017–18 seasons and two consecutive times from the 2022–23 to 2023–24 seasons, respectively.[374][375] ESPN has ranked Curry among the most famous international athletes. He is the highest paid NBA player of all-time by season and has been ranked in Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid celebrities for his endorsements six times.[376][377] ESPN's Kirk Goldsberry reasoned that one reason for Curry's popularity is that while most people are not tall enough to dunk, everyone can attempt a shot, which is something Curry inspires.[316] Owen Davis of Sky Sports echoed this sentiment, stating: \"After all, not everyone is blessed with supreme height and athleticism, but everyone can learn to pass, dribble and shoot. Curry is proof that if you work hard enough, you can still find ways to dominate, no matter your size.\"[327] Monte Poole of NBC Sports found Curry to be \"the most human of superstars,\" with a childlike aura to him when he plays with success. His fanbase ranges from very young children to the elderly, and casual or committed fans enjoy his style of play. Poole stated that \"the joy factor exponentially increases\" when Curry is on the court and that \"the sight of this relatively ordinary specimen sending much bigger players into silent surrender is an intoxicant for the Warriors and their fans.\"[366] Curry is widely known for his partnership with Under Armour, serving as the \"face of their footwear line\" and the President of his signature shoe and apparel line called the \"Curry Brand\".[378] Originally signed to Nike, Curry began a partnership with Under Armour in the 2013 offseason.[379] After becoming the NBA MVP and one of the most popular athletes in the world, sales of Curry's shoe line became an influential factor for the brand, with stock prices pivoting based on its success.[380][381] In September 2017, it was announced that Curry had signed an exclusive autograph contract with Steiner Sports Memorabilia. The full product line included hand-signed official basketballs and jerseys, autographed photographs, framed signs and wall-art, game-used memorabilia, and limited-edition pieces.[382] In October 2018, Curry announced his involvement with the relaunch of Palm, a mobile companion device that pairs with a primary smartphone.[383] Curry is an investor and the leading brand ambassador for Palm, a small startup based in San Francisco which licenses the Palm name from TCL Corporation. He is also involved with designing and testing accessories and even helped to name the device.[384] In 2021, Curry, among other high-profile athletes and celebrities, was a paid spokesperson for FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange. In November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, erasing billions of dollars in customer funds, with Curry, alongside other spokespeople, being sued for promoting unregistered securities through a class-action lawsuit.[385][386][387] In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.[388] Since 2018, Curry has served as the chief executive officer of Thirty Ink, a San Francisco-based company that works to provide equitable opportunities to people through brand, media, experiences, and philanthropy, as the four major verticals. Since 2019, Curry has been the Global Brand Ambassador for Rakuten. The company partnered with Curry on a one-day shopping spree at the Warriors Shop in Chase Center for 20 Bay Area children. Curry posed as a team shop employee during the event and helped find sports gear around the store.[389] In 2012, Curry started donating three insecticide-treated mosquito nets for every three-pointer he made to the United Nations Foundation's Nothing But Nets campaign to combat malaria. He was first introduced to the malaria cause by Davidson teammate Bryant Barr when they were both in school. Curry visited the White House in 2015 and delivered a five-minute speech to dignitaries as part of President Barack Obama's launch of his President's Malaria Initiative strategy for 2015–2020.[390][391] In 2015, Curry wore sneakers that bore the name \"Deah Shaddy Barakat\"—a victim of the 2015 Chapel Hill shooting. According to his sister Suzanne, Deah was known for his \"love for basketball and anything Steph Curry.\"[392] Deah donned Curry's No. 30 as his jersey number for his intramural basketball team at North Carolina State University, and recreated Curry's pose from his GQ photoshoot.[392] Curry said that Deah's family \"did a great job of reaching out to me and making me aware of the details of his life and personality ... It was really kind of a cool deal to be able to use the platform yesterday to honor Deah and his family ... I'm going to send them the shoes I wore yesterday. And hopefully, they know that I've been thinking about them.\"[393][394][395] Following his MVP award win and historic 2015–16 season, Curry donated his prize vehicle—a 2016 Kia Sorento—to the East Oakland Youth Development Center, a local non-profit organization located in the backyard of Oracle Arena.[396] In December 2018, while on a podcast, Curry jokingly questioned whether the Apollo program's Moon landing actually took place, which received substantial media attention and criticism. NASA went on to offer Curry a tour of the Johnson Space Center and discuss further. He partnered with Under Armour in creating signature shoes inspired by the comment and subsequent discussion. After wearing them to a game, he signed and auctioned them off on eBay. The shoes sold for $58,100 after 113 bids, with the money being donated for STEM education initiatives.[397][398] In July 2019, Curry and his wife launched the Eat. Learn. Play. Foundation in Oakland, California.[399] In April 2018, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced a wide-ranging, multiyear multimedia deal with Curry's newly formed production company Unanimous Media (named for Curry becoming the first NBA player in history to be elected the league's MVP by a unanimous vote), located on the Sony Pictures studio lot in Culver City. The film and TV deal included electronics, gaming and virtual reality and is focused on faith and family-friendly content.[400] In October 2018, Curry signed on as executive producer of the film Breakthrough, scheduled for release in April 2019.[401] Curry was also executive producer of the film Emanuel, scheduled for US theatrical release in select theaters on June 17, 2019.[402] The film focused on the responses by family members of victims of the 2015 Charleston church shooting. Curry remarked, \"In the face of adversity, in the face of tragedy, how can I get through it?\"[402] Beginning in 2019, Curry became both the executive producer and resident golf pro on the American sports reality competition television series Holey Moley.[403] On June 24, 2020, Curry released a trailer for his new show on his YouTube channel called Ultimate Home Championships, a show featuring people such as DeAndre Jordan, Ronda Rousey, and Kristopher London, where contestants competed in wacky at-home challenges using things in their home. In 2020, Unanimous Media signed a deal with Amazon's Audible.[404] The same year, Curry served as the executive producer of an animated revival of the 1970s sitcom Good Times along with the series' original executive producer, Norman Lear, and Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. The series was green-lit by Netflix in 2020.[405] In 2021, Curry signed on as executive producer of The Queen of Basketball, a documentary short film about basketball legend Lusia Harris. The same year, Unanimous Media signed a deal with NBCUniversal.[406] In 2023, Unanimous Media and Ryan Coogler co-produced Stephen Curry: Underrated, a sports documentary film chronicling Curry's path to NBA stardom. Apple TV+ secured the streaming rights and a release date of July 21, 2023.[407] Curry and his wife endorsed Joe Biden for President of the United States during the 2020 Democratic National Convention.[408] In December 2021, Curry voiced his support for the For the People Act, an election reform bill aimed at expanding voting rights.[409] In 2023, Curry opposed the development of multi-family housing in the wealthy enclave of Atherton, California, where he and his family live,[410] citing safety and privacy for themselves and their children.[411] Curry endorsed Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee and an avid Warriors fan, for the 2024 United States presidential election.[412] NBA[83] USA Basketball[273] NCAA Golf Halls of Fame Media State/Local NBA Golden State Warriors USA Basketball NCAA Davidson College",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Stephen Curry (born March 14, 1988, Akron, Ohio, U.S.) is an American professional basketball player who led the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA) to championships in 2014–15, 2016–17, 2017–18, and 2021–22 and to the best regular-season record in league history (73–9) in 2015–16. Curry grew up immersed in basketball as the son of 16-year NBA veteran sharpshooter Dell Curry. The younger Curry learned the intricacies of the game from his father. His keen shooting and high “basketball IQ” were not enough to persuade college coaches to overlook his wiry frame and unremarkable 6-foot (1.8-meter) height. He did not receive scholarship offers from major college basketball programs and attended Davidson (North Carolina) College, which had an enrollment of fewer than 2,000 students. He quickly made his mark, however, averaging 21.5 points per game as a freshman to lead all first-year players in the country. Curry became a national sensation during his sophomore season, when he led 10th-seeded Davidson on an improbable run to the Elite Eight of the National Collegiate Athletic Association men’s top-division basketball championship tournament in a performance that featured what would soon be recognized as his signature shot: a three-pointer from well outside the line. His junior season did not feature any such postseason heroics, but his average of 28.6 points per game led the country, and he was named a consensus first-team All-American. Curry, who by then was 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 meters) tall, entered the 2009 NBA draft, in which he was selected by the Warriors with the seventh overall pick. Curry made an immediate impact with the Warriors, becoming the team’s starting point guard and averaging 17.5 points per game in his first season. A series of ankle sprains led to Curry’s playing just 26 games in the 2011–12 season, and he underwent off-season ligament surgery. He then signed a modest four-year $44 million contract extension that allowed Golden State to surround its budding star with other talented players. Curry led the league in three-pointers made (272) in 2012–13. The following season he repeated that feat (with 261) and earned his first All-Star selection. In 2014–15 he made a then-record 286 three-pointers while leading the Warriors to an NBA-best 67–15 record and was named the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP). In the following postseason, Curry propelled the Warriors to the franchise’s first title in 40 years over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Curry led his team to even greater heights in 2015–16, as Golden State bested the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls’ 72–10 regular-season record by one additional victory. He also topped the NBA with an average of 30.1 points per game and shattered his own league standard by making an astounding 402 three-point shots. Curry earned his second consecutive MVP award for his efforts and became the first person to be voted MVP unanimously. However, the Warriors’ historic season ultimately ended in shocking disappointment as the team surrendered a 3–1 NBA finals lead to the Cavaliers. In 2016–17 Curry led the NBA in three-point field goals made (324) for a fifth straight season as the Warriors again led the NBA in wins (67). Golden State then ran off an unprecedented 12 straight victories to open the postseason and won a third consecutive Western Conference title. The Warriors finally had a postseason loss in game four of the NBA finals, but the team rebounded to defeat the Cavaliers in five games to capture Curry’s second NBA title. A knee injury limited Curry to 51 games during the 2017–18 regular season, ending his five-year run as the league leader in three-point field goals attempted and made. He returned during the second round of the playoffs to help the Warriors win their fourth consecutive conference championship and third NBA title (in a four-game sweep of the Cavaliers). Curry continued his dazzling play in 2018–19, averaging 27.3 points per game and earning first-team All-NBA honors. In the playoffs, he guided an injury-plagued Warriors team to a fifth straight conference title, the most in a row since the NBA instituted conferences in 1970–71. However, additional injuries and inspired play by the opposing Toronto Raptors led to a six-game Golden State loss in the finals. The Warriors entered the 2019–20 season shorthanded after losing fellow All-Stars Kevin Durant (departure via free agency) and Klay Thompson (season-ending injury during the 2019 finals). Curry himself played in just five games during that campaign after breaking his hand early in the season, which led to the Warriors having a league-worst record. Curry returned to form and had a fantastic 2020–21 season, leading the NBA with 32 points per game, but the team missed the playoffs despite having a winning record. In December 2021 Curry made yet another mark in the NBA history books by scoring his 2,974th career three-pointer, breaking the NBA record for all-time three-point field goals scored. Following another season-ending injury in 2020, Thompson rejoined the team in 2021–22 and helped the Warriors finally return to form, as Golden State won 53 games and qualified for the postseason. There, the team—and Curry—regained their dominance, losing just six games during the NBA playoffs to win a fourth title during Curry’s era, and he was named finals MVP after scoring 31.2 points per game during the six-game series win over the Boston Celtics. His strong play continued in 2022–23, but the Warriors lost in the conference semifinals. The team missed the playoffs the following season. Curry occasionally played on the U.S. men’s national basketball team. He helped the squad win the gold medal at the 2010 FIBA World Championship and at the 2014 FIBA World Cup. Curry made his Olympic debut at the 2024 Paris Games. The U.S. team advanced to the gold-medal game, and Curry scored 24 points, including four three-pointers late in the fourth quarter, to help the United States defeat France, 98–87. In 2011 Curry married Ayesha Alexander, an actress who later wrote several popular cookbooks. The couple have four children: daughters Riley (2012) and Ryan (2015) and sons Canon (2018) and Caius (2024).",

                "content": "Stephen Curry's influence on the sport of basketball and the NBA is recognised as transformational. Over the years, his impact on the game and his role in popularising the three-point shot has fundamentally changed the way basketball is played. Following in the footsteps of his father, Dell Curry, a former NBA player, young Stephen started playing basketball at a young age. However, during his teenage years, his relatively modest height (1.80m or 6 feet) failed to attract major college scholarship offers. Consequently, Curry enrolled at the relatively small Davidson College in North Carolina, where he would soon become a national sensation. His sophomore year was particularly remarkable as, grown to his adult height (1.91m or 6-foot-3), he led his team to the Elite Eight in the 2008 College Basketball Tournament, showcasing an astounding talent for three-pointers, including a tournament-best 23 of them. The shot from beyond the arc would eventually become Curry's trademark as he entered the NBA with the Golden State Warriors in the 2009 draft, selected seventh overall. Curry quickly made his mark with the Warriors, assuming the role of the team's starting point guard and averaging 17.5 points per game in his debut season. The team progressively improved under his leadership, characterised by his trademark long-range baskets. In the 2012–13 and 2013–14 seasons, Curry led the league in three-pointers made (272 and 261, respectively). During the latter season, he earned his first All-Star selection. In January 2015, he surpassed 1,000 three-pointers made in his 369th professional game, becoming at the time the fastest player to achieve the feat. That helped him on the way to winning his first NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award as the Warriors clinched their first NBA title in 40 years, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers. In the 2015–16 season, Curry made history by making a jaw-dropping 402 three-point shots, including a record-breaking 13 three-pointers in a single game against the Pelicans on November 7, 2016. He earned his second consecutive MVP award, becoming the first player in history to win the MVP title unanimously. Despite leading 3–1 in the finals series, the Warriors ultimately conceded the title to LeBron James' Cavaliers. The following year he led the NBA in three-point field goals made (324) for the fifth straight season. The Warriors avenged their previous loss to the Cavaliers, securing Curry's second NBA title. In December 2021, Curry passed another milestone by scoring his 2,974th career three-pointer, surpassing NBA legend Ray Allen's record for all-time three-pointers. That season he guided the Warriors to another NBA championship, earning his fourth ring. With an incredible 42.6 career per cent success rate from beyond the arc, Curry is regarded as one of the greatest shooters and scorers in NBA history. On the international stage, the husband of television personality Ayesha Disa Curry contributed to the USA's consecutive World titles in 2010 and 2014. Although he withdrew from consideration for the 2016 Olympics due to injury, Curry finally made his Games debut at Paris 2024, where he was vital in ensuring a fifth consecutive gold medal for the USA. In the final against hosts France, the 35-year-old scored 24 points (all from three-point range), including four three-pointers in the final three minutes to stop a late comeback from France and secure a 98-87 win.

                "title": "Denver Nuggets - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Denver Nuggets are an American professional basketball team based in Denver. The Nuggets compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference. The team was founded as the Denver Larks in 1967 as a charter franchise of the American Basketball Association (ABA) but changed their name to the Rockets before the first season.[15] The Rockets then changed their name again to the Nuggets in 1974.[16] After the name change, the Nuggets played for the final ABA Championship title in 1976, losing to the New York Nets. The team has had some periods of success, qualifying for the ABA playoffs in every season of the ABA's existence (except 1971 and 1974), losing in the 1976 ABA Finals to the New York Nets.[17] The team joined the NBA in 1976 after the ABA–NBA merger and qualified for the NBA playoffs in nine consecutive seasons in the 1980s and ten consecutive seasons from 2004 to 2013.[17] In 2023, the Nuggets, led by Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray, reached their first NBA Finals and defeated the Miami Heat to capture the franchise's first NBA championship. The Nuggets were the last of the four surviving former ABA teams to reach the NBA Finals, and the second former ABA team to win an NBA title (after the San Antonio Spurs).[17][18] The Nuggets play their home games at Ball Arena,[4] which they share with the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Colorado Mammoth of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). Prior to the 1948–49 National Basketball League (NBL) season, the original Denver Nuggets were founded. Following that season, the NBL merged with the Basketball Association of America (BAA), with the newly unified circuit named the National Basketball Association to reflect the merger. The Denver Nuggets played the 1949–50 season as one of the charter NBA teams before folding. This franchise's records and statistics remain separate from the modern-day Denver Nuggets. The current franchise traces its roots to 1967, when one of the American Basketball Association (ABA)'s charter franchises was awarded to a group in Kansas City, Missouri, headed by Southern California businessman James Trindle. However, Trindle was unable to find a suitable arena in the Kansas City area. League commissioner George Mikan suggested moving the team to Denver. After agreeing to name Denver resident and former NBA player Vince Boryla as general manager, Trindle moved his team to Denver as the Denver Larks, named after Colorado's state bird.[19] The Trindle group was severely undercapitalized, leading Mikan to order the Larks to post a $100,000 performance bond or lose the franchise. Hours before the deadline, Trindle sold a ⅔ controlling interest to Denver trucking magnate Bill Ringsby for $350,000. Ringsby then renamed the team the Rockets, after his company's long-haul trucks.[20] Playing at the Denver Auditorium Arena, the Rockets had early successes on the court, developing a strong fan base along the way.[21] However, the team had a history of early playoff exits and only once played in the ABA championship series. Early, Denver had a solid lineup led by Byron Beck and Larry Jones, then later by Beck and Ralph Simpson. Lonnie Wright of the American Football League's Denver Broncos signed with the Rockets during that first season and became the first player to play professional football and basketball in the same season. Wright played four seasons with Denver.[21] Controversial rookie Spencer Haywood joined the team for the 1969–70 season. Haywood was one of the first players to turn pro before graduating from college, and the NBA initially refused to let him play in the league. Haywood averaged nearly 30 points and 19.5 rebounds per game in his only ABA season, being named ABA MVP, ABA rookie of the year, as well as the All-Star Game MVP. The team finished 51–33, winning their division, before exiting the playoffs in the 2nd round. Just before the start of the 1970–71 season, Haywood signed with the Seattle SuperSonics, jumping to the NBA. The team tumbled to a 30–54 record and attendance suffered.[21] Ringsby sold the team to San Diego businessmen Frank Goldberg and Bud Fischer in 1972.[19] In 1974, in anticipation of moving into the NBA, and the new McNichols Arena, the franchise held a contest to choose a new team nickname, as \"Rockets\" was already in use by the Houston Rockets. The winning choice was \"Nuggets\", in honor of the original Denver Nuggets team from 1948 to 1950, the last year as a charter member of the NBA. Their new logo was a miner \"discovering\" an ABA ball. Goldberg and Fischer in turn sold the team to a local investment group in 1976. With the drafting and signing of future Hall of Fame player David Thompson out of North Carolina State and Marvin Webster, and the acquisitions of Dan Issel and Bobby Jones (all signed for the 1975–76 season), with Larry Brown coaching, they had their best seasons in team history in their first two as the Nuggets. Playing in the Denver Auditorium Arena for the last season the 1974–75 team went 65–19, including a 40–2 record at home. However, they lost in the Western Conference Finals in 7 games, to the Indiana Pacers.[22] In 1975–76, playing at their new arena, the Nuggets, with the acquisitions of Thompson, Jones and Dan Issel who had come via a trade after he won an ABA title with the 1974–75 Kentucky Colonels, the team went 60–24, edged the reigning champion Kentucky Colonels four games to three to make the 1976 ABA finals for the first time. Eventually, they lost to the New York Nets and Julius Erving in 6 games.[22] They did not get a second chance to win an ABA league championship, as the ABA–NBA merger took place after the 1975–76 season. The Nuggets, Nets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs were merged into the NBA. The Spirits of St. Louis and Kentucky Colonels were disbanded.[23] The Nuggets and Nets had actually applied to join the NBA in 1975, but were forced to stay in the ABA by a court order. The Nuggets continued their strong play early on in the NBA, as they won division titles in their first two seasons in the league, and missed a third by a single game. However, neither of these teams were ultimately successful in the postseason. Similarly to the other new NBA teams, the Nuggets were saddled with stiff financial obligations upon joining the NBA, including a $2 million entry fee. Red McCombs bought the team in 1978. In 1979, Brown left the team, helping usher in a brief decline in their performance. It ended in 1981, when they hired Doug Moe as a head coach. Moe brought with him a \"motion offense\" philosophy, a style of play focusing on attempting to move the ball until someone got open. Moe was also known for not paying as much attention to defense as other NBA coaches. The offense helped the team become highly competitive. During the 1980s, the Nuggets often[quantify] scored in excess of 115 points a game, and during the 1981–82 season, they scored at least 100 points in every game. The NBA-record streak was halted at 136 consecutive games.[24] During the 1981–82 season, the Nuggets set the league scoring record for the highest points per game average at 126.5 points. Anchored by scoring machines Alex English and Kiki Vandeweghe at the two forward spots, and Dan Issel at center, Denver led the league in scoring, with English and Vandeweghe both averaging above 25 points per game. It was a novel strategy, allowing the Nuggets to top the Midwest Division and qualify for the playoffs during that span. (On December 13, 1983, the Nuggets and the visiting Detroit Pistons combined for an NBA record 370 points, with Detroit winning in triple overtime, 186–184.) At the end of the season, English won the NBA scoring title, becoming the only Nugget to win the award despite the heavily favored offensive play of Doug Moe. In 1984–85, they made it to the Western Conference finals after being perennial playoff contenders, and they lost in five games to the Los Angeles Lakers. Vandeweghe was traded before the 1984–85 season to the Portland Trail Blazers for 6–3 rebounding guard Fat Lever, undersized power forward Calvin Natt and center Wayne Cooper. Spearheaded by Alex English and supported by the three new acquisitions and defensive specialists Bill Hanzlik and TR Dunn, the team replicated its success in the Western Conference despite the loss of Vandeweghe. They even managed to win 54 games in the 1987–88 season, the most they had ever won as an NBA team. However, the Mavericks eliminated the Nuggets in the second round of the 1988 NBA Playoffs. McCombs sold the team to Sidney Shlenker in 1985. Shlenker, in turn, sold the team to COMSAT in 1989. Moe left the team in 1990, and was replaced by Paul Westhead. Westhead also believed in a \"run and gun\" style of play allowing players to speed down the court to shoot rather than creating set plays.[25] Denver took a positive step in rebuilding by drafting Georgetown University center Dikembe Mutombo in 1991. Mutombo finished runner-up to Larry Johnson for the NBA rookie of the year that season. Denver finished 24–58 that year. Denver fired Westhead prior to the 1992–93 season and hired former star player Dan Issel as his successor. The Nuggets had two lottery picks that year and drafted University of Notre Dame forward LaPhonso Ellis and University of Virginia guard Bryant Stith. Denver improved to 36–46, just missing the playoffs that year. Denver ditched their rainbow colors for a dark navy, metallic gold and wine color scheme starting in the 1993–94 season. Led by Mutombo, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf (who changed his name from Chris Jackson prior to the season), and Ellis, Denver finished with its first winning season since the Doug Moe era at 42–40. Denver clinched the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, playing the first place Seattle SuperSonics. Denver was a heavy underdog, having only a couple of players on their roster with actual NBA playoff experience. After dropping the first two games of the five-game set in Seattle, the series returned to Denver. Denver won both games and tied the series at 2. The Nuggets made NBA history in Game 5, upsetting Seattle in overtime 98–94. They became the first 8th-seeded team to defeat a 1st-seeded team in NBA playoff history. Denver almost repeated the feat before falling to the Utah Jazz in Game 7 of the second round. Denver acquired Sonics sharp-shooter Dale Ellis in the off-season and drafted University of Michigan guard Jalen Rose. Denver struggled, causing Issel to resign as coach partway into the season. Assistant Coach Gene Littles assumed control for a brief period before relinquishing control to general manager Bernie Bickerstaff. Denver rebounded and earned the eighth seed again in the playoffs, finishing 41–41. The Nuggets were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs that season. Following that season, Denver acquired Antonio McDyess in a draft-day trade with the Los Angeles Clippers. McDyess was the face of the franchise for the next few years, as Mutombo left after the 1995–96 season for the Atlanta Hawks, Ellis missed the majority of the next few seasons due to recurring knee and leg injuries, Rose was traded to the Indiana Pacers for Mark Jackson, and Abdul-Rauf was traded to the Sacramento Kings prior to the 1996–97 season. After finishing the 1996–97 season with the fourth-worst record in the league (21–61), the Nuggets sent Antonio McDyess to the Phoenix Suns, and Dale Ellis returned to Seattle. Denver flirted with history in the 1997–98, by nearly setting the mark for fewest wins in an 82-game season (11). They tied the then-NBA's all-time worst single-season losing streak at 23—only one game shy of the overall worst mark of 24 by the Cleveland Cavaliers of the early 1980s. The losing streak was later broken by the Cavaliers in 2011 and the Philadelphia 76ers in 2014 with 26 consecutive losses. Several years later, the Nuggets tied for the worst record in the NBA in 2002–03, also with the Cavaliers. The team's struggles in the late 1990s were due in part to ownership instability. COMSAT bought the NHL's Quebec Nordiques in 1995 and moved them to Denver as the Colorado Avalanche. However, its diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company. In particular, cost overruns associated with the construction of Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent Entertainment Group, the umbrella corporation for its sporting assets, to Liberty Media.[19] However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought the Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.[26] After almost two years, Ascent sold the Avalanche and Nuggets to Walmart heirs Bill and Nancy Laurie for $400 million. However, a group of Ascent shareholders sued, claiming that the sale price was several million dollars too low. Ascent then agreed to sell the Avalanche and Nuggets to Denver banking tycoon Donald Sturm for $461 million.[27] However, a new wrinkle appeared when the city of Denver refused to transfer the parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had bought the teams in his own name, and the city wanted to protect taxpayers in the event Sturm either died or sold the teams. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he was not willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.[28] In the meantime, Issel had returned as head coach in 1999, but the protracted ownership negotiations made it difficult for him to rebuild the team. Just before the start of the 1999–2000 season, he told reporters there were several personnel moves he simply could not make due to the unstable ownership situation. Under the terms of Strum's purchase agreement, all basketball decisions required the approval of both Ascent/Liberty and Sturm.[29] Finally, in July 2000, the Avalanche, Nuggets and Pepsi Center were bought by real estate entrepreneur Stan Kroenke in a $450 million deal.[19] Kroenke is the brother-in-law of the Lauries; his wife Ann is Nancy Laurie's sister. Liberty retained a 6.5% interest. As part of the deal, Kroenke placed the teams into a trust that would ensure the teams will stay in Denver until at least 2025.[28] After the deal, Kroenke organized his sports assets under Kroenke Sports Enterprises. In 2003, the Nuggets drafted future All-Star Carmelo Anthony with the third overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft.[30] That same year, the team also updated their logos and uniforms, with a new color scheme of powder blue, gold and royal blue; the latter color was changed to navy blue in 2008.[31] In just two months of the season, the Nuggets recorded more wins than they had in 5½ months of play in 2002–03. Much of the reason for this incredible turnaround were the front-office moves of general manager Kiki Vandeweghe, a former Nuggets player who assumed general manager duties on August 9, 2001.[32] In April, the turnaround was complete as they became the first franchise in NBA history to qualify for the postseason following a sub-20-win campaign the previous year since the NBA went to an 82-game schedule.[32] They were eliminated in the first round four games to one by the Minnesota Timberwolves.[33] On December 28, 2004, head coach Jeff Bzdelik was fired from the organization and replaced by interim coach, former Los Angeles Lakers player and Los Angeles Sparks head coach Michael Cooper.[34] The Nuggets later hired George Karl as a permanent replacement.[35] Karl led the team to a record of 32–8 in the second half of the regular season, which vaulted the team into the playoffs for the second consecutive year.[36] In the playoffs, however, the Nuggets could not survive the San Antonio Spurs. After winning game one in San Antonio, the Nuggets proceeded to lose the next four games and lost the series 4–1.[37] The Nuggets picked 20th in the 2005 NBA draft; it was acquired from the Washington Wizards via the Orlando Magic.[38] Denver selected Julius Hodge with the pick. The Nuggets also had the 22nd overall selection in the draft, in which they selected Jarrett Jack, but sent him to the Portland Trail Blazers for rights to Portland's 27th overall pick, Linas Kleiza.[38] In 2005–06, for the first time in 18 years, the club won the Northwest division title.[39] This placed the team in the third seed of the Western Conference playoffs. Denver played the Los Angeles Clippers who, despite their sixth seeding, had a better regular season record. As a result, the Clippers received home-court advantage. They defeated the Nuggets in 5 games. Shortly after, the Nuggets announced that general manager Kiki Vandeweghe's contract would not be renewed. He was replaced by Mark Warkentien.[40] On December 18, 2006, team co-captain Carmelo Anthony, shooting guard J. R. Smith and power forward Nenê were suspended by the NBA (15, 10 and one games respectively) for a fight that occurred in the last two minutes of a game against the New York Knicks two days earlier.[41][42] The fight was sparked by Knicks rookie Mardy Collins, when he tackled J. R. Smith on a breakaway layup. According to Anthony, Knicks coach Isiah Thomas warned him to not go in the paint shortly before the hard foul.[43] On December 19, 2006, the Nuggets traded Joe Smith, Andre Miller and two first-round draft picks of the 2007 NBA draft to the Philadelphia 76ers for Ivan McFarlin and superstar Allen Iverson (McFarlin was waived immediately following the trade's approval). The moves gave the Nuggets the top two scorers in the league at the time in Anthony and Iverson, who were both scoring over 30 points per game at the time of the trade. On January 11, 2007, Earl Boykins, Julius Hodge and cash considerations were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, in exchange for point guard Steve Blake. With Iverson, many considered the Nuggets as one of the elite in the West. However, chemistry was an issue, as the Nuggets finished the season with the sixth seed, giving them a first-round matchup against the San Antonio Spurs. In the playoffs, the Nuggets took Game 1 and home-court advantage away from the Spurs. However, as had occurred in the 2005 playoffs, the Spurs bounced back to sweep the next four, as the Nuggets were eliminated in the first round in five games for the fourth straight year. On March 16, 2008, the Nuggets scored 168 points in a 168–116 home win over Seattle SuperSonics.[44] It was the third-most points scored for a regulation game in NBA history (The Nuggets and the Pistons hold the spot for most combined points scored in a game which was over 360 points total.)[44] They finished the 2007–08 NBA season with exactly 50 wins as well as finishing the first half of that season 25–16 (50–32 overall record, tied for the third-best all-time Nuggets record since the team officially joined the NBA in 1976), following a 120–111 home victory over the Memphis Grizzlies in the last game of the season.[45] It was the first time since the 1987–88 NBA season that the Nuggets finished with at least 50 wins in a season.[45] Denver ended up as the eighth seed in the Western Conference of the 2008 NBA playoffs, and their 50 wins marked the highest win total for an eighth seed in NBA history.[45] It also meant that for the first time in NBA history, all eight playoff seeds in a Conference had at least 50 wins. The Nuggets faced the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers (57–25) in the first round. The seven games separating the Nuggets and the Lakers overall records is the closest margin between an eighth seed and a top seed since the NBA went to a 16-team playoff format in 1983–84.[45] However, the Lakers swept them in four games, marking the second time in NBA history that a 50-win team was swept in a best-of-seven playoff series in the first round. It was Denver's fifth straight first-round loss.[46][47] On July 16, 2008, at the end of the 2007–08 NBA season, the Nuggets traded former NBA Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Camby to the Los Angeles Clippers for a second-round draft pick (that was then traded to the New York Knicks for Renaldo Balkman). On November 3, 2008, guard Allen Iverson was traded to the Detroit Pistons for Chauncey Billups, Antonio McDyess, and Cheikh Samb (part of the trade exception from the Marcus Camby trade was used to allow the deal to go through). McDyess was waived though on November 10, 2008, and he returned to Detroit shortly afterwards. With Carmelo Anthony averaging 22.8 points per game and Billups averaging 6.4 assists in the 2008–09 NBA season the Nuggets accomplished a great number of franchise milestones. Their 54–28 record matched the most wins the franchise had gotten since their induction in the NBA; their 27–14 start was also a record for wins in the first half of a season. This also marked the first time in the franchise's history the team had back-to-back 50-win seasons. They led the Northwest division for much of the season, eventually winning the division and placing #2 in the Western Conference, matching the highest the team has ever been seeded for the playoffs. General manager Mark Warkentien won the NBA Executive of the Year Award for the Nuggets' improvement. They won Game 1 of the playoffs against the New Orleans Hornets, the first time they had home-court advantage since 1988 and also, the 29-point victory was the largest victory for any team for Game 1 of the first round of the 2009 NBA playoffs. Chauncey Billups set a Nuggets franchise record with the most three-pointers in a playoff game with 8, and his 19 three-pointers in total is also a Nuggets record for threes made in a playoff series.[48] They went on to beat the Hornets in 5, including a 58-point victory in Game 4 which matched the most lopsided win in NBA playoff history. They then went on to beat the sixth seed Dallas Mavericks four games to one in the Conference Semifinals to make their first trip to the Western Conference Finals since 1985. That was also the first time the Nuggets had ever led 3–0 in a best-of-seven series. Up to that point, they held an NBA Playoffs-high in three-pointers made and a 16-point average margin of victory, the largest average margin of victory in the first 10 playoff games in NBA Playoff history. They lost the first game of the Western Conference Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers but won the second game to tie the series. Anthony became the first Denver player to score at least 30 points in five consecutive playoff games since the Nuggets joined the NBA in 1976. They lost the series 4–2, ending Denver's longest playoff run in team history.[49] In the 2009 NBA draft, the Nuggets traded a first-round draft pick acquired from the Charlotte Bobcats to the Minnesota Timberwolves for the rights to rookie Ty Lawson, who was drafted 18th overall. On July 13, 2009, the Nuggets traded a second-round draft pick to the Detroit Pistons for Arron Afflalo (part of the trade exception from the Iverson trade was used to allow the deal to go through) and Walter Sharpe. Afflalo replaced starting guard Dahntay Jones, who signed with the Indiana Pacers.[50] However, on August 10, the Nuggets lost forward Linas Kleiza, who signed with Olympiacos Piraeus of the Greek League.[51] The 2009–10 season saw Anthony average 28.2 points per game and Billups average a career-high 19.6 points per game. In the opening two games of the season, Anthony totaled 71 points, scoring 30 points in the home opener and 41 the next night, in wins against division rivals Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers, respectively. Anthony became one of two players in the Nuggets' history to open with more than 70 points through two games (Alex English also accomplished the feat). It was also only the second time since 1987 that the Nuggets started the season 2–0.[52] They later went 3–0, 4–0, and 5–0 for the first time since 1985 after defeating the Memphis Grizzlies, Indiana Pacers, and New Jersey Nets respectively. Despite injuries that caused all three captains – Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, and Kenyon Martin – to miss a total of 46 games, and then later on in the second half of the season the absence of head coach George Karl, who underwent treatment for neck and throat cancer, the Nuggets were still able to win 53 games (third consecutive 50-win season, a Nuggets first) for the season which gave them a second consecutive Northwest division title and finished as the fourth seed in the West Conference. However, they were eliminated by the Utah Jazz 4–2, their sixth first-round elimination in 7 seasons. Anthony averaged a career-high 30.7 points per game in the playoffs. On July 14, 2010, the Nuggets bolstered their frontcourt depth by signing Al Harrington.[53] During the 2010 off-season, Masai Ujiri replaced Mark Warkentien as the general manager, while Josh Kroenke was named team president. On February 22, 2011, after months of speculation that he wanted to leave the Nuggets, Carmelo Anthony was traded along with Chauncey Billups, Anthony Carter, Shelden Williams and Renaldo Balkman to the New York Knicks in a multi-player deal also involving the Minnesota Timberwolves in which the Nuggets received Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Timofey Mozgov and Kosta Koufos. On the day when the trade was done, the Nuggets were left with nine players to play against the Memphis Grizzlies. The Nuggets won 120–107, where they led by as many as 27 points. In the closing minutes of the game, the arena resounded with chants of \"Who needs Melo?\" George Karl said after the game, \"Our guys, when their backs are confronted with a difficult situation, they usually play at a high level. We always react to tough situations in a very positive way.\" However, the trade only seemed to make them better. Post-trade, the Nuggets averaged 24.1 assists, showing their newfound teamwork. The defense of the Nuggets also improved, from allowing 105.2 points per game before the trade to 97.1 points per game for the remainder of the season. [54] Despite the franchise-changing trade which saw eighteen different starting lineups through the whole season, Denver finished with 50 wins (fourth consecutive 50 win seasons for the first time in Nuggets history), clinching the fifth seed of the Western Conference. They met the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the playoffs and lost four games to one. The first full season of the post-Melo Nuggets saw the steady rise of Danilo Gallinari, who averaged 17 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.6 assists through the first 25 games of the season, which resulted to the Nuggets' best start through the first 20 games. However, Gallinari sustained injuries to his ankle, thumb, and wrist that year. On March 15, 2012, the Nuggets decided to make their team younger by trading Nenê, who had played the previous nine seasons for Denver, to the Washington Wizards for JaVale McGee.[55] In his first game as a Nugget, McGee made a putback dunk off an Arron Afflalo miss which proved to be the game-winning basket in Denver's 116–115 victory over the Detroit Pistons. In two of the Nuggets' final games of their season, McGee finally earned national attention when he had a 16-point, 15-rebound effort, and a 21-point, 14-rebound effort in Denver's playoff series against the Los Angeles Lakers. These performances helped the Nuggets come back from a 2–0 and a 3–1 series deficit, but the Nuggets eventually lost in Game 7, 87–96. On August 10, 2012, Denver was involved in a four-team trade where they received All-Star Andre Iguodala and sent Arron Afflalo and Al Harrington to the Orlando Magic. This same trade also sent Dwight Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers. After the trade, Iguodala tweeted \"I'm excited to be joining the Denver Nuggets and I know my best basketball is ahead of me!\"[56] Despite losing their first three games, the 2012–2013 Nuggets finished with a franchise-best 57–25 record, and a 38–3 record in Pepsi Center (the Washington Wizards, Miami Heat, and Minnesota Timberwolves were the only 3 visitors to defeat Denver on their home during the regular season). Denver also clinched the third seed in the Western Conference, with a first-round matchup with the Golden State Warriors. The Nuggets won Game 1 97–95 on their home court on a last-second Andre Miller game-winner, but the Warriors won the next three games, putting the Nuggets on the brink of elimination. Denver won Game 5 at home to keep their season alive, but the Warriors eliminated the Nuggets in Game 6, winning 92–88 in Oakland. It was Denver's ninth first-round loss in the previous 10 seasons, and the eighth of Karl's tenure. Although Karl won that year's NBA Coach of the Year Award and had led Denver to the playoffs in every year of his nine-year tenure, it was not enough to keep him from being fired after the season. Along with Karl being fired, Denver saw a major shake-up in the front office with Executive of the Year Masai Ujiri accepting the general manager position with the Toronto Raptors[57] and vice-president Pete D'Alessandro, who was expected to replace Ujiri, being named general manager of the Sacramento Kings. On June 21, 2013, Tim Connelly was announced as the new general manager.[58] To replace Karl, the Nuggets hired the Indiana Pacers' associate head coach, former NBA player, Brian Shaw. Guard-forward Andre Iguodala was sent to the Golden State Warriors in a sign-and-trade in which they acquired guard Randy Foye from the Utah Jazz. They also signed center-forward JJ Hickson, who was previously with the Portland Trail Blazers and 5' 9\" guard Nate Robinson, who played for the Bulls during the 2012–2013 season. They also acquired Darrell Arthur from the Memphis Grizzlies and 55th pick Joffrey Lauvergne in return for Kosta Koufos.[59] In a tough 2013–14 season which saw numerous injuries to key players missing a significant amount of the season, the Nuggets finished with 36 wins, their worst in 11 years, and missed the playoffs. During the 2014 off-season, the Nuggets brought back Arron Afflalo for whom they traded Evan Fournier. During the 2014 NBA draft, Denver traded their first lottery pick (11th overall pick) since 2003 to Chicago to acquire two later first-round draft picks, which were used to draft Jusuf Nurkić and Gary Harris; with the 41st overall pick and their first pick of the second round of the draft, the Nuggets selected 19-year old Nikola Jokić from Mega Basket in Serbia. On March 3, 2015, general manager Tim Connelly announced the Nuggets fired head coach Brian Shaw and named Melvin Hunt interim head coach.[60] On June 15, 2015, at the end of the 2014–15 season, Michael Malone was named as the new head coach of the Denver Nuggets.[61] Entering the 2015 NBA draft with their lowest draft pick (seventh overall) since 2003, the Nuggets drafted Emmanuel Mudiay who was widely regarded as the top point guard of the draft, leading to speculation that current starting point guard, Ty Lawson, would be traded.[62] On July 14, 2015, Lawson was arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of driving under the influence, his second in six months.[63] The Nuggets traded Lawson a week later to the Houston Rockets along with a second round draft pick for Joey Dorsey, Nick Johnson, Kostas Papanikolaou, Pablo Prigioni (all of whom were waived), and a first round pick that was used to draft Juan Hernangómez.[64] Under Michael Malone's leadership, the Denver Nuggets slightly started to improve while primarily relying on the youth movement consisting of Emmanuel Mudiay, Nikola Jokić, Gary Harris and later also on the recovered Jusuf Nurkić. On January 27, 2016, it was announced that both Mudiay and Jokić would participate in BBVA Compass Rising Stars Challenge during NBA All-Star 2016.[65] On February 18, the Denver Nuggets announced that they decided to trade veteran shooting guard Randy Foye to Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for D. J. Augustin, Steve Novak and two second-round draft picks.[66] One day later, JJ Hickson and the newly acquired Novak were waived.[67] Over the course of the 2016 NBA draft, the Denver Nuggets added the Kentucky guard Jamal Murray as well as Juan Hernangómez, Malik Beasley, and Petr Cornelie.[68] Meanwhile, their 56th pick was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder. On February 13, 2017, Nurkić was traded, along with the rights to the Memphis Grizzlies' 2017 first-round draft pick, to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Mason Plumlee, a 2018 second-round pick and cash considerations.[69] Thanks to the continuing improvements of Nikola Jokić, the Nuggets would make significant improvements to their team, although they would be just one game shy from reaching the 2017 NBA playoffs, finishing 9th in the Western Conference.[70] On June 15, 2017, the Nuggets officially promoted both Artūras Karnišovas and Tim Connelly to become the team's newest general manager and president of basketball operations respectively.[71][72] In the 2017 NBA draft, the Denver Nuggets selected Tyler Lydon, Vlatko Čančar, and Monté Morris, with the 24th, 49th, and 51st picks respectively. On December 2, 2017, the Nuggets would retire Fat Lever's number during their 115–100 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite compiling their first winning season since 2013, they missed the 2018 playoffs, the fifth straight missed playoff run, after losing to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a win-or-go-home situation in the regular season finale, also ending the Timberwolves' 14-year playoff drought.[73] The Nuggets finished 9th, one game behind the eighth seeded Timberwolves.[74] In the 2018 NBA draft, the Nuggets drafted Michael Porter Jr. and traded with the Magic to get Jarred Vanderbilt. On January 31, 2019, Jokić received his first All-Star selection as a Western Conference reserve for the 2019 NBA All-Star Game, becoming the Nuggets' first All-Star since Carmelo Anthony in 2011.[75] The Nuggets finished the 2018–2019 season with 54 wins, first in their division and second in the Western Conference, and made the playoffs for the first time since 2012–2013.[76][77] In the first round, the Nuggets played against the San Antonio Spurs, winning the round in game seven. The Nuggets were eliminated in the second round by the Portland Trail Blazers in 7 games.[76] Game three of the second round had four overtimes, tying a 1953 game for the longest NBA playoff game.[78] Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Nuggets were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season.[79] Led by Jokić and Murray, the team is the first in NBA playoff history to consecutively come from 3–1 deficits. In the first round, they defeated Utah in 7 games in a record-breaking scoring duel between Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell.[80] The Nuggets repeated the same feat against Paul George and Kawhi Leonard of the Los Angeles Clippers in the second round, becoming the only team in NBA history to overcome multiple 3–1 deficits in a single playoff run. In the Western Conference Finals, the Nuggets' title race came to an end, after the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers trounced them in five games.[81] In the 2020–21 NBA season, Jokić was named the NBA Most Valuable Player, becoming the first center since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000 and the first player in Nuggets franchise history to win the award. He also became the first Serbian player, third European player overall (along with Dirk Nowitzki of Germany and Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece), and sixth international player to ever win the award (along with Hakeem Olajuwon of Nigeria, Tim Duncan of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Steve Nash of Canada, Nowitzki of Germany, and Antetokounmpo of Greece). Jokić also became the lowest ever drafted player at #41, and the first player in NBA history to be selected in the second round of the common era draft, to win the MVP award.[82][83] Although the Nuggets finished the season with the third seed in the Western Conference and beat their first round opponents, the Portland Trail Blazers, in six games, the loss of starting guard Jamal Murray to an ACL tear contributed to the team's sweep by the eventual Western Conference champions, the second-seeded Phoenix Suns.[84] The following season saw more poor injury luck for the Denver Nuggets. Nine games into the season, starting forward Michael Porter Jr. joined Murray on the sidelines with season-ending back surgery.[85] In spite of the injuries, Jokić and starting power forward Aaron Gordon carried the Nuggets to the sixth seed, the former becoming the first-ever player in NBA history to accumulate 2,000 points, 1,000 rebounds, and 500 assists in a single season.[86] Jokić went on to receive the Kia MVP Award for the second year in a row – joining 12 other players in NBA history to achieve the award in back to back years, and the first center to do so since Moses Malone in 1982 and 1983.[86] In the first round of the playoffs, Jokić's Nuggets fell five games to the Golden State Warriors, who went on to win the championship. In the 2022–23 season, elevated by the offseason acquisitions of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Bruce Brown, the Nuggets secured the top seed in the Western Conference with 53 wins and 29 losses, two games ahead of the Memphis Grizzlies. The Nuggets defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 4–1 in the first round of the 2023 playoffs, before defeating the Phoenix Suns 4–2 in the Conference Semifinals. The Nuggets' playoff dominance continued in the Conference Finals; spearheaded by outstanding play from Jokić, who was named the Western Conference Finals Most Valuable Player, the team swept the Los Angeles Lakers in four games to advance to their first ever NBA Finals.[87] This also marked the first time that the Nuggets had beaten the Lakers in a playoff series (having previously been 0–7 against them), as well as the first playoff series sweep in franchise history.[88] In the NBA Finals, on June 12, 2023, the Nuggets would beat the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat 4–1 to win their first NBA championship, with Jokić receiving the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.[89][90] In the 2023–24 season, the first season in league history with the Nuggets as defending champions, Denver finished with the 2nd seed in the Western Conference with a 57–25 record, tying with the Oklahoma City Thunder and finishing 1 game ahead of the Minnesota Timberwolves. On May 8, 2024, Nikola Jokić won his third Most Valuable Player Award, becoming the ninth player to do so and tying with other greats such as Moses Malone and Larry Bird. In the first round of the playoffs against the Lakers, the Nuggets won the series 4–1, with Jamal Murray hitting several game-winning shots to pull out a win. However, in the conference semifinals against the Timberwolves, the Nuggets lost in Game 7 from a comeback after being up by 20 points in the 3rd quarter, and ultimately losing the game 98–90.[91] List of the last five seasons completed by the Nuggets. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Denver Nuggets seasons. Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage The Nuggets have displayed numerous color schemes, logos, and uniforms throughout their franchise history, including their days in the American Basketball Association (ABA) as the \"Denver Rockets.\" From 1967–68 through 1970–71, the Denver Rockets' logos, uniforms, and colors were black, orange, and white. From 1971–72 through 1973–74, the Rockets wore gold and purple (Columbine blue) uniforms, and their logo featured a cartoonish rocket bouncing a gold and purple basketball, with a purple and white snow-capped mountain in the background.[93] During the Nuggets' final two seasons in the ABA, the team's logo featured a cartoonish miner known as \"Maxie The Miner,\" with a large red beard, a pick-axe in one hand and a red and blue basketball in the other hand. When the Nuggets joined the NBA in the 1976–77 season, they retained the pick-axe logo on their jerseys from the ABA days. The home uniforms feature \"Nuggets\" in red, with a red pick-axe inside a blue oval, and gold numbers with blue trim in front, blue numbers and letters at the back. The road uniforms were blue, with \"Denver\" in blue with a blue pick-axe in a red oval, and gold numbers in front, white numbers and letters at the back. The Nuggets simplified their uniforms following their inaugural season in the NBA. From 1977 to 1982, their home uniforms were white, with a \"Nuggets\" script written across the chest in a darker royal blue, with gold trim around the script and jersey numbers. The royal blue away jersey had \"Denver\" written across the chest in white, with gold trim. From 1982–83 through 1992–93, the Nuggets wore the Denver \"rainbow city\" skyline across the chest and back on both the home and away uniforms. Some fans also call the iconic 1980s logo the \"Tetris\" logo, due to the buildings that shadow the mountains on the logo which are in the shape of squares. The initial home uniforms were white with navy and green trim, with \"Nuggets\" and the uniform number in gold with blue trim. The player names were written in block lettering and in a straight position. In 1985, they changed the shade of blue to royal and eliminated green, and in 1986, changed the back numbers to royal blue. In 1991, coinciding with the debut of Dikembe Mutombo, the word \"Nuggets\" became white with royal blue and gold trim. The road uniforms were initially navy blue with green trim, with \"Denver\" and the uniform number in white with gold trim, before likewise changing it to royal blue, with gold serifed block letters for player names in an arch (royal blue in home uniforms). The font and \"skyline\" logo were later reintroduced on alternate jerseys beginning with the 2012–13 season. For the 1993–94 season, the Nuggets drastically changed their look, with a navy blue, metallic gold and maroon color scheme on their uniforms. The \"rainbow city skyline,\" which had been synonymous with the team since 1981, was replaced with a logo that featured a navy blue snow-capped mountain above an enlarged western-style \"Nuggets\" wordmark in metallic gold, and a curved maroon ribbon with a \"Denver\" wordmark positioned in between the mountain and the \"Nuggets\" wordmark. The home jerseys had a \"Nuggets\" script in a modified version of the typeface Aachen across the chest in navy blue, with maroon and metallic gold trim around the script and numbers, while the navy blue away jerseys had the same script in metallic gold, with maroon and white trim. The Nuggets wore these uniforms for a decade, until the end of the 2002–03 season. For the 2003–04 season, the Nuggets made another uniform change, coinciding with Carmelo Anthony's debut, with a color scheme of powder blue, gold (yellow) and royal blue. The primary logo, featuring a snow-capped mountain, curved ribbon with a \"Denver\" wordmark and an enlarged western-style \"Nuggets\" workmark (see previous section), was modified, with the mountain royal blue, the ribbon powder blue and the \"Nuggets\" wordmark a golden yellow. Like the 1990s uniforms, the Nuggets' revised jerseys also had the \"Aachen\" typeface across the chest—it was \"Nuggets\" in powder blue, with royal blue and gold trim on the home white jersey, while the powder blue road jerseys had \"Denver\" in white, with gold and royal blue trim. These jerseys, along with the team logo, were tweaked prior to the 2008–09 season, with the royal blue replaced by the shade of navy blue that was part of the team's color scheme from 1993 to 2003. These jerseys were used until the 2014–15 season, while the snow-capped mountain logo would serve as the team's primary logo until the 2017–18 season. In the 2005–06 season, the Nuggets also introduced an alternate logo, as well as an alternate navy blue uniform. The alternate logo featured twin intersecting gold pick-axes in a powder blue circle, with a half-white/half-yellow \"mountain peaks\" at the top of the circle and a basketball with gold outlining and navy blue accents at the bottom of the circle. The navy blue jersey featured an alternate \"Nuggets\" script in gold, with navy blue interior trim and powder blue outlining. This uniform was used until the end of the 2011–12 season, while the circular \"pick axe\" logo would become the team's new primary logo for the 2018–19 season. While the \"pick axe\" logo was officially introduced in 2005, former NBA director of creative services Tom O'Grady had planned on introducing the logo as early as 1998, but then-NBA commissioner David Stern was not informed of the possible logo change. As a result, the logo was shelved until it was brought in as an alternate seven years later.[94] For the 2012–13 season, the Nuggets unveiled a gold alternate jersey, replacing the aforementioned navy blue jerseys that had been used during the previous seven seasons. This jersey featured a return to the Denver \"rainbow skyline\" logo, but used the team's \"Aachen\" typeface and color scheme of powder blue, navy and gold.[95] For the 2015–16 season, the Nuggets modified the script and numbering fonts on their home and away jerseys, with a gold \"Nuggets\" script on the home white jersey and a gold \"Denver\" script on the powder blue away jersey—both with the \"Coliseum\" typeface. Navy blue numerals trimmed in gold, as well as navy blue nameplates, were featured on both the home and away jerseys. The alternate gold \"skyline\" jerseys were also tweaked, with a retro \"Nuggets\" wordmark (that was used on the 1980s rainbow skyline jerseys) in navy blue trimmed in white. The numerals were also modified with the Coliseum typeface, but remained white, with powder blue interior trim and navy blue exterior outlining.[96] The Nuggets updated their uniforms for the 2017–18 season. The light uniform (dubbed by Nike as the \"Association\" jersey), the dark uniform (dubbed by Nike as the \"Icon\" jersey) and the alternate uniform (dubbed by Nike as the \"Statement\" jersey) saw the return of navy blue as a primary color for the first time since the 2002–03 season, while powder blue was drastically diminished and relegated to trim color status. Slight tweaks were made to the striping and lettering.[97][98] The Nuggets' gold \"Statement\" jersey made some noticeable alterations as well, relegating the navy, powder blue and white rainbow to the sides and relocating the number to the bottom. Western Union became the team's jersey sponsor. For the 2018–19 season, the Nuggets modified their logos and uniforms, featuring various color schemes that the team has worn in their history. The current color scheme consists of midnight blue (navy), sunshine yellow, flatirons red (maroon) and skyline blue (royal)—the latter color is only featured on the \"Statement\" jersey and two of the team's new alternate logos. Powder blue, which had been part of the team's color scheme since 2003, was eliminated from all logos and uniforms. The white \"Association\" jersey features \"Nuggets\" in flatirons red, with sunshine yellow trim and midnight blue numbers with sunshine yellow trim, while the midnight blue \"Icon\" jersey features \"Denver\" in sunshine yellow, with flatirons red trim and white numbers with flatirons red trim. Both sets also include mountain peak striping on the shorts and the pick axe logo on the waistline. The skyline blue \"Statement\" jersey features \"Mile High City\" in white surrounding sunshine yellow numbers, plus a midnight blue mountain peak silhouette and a sunshine yellow pick axe logo on the sides of the shorts. A modernized version of the skyline logo adorns the waistline. The circular \"pick axe logo,\" which had served as the Nuggets' alternate logo since 2005, became the team's new primary logo, replacing the snow-capped mountain/enlarged western-style wordmark logo that had served as the team's primary logo (in three different versions) since 1993. The colors on the circular pick axe logo were also modified with the team's new color scheme.[6][99] Prior to the 2022–23 season, the \"Statement\" uniform was slightly tweaked with greater usage of gold on the letters, and red on the trim and mountain silhouette. Two \"gold strikes\" were also added between the words \"Mile High City\".[100] In the 2017–18 season, Nike released a fourth uniform option known as the \"City\" series, which is updated annually. The Nuggets' first \"City\" uniform had a navy base, highlighting the pick-axe and mountain logo in front and incorporating sublimated mountain peak patterns on the shorts.[101] The Nuggets' 2018–19 \"City\" uniform was a callback to the team's 1982–93 rainbow uniforms, featuring a sublimated pattern of the rainbow logo and navy lettering.[102] The same design was used for the 2019–20 \"City\" uniform, albeit with a black base and white letters.[103] For 2020–21, the Nuggets kept the same \"City\" uniform design but eliminated the rainbow pattern and went with a red/yellow/orange gradient within the mountains and a flatirons red base.[104] The Nuggets were one of 27 teams to receive mashup \"City\" uniforms as part of the NBA's 75th anniversary during the 2021–22 season. Denver's uniform featured various design takes from past uniforms, including the throwback \"Nuggets\" wordmark and rainbow pattern from the 1980s uniforms, navy blue and stylized numbers from the 1993–2003 uniforms, Maxie the Miner and striping based on the ABA Nuggets uniforms, and the powder blue and \"DN\" alternate logo from the 2000s uniforms.[105] For the 2022–23 \"City\" uniform, the Nuggets wore white uniforms with navy letters, gold and red trim, and royal blue/white gradient stripes. The uniform was inspired by Denver's iconic architecture and its civic organizations.[106] For their 2023–24 \"City\" uniform, the Nuggets revisited the mountain-themed motif from their 1980s \"Rainbow\" uniforms. The black-based design featured sublimated blue lines representing the Rocky Mountains, and \"5280\" below in gold to symbolize Denver's high elevation. Other elements include a secondary team logo on the shorts, \"Denver\" wordmark on the waistband, white numbers above the left chest, and burgundy stripes.[107][108] The uniform would be worn for select games, and in home games during the 2023 NBA in-season tournament, it would be paired with a specially-painted alternate blue court with a gold middle strip and the silhouette of the NBA Cup.[109] As part of the 2024–25 \"City\" uniform, the Nuggets revisited the \"Rainbow\" theme last seen in the 2018–2020 \"City\" uniforms, as well as last season's \"5280\" uniform. The white-based uniform featured \"5280\" in white trimmed in black along with rainbow mountain accents along the text and sides.[110] As a reward for making the NBA playoffs the previous season, 16 teams were given an exclusive fifth or sixth uniform option: the \"Earned\" uniform. The Nuggets, having qualified for the 2020 NBA playoffs, were given this option in the 2020–21 season. The white-based design featured a modified pickaxe logo, with the top half in skyline blue and the bottom half in flatirons red. Names are written in blue and numbers are written in red with gold trim.[111] Roster Last transaction: December 1, 2024 The Nuggets hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA team. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[112] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.

                "content": "Week 16’s iteration of “Thursday Night Football” was all Denver Broncos ... until it wasn’t. The Los Angeles Chargers came back from an 11-point deficit to take home the prime-time win, 34-27. To complete the comeback, they excelled in all phases of the game. Quarterback Justin Herbert threw for 284 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. Los Angeles’ offensive play-makers also combined for 117 rushing yards — including 28 from Herbert and two rushing touchdowns — both of which were from tailback Gus Edwards. Defensively, the Chargers were able to create chaos in their pass-rush, particularly in the second half, and kept Broncos quarterback Bo Nix out of rhythm. And on special teams, Los Angeles accomplished something no team had since 1976: scored three points on a fair-catch kick. It was the first time any team had attempted such a play since 2019, and kicker Cameron Dicker’s 57-yarder was the longest successful attempt in NFL history. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. The Chargers now hold the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Broncos with their second win over Denver this season. The win also boosted Los Angeles’ playoff odds to 97%, according to NFL.com. For the Broncos, the loss slightly hurt their playoff chances. However, they still remain on the right side of the playoff bubble and have an 85% chance to make the postseason. DO YOU LIKE FOOTBALL? Then you'll enjoy getting our NFL newsletter delivered to your inbox Nick Niemann, a linebacker and member of Los Angeles' hands team, was able to hold onto the high-bouncing kick by his fingertips. The Chargers take over possession with 57 seconds left and will try to kneel out the clock. Will Lutz pulled his team back within one score on his second field goal of the night. The 55-yard kick was Lutz's longest made field goal of the year. With under one minute to play, he'll attempt an onside kick to keep the Broncos' winning hopes alive Just two plays after Gus Edwards' explosive, 43-yard play put the Chargers in Denver territory, Hassan Haskins broke away on a 34-yard catch-and-run off of a screen pass. The score gave Los Angeles its first two-score lead of the night. The Chargers, who once trailed by 11 points in the third quarter, now lead, 34-24. There are just under two minutes left to play as the Broncos drive. Edwards, who had already scored two touchdowns, had the Chargers' most explosive play of the night when he broke through multiple tackles for a long run. The play advanced Los Angeles from its own 26 to Denver's 31. Derius Davis, a second-year receiver, scored the first receiving touchdown of his NFL career on a 19-yard bullet pass from quarterback Justin Herbert. It was the second touchdown of Davis' career including a punt return score he had as a rookie. Joshua Palmer added some extra juice with a nice, one-handed snag in the back of the end zone for a two-point conversion. It's 27-24 Chargers with 12:23 left to play. It's a five-point game after veteran running back Gus Edwards hit pay dirt from five yards out and the Chargers failed their two-point conversion attempt. The Broncos still lead, 24-19, with under three minutes to go in the third quarter. Will Lutz attempted his first field goal of the night from 41 yards out and knocked it through for the three points, giving Denver another two-score lead. The Broncos hold a 24-13 with 8:31 left in the third quarter. Near the start of the second half, the Chargers announced that linebacker Denzel Perryman is questionable to return to action after sustaining a groin injury. Troy Dye is listed as the linebacker behind him on the depth chart. Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh dug deep into the rule book for the final points of the first half. A 15-yard fair-catch interference penalty against the Broncos on a punt with no time left on the clock in the first half. The half can't end on a defensive penalty, so the Chargers had an opportunity for an untimed down with 0:00 on the clock. Harbaugh sent Cameron Dicker out to attempt a fair-catch kick. No Broncos players were allowed to rush and the play looked similar to a traditional kickoff, though from midfield and Dicker aiming for the uprights. Dicker's 57-yard attempt was good, and it was the first successful free kick in the NFL since 1976. It also was the longest fair-catch kick in NFL history. Ray Wersching was the last kicker to successfully make a fair-catch field goal, doing so for the Chargers against the Bills on Nov. 21, 1976. Between Wersching's free kick field goal and that of Dicker on Thursday night, NFL kickers were 0-9 on such attempts. It's all about the rookies for Denver tonight! Kris Abrams-Draine, filling in for the injured Riley Moss, was the latest first-year to make an impact against the Chargers. The cornerback read Justin Herbert's throw perfectly and secured the takeaway for the Broncos just in front of the goal line. It gave Denver the ball once again on its own 18 and less than a minute to play. Devaughn Vele, the seventh-round rookie out of Utah, caught a 6-yard pass from quarterback Bo Nix to give the Broncos a two-score lead. It was the final piece of a six-play drive in which Denver only attempted passing plays. It's 21-10 Broncos with 6:22 in the second quarter. Broncos defensive end Zach Allen brought down running back Gus Edwards behind the line of scrimmage on a third-and-inches play. Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh opted to try the field goal on the ensuing fourth-and-3, and Cameron Dicker converted on his first field goal chance of the night. It's 14-10 Broncos with under nine minutes to play in the first half. Denver fullback Michael Burton ran a short out route to the flat, and quarterback Bo Nix made the easy toss for a 1-yard touchdown. It was the third score of the 10-year veteran's career and second in three weeks. The Broncos lead, 14-7, with just over 12 minutes to go until halftime. Both teams have one rushing touchdown through 15 minutes: Rookie Audric Estime has it for the Broncos, and veteran Gus Edwards was responsible for the Chargers'. Denver has the ball on the Los Angeles 33-yard line on first-and-10 to begin the second quarter. Los Angeles running back Gus Edwards drove his way through a pile and leaned forward for his third touchdown of the year. It also brought his team back even with Denver just one drive after the Broncos took an early lead. It's 7-7 with three minutes left in the first quarter. Chargers safety Marcus Maye, who was filling in for Elijah Molden, headed to the locker room to receive X-rays on his ankle. The team designated him as questionable for the remainder of the game. Los Angeles' safety depth will be tested further with Molden hurt, Maye now questionable and Alohi Gillman on IR. Audric Estime, the Broncos' rookie running back out of Notre Dame, followed his blockers on a 3-yard touchdown run. His first career score was the finishing touch on a 10-play, 72-yard drive by Denver to open the scoring. It's 7-0 Broncos halfway through the first quarter.

                "content": "With the game still in the balance, and the Broncos needing a stop, the Chargers stormed down the field on a six play, 2:01 drive that sealed the game for LA. Herbert's best throw of the day was his shortest one to Hassan Haskins who did the dirty work taking it 34 yards for the TD that put the nail in the Broncos' coffin. The Chargers are now tied with the Broncos at 9-6 but because they won both matchups against Denver, they hold the tie breaker. The Ravens are the other team in the hunt for the top Wild Card spot, but. it looks as if it's going to be those three teams that get into the post season as an AFC Wild Cards. Of course a lot depends on what happens in the game between the Steelers and Ravens on Saturday. Joshua Palmer made an insane catch in the back of the end zone for the two point conversion that put the Chargers up three. That's just the kind of second half it was for LA who seemed to have everything bouncing their way after the Fair Catch Kick call to end the first half. Herbert really turned it on in the second half as he used his feet to get out of the pocket and scramble when he needed to. This time he looked like he might get sacked but instead he throws a dime to Derius Davis in the end zone to give the Chargers their first lead of the night. The defense started rolling and that sparked the offense to start getting into the end zone. The first of the second half came on this Gus Edwards run just a play after a late hit on the QB flag gave LA a first down instead of a 4th and 5. LA took advantage of the flag by turning three points into seven with Edwards' second TD of the night. An incomplete pass and a Chargers timeout stopped the clock with 8 seconds left and forced the Broncos to punt. On the return, Denver was called for a kick catch interference flag as the clock expired, which meant the Chargers got a free 15 yards and put them in range to kick a Fair Catch Kick which looks more like a kick off then a field goal. But Cameron Dicker came on the field and kicked the 57 yarder on the first Fair Catch Kick in almost half a decade. The Chargers were driving down field late in the first half, trying to chip into the lead, but Justin Herbert made one of his only bad throws of the night when he got picked in the end zone by Kris Abrams-Davis as it looked like Denver was going into half with all the momentum. Denver would extend the lead after a 54 yard screen pass by Marvin Mims Jr. set up Nix's second TD pass of the day. That would be the last time the Broncos got into the end zone all night. The Chargers defense woke up and looked like the top ranked defense that they were earlier in the year. Nix ended the night with 263 yards and 2 TDs on 29/40 passing, but like the rushing game, most of that came in the first half. It looked like there was no stopping the Broncos early on as they continued to ground and pound which opened up the passing game for Bo Nix. Nix found his full back MIchael Burton with the one yard TD pass as Denver scored on their first two drives of the night. The Chargers would respond with a TD drive of their own as Justin Herbert set up this TD with a long pass Joshua Palmer that put LA at the 3 yard line. Gus Edwards would cap the drive with a feisty run to tie the game up, but the offense would go quiet after that. The Los Angeles Chargers took a step closer to the playoffs with a big win over their division rival on Thursday Night Football. A big second half from Justin Herbert led the Chargers over the Broncos in the 34-27 win from Sofi Stadium. It wasn't the prettiest of starts for the Chargers who went three and out on their first drive of the game and then let the Broncos march down the field to put the opening TD on the board. The Broncos has 110 yards rushing, but most of those came in the first half. IT'S ALL OVER!!! The Chargers comeback on the Broncos and draw level with them in the Wild Card race!

WE ARE BACK IN SOFI FOR THE SECOND HALF OF ACTION!!!! So this is it. It's been almost 50 years since we have seen a Fair Catch Kick, but Cameron Dicker makes history and closes the gap to 8 points before the halftime break. Herbert and the Chargres looked like they might put some points on the board before the half but his pass to the end zone was picked by Kris Abrams-Draine. The Chargers would get a chance to put points on the board in one of the strangest plays you probably haven't seen before in your life before tonight. After Marvin Mims took a WR screen 55 yards down the left sideline, the Broncos would be set up Nix with a chance to find Devaughn Vele this TD pass as Denver started the game scoring TDs on their first three drives. Nix and the Broncos would ease back down the field again and score another TD on their second drive. This time the Broncos opened up the passing game a bit and it was the fullback Michael Burton who made the short catch for a TD. The Chargers answered back after going three and out on their opening drive. Herbert marched his guys down the field and Gus Edwards punched in the TD. He's got 18 yards and Kimani Vidal leads LA with 22 on two rushes. The Chargers came out grounding and pounding. They ran the ball 7 times on their 10 play opening drive and the first TD was punched in by Audric Estime. The Broncos have 89 yards rushing by comittee. Estime leads all five rushers with 30 yards. WE ARE HEADING TO THE HALFTIME BREAK WITH THE BRONCOS UP 21-13. The Chargers line up for a free kick to end the half. That means LA got a field goal chance on what looked more like a kickoff return.

DEN is all over the Chargers on this huge game in the AFC Wild Card race. Herbert takes a shot to the end zone for Palmer, but that is picked off by Abrams-Draine who takes it to the DEN 18! 1st and 10 as the Broncos D comes up with a huge pick before the half.

LA get the ball from the 30 and Edwards gets four yards on the opening run up the game. 2nd and 6 from the DEN 33. Denver will kickoff after winning the toss and differing. These two teams are in playoff position because of their defenses. Unfortunately the Chargers defense has been getting exposed over the last few weeks as they play tougher and tougher opponents as the weeks go on. The Broncos are trending in the right direction and I think they are the better team. They are more complete. They have more ways to hurt you and they have gotten better since they lost to the Chargers earlier in the year, where LA has gotten worse. I think the Broncos win in a low scoring, defense struggle. AFC Standings heading into Week 16 Taking a look at the AFC standings, we see the Kansas City Chiefs at the top of the conference with a record of 13-1. They have clinched the AFC West for the ninth straight year. That means that these two teams playing tonight will have to settle for a Wild Card spot. The Broncos and the Ravens are currently tied at 9-5 but the Broncos lost to the Ravens earlier this season so Baltimore would get the top Wild Card spot if the season ended today. The Chargers currently have the third and final Wild Card spot, and are trying to fend off the 6-8 Dolphins, 6-8 Bengals and the 6-8 Colts. The Broncos are in the playoffs with a win today, while the Chargers can get into the playoffs with a win and a some help this weekend. If they win and the Dolphins and Colts lose, they are in. For the Chargers portion of the star watch, we highlight a star that hasn’t really been playing like a star this season. Herbert teamed up with new coach Jim Harbaugh who is know as a QB coaching savant. While his numbers haven’t been great, he also hasn’t made a whole lot of mistakes. He has 16 TDs and just 2 INTs while throwing for 2,959 yards. Modest, but clean numbers for a QB who saw a lot of his top weapons depart in the offseason. The other thing that Herbert has done this season is stay pretty healthy. In previous seasons he has battled injury after injury and despite playing and fighting through pain that has affected his play and his numbers. Last year he played just 13 games and passed for under 4,000 yards for the first time in his career. That looks like it will happen again this year, but if the Charger can make the playoffs, we know that he can turn it on at any point and with a defense like LA’s that could be trouble for teams in the postseason. Jim Harbaugh’s first year in LA has had it’s peaks and valleys but one thing has remained a constant for most of the year. The Chargers defense. They didn’t give up more than 20 points in their first 10 games of the season and in that time they went 7-3. Aside from their win over the Chargers, they really hadn’t beat a good, over .500 team. They have had a tough stretch of games over the last month, and have gone 1-3 in their last four games beating the Falcons but losing against the Ravens, Chiefs and then the Bucs last week. They are in great position to get a playoff spot, but the way they are playing should concern Jim Harbaugh and the Chargers fans. After a disastrous season last year, the Broncos and Sean Payton got rid of Russell Wilson and drafted rookie QB Bo Nix to be their face of the future. Expectations were realistic, and no one really though this team would be in this position already. Denver lost their first two games as Bo Nix looked like a rookie QB who wasn’t quite ready for the speed of the game. They would win five of their next six games, only losing to this Chargers team during that stretch and Nix looked like he was starting to find his groove. A couple of tough games against the Chiefs and Ravens gave them a bit of a reality dose but they would bounce back and win their next four games against the Falcons, Raiders, Browns and Colts to find themself in the drivers seat for a playoff spot in the AFC. The Chargers locked horns with another team in the chase for the playoffs, but only one team showed up and played like a playoff team. It wasn’t the Chargers. LA actually led in the first half, after the defense picked off Baker Mayfield and Justin Herbert connected with Quinton Johnston on the second of his two TD passes, but the LA offense would shut down after that. Baker and the Bucs switch on in the second half and scored 27 unanswered points to win 40-17. Herbert ended the game 21/33 with 195 yards and 2 TDs with 1 INT, but it wasn’t enough for the Chargers who are still waiting for their offense to turn on before they face a do or die situation in the playoffs, or before that. The defense is the star of the show for the Broncos, but in this part of the preview we would be remiss if we did highlight Bo Nix in the star watch section. Nix put himself in contention and is a real candidate for the rookie of the year after a fantastic stretch in which he had stretch of games in which he threw 16 TDs and just two INTs. It was a rough start to the season, as the rookie threw zero TDs and four picks in the first two weeks of the season, but Sean Payton took the first year QB under wing and has turned him into a fantastic quarterback that is leading his team to the playoffs in his first year. Nix has 2,972 yards, 20 TDs and 11 INTs, and while his passing stats are impressive it’s his legs that many teams don’t account for. He has 327 yards rushing and 4 TDs and has shown he can change the game by scrambling and stretching a defense out. He may or may not win ROTY, but he will be more than happy getting his team to the playoffs in his first year. The Broncos came off of their Week 14 BYE and looked a little sluggish in the first half of their game against the Colts. They went down 10-0 early in the second quarter and rookie Bo Nix was far from perfect, throwing three interceptions, but like they have done so often this year, the Denver defense bailed them out. They turned the Colts over five times, and none of those turnovers were bigger than the pick six that Nick Bonitto took to the house on a disastrous trick play for Indianapolis. Denver scored 21 points in the fourth quarter and won the game 31-13 to improve to 9-5. Hello everyone and welcome to Los Angeles where the Chargers are in good position to get a Wild Card but they can be in much better shape with a win tonight. While they might be in playoff position they have hit a bit of a rut, losing three of their last four games and their one time top rated defense is no longer looking as dominant as it did a month and a half ago. The Broncos on the other hand have bounced back from a two game losing skid to the Chiefs and the Ravens with a four game losing streak including a big win over the Colts last week. These two teams will most likely be in the post season no matter the outcome of this game, but Broncos and Chargers will be hoping to get the best possible Wild Card seed, and that starts with tonight’s big divisional match up. A couple AFC West currently occupying two of the three Wild Card spots in the conference go toe-to-toe tonight and the winner will most likely be guaranteed a place in the postseason. It’s the Denver Broncos taking on the Los Angeles Chargers in a Thrusday night divisional match up with massive implications and AS English will be with you all night providing live coverage, stats, highlights and analysis of tonight’s game from Sofi Stadium.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Broncos (9-6) failed to clinch their first playoff appearance since the 2015 season as the Los Angles Chargers (9-6) exploded in the second half, outscoring Denver 21-6 en route to a 34-27 victory on 'Thursday Night Football' and a season sweep of their AFC West rival. The result of the Chargers' victory is Los Angeles and Denver swap places in the conference standings with the Chargers now standing as the AFC's sixth seed and the Broncos tumbling down to the seventh and final postseason slot with two weeks remaining in the regular season for both franchises. Both teams entered Week 16 tied atop the NFL, along with the Philadelphia Eagles, for the league's best scoring defense, allowing 17.6 points per game, and while Los Angeles' defense didn't look a top scoring defense early, it certainly did late. The Broncos offense didn't have any issues moving the ball against the host Chargers' No. 1 scoring defense in the first two quarters, scoring touchdowns on each of their first three drives. The first concluded with a 3-yard rushing touchdown by fifth-round rookie running back Audric Estime; the next two were a 1-yard touchdown pass from first-round rookie quarterback Bo Nix to fullback Michael Burton, and another touchdown pass, a 6-yard strike, from Nix to seventh-round rookie wide receiver Devaughn Vele. However, their offense went completely cold after their first three drives. Five of the Broncos' final seven drives ended in punts with the other two being a 41-yard field goal to open the second half, and a 55-yard field goal on their final possession of the night. Nix finished the game with 248 yards passing and two touchdowns on 29 of 40 passing, but he threw for only 109 yards on 14 of 19 passing in the game's final two quarters. Justin Herbert and the Chargers offense fed off the momentum of concluding the half with a 57-yard field goal off the first fair-catch kick since 1976 from kicker Cameron Dicker after the Broncos committed a fair catch interference penalty on a punt with no time left on the clock that trimmed their halftime deficit to eight, 21-13. The Chargers scored three touchdowns on their four second-half possessions prior to recovering a last-ditch onside kick by the Broncos with just under a minute left to play. Running back Gus Edwards added his second rushing touchdown of the game from 5 yards out and finished the game with 68 rushing yards and two scores on 14 carries. Then, Herbert locked in, throwing two touchdown passes, including a miraculous 19-yarder to wide receiver Derius Davis in which the Chargers quarterback launched the football to the end while rolling to the left with a defender draped all over him. A shovel pass to running back Hassan Haskins for a 34-yard score with 2:27 left to play sealed the victory as Herbert finished with 284 yards passing, two touchdowns and an interception on 23 of 30 passing. Herbert heroics, and a defense that stepped up after a horrific start. Herbert finished this game 23 of 30 for 284 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception, but the stat line doesn't do his performance justice -- even when you account for his 40 rushing yards. He was firing lasers all over the field, and he repeatedly came up with huge plays at the most crucial moments. He was the best player on the field. And L.A.'s defense yielded just six points the rest of the game, after allowing the Broncos to begin the night with three consecutive touchdown drives. Their offense peaked too early, and their defense had no answers once the Chargers got going. As previously mentioned, the Broncos scored touchdowns on each of their first three drives. But beyond the 21 points they got, the ease with which they did it was astounding. They opened the game by going 72 yards on 10 plays, 70 yards on 12 plays and 70 yards on six plays. They didn't take a negative play until there were around four minutes remaining in the first half. It was SO easy for them ... until it wasn't. After those first three possessions, Denver ran just 35 more plays, and gained only 143 yards on those snaps. And after holding the Chargers to 10 points on their first five possessions, the defense yielded three touchdowns on four second-half drives before the final possession where the Chargers ran out the clock. Leading 21-10 late in the second quarter, the Broncos had the ball deep in their own territory. They'd been rolling offensively so with 41 seconds left they tried to put together a real drive rather than just running out the clock. But it went disastrously bad. A first-down pass to Javonte Williams went backward. Crucially, a second-down pass fell incomplete. And then a third-down run was stopped after just a yard, with 8 seconds left. The Chargers called timeout to force a punt. Why not, right? Something strange might happen. And then something strange happened. That's right, we got a fair-catch free kick for the first time since 1976. Aided, naturally, by a fair catch interference penalty, which moved the ball into Cameron Dicker's range. That sequence left the Chargers down by only one score at halftime, and started their run to eventually win the game. It's tough to choose between Herbert's ridiculous touchdown throws, but let's go with the one with a higher degree of difficulty. SHEESH. That is a frozen rope, on the move to his left, thrown back across his body, over the top of a defender and right on the money to the receiver, in stride, in the end zone. Hard to make a better throw than that. L.A. improves to 9-6 with this win and also moved ahead of the Broncos in the standings. The Chargers now hold the No. 6 seed in the AFC and hold the tiebreaker over Denver in the event the two teams finish with the same record. Their final two games of the season are at New England and at Las Vegas. Denver drops to 9-6 with the loss and falls behind the Chargers in the standings. Denver now holds the No. 7 seed in the AFC but remains fairly safe in the playoff race, with the Colts, Dolphins and Bengals all sitting at 6-8 and needing a lot of things to break their way (likely including Denver losing out) in order to make the field. The Broncos finish out the season with games at Cincinnati and home against the Chiefs. And that'll almost do it, folks. Chargers are gonna win this one and improve to 9-6, while the Broncos will drop to 9-6 themselves. Well, this is all gonna come down to an onside kick after that deep field goal by Wil Lutz. Those have been VERY unsuccessful this season. Let's see if the Broncos can be the exception to the rule. Justin Herbert, man. What a ridiculous game from this guy. This is his second truly spectacular touchdown of the night. The shovel pass under pressure to Hassan Haskins, who scoots his way through the defense to put the Chargers up two scores with a little more than two minutes remaining. Herbert has used his legs way more often this season, and to great effect. That was an enormous conversion on third-and-10 right there to keep his offense on the field, and then Gus Edwards followed it with his longest run of the season to get L.A. deep into Denver territory. Big swing. Also, the Broncos probably should've gone for it there, considering the situation. Sean Payton might regret punting it away. Great series for L.A.'s defense. Bud Dupree got it started with a sack on first down to put the Broncos behind the chains. A short run and a short pass later, and now the Chargers have a chance to run a bunch of clock in the four-minute drill to try to put this game away. After a big third-down conversion from Herbert to Hayden Hurst, the Broncos pass rush quickly ended the drive. First, Jonathon Cooper came off the edge to bat a pass down out of the air on second down. And then Drew Sanders got to Herbert in the pocket for a sack before he could slip away. Denver has a chance to tie or re-take the lead midway through the fourth. The Broncos since opening the game with three straight touchdowns: 27 plays, 87 yards, 1 FG, 4 punts. Nix missed an opportunity right there. Mims had about five steps on the corner and Nix underthrew the ball. Should've been a TD. What an outrageous throw from Herbert to give the Chargers their first lead of the game. Holy cow. Rolling to his left, back across his body, over the top of the defender and in a spot where only Derius Davis could catch it. Unreal throw. Well, we had a free kick earlier and now it looks like we have a simultaneous catch. Thursday Night Football! Gus Edwards it into the end zone again for L.A.'s second touchdown of the night. Immediately capitalizes on the late hit by Strnad. And suddenly it's a one-score game again. Two-point conversion fails, though, so it remains a five-point lead for Denver. Justin Strnad with a really silly play right there. It's not like that was a late slide. Herbert was on his way to the ground well before Strnad began his tackle attempt. After that conversion, Denver's series stalled out after Estime was dropped behind the line and then Nix threw the ball way out of the end zone. A short pass set up fourth-and-3, but Sean Payton opted for a field goal rather than trying to pick up a second conversion of the drive. Denver converted each of its first four third-down opportunities of the game, but missed its last three. Alas, the Broncos kept the line moving this time around with a screen pass to Courtland Sutton on fourth down and now have a chance to extend their lead. In case you're wondering... It's not every day that you see one of these. Because the half ended on a fair catch, and because there was a personal-foul penalty on the catch, the Chargers got the opportunity to kick a free field goal and Cameron Dicker nailed it to make this a one-score game at the half. Really, really poor clock management from the Broncos made that possible. Well there that goes! Kris Abrams-Draine just made a terrific play on a Herbert pass up the seam and came away with an interception. Just cut right in front of the receiver and snatched it out of the air. Only Herbert's third pick of the season. Justin Herbert (12-14 for 141 yards) has been just as effective as Bo Nix (14-19, 158 yards, 2 TD) on a per-dropback basis so far. The difference here is Gus Edwards has 18 yards on his 8 carries and the Broncos' backs are averaging over 5 yards per carry, so Denver's drives have sustained in a way L.A.'s haven't. That sack by Bosa was enough to get L.A. its first stop of the night. Nix's third-down pass for Vele was tapped up into the air. No defenders in the area or else it might've had a chance to get picked. Now Herbert can cut this to a one-score lead before the half and make it a very different game. With 4:13 left in the second quarter, the Broncos finally had their first negative play of the night. Joey Bosa dropped Bo Nix for a sack. The Chargers go three-and-out this time, and now Denver has a chance to make it a three-score game. Also, Gus Edwards is getting looked at by trainers. Wheels might be starting to come off for the Chargers here. Two pretty egregious missed calls in favor of the Broncos so far, with the personal foul on their opening drive and the missed illegal man downfield on that last touchdown. Stop me if you've heard this before: The Broncos easily marched right down the field and scored a touchdown. 6 plays, 70 yards, 2:28, zero negative plays, and Devaughn Vele with the score this time. It looked like we were on our way to a fourth consecutive touchdown drive, but the Broncos stuffed Gus Edwards behind the line of scrimmage on a third-and-1 opportunity and Jim Harbaugh decided to send the field goal team out there. The way this Broncos offense looks so far, that might be a pretty big mistake. The Chargers need all the points they can get if they want to keep pace. (And you shouldn't really be kicking on fourth-and-3 from the 19 in the first place.) Once again, Denver got whatever it wanted on a relatively easy touchdown drive. Bo Nix threw two incomplete passes but every other play gained positive yards. The touchdown came on a play-action bootleg concept with FB Michael Burton sneaking out into the flat. Extremely easy stuff. Significantly more effective second drive for the Chargers. They marched right down the field just as efficiently as Denver did on its first possession. Justin Herbert is now 4 of 4 for 43 yards, with the big plays on the drive being completions to Josh Palmer and Scott Matlock, plus a 19-yard run by Kimani Vidal before Gus Edwards punched it into the end zone from the 1-yard line. The Chargers are incredibly banged up in the secondary and could now be without yet another safety. The Amazon broadcast reported that Maye has an ankle injury and headed to the X-ray room. Quick, efficient work for the Broncos on that first possession. They gained positive yards on every snap. 10 plays, 72 yards, 5:56 off the clock and Estime's first career touchdown from 3 yards out. The Broncos have not been very good at running the ball this season (23rd in the NFL in yards per carry), but are finding plenty of success on the ground on their first drive. The Chargers have yielded 4.7 yards per carry to opponents, so this early success makes some sense. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "The Los Angeles Chargers just shocked the Denver Broncos. Despite a double-digit lead at halftime, Los Angeles surged in the second half to overcome Denver 34-27 on Thursday Night Football to open Week 16. Bo Nix outplayed Justin Herbert in the first half with two passing touchdowns, but the roles completely switched in the second. Denver only mustered a field goal in each of the third and fourth quarters, while Los Angeles put up 15 in the fourth. >24/7 New York news stream: Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are The result puts Los Angeles one step closer to a playoff berth while Denver needs to do a little more work. Here are winners and losers from the AFC West affair: Haskins, Los Angeles' 25-year-old running back, came up big when it needed him the most. Out of nowhere, Herbert scrambled and threw a shovel pass to Haskins, who made a brilliant cut to take the ball inside and into the end zone. The flip pass. The juke 😮‍💨... The @Chargers TD!#DENvsLAC on Prime VideoAlso streaming on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/a5XDe9gfqM The play essentially sealed the deal on Los Angeles' win, with Haskins not having much of an impact prior to this score. He only has 14 carries for 26 yards and a score in the regular season, with his two catches for 39 yards and a score in this game being his first receptions of the year. Gus Edwards also came up big with 14 carries for 68 yards and two rushing touchdowns. Denver enjoyed a promising start to the first half with Nix completing 15 of 21 passes for 155 yards, two touchdowns and no picks. But the offense lacked in the second half, with Nix ending the game with 29 of 40 completions for 263 yards. The Broncos had a decent showing on the ground game with five different rushers logging a total 110 yards, with Audric Estime going for 48 yards on nine carries and a score. But Denver couldn't establish the run game as much in the second half, and running back Javonte Williams led the team in receptions with seven, but just for 29 yards. All season the Broncos have deployed an elite defense with the offense being just around average. That could be their downfall should they hold onto a playoff spot. The turning point of the game might have occurred just before halftime. If a player fair catches a kick with no time left, the team can attempt a field goal -- or free kick -- from the spot of the catch. Cameron Dicker then nailed a 57-yard attempt to bridge the gap to 24-13, with the make being the first successful one since 1976. A rare fair catch free kick results in a Cameron Dicker 57-yard FG for the @Chargers 🤯It's the first free kick FG since 1976! pic.twitter.com/yb0cyPuKnR With both teams now 9-6, the Chargers picked up an imperative result by sweeping the season series over Denver for the first time in 14 years. Denver just needed to win to punch its ticket for the first time since 2015, but now it'll need some help. If the Indianapolis Colts, Miami Dolphins and Cincinnati Bengals all lose on Sunday, Denver will be in. But if not, Denver needs to win at least one of its final two games: at Cincinnati and at the Kansas City Chiefs. The Bengals host the lowly Cleveland Browns, which could make things extremely intriguing if Cincinnati manages to win. The Chargers have a 97% chance to make the playoffs. If the Colts and Dolphins lose on Sunday, Los Angeles will be in. However, all Los Angeles needs to do is win either at the New England Patriots or at the Las Vegas Raiders, two games they should be expected to triumph in.",

                "content": "There are eight Amazon delivery hubs affected across the U.S. by The International Brotherhood of Teamsters' strike action, which started on Thursday. The strikes are affecting four hubs in Southern California, in Palmdale, Victorville, Industry, and San Bernardino, and one in San Francisco, one in New York City, one in Atlanta, Georgia, and one in Skokie, Illinois. Commenting on the announcement of the strikes, Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel told Newsweek, \"This is another attempt to push a false narrative.\" \"The truth is that the Teamsters have actively threatened, intimidated, and attempted to coerce Amazon employees and third-party drivers to join them, which is illegal and is the subject of multiple pending unfair labor practice charges against the union,\" she said. Responding to Nantel's comments, The International Brotherhood of Teamsters told Newsweek, \"Amazon is the biggest corporate PR machine there is and yet despite the false narratives they are spreading, the American public believes none of their nonsense. Thousands of Amazon Teamsters are on the picket line today and will continue.\" The map below shows the cities with affected Amazon delivery hubs. Amazon, the second-largest company on the Fortune 500 list, sees billions of orders come through at Christmas time, and the strikes could mean many people's deliveries are delayed. The issues highlight growing tensions between Amazon and its workers over labor rights, union recognition, and employment terms. Teamsters announced on Thursday that it launched the \"largest strike against Amazon in American history.\" Nearly 10,000 Amazon workers joined Teamsters as \"part of a growing grassroots movement to secure strong union contracts and take control of their own lives,\" the union said in a press release. \"On the picket line, they are fighting for increased wages, improved benefits, and safer work conditions,\" the press release said. Teamsters said that Amazon \"forced them to strike by ignoring the December 15 deadline\" to negotiate a labor contract. Nantel told Newsweek that Teamsters \"don't represent our employees,\" and the word \"strike\" was being misused under the circumstances as a result. Teamsters has previously said it represents some Amazon warehouse workers, according to the Associated Press. At each delivery station, Amazon has a few hundred employees, but has rebuffed demands that the delivery drivers, which Teamsters have been focusing on, are its employees, AP reported. Daniel Herrera, a delivery driver in Victorville, California, said in a statement: \"This is Amazon's strike, plain and simple. Amazon left us no choice but to come to the picket line. They could easily give us the treatment we deserve, but they refuse to even hear us out at the bargaining table.\" Sean M. O'Brien, Teamsters General President said in a statement: \"Amazon is pushing its workers closer to the picket line by failing to show them the respect they have earned.\" Kelly Nantel, Amazon spokesperson, told Newsweek in a statement: \"For more than a year now, the Teamsters have continued to intentionally mislead the public – claiming that they represent 'thousands of Amazon employees and drivers'. \"What you're seeing at these sites are almost entirely outsiders—not Amazon employees or partners—and the suggestion otherwise is just another lie from the Teamsters. The truth is that they were unable to get enough support from our employees and partners and have brought in outsiders to harass and intimidate our team, which is inappropriate and dangerous. We appreciate all our team's great work to serve their customers and communities, and thanks to them, we're not seeing any impact to customers' orders.\" The International Brotherhood of Teamsters told Newsweek in a statement: \"Amazon threatens, intimidates, and coerces its workers by unleashing union busters to swarm facilities—spending millions of dollars to try to deprive workers of their Constitutional rights to freedom of association. Workers are fed up and fighting back.\" What's Next Amazon has informed Newsweek it doesn't expect the strike action to affect its operations over the festive period, but The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has not yet said how long the strikes will carry on.

                "content": "Newsletters “We are fighting against a vicious union-busting campaign, and we are going to win.” By Sammi Caramela Well, it officially happened: as promised—or threatened—Amazon workers have begun the largest strike against the company in American history, and just in time for the holiday rush. According to a press release, the Teamsters launched the strike yesterday to address Amazon’s refusal to negotiate with the union. Quoting unfair treatment and low wages, these workers are fed up with the corporation’s selfishness. “If your package is delayed during the holidays, you can blame Amazon’s insatiable greed,” said Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien. “We gave Amazon a clear deadline to come to the table and do right by our members. They ignored it.” “These greedy executives had every chance to show decency and respect for the people who make their obscene profits possible,” he continued. “Instead, they’ve pushed workers to the limit and now they’re paying the price. This strike is on them.” The press release noted that union workers will strike at facilities across New York City, Atlanta, Southern California, San Francisco, and Illinois. Additionally, primary picket lines will be in place at hundreds of Amazon Fulfillment Centers across the nation. “What we’re doing is historic,” said Leah Pensler, a warehouse worker at DCK6 in San Francisco. “We are fighting against a vicious union-busting campaign, and we are going to win.” “Amazon is one of the biggest, richest corporations in the world,” added Gabriel Irizarry, a driver at DIL7 in Skokie, Ill. “They talk a big game about taking care of their workers, but when it comes down to it, Amazon does not respect us and our right to negotiate for better working conditions and wages. We can’t even afford to pay our bills.” Hopefully, by now, you’ve already ordered all your holiday gifts anyway. And hopefully, these Amazon workers finally get the respect and compensation they deserve.

                "title": "Superman - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Superman is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, and debuted in the comic book Action Comics #1 (cover-dated June 1938 and published April 18, 1938).[1] Superman has been adapted to several other media including radio serials, novels, films, television shows, theater, and video games. Superman was born Kal-El, on the fictional planet Krypton. As a baby, his parents Jor-El and Lara sent him to Earth in a small spaceship shortly before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside near the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas. He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark began developing superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin. His adoptive parents advised him to use his powers to benefit humanity, and he decided to fight crime as a vigilante. To protect his personal life, he changes into a colorful costume and uses the alias \"Superman\" when fighting crime. Clark resides in the fictional American city of Metropolis, where he works as a journalist for the Daily Planet. Superman's supporting characters include his love interest and fellow journalist Lois Lane, Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen, and editor-in-chief Perry White, and his enemies include Brainiac, General Zod, and archenemy Lex Luthor. Superman is the archetypal superhero: he wears an outlandish costume, uses a codename, is unfailingly good and honest, and fights evil with the aid of extraordinary abilities. Although there are earlier characters who arguably fit this definition, Superman popularized the superhero genre and established its conventions. He was the best-selling superhero in American comic books up until the 1980s.[2] Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster met in 1932 while attending Glenville High School in Cleveland and bonded over their admiration of fiction. Siegel aspired to become a writer and Shuster aspired to become an illustrator. Siegel wrote amateur science fiction stories, which he self-published as a magazine called Science Fiction: The Advance Guard of Future Civilization. His friend Shuster often provided illustrations for his work.[3] In January 1933, Siegel published a short story in his magazine titled \"The Reign of the Superman\". The titular character is a homeless man named Bill Dunn who is tricked by an evil scientist into consuming an experimental drug. The drug gives Dunn the powers of mind-reading, mind-control, and clairvoyance. He uses these powers maliciously for profit and amusement, but then the drug wears off, leaving him a powerless vagrant again. Shuster provided illustrations, depicting Dunn as a bald man.[4] Siegel and Shuster shifted to making comic strips, with a focus on adventure and comedy. They wanted to become syndicated newspaper strip authors, so they showed their ideas to various newspaper editors. However, the newspaper editors were not impressed, and told them that if they wanted to make a successful comic strip, it had to be something more sensational than anything else on the market. This prompted Siegel to revisit Superman as a comic strip character.[5][6] Siegel modified Superman's powers to make him even more sensational. Like Bill Dunn, the second prototype of Superman is given powers against his will by an unscrupulous scientist, but instead of psychic abilities, he acquires superhuman strength and bullet-proof skin.[7][8] Additionally, this new Superman was a crime-fighting hero instead of a villain, because Siegel noted that comic strips with heroic protagonists tended to be more successful.[9] In later years, Siegel once recalled that this Superman wore a \"bat-like\" cape in some panels, but typically he and Shuster agreed there was no costume yet, and there is none apparent in the surviving artwork.[10][11] Siegel and Shuster showed this second concept of Superman to Consolidated Book Publishers, based in Chicago.[12][a] In May 1933, Consolidated had published a proto-comic book titled Detective Dan: Secret Operative 48.[13] It contained all-original stories as opposed to reprints of newspaper strips, which was a novelty at the time.[14] Siegel and Shuster put together a comic book in a similar format called The Superman. A delegation from Consolidated visited Cleveland that summer on a business trip and Siegel and Shuster took the opportunity to present their work in person.[15][16] Although Consolidated expressed interest, they later pulled out of the comics business without ever offering a book deal because the sales of Detective Dan were disappointing.[17][18] Siegel believed publishers kept rejecting them because he and Shuster were young and unknown, so he looked for an established artist to replace Shuster.[19] When Siegel told Shuster what he was doing, Shuster reacted by burning their rejected Superman comic, sparing only the cover. They continued collaborating on other projects, but for the time being Shuster was through with Superman.[20] Siegel wrote to numerous artists.[19] The first response came in July 1933 from Leo O'Mealia, who drew the Fu Manchu strip for the Bell Syndicate.[21][22] In the script that Siegel sent to O'Mealia, Superman's origin story changes: He is a \"scientist-adventurer\" from the far future when humanity has naturally evolved \"superpowers\". Just before the Earth explodes, he escapes in a time-machine to the modern era, whereupon he immediately begins using his superpowers to fight crime.[23] O'Mealia produced a few strips and showed them to his newspaper syndicate, but they were rejected. O'Mealia did not send to Siegel any copies of his strips, and they have been lost.[24] In June 1934, Siegel found another partner, an artist in Chicago named Russell Keaton.[25][26] Keaton drew the Buck Rogers and Skyroads comic strips. In the script that Siegel sent Keaton in June, Superman's origin story further evolved: In the distant future, when Earth is on the verge of exploding due to \"giant cataclysms\", the last surviving man sends his three-year-old son back in time to the year 1935. The time-machine appears on a road where it is discovered by motorists Sam and Molly Kent. They leave the boy in an orphanage, but the staff struggle to control him because he has superhuman strength and impenetrable skin. The Kents adopt the boy and name him Clark, and teach him that he must use his fantastic natural gifts for the benefit of humanity. In November, Siegel sent Keaton an extension of his script: an adventure where Superman foils a conspiracy to kidnap a star football player. The extended script mentions that Clark puts on a special \"uniform\" when assuming the identity of Superman, but it is not described.[27] Keaton produced two weeks' worth of strips based on Siegel's script. In November, Keaton showed his strips to a newspaper syndicate, but they too were rejected, and he abandoned the project.[28][29] Siegel and Shuster reconciled and resumed developing Superman together. The character became an alien from the planet Krypton. Shuster designed the now-familiar costume: tights with an \"S\" on the chest, over-shorts, and a cape.[30][31][32] They made Clark Kent a journalist who pretends to be timid, and conceived his colleague Lois Lane, who is attracted to the bold and mighty Superman but does not realize that he and Kent are the same person.[33] In June 1935 Siegel and Shuster finally found work with National Allied Publications, a comic magazine publishing company in New York owned by Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson.[35] Wheeler-Nicholson published two of their strips in New Fun Comics #6 (1935): \"Henri Duval\" and \"Doctor Occult\".[36] Siegel and Shuster also showed him Superman and asked him to market Superman to the newspapers on their behalf.[37] In October, Wheeler-Nicholson offered to publish Superman in one of his own magazines.[38] Siegel and Shuster refused his offer because Wheeler-Nicholson had demonstrated himself to be an irresponsible businessman. He had been slow to respond to their letters and had not paid them for their work in New Fun Comics #6. They chose to keep marketing Superman to newspaper syndicates themselves.[39][40] Despite the erratic pay, Siegel and Shuster kept working for Wheeler-Nicholson because he was the only publisher who was buying their work, and over the years they produced other adventure strips for his magazines.[41] Wheeler-Nicholson's financial difficulties continued to mount. In 1936, he formed a joint corporation with Harry Donenfeld and Jack Liebowitz called Detective Comics, Inc. in order to release his third magazine, which was titled Detective Comics. Siegel and Shuster produced stories for Detective Comics too, such as \"Slam Bradley\". Wheeler-Nicholson fell into deep debt to Donenfeld and Liebowitz, and in early January 1938, Donenfeld and Liebowitz petitioned Wheeler-Nicholson's company into bankruptcy and seized it.[3][42] In early December 1937, Siegel visited Liebowitz in New York, and Liebowitz asked Siegel to produce some comics for an upcoming comic anthology magazine called Action Comics.[43][44] Siegel proposed some new stories, but not Superman. Siegel and Shuster were, at the time, negotiating a deal with the McClure Newspaper Syndicate for Superman. In early January 1938, Siegel had a three-way telephone conversation with Liebowitz and an employee of McClure named Max Gaines. Gaines informed Siegel that McClure had rejected Superman, and asked if he could forward their Superman strips to Liebowitz so that Liebowitz could consider them for Action Comics. Siegel agreed.[45] Liebowitz and his colleagues were impressed by the strips, and they asked Siegel and Shuster to develop the strips into 13 pages for Action Comics.[46] Having grown tired of rejections, Siegel and Shuster accepted the offer. At least now they would see Superman published.[47][48] Siegel and Shuster submitted their work in late February and were paid US$130 (equivalent to $2,800 in 2023) for their work ($10 per page).[49] In early March they signed a contract at Liebowitz's request in which they gave away the copyright for Superman to Detective Comics, Inc. This was normal practice in the business, and Siegel and Shuster had given away the copyrights to their previous works as well.[50] The duo's revised version of Superman appeared in the first issue of Action Comics, which was published on April 18, 1938. The issue was a huge success thanks to Superman's feature.[1][51][52] Siegel and Shuster read pulp science-fiction and adventure magazines, and many stories featured characters with fantastical abilities such as telepathy, clairvoyance, and superhuman strength. One character in particular was John Carter of Mars from the novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs. John Carter is a human who is transported to Mars, where the lower gravity makes him stronger than the natives and allows him to leap great distances.[53][54] Another influence was Philip Wylie's 1930 novel Gladiator, featuring a protagonist named Hugo Danner who had similar powers.[55][56] Superman's stance and devil-may-care attitude were influenced by the characters of Douglas Fairbanks, who starred in adventure films such as The Mark of Zorro and Robin Hood.[57] The name of Superman's home city, Metropolis, was taken from the 1927 film of the same name.[58] Popeye cartoons were also an influence.[58] Clark Kent's harmless facade and dual identity were inspired by the protagonists of such movies as Don Diego de la Vega in The Mark of Zorro and Sir Percy Blakeney in The Scarlet Pimpernel. Siegel thought this would make for interesting dramatic contrast and good humor.[59][60] Another inspiration was slapstick comedian Harold Lloyd. The archetypal Lloyd character was a mild-mannered man who finds himself abused by bullies but later in the story snaps and fights back furiously.[61] Kent is a journalist because Siegel often imagined himself becoming one after leaving school. The love triangle between Lois Lane, Clark, and Superman was inspired by Siegel's own awkwardness with girls.[62] The pair collected comic strips in their youth, with a favorite being Winsor McCay's fantastical Little Nemo.[58] Shuster remarked on the artists who played an important part in the development of his own style: \"Alex Raymond and Burne Hogarth were my idols – also Milt Caniff, Hal Foster, and Roy Crane.\"[58] Shuster taught himself to draw by tracing over the art in the strips and magazines they collected.[3] As a boy, Shuster was interested in fitness culture[63] and a fan of strongmen such as Siegmund Breitbart and Joseph Greenstein. He collected fitness magazines and manuals and used their photographs as visual references for his art.[3] The visual design of Superman came from multiple influences. The tight-fitting suit and shorts were inspired by the costumes of wrestlers, boxers, and strongmen. In early concept art, Shuster gave Superman laced sandals like those of strongmen and classical heroes, but these were eventually changed to red boots.[34] The costumes of Douglas Fairbanks were also an influence.[64] The emblem on his chest was inspired by heraldic crests.[65] Many pulp action heroes such as swashbucklers wore capes. Superman's face was based on Johnny Weissmuller with touches derived from the comic-strip character Dick Tracy and from the work of cartoonist Roy Crane.[66] The word \"superman\" was commonly used in the 1920s and 1930s to describe men of great ability, most often athletes and politicians.[67] It occasionally appeared in pulp fiction stories as well, such as \"The Superman of Dr. Jukes\".[68] It is unclear whether Siegel and Shuster were influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of the Übermensch; they never acknowledged as much.[69] Since 1938, Superman stories have been regularly published in periodical comic books published by DC Comics. The first and oldest of these is Action Comics, which began in April 1938.[1] Action Comics was initially an anthology magazine, but it eventually became dedicated to Superman stories. The second oldest periodical is Superman, which began in June 1939. Action Comics and Superman have been published without interruption (ignoring changes to the title and numbering scheme).[71][72] Several other shorter-lived Superman periodicals have been published over the years.[73] Superman is part of the DC Universe, which is a shared setting of superhero characters owned by DC Comics, and consequently he frequently appears in stories alongside the likes of Batman, Wonder Woman, and others. More Superman comic books have been sold in publication history than any other American superhero character.[74] Exact sales figures for the early decades of Superman comic books are hard to find because, like most publishers at the time, DC Comics concealed this data from its competitors and thereby the general public, but given the general market trends at the time, sales of Action Comics and Superman probably peaked in the mid-1940s and thereafter steadily declined.[75] Sales data first became public in 1960, and showed that Superman was the best-selling comic book character of the 1960s and 1970s.[2][76][77] Sales rose again starting in 1987. Superman #75 (Nov 1992) had over 23 million copies sold,[78] making it the best-selling issue of a comic book of all time, due to a media sensation over The Death of Superman in that issue.[79] Sales declined from that point on. In March 2018, Action Comics sold just 51,534 copies, although such low figures are normal for superhero comic books in general (for comparison, Amazing Spider-Man #797 sold only 128,189 copies).[80] The comic books have become a niche aspect of the Superman franchise due to low readership,[81] though they remain influential as creative engines for the movies and television shows. Comic book stories can be produced quickly and cheaply, and are thus an ideal medium for experimentation.[82] Whereas comic books in the 1950s were read by children, since the 1990s the average reader has been an adult.[83] A major reason for this shift was DC Comics' decision in the 1970s to sell its comic books to specialty stores instead of traditional magazine retailers (supermarkets, newsstands, etc.) — a model called \"direct distribution\". This made comic books less accessible to children.[84] Beginning in January 1939, a Superman daily comic strip appeared in newspapers, syndicated through the McClure Syndicate. A color Sunday version was added that November. Jerry Siegel wrote most of the strips until he was conscripted into the United States Army in 1943. The Sunday strips had a narrative continuity separate from the daily strips, possibly because Siegel had to delegate the Sunday strips to ghostwriters.[85] By 1941, the newspaper strips had an estimated readership of 20 million.[86] Joe Shuster drew the early strips, then passed the job to Wayne Boring.[87] From 1949 to 1956, the newspaper strips were drawn by Win Mortimer.[88] The strip ended in May 1966, but was revived from 1977 to 1983 to coincide with a series of movies released by Warner Bros.[89] Initially, Siegel was allowed to write Superman more or less as he saw fit because nobody had anticipated the success and rapid expansion of the franchise.[90][91] But soon Siegel and Shuster's work was put under careful oversight for fear of trouble with censors.[92] Siegel was forced to tone down the violence and social crusading that characterized his early stories.[93] Editor Whitney Ellsworth, hired in 1940, dictated that Superman not kill.[94] Sexuality was banned, and colorfully outlandish villains such as Ultra-Humanite and Toyman were thought to be less nightmarish for young readers.[95] Mort Weisinger was the editor on Superman comics from 1941 to 1970, his tenure briefly interrupted by military service. Siegel and his fellow writers had developed the character with little thought of building a coherent mythology, but as the number of Superman titles and the pool of writers grew, Weisinger demanded a more disciplined approach.[96] Weisinger assigned story ideas, and the logic of Superman's powers, his origin, the locales, and his relationships with his growing cast of supporting characters were carefully planned. Elements such as Bizarro, his cousin Supergirl, the Phantom Zone, the Fortress of Solitude, alternate varieties of kryptonite, robot doppelgangers, and Krypto were introduced during this era. The complicated universe built under Weisinger was beguiling to devoted readers but alienating to casuals.[97] Weisinger favored lighthearted stories over serious drama, and avoided sensitive subjects such as the Vietnam War and the American civil rights movement because he feared his right-wing views would alienate his left-leaning writers and readers.[98] Weisinger also introduced letters columns in 1958 to encourage feedback and build intimacy with readers.[99] Weisinger retired in 1970 and Julius Schwartz took over. By his own admission, Weisinger had grown out of touch with newer readers.[100] Starting with The Sandman Saga, Schwartz updated Superman by making Clark Kent a television anchor, and he retired overused plot elements such as kryptonite and robot doppelgangers.[101] Schwartz also scaled Superman's powers down to a level closer to Siegel's original. These changes would eventually be reversed by later writers. Schwartz allowed stories with serious drama such as \"For the Man Who Has Everything\" (Superman Annual #11), in which the villain Mongul torments Superman with an illusion of happy family life on a living Krypton. Schwartz retired from DC Comics in 1986 and was succeeded by Mike Carlin as an editor on Superman comics. His retirement coincided with DC Comics' decision to reboot the DC Universe with the companywide-crossover storyline \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\". In The Man of Steel writer John Byrne rewrote the Superman mythos, again reducing Superman's powers, which writers had slowly re-strengthened, and revised many supporting characters, such as making Lex Luthor a billionaire industrialist rather than a mad scientist, and making Supergirl an artificial shapeshifting organism because DC wanted Superman to be the sole surviving Kryptonian. Carlin was promoted to Executive Editor for the DC Universe books in 1996, a position he held until 2002. K.C. Carlson took his place as editor of the Superman comics. In the earlier decades of Superman comics, artists were expected to conform to a certain \"house style\".[102] Joe Shuster defined the aesthetic style of Superman in the 1940s. After Shuster left National, Wayne Boring succeeded him as the principal artist on Superman comic books.[103] He redrew Superman taller and more detailed.[104] Around 1955, Curt Swan in turn succeeded Boring.[105] The 1980s saw a boom in the diversity of comic book art and now there is no single \"house style\" in Superman comics.[citation needed] The first adaptation of Superman beyond comic books was a radio show, The Adventures of Superman, which ran from 1940 to 1951 for 2,088 episodes, most of which were aimed at children. The episodes were initially 15 minutes long, but after 1949 they were lengthened to 30 minutes. Most episodes were done live.[106] Bud Collyer was the voice actor for Superman in most episodes. The show was produced by Robert Maxwell and Allen Ducovny, who were employees of Superman, Inc. and Detective Comics, Inc. respectively.[107][108] In 1966 Superman had a Tony-nominated musical play produced on Broadway. It's a Bird... It's a Plane... It's Superman featured music by Charles Strouse, lyrics by Lee Adams and book by David Newman and Robert Benton. Actor Bob Holiday performed as Clark Kent/Superman and actress Patricia Marand performed as Lois Lane. DC Comics trademarked the Superman chest logo in August 1938.[126] Jack Liebowitz established Superman, Inc. in October 1939 to develop the franchise beyond the comic books.[51] Superman, Inc. merged with DC Comics in October 1946.[127] After DC Comics merged with Warner Communications in 1967, licensing for Superman was handled by the Licensing Corporation of America.[128] The Licensing Letter (an American market research firm) estimated that Superman licensed merchandise made $634 million in sales globally in 2018 (43.3% of this revenue came from the North American market). For comparison, in the same year, Spider-Man merchandise made $1.075 billion and Star Wars merchandise made $1.923 billion globally.[129] The earliest paraphernalia appeared in 1939: a button proclaiming membership in the Supermen of America club. The first toy was a wooden doll in 1939 made by the Ideal Novelty and Toy Company.[130] Superman #5 (May 1940) carried an advertisement for a \"Krypto-Raygun\", which was a gun-shaped device that could project images on a wall.[131] The majority of Superman merchandise is targeted at children, but since the 1970s, adults have been increasingly targeted because the comic book readership has gotten older.[132] During World War II, Superman was used to support the war effort. Action Comics and Superman carried messages urging readers to buy war bonds and participate in scrap drives.[133] Other superheroes became patriots who went to fight: Batman, Wonder Woman and Captain America. In a contract dated March 1, 1938, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster gave away the copyright to Superman to their employer, DC Comics (then known as Detective Comics, Inc.)[b] prior to Superman's first publication in April. Contrary to popular perception, the $130 that DC Comics paid them was for their first Superman story, not the copyright to the character — that, they gave away for free. This was normal practice in the comic magazine industry and they had done the same with their previous published works (Slam Bradley, Doctor Occult, etc.),[50] but Superman became far more popular and valuable than they anticipated and they much regretted giving him away.[134] DC Comics retained Siegel and Shuster, and they were paid well because they were popular with the readers.[135] Between 1938 and 1947, DC Comics paid them together at least $401,194.85 (equivalent to $7,310,000 in 2023).[136][137] Siegel wrote most of the magazine and daily newspaper stories until he was conscripted into the United States Army in 1943, whereupon the task was passed to ghostwriters.[138][139] While Siegel was serving in Hawaii, DC Comics published a story featuring a child version of Superman called \"Superboy\", which was based on a script Siegel had submitted several years before. Siegel was furious because DC Comics did this without having bought the character.[140] After Siegel's discharge from the Army, he and Shuster sued DC Comics in 1947 for the rights to Superman and Superboy. The judge ruled that Superman belonged to DC Comics, but that Superboy was a separate entity that belonged to Siegel. Siegel and Shuster settled out-of-court with DC Comics, which paid the pair $94,013.16 (equivalent to $1,192,222 in 2023) in exchange for the full rights to both Superman and Superboy.[141] DC Comics then fired Siegel and Shuster.[142] DC Comics rehired Jerry Siegel as a writer in 1959. In 1965, Siegel and Shuster attempted to regain rights to Superman using the renewal option in the Copyright Act of 1909, but the court ruled Siegel and Shuster had transferred the renewal rights to DC Comics in 1938. Siegel and Shuster appealed, but the appeals court upheld this decision. DC Comics fired Siegel once again, when he filed this second lawsuit.[143] In 1975, Siegel and several other comic book writers and artists launched a public campaign for better compensation and treatment of comic creators. Warner Brothers agreed to give Siegel and Shuster a yearly stipend, full medical benefits, and credit their names in all future Superman productions in exchange for never contesting ownership of Superman. Siegel and Shuster upheld this bargain.[3] Shuster died in 1992. DC Comics offered Shuster's heirs a stipend in exchange for never challenging ownership of Superman, which they accepted for some years.[141] Siegel died in 1996. His heirs attempted to take the rights to Superman using the termination provision of the Copyright Act of 1976. DC Comics negotiated an agreement wherein it would pay the Siegel heirs several million dollars and a yearly stipend of $500,000 in exchange for permanently granting DC the rights to Superman. DC Comics also agreed to insert the line \"By Special Arrangement with the Jerry Siegel Family\" in all future Superman productions.[144] The Siegels accepted DC's offer in an October 2001 letter.[141] Copyright lawyer and movie producer Marc Toberoff then struck a deal with the heirs of both Siegel and Shuster to help them get the rights to Superman in exchange for signing the rights over to his production company, Pacific Pictures. Both groups accepted. The Siegel heirs called off their deal with DC Comics and in 2004 sued DC for the rights to Superman and Superboy. In 2008, the judge ruled in favor of the Siegels. DC Comics appealed the decision, and the appeals court ruled in favor of DC, arguing that the October 2001 letter was binding. In 2003, the Shuster heirs served a termination notice for Shuster's grant of his half of the copyright to Superman. DC Comics sued the Shuster heirs in 2010, and the court ruled in DC's favor on the grounds that the 1992 agreement with the Shuster heirs barred them from terminating the grant.[141] Under current US copyright law, Superman is due to enter the public domain on January 1, 2034.[145][c] However, this will only apply (at first) to the character as he is depicted in Action Comics #1, which was published in 1938. Versions of him with later developments, such as his power of \"heat vision\", may persist under copyright until the works they were introduced in enter the public domain.[146] Lois Lane, who also debuted in Action Comics #1, is expected to enter public domain in 2034, but supporting characters introduced in later publications, such as Jimmy Olsen and Supergirl, will pass into the public domain at later dates. Superman's success immediately begat a wave of imitations. The most successful is Captain Marvel, first published by Fawcett Comics in December 1939. Captain Marvel had many similarities to Superman: Herculean strength, invulnerability, the ability to fly, a cape, a secret identity, and a job as a journalist. DC Comics filed a lawsuit against Fawcett Comics for copyright infringement.[citation needed] The trial began in March 1948 after seven years of discovery. The judge ruled that Fawcett had indeed infringed on Superman. However, the judge also found that the copyright notices that appeared with the Superman newspaper strips did not meet the technical standards of the Copyright Act of 1909 and were therefore invalid. Furthermore, since the newspaper strips carried stories adapted from Action Comics, the judge ruled that DC Comics had effectively abandoned the copyright to the Action Comics stories and Superman, and therefore forfeited its right to sue Fawcett for copyright infringement.[141] DC Comics appealed this decision. The appeals court ruled that unintentional mistakes in the copyright notices of the newspaper strips did not invalidate the copyrights. Furthermore, Fawcett knew that DC Comics never intended to abandon the copyrights, and therefore Fawcett's infringement was not an innocent misunderstanding, and therefore Fawcett owed damages to DC Comics.[d] The appeals court remanded the case back to the lower court to determine how much Fawcett owed in damages.[141] At that point, Fawcett Comics decided to settle out of court with DC Comics. Fawcett paid DC Comics $400,000 (equivalent to $4,555,000 in 2023) and agreed to stop publishing Captain Marvel. The last Captain Marvel story from Fawcett Comics was published in September 1953.[147] DC Comics licensed Captain Marvel in 1972 and published crossover stories with Superman. By 1991, DC Comics had purchased Fawcett Comics and with it the full rights to Captain Marvel. DC eventually renamed the character \"Shazam\" to prevent disputes with Marvel Comics, who had created a character of their own named \"Captain Marvel\" back when the Fawcett character had lingered in limbo.[148] Several elements of the Superman narrative have remained consistent in the myriad stories published since 1938. In Action Comics #1 (1938), Superman is born on an alien world to a technologically advanced species that resembles humans. Shortly after he is born, his planet is destroyed in a natural cataclysm, but his scientist father foresaw the calamity and saves his baby son by sending him to Earth in a small spaceship. The ship is too small to carry anyone else, so Superman's parents stay behind and die. The earliest newspaper strips name the planet Krypton, the baby Kal-L, and his biological parents Jor-L and Lora;[149] their names were changed to Jor-el, and Lara in a 1942 spinoff novel by George Lowther.[150] The ship lands in the American countryside, where the baby is discovered by the Kents, a farming couple. The Kents name the boy Clark and raise him in a farming community. A 1947 episode of the radio serial places this yet unnamed community in Iowa.[151] It is named Smallville in Superboy #2 (June 1949). The 1978 Superman movie placed it in Kansas, as have most Superman stories since.[152] New Adventures of Superboy #22 (Oct. 1981) places it in Maryland. In Action Comics #1 and most stories published before 1986, Superman's powers begin developing in infancy. From 1944 to 1986, DC Comics regularly published stories of Superman's childhood and adolescent adventures, when he called himself \"Superboy\". From 1986 on (beginning with Man of Steel #1), Superman's powers emerged more slowly and he began his superhero career as an adult. The Kents teach Clark he must conceal his otherworldly origins and use his fantastic powers to do good. Clark creates the costumed identity of Superman so as to protect his personal privacy and the safety of his loved ones. As Clark Kent, he wears eyeglasses to disguise his face and wears his Superman costume underneath his clothes so that he can change at a moment's notice. To complete this disguise, Clark avoids violent confrontation, preferring to slip away and change into Superman when danger arises, and in older stories he would suffer occasional ridicule for his apparent cowardice. In Superboy #78 (1960), Superboy makes his costume out of the indestructible blankets found in the ship he came to Earth in. In Man of Steel #1 (1986), Martha Kent makes the costume from human-manufactured cloth, and it is rendered indestructible by an aura that Superman projects. The \"S\" on Superman's chest at first was simply an initial for \"Superman\". When writing the script for the 1978 movie, Tom Mankiewicz made it the crest of Superman's Kryptonian family, the House of El.[153] This was carried over into some comic book stories and later movies, such as Man of Steel. In the comic story Superman: Birthright, the crest is described as an old Kryptonian symbol for hope. Clark works as a newspaper journalist. In the earliest stories, he worked for The Daily Star, but the second episode of the radio serial changed this to the Daily Planet. In comics from the early 1970s, Clark worked as a television journalist, which was an attempt to modernize the character. However, for the 1978 movie, the producers chose to make Clark a newspaper journalist again because that was how most people outside of comic book readers knew him.[154] The first story in which Superman dies was published in Superman #149 (1961), in which he is murdered by Lex Luthor by means of kryptonite. This story was \"imaginary\" and therefore was ignored in subsequent books. In Superman #188 (April 1966), Superman is killed by kryptonite radiation but is revived in the same issue by one of his android doppelgangers. In the 1990s The Death and Return of Superman story arc, after a deadly battle with Doomsday, Superman died in Superman #75 (Jan. 1993). He was later revived by the Eradicator using Kryptonian technology. In Superman #52 (May 2016) Superman is killed by kryptonite poisoning, and this time he is not resurrected, but replaced by the Superman of an alternate timeline. Superman maintains a secret hideout called the \"Fortress of Solitude\", which is located somewhere in the Arctic. Here, Superman keeps a collection of mementos and a laboratory for science experiments. Action Comics #241 (1958) depicts the Fortress of Solitude as a cave in a mountain, sealed with a very heavy door that is opened with a gigantic key too heavy for anyone but Superman to use. In the 1978 movie, the Fortress of Solitude is a structure made of white crystal. Superman's secret identity is Clark Joseph Kent, a reporter for the Daily Planet. Although his name and history originate from his early life with his adoptive Earth parents, everything about Clark was staged for the benefit of his alternate identity: as a reporter for the Daily Planet, he receives late-breaking news before the general public, always has a plausible reason to be present at crime scenes, and need not strictly account for his whereabouts as long as he makes his publication deadlines. He sees his job as a journalist as an extension of his Superman responsibilities—bringing truth to the forefront and fighting for the little guy. He believes that everybody has the right to know what is going on in the world, regardless of who is involved.[155] In the Bronze Age of Comic Books, Clark Kent was featured in a series that appeared primarily in The Superman Family, \"The Private Life of Clark Kent\" where Superman dealt with various situations subtly while remaining Clark. To deflect suspicion that he is Superman, Clark Kent adopted a mainly passive and introverted personality with conservative mannerisms, a higher-pitched voice, and a slight slouch. This personality is typically described as \"mild-mannered\", as in the opening narration of Max Fleischer's Superman animated theatrical shorts. These traits extended into Clark's wardrobe, which typically consists of a bland-colored business suit, a red necktie, black-rimmed glasses, combed-back hair, and occasionally a fedora. Clark wears his Superman costume underneath his street clothes, allowing easy changes between the two personae and the dramatic gesture of ripping open his shirt to reveal the familiar \"S\" emblem when called into action. His hair also changes with the clothing change, with Superman sporting a small curl or spit curl on his forehead. Superman usually stores his Clark Kent clothing compressed in a secret pouch within his cape,[156] though some stories have shown him leaving his clothes in some covert location (such as the Daily Planet storeroom)[157] for later retrieval. As Superman's alter ego, the personality, concept, and name of Clark Kent have become synonymous with secret identities and innocuous fronts for ulterior motives and activities. In 1992, Superman co-creator Joe Shuster told the Toronto Star that the name derived from 1930s cinematic leading men Clark Gable and Kent Taylor, but the persona from bespectacled silent film comic Harold Lloyd and himself.[158] Clark's middle name is given variously as either Joseph, Jerome, or Jonathan, all being allusions to creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. In the original Siegel and Shuster stories, Superman's personality is rough and aggressive. He often uses excessive force and terror against criminals, on some occasions even killing them. This came to an end in late 1940 when new editor Whitney Ellsworth instituted a code of conduct for his characters to follow, banning Superman from ever killing.[159] The character was softened and given a sense of humanitarianism. Ellsworth's code, however, is not to be confused with \"the Comics Code\", which was created in 1954 by the Comics Code Authority and ultimately abandoned by every major comic book publisher by the early 21st century. In his first appearances, Superman was considered a vigilante by the authorities, being fired upon by the National Guard as he razed a slum so that the government would create better housing conditions for the poor. By 1942, however, Superman was working side-by-side with the police.[160][161] Today, Superman is commonly seen as a brave and kind-hearted hero with a strong sense of justice, morality, and righteousness. He adheres to an unwavering moral code instilled in him by his adoptive parents.[162] His commitment to operating within the law has been an example to many citizens and other heroes, but has stirred resentment and criticism among others, who refer to him as the \"big blue boy scout\". Superman can be rather rigid in this trait, causing tensions in the superhero community.[163] This was most notable with Wonder Woman, one of his closest friends, after she killed Maxwell Lord.[163] Booster Gold initially had an icy relationship with the Man of Steel but grew to respect him.[164] Having lost his home world of Krypton, Superman is very protective of Earth,[165] and especially of Clark Kent's family and friends. This same loss, combined with the pressure of using his powers responsibly, has caused Superman to feel lonely on Earth, despite having his friends and parents. Previous encounters with people he thought to be fellow Kryptonians, Power Girl[166] and Mon-El,[167] have led to disappointment. The arrival of Supergirl, who has been confirmed to be his cousin from Krypton, relieved this loneliness somewhat.[168] Superman's Fortress of Solitude acts as a place of solace for him in times of loneliness and despair.[169] The catalog of Superman's abilities and his strength has varied considerably over the vast body of Superman fiction released since 1938. Since Action Comics #1 (1938), Superman has superhuman strength. The cover of Action Comics #1 shows him effortlessly lifting a car over his head. Another classic feat of strength on Superman's part is breaking steel chains. In some stories, he is strong enough to shift the orbits of planets[170] and crush coal into diamond with his hands. Since Action Comics #1 (1938), Superman has a highly durable body, invulnerable for most practical purposes. At the very least, bullets bounce harmlessly off his body. In some stories, such as Kingdom Come, not even a nuclear bomb can harm him. In the earliest stories, Superman's costume is made out of exotic materials that are as tough as he is, which is why it typically does not tear up when he performs superhuman feats. In later stories, beginning with Man of Steel #1 (1986), Superman's body is said to project an aura that renders invulnerable any tight-fitting clothes he wears, and hence his costume is as durable as he is even if made of common cloth. In Action Comics #1, Superman could not fly. He traveled by running and leaping, which he could do to a prodigious degree thanks to his strength. Superman gained the ability to fly in the second episode of the radio serial in 1940.[171] Superman can fly faster than sound and in some stories, he can even fly faster than the speed of light to travel to distant galaxies. Superman can project and perceive X-rays via his eyes, which allows him to see through objects. He first uses this power in Action Comics #11 (1939). Certain materials such as lead can block his X-ray vision. Superman can project beams of heat from his eyes which are hot enough to melt steel. He first used this power in Superman #59 (1949) by applying his X-ray vision at its highest intensity. In later stories, this ability is simply called \"heat vision\". Superman can hear sounds that are too faint for a human to hear, and at frequencies outside the human hearing range. This ability was introduced in Action Comics #11 (1939). Since Action Comics #20 (1940), Superman possesses superhuman breath, which enables him to inhale or blow huge amounts of air, as well as holding his breath indefinitely to remain underwater or space without adverse effects. He has a significant focus of his breath's intensity to the point of freezing targets by blowing on them. The \"freeze breath\" was first demonstrated in Superman #129 (1959). Action Comics #1 (1938) explained that Superman's strength was common to all Kryptonians because they were a species \"millions of years advanced of our own\". In the first newspaper strips, Jor-El is shown running and leaping like Superman, and his wife survives a building collapsing on her. Later stories explained they evolved superhuman strength simply because of Krypton's higher gravity. Superman #146 (1961) established that Superman's abilities other than strength (flight, durability, etc.) are activated by the light of Earth's yellow sun. In Action Comics #300 (1963), all of his powers including strength are activated by yellow sunlight and can be deactivated by red sunlight similar to that of Krypton's sun. Exposure to green kryptonite radiation nullifies Superman's powers and incapacitates him with pain and nausea; prolonged exposure will eventually kill him. Although green kryptonite is the most commonly seen form, writers have introduced other forms over the years: such as red, gold, blue, white, and black, each with peculiar effects.[172] Gold kryptonite, for instance, nullifies Superman's powers but otherwise does not harm him. Kryptonite first appeared in a 1943 episode of the radio serial.[173] It first appeared in comics in Superman #61 (Dec. 1949).[174] Superman is also vulnerable to magic. Enchanted weapons and magical spells affect Superman as easily as they would a normal human. This weakness was established in Superman #171 (1964). Like all Kryptonians, Kal-El is also highly susceptible to psychokinetic phenomena ranging along Telekinesis, Illusion casting, Mind control, etc., as shown in Wonder Woman Vol 2 # 219 (Sept. 2005). A powerful enough psionic can affect either the psyche or microbiology of Superman to induce strokes or mangle his internal organs, as well as disrupt his mind and perceptions of the world, something a young power-amped Gene-Bomb meta showcased in Superman #48 (Oct. 1990). Superman's first and most famous supporting character is Lois Lane, introduced in Action Comics #1. She is a fellow journalist at the Daily Planet. As Jerry Siegel conceived her, Lois considers Clark Kent to be a wimp, but she is infatuated with the bold and mighty Superman, not knowing that Kent and Superman are the same person. Siegel objected to any proposal that Lois discover that Clark is Superman because he felt that, as implausible as Clark's disguise is, the love triangle was too important to the book's appeal.[175] However, Siegel wrote stories in which Lois suspects Clark is Superman and tries to prove it, with Superman always duping her in the end; the first such story was in Superman #17 (July–August 1942).[176][177] This was a common plot in comic book stories prior to the 1970s. In a story in Action Comics #484 (June 1978), Clark Kent admits to Lois that he is Superman, and they marry. This was the first story in which Superman and Lois marry that was not an \"imaginary tale\". Many Superman stories since then have depicted Superman and Lois as a married couple, but about as many depict them in the classic love triangle. In modern era comic books, Superman and Lois are a stable married couple, and the Superman supporting cast was further expanded with the introduction of their son, Jonathan Kent. Other supporting characters include Jimmy Olsen, a photographer at the Daily Planet, who is friends with both Superman and Clark Kent, though in most stories he does not know that Clark is Superman. Jimmy is frequently described as \"Superman's pal\", and was conceived to give young male readers a relatable character through which they could fantasize being friends with Superman. In the earliest comic book stories, Clark Kent's employer is George Taylor of The Daily Star, but the second episode of the radio serial changed this to Perry White of the Daily Planet.[178] Clark Kent's foster parents are Ma and Pa Kent. In many stories, one or both of them have died by the time Clark becomes Superman. Clark's parents taught him that he should use his abilities for altruistic means, but that he should also find some way to safeguard his private life. The villains Superman faced in the earliest stories were ordinary humans, such as gangsters, corrupt politicians, and violent husbands; but they soon grew more colorful and outlandish so as to avoid offending censors or scaring children. The mad scientist Ultra-Humanite, introduced in Action Comics #13 (June 1939), was Superman's first recurring villain. Superman's best-known nemesis, Lex Luthor, was introduced in Action Comics #23 (April 1940) and has been depicted as either a mad scientist or a wealthy businessman (sometimes both).[179] In 1944, the magical imp Mister Mxyzptlk, Superman's first recurring super-powered adversary, was introduced.[180] Superman's first alien villain, Brainiac, debuted in Action Comics #242 (July 1958). The monstrous Doomsday, introduced in Superman: The Man of Steel #17–18 (Nov.-Dec. 1992), was the first villain to evidently kill Superman in physical combat without exploiting Superman's critical weaknesses such as kryptonite and magic. The details of Superman's origin story and supporting cast vary across his large body of fiction released since 1938, but most versions conform to the basic template described above. A few stories feature radically altered versions of Superman. An example is the graphic novel Superman: Red Son, which depicts a communist Superman who rules the Soviet Union. DC Comics has on some occasions published crossover stories where different versions of Superman interact with each other using the plot device of parallel universes. For instance, in the 1960s, the Superman of \"Earth-One\" would occasionally feature in stories alongside the Superman of \"Earth-Two\", the latter of whom resembled Superman as he was portrayed in the 1940s. DC Comics has not developed a consistent and universal system to classify all versions of Superman. Superman is often considered the first superhero. This point can be debated: Ogon Bat, the Phantom, Zorro, and Mandrake the Magician arguably fit the definition of the superhero yet predate Superman. Nevertheless, Superman popularized this kind of character and established the conventions: a costume, a codename, extraordinary abilities, and an altruistic mission.[citation needed] Superman's success in 1938 begat a wave of imitations, which include Batman, Captain America, and Captain Marvel. This flourishing is today referred to as America's Golden Age of Comic Books, which lasted from 1938 to about 1950. The Golden Age ended when American superhero book sales declined, leading to the cancellation of many characters; but Superman was one of the few superhero franchises that survived this decline, and his sustained popularity into the late 1950s led to a revival in the Silver Age of Comic Books, when characters such as Spider-Man, Iron Man, and The X-Men were created. After World War II, American superhero fiction entered Japanese culture. Astro Boy, first published in 1952, was inspired by Mighty Mouse, which in turn was a parody of Superman.[181] The Superman animated shorts from the 1940s were first broadcast on Japanese television in 1955, and they were followed in 1956 by the TV show Adventures of Superman starring George Reeves. These shows were popular with the Japanese and inspired Japan's own prolific genre of superheroes. The first Japanese superhero movie, Super Giant, was released in 1957. The first Japanese superhero TV show was Moonlight Mask in 1958. Other notable Japanese superheroes include Ultraman, Kamen Rider, and Sailor Moon.[182][183][184] Since the Pop Art period and the 1960s, the character of Superman has been \"appropriated\" by multiple visual artists and incorporated into contemporary artwork,[185][186] most notably by Andy Warhol,[187][188] Roy Lichtenstein,[189] Mel Ramos,[190] Dulce Pinzon,[191] Mr. Brainwash,[192] Raymond Pettibon,[193] Peter Saul,[194] Giuseppe Veneziano,[195] F. Lennox Campello,[196] and others.[192][197][198] Superman has been interpreted and discussed in many forms, with Umberto Eco noting that \"he can be seen as the representative of all his similars\".[199] Writing in Time in 1971, Gerald Clarke stated: \"Superman's enormous popularity might be looked upon as signaling the beginning of the end for the Horatio Alger myth of the self-made man.\" Clarke viewed the comics characters as having to continuously update in order to maintain relevance and thus representing the mood of the nation. He regarded Superman's character in the early seventies as a comment on the modern world, which he saw as a place in which \"only the man with superpowers can survive and prosper\".[200] Andrew Arnold, writing in the early 21st century, has noted Superman's partial role in exploring assimilation, the character's alien status allowing the reader to explore attempts to fit in on a somewhat superficial level. A.C. Grayling, writing in The Spectator, traces Superman's stances through the decades, from his 1930s campaign against crime being relevant to a nation under the influence of Al Capone, through the 1940s and World War II, a period in which Superman helped sell war bonds,[201] and into the 1950s, where Superman explored the new technological threats. Grayling notes the period after the Cold War as being one where \"matters become merely personal: the task of pitting his brawn against the brains of Lex Luthor and Brainiac appeared to be independent of bigger questions\", and discusses events post 9/11, stating that as a nation \"caught between the terrifying George W. Bush and the terrorist Osama bin Laden, America is in earnest need of a Saviour for everything from the minor inconveniences to the major horrors of world catastrophe. And here he is, the down-home clean-cut boy in the blue tights and red cape\".[202] An influence on early Superman stories is the context of the Great Depression. Superman took on the role of social activist, fighting crooked businessmen and politicians and demolishing run-down tenements.[203] Comics scholar Roger Sabin sees this as a reflection of \"the liberal idealism of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal\", with Shuster and Siegel initially portraying Superman as champion to a variety of social causes.[204][205] In later Superman radio programs the character continued to take on such issues, tackling a version of the Ku Klux Klan in a 1946 broadcast, as well as combating anti-semitism and veteran discrimination.[206][207][208] Scott Bukatman has discussed Superman, and the superhero in general, noting the ways in which they humanize large urban areas through their use of the space, especially in Superman's ability to soar over the large skyscrapers of Metropolis. He writes that the character \"represented, in 1938, a kind of Corbusierian ideal. Superman has X-ray vision: walls become permeable, transparent. Through his benign, controlled authority, Superman renders the city open, modernist and democratic; he furthers a sense that Le Corbusier described in 1925, namely, that 'Everything is known to us'.\"[209] Jules Feiffer has argued that Superman's real innovation lay in the creation of the Clark Kent persona, noting that what \"made Superman extraordinary was his point of origin: Clark Kent.\" Feiffer develops the theme to establish Superman's popularity in simple wish fulfillment,[210] a point Siegel and Shuster themselves supported, Siegel commenting that \"If you're interested in what made Superman what it is, here's one of the keys to what made it universally acceptable. Joe and I had certain inhibitions... which led to wish-fulfillment which we expressed through our interest in science fiction and our comic strip. That's where the dual-identity concept came from\" and Shuster supporting that as being \"why so many people could relate to it\".[211] Ian Gordon suggests that the many incarnations of Superman across media use nostalgia to link the character to an ideology of the American Way. He defines this ideology as a means of associating individualism, consumerism, and democracy and as something that took shape around WWII and underpinned the war effort. Superman, he notes was very much part of that effort.[212] Superman's immigrant status is a key aspect of his appeal.[213][214][215] Aldo Regalado saw the character as pushing the boundaries of acceptance in America. The extraterrestrial origin was seen by Regalado as challenging the notion that Anglo-Saxon ancestry was the source of all might.[216] Gary Engle saw the \"myth of Superman [asserting] with total confidence and a childlike innocence the value of the immigrant in American culture\". He argues that Superman allowed the superhero genre to take over from the Western as the expression of immigrant sensibilities. Through the use of a dual identity, Superman allowed immigrants to identify with both of their cultures. Clark Kent represents the assimilated individual, allowing Superman to express the immigrants' cultural heritage for the greater good.[214] David Jenemann has offered a contrasting view. He argues that Superman's early stories portray a threat: \"the possibility that the exile would overwhelm the country\".[217] David Rooney, a theater critic for The New York Times, in his evaluation of the play Year Zero considers Superman to be the \"quintessential immigrant story [...] [b]orn on an alien planet, he grows stronger on Earth, but maintains a secret identity tied to a homeland that continues to exert a powerful hold on him even as his every contact with those origins does him harm\".[218] It is popularly believed that Superman took inspiration from Judaic mythology. The British rabbi Simcha Weinstein notes that Superman's story has some parallels to that of Moses. For example, Moses as a baby was sent away by his parents in a reed basket to escape death and was adopted by a foreign culture. Weinstein also posits that Superman's Kryptonian name, \"Kal-El\", resembles the Hebrew phrase qōl ʾēl (קוֹל-אֵל) which can be taken to mean \"voice of God\".[219] The historian Larry Tye suggests that this \"Voice of God\" is an allusion to Moses' role as a prophet.[220] The suffix \"el\", meaning \"god\", is also found in the name of angels (e.g. Gabriel, Ariel), who are airborne humanoid agents of good with superhuman powers. The Nazis also thought Superman was a Jew and in 1940 Joseph Goebbels publicly denounced Superman and his creator Jerry Siegel.[221] All that said, historians such as Martin Lund and Les Daniels argue that the evidence for Judaic influence in Siegel and Shuster's stories is merely circumstantial. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were not practicing Jews and never acknowledged the influence of Judaism in any memoir or interview.[222][223] Superman stories have occasionally exhibited Christian themes as well. Screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz consciously made Superman an allegory for Jesus Christ in the 1978 movie starring Christopher Reeve: baby Kal-El's ship resembles the Star of Bethlehem, and Jor-El gives his son a messianic mission to lead humanity into a brighter future.[224] This messianic theme was revisited in the 2013 movie Man of Steel, wherein Jor-El asks Superman to redeem the Kryptonian race, which corrupted itself through eugenics, by guiding humanity down a wiser path.[225]",

                "content": "Superman is a famous comic book character, and is often known as the first modern superhero character. He was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1932, while they were still in high school. He first appeared in Action Comics issue #1 in 1938. Later, he appeared in movies, television series, cartoons, commercials, video games, and radio shows. Superman is one of the most popular superheroes, he is also in the DC Comics. His name is Clark Kent in the comics. [source?] As a superhero he does not want to kill anyone. But he was forced to kill his nemesis General Zod as Zod was about to kill people. Several actors have played Superman in motion pictures and TV series including Bud Collyer, Kirk Alyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain, Tim Daly, Tom Welling, Brandon Routh, Henry Cavill, Tyler Hoechlin and David Corenswet. Mr. Siegel imagined an evil villain who read minds and dreamed of conquering the world. He went by the name of the Superman. In the 1930s, Adolf Hitler, the infamous nazi villain from real life, was talking about getting rid of the Jews and communists. This was because he believed that Germans he called Aryans were supermen. Mr. Siegel, who was Jewish, found this disgusting. But one night, Mr. Siegel tossed and turned in his bed, and had a horrible time getting to sleep. When he awoke, Superman became the superman we know today, and the evil version disappeared.[source?] Superman was born on a planet called Krypton. His name was Kal-El. When his father, Jor-El, found out that their planet was going to explode, Jor-El sent his baby son to Earth in a spacecraft to save him. Kal-El was found and adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent. They named him Clark Kent. The Kents raised him as their own son in a town called Smallville, Kansas in the United States. (There is a television series called Smallville about his time growing up there) As he grows up, Clark finds out that he has special powers. He is almost invulnerable (most things cannot hurt him). He is strong enough to lift almost anything and he can fly. Superman can also run and move faster than a bullet. He has X-ray vision (he can see through walls, he is not able to see through lead), and heat vision (shooting heat from his eyes). He can freeze things with his frost breath and his super-breath (which allows him to blow super hard). He decides to use his special powers to fight crime and save people in danger. He wears a blue and red costume and cape to keep his alter ego (his real name) a secret. He saves the entire world many times. Superman moves to a city called Metropolis, and becomes a reporter for the Daily Planet, a newspaper. He falls in love with another reporter, Lois Lane. His weaknesses are radioactive rocks from his home planet that are called \"kryptonite\"; and magic. Sometimes his enemies use it to hurt him. Diffferent Kryptoinites have different effects on him, Blue Kryptonite makes people able to control him using hypnosis, green weakens his powers and slowly kills him, black makes him evil, and red has many different effects on him (each piece of red kryptonite affects him differently). There is also gold, white, and jewel kryptonite. Some of Superman's enemies use magic to hurt him. His most well known arch enemy is a bald (hairless), evil genius named Lex Luthor. He has other deadly enemies too. Bizarro is a failed duplicate of Superman. Darkseid is a very powerful enemy, and the ruler of the planet Apokolips. Doomsday is regarded as the first villain to kill Superman in physical combat, but he is later revived. Another enemy includes General Zod who comes from the same planet as Superman. Superman also founded the Justice League of America alongside Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Hawkgirl, Hawkman, and Martian Manhunter. Several live-action television shows have focused on Superman: Superman has also been featured in many cartoon shows including:",

Nebraska plays its home games at the Bob Devaney Sports Center and has sold out every home match since 2001.[2] The team has been coached by John Cook since 2000. The program was founded in 1975 and is one of the most decorated in women's volleyball, with more wins than any other program and five national championships.[3] Nebraska has been ranked in every weekly poll since the introduction of the AVCA National Poll in 1982 and has spent more weeks ranked number one than any other program. The Cornhuskers' 102 All-Americans are the most in the country.[4][5] Nebraska regularly leads the NCAA in average attendance and has participated in several of the highest-attended women's volleyball games ever played.[6] On August 30, 2023, Nebraska and Omaha played at Memorial Stadium in front of 92,003 people, the highest-attended women's sporting event in the world.[7][8] Until the 1972 passing of Title IX, Nebraska's volleyball program existed for four years as an \"extramural\" sport operating as a part of the school's physical education department.[9] Pat Sullivan was hired in 1974, and she led the program's first season of varsity competition. Though the school offered its first scholarships for female student-athletes to members of this team, which went 25–10–1 and placed sixth in the AIAW's Region VI tournament, the university recognizes 1975 as its inaugural season due to \"a lack of records [from 1974] and tradition.\"[10] Sullivan compiled an 83–21 record over two official seasons, including an AIAW regional final appearance in 1975 and NU's first Big Eight championship in 1976.[11] Sullivan would later go on to coach volleyball at George Washington University for nine seasons, as well as be a professor there.[12][13] Terry Pettit was hired as Nebraska's second head coach in 1977.[14] Pettit, an Indiana native, was an English teacher and volleyball coach at Louisburg College in North Carolina[15] when a fellow coach found out about Nebraska's open job and directed Pettit to apply.[16] From 1977 to 1999, he led the Cornhuskers to a record of 694–148, winning twenty-one conference championships and the 1995 national championship.[17] In his twenty-three years as head coach,[18] Pettit built the program into a national power. Under his guidance, Nebraska appeared in eighteen consecutive NCAA tournaments, including six national semifinals, two national runner-up finishes, and NU's first national title. Pettit's teams won a conference championship in all but two seasons during his tenure. His list of honors includes induction into the AVCA Hall of Fame in 2009, USA Volleyball All-Time Great Coach Award, and several national and regional coach of the year awards from various publications.[19][20] Under Pettit, Nebraska became one of the first schools to offer scholarships to female athletes. In 1978, Terri Kanouse and Shandi Pettine were the first players to receive full scholarships for volleyball, and just three years later, the university allowed Pettit to offer up to twelve scholarships.[21] Pettit coached thirty-six AVCA All-Americans at Nebraska, the highest number of any school in that time span.[17] Pettit's only national championship as a head coach came in 1995.[15] After dropping an early-season match to Stanford, NU swept twenty-two consecutive opponents and won thirty-one straight matches. Nebraska defeated Texas 3–1 to win the title, and AVCA National Player of the Year Allison Weston was among three Huskers named first-team All-Americans. Before the 1999 season, Pettit hired former assistant John Cook as associate head coach. Following Nebraska's loss in the national semifinals, Pettit retired and Cook became head coach. In 2020, Pettit was inducted into the Nebraska Athletics Hall of Fame.[22] Cook succeeded the retiring Pettit before the 2000 season after a seven-year stint as head coach at Wisconsin. He was Pettit's assistant coach from 1989 to 1991.[18] In twenty years at Nebraska, Cook has guided the Huskers to four national championships, five other national semifinal appearances and an NCAA tournament berth in each season. Cook was named National Coach of the Year in 2000 and 2005, Central Region Coach of the Year four times, and conference coach of the year six times. He was awarded the USA Volleyball All-Time Great Coach Award in 2008, and was inducted into the AVCA Hall of Fame in 2017. Under Cook, Greichaly Cepero, Christina Houghtelling, and Sarah Pavan won AVCA National Player of the Year, and Pavan won the Honda-Broderick Cup in 2007 as the Collegiate Female Athlete of the Year. In his first year as NU's head coach, Cook guided the Huskers to their second national championship. After starting the season outside the national top ten, Nebraska went 20–0 in Big 12 play and defeated Cook's former team, Wisconsin, in a five-set national title match to cap a 34–0 season and become the second undefeated team in NCAA volleyball history.[23] Sophomore setter Greichaly Cepero was named National Player of the Year and won the Honda Sports Award as the best female athlete in collegiate sports.[5] Nebraska finished the 2001 and 2002 seasons 20–0 in conference play, but lost late in the tournament to Stanford and Hawaii, ending both seasons 31–2. Nebraska's seventy-seven game Big 12 winning streak ended with a loss at Kansas State in 2003 as the Cornhuskers failed to make it out of a regional. Nebraska earned the number one overall seed in the 2004 NCAA tournament, which began an NCAA-record eighty-eight consecutive weeks the Cornhuskers were ranked atop the AVCA weekly poll. The Huskers fell to two-time defending champion USC but freshman Sarah Pavan was named AVCA National Freshman of the Year. Pavan became one of the most decorated players in volleyball history, including four First-Team All-American honors and the 2006 National Player of the Year award. Nebraska was again the top seed in the 2005 NCAA Tournament and swept through the first five rounds, but was upset by Washington in the national title match.[24] Nebraska lost only once in the 2006 regular season as its streak at the top of the rankings continued. The Cornhuskers were the top seed in the NCAA Tournament for the third consecutive year and returned to the national title match after a five-set win over Minnesota.[25] Nebraska dropped the first set to Stanford but won the next three to win the school's third championship in front of a then-NCAA volleyball-record crowd of 17,209.[26] Nebraska swept twenty-four of its thirty-three opponents and lost just fourteen sets all season and became the first team to win the championship while hosting the finals since UCLA in 1991.[5] Pavan won numerous awards after the season and sophomore Jordan Larson was named a first-team All American.[27][28] Nebraska's season opener in 2007 marked the program's 1,000th game, a sweep of Tennessee in the AVCA Showcase.[29] The Cornhuskers' eighty-eight week streak at number one came to an end in October, but NU won its fourth straight Big 12 title. After surviving an upset bid by unseeded Michigan State in the NCAA Tournament, Nebraska fell to California in the regional final.[30] Pavan joined Texas softball pitcher Cat Osterman as the only repeat Big 12 Female Athlete of the Year and Nebraska placed a then-record five players on All-America teams.[31] Nebraska won its fifth consecutive Big 12 title in 2008[32] and advanced through the first three rounds of the NCAA Tournament to face Washington.[33] After losing the first two sets, Nebraska came back to tie the match, and used a nine-point run to win set five.[34] Nebraska met undefeated Penn State in the national semifinal and again fell behind 2–0. The Huskers rallied to deal the Nittany Lions their first two set losses of the season, snapping their NCAA-record 111 consecutive set wins, but lost the match in five sets.[35] Nebraska's NCAA-record ninety-game home winning streak came to an end at the beginning of the 2009 season.[36] In the 2009 NCAA Tournament Texas became the first team to beat NU three times in one season after ending the Huskers' five-year stretch atop the Big 12.[37] In 2010, the University of Nebraska announced it would be ending its fifteen-year relationship with the Big 12 and joining the Big Ten. The Cornhuskers won the Big 12 in 2010, departing with an all-time conference record of 278–22. Move to the Big Ten The University of Nebraska joined the Big Ten Conference in 2011. This meant for the first time NU would regularly play longtime rival Penn State along with other nationally relevant programs including Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois. The Huskers won the Big Ten in their first year of competition but failed to make a regional semifinal for the first time since 1993.[38] Nebraska did not win another Big Ten title until 2016 and failed to make the national semifinals in six straight seasons, the longest stretch for the program in over thirty years. Nebraska's drought ended in 2015 when the Cornhuskers swept former Big 12 rival Texas to win the program's fourth national championship in front of an NCAA-record crowd in Omaha. Mikaela Foecke had nineteen kills in the title game and became the third freshman named the NCAA tournament's Most Outstanding Player. The Cornhuskers spent much of the following season ranked number one in the country and won the program's first conference title since 2011.[39] In the 2016 NCAA Tournament, Nebraska fought off two match points to defeat Penn State in the regional semifinals[40] but fell to Texas in the national semifinals.[41] Nebraska's 2017 season opened with consecutive losses to Florida and Oregon, but the Cornhuskers finished the regular season with just two more losses, ultimately sharing the Big Ten title with Penn State. NU defeated the top-seeded Nittany Lions in five sets to advance to the national title match, defeating Florida 3–1 to win the school's fifth national title in front of a then-record crowd of 18,516.[42] Outside hitter Mikaela Foecke was again named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, making her one of four players to win the honor more than once. NU made a program-record fourth straight trip to the national semifinals in 2018 but fell to Stanford in a five-set national title match. After a pair of regional final losses in 2019 and 2020 (though the 2020 Tournament was held in the spring of 2021), NU defeated No. 2 Texas and No. 3 Pittsburgh in the 2021 Tournament to reach the school's tenth national title match; Nebraska's five-set loss to Wisconsin set a new NCAA volleyball attendance record.[43] Following the season, freshman libero Lexi Rodriguez became the second Cornhusker and first libero to win AVCA National Freshman of the Year. On August 30, 2023, Nebraska hosted \"Volleyball Day in Nebraska\" at Memorial Stadium, with a temporary court on the football playing field. The event featured an exhibition between two of the state's three Division II schools, Nebraska–Kearney and Wayne State, followed by a regular-season match between the Cornhuskers and Omaha. The event was declared a sellout on April 27, three days after tickets went on sale. The official attendance for Nebraska's 3–0 victory was 92,003, the highest ever for a women's sporting event in the United States. It also set an all-time attendance record for a sporting event in Memorial Stadium history.[44][7] Assistant coaching history NU compiled an all-time record of 511–36 at the 4,030-seat Nebraska Coliseum, losing just three home matches in thirty-three seasons of conference play. In 1991, the Cornhuskers played home games at the Bob Devaney Sports Center while the Coliseum was being renovated specifically to host volleyball matches. NU has hosted at least one NCAA Tournament match every year since 1984, including a 52–4 postseason record at the Coliseum. Nebraska established an NCAA record with their 88th consecutive home win in 2009,[45] a streak that ended at ninety when UCLA defeated NU in front of an NCAA regular season-record crowd of 13,870.[46] In 2008, the AVCA's Kathy DeBoer described the Coliseum as \"the epicenter of volleyball fandom\".[47] The Coliseum was one of few collegiate arenas designed specifically for volleyball. It is noted for its classical architecture and intimate atmosphere. At the Coliseum, the Huskers began an NCAA record for most consecutive sellouts in a women's sport, a streak that continues at the Devaney Center.[48] The Coliseum was the subject of a CBS Sports documentary in 2011.[49] Nebraska's volleyball program moved to the Bob Devaney Sports Center in 2013, which was vacated when Pinnacle Bank Arena was built for NU's basketball teams. The Devaney Center's capacity was decreased from 13,596 to 7,907 with luxury suites on the south side of the court.[50] The capacity was modestly increased to 8,309 prior to the 2023 season.[51] Despite the increase in capacity from the Coliseum, the Huskers' sellout streak still continues and stands at 339, the longest in any NCAA women's sport.[52] Nebraska has led the country in attendance every year since moving to the Devaney Center,[a] averaging over 8,000 fans per game each season.[53] The move to the Devaney Center has made Nebraska's volleyball program profitable each year, a rarity in women's college athletics.[54] With no financial support from tax dollars, tuition, or student fees, the team is entirely self-sufficient.[55] Nebraska has played in eleven of the twelve highest-attended matches in NCAA volleyball history.[b][56] National Player of the Year National Freshman of the Year National Coach of the Year Nebraska has had 54 total players account for 106 AVCA All-American selections, including 52 First-Team AVCA All-American selections.[57][58] First team Second team Third team Team[59][60] Individual The Nebraska Cornhuskers women's beach volleyball team began play in the spring of 2013 as the school's twenty-second intercollegiate sport. In 2016, the NCAA began sponsoring a beach volleyball tournament (previously the sport was run by the AVCA), but Nebraska did not attempt to qualify. Increasing popularity of the sport in the Midwest has resulted in a significant uptick in participation; Nebraska is now one of four Division 1 competitors in the Midwest (alongside Eastern Illinois, Lindenwood and Missouri State). Several universities at lower levels have also formed programs, including one of the Nebraska State Colleges, Wayne State.[61] Still, events in the Midwest are scarce and NU generally plays the bulk of its season during a spring break trip to California and Hawaii. John Cook, previously coach for both volleyball programs, has said the school views beach volleyball primarily as a training and recruiting tool for its indoor team, with the rosters usually fully overlapping. Championship-winning success from the indoor program has not translated to the beach volleyball scene— the team has a 3-52 record all-time against ranked opponents. Jaylen Reyes took over as Head Beach Coach for the 2023 season.[62] Beach volleyball competes as an independent, making it one of only three programs at Nebraska not affiliated with the Big Ten. On March 9, 2016, Nebraska hosted Missouri Baptist at the erstwhile Hawks Championship Center. The match, closed to the public due to space limitations, was the first collegiate beach volleyball match held in the state of Nebraska. The Cornhuskers swept the Spartans 5–0. A rematch the next season yielded identical results. Another 23 matches have been held at the athletic complex.[63] Additionally, in February 2024, Nebraska hosted a triangular at its campus recreational courts.[64] In 2007, prior to official AVCA/NCAA competitions, Jordan Larson and Sarah Pavan defeated student-athletes from seven other schools to win the Collegiate Beach Volleyball Championship, an invitational tournament featuring two players per school.[65]",

It marked the first reverse sweep in the semifinals of the tournament since 2018. Nebraska appeared poised to advance after taking the first two sets with strong performances from Andi Jackson, who finished with 18 kills, and a solid defensive effort from Rebekah Allick. But Penn State rallied, led by Jess Mruzik’s offensive spark and Izzy Starck’s key blocks, to take control in the next three sets. The Nittany Lions found their rhythm in the third set, using a 5-0 run to take the lead, with Starck contributing six blocks and Mruzik finishing with 17 kills. The Huskers struggled to contain Penn State’s momentum as the match continued. In the fourth, Nebraska had a 22-16 advantage, which would lead to the Huskers being able to close out the semifinal with two match points, but the set ended with the Nittany Lions stunning the Nebraska-dominant crowd sealing the fourth with a 28-26 final score. In a thrilling fifth set, Penn State held off a late Nebraska push, with Starck’s block sealing the win. This marks Penn State's 14th NCAA championship match appearance and their first since 2017. They’ll face Louisville on Sunday, December 22. Penn State stormed back to win the fourth set 28-26 in extra points.

                "content": "Neil Patrick Cavuto (born September 22, 1958) is an American television news anchor, executive, commentator, and business journalist. He was the host of Your World with Neil Cavuto and Cavuto Live, both on Fox News, and Cavuto: Coast to Coast on sister channel Fox Business Network until he left the network on December 19, 2024.[1] Cavuto was born in Westbury, New York, on Long Island, the son of Kathleen T. (Feeley), a United Nations staffer and homemaker, and Patrick \"Pat\" Cavuto, a can company sales executive.[2] His father was of Italian descent, while his mother was of Irish ancestry.[3] He was raised in Danbury, Connecticut, where he attended Immaculate High School. At 17, he became the manager of a fish and chips restaurant while attending high school.[4] He worked as a White House intern during the Carter Administration. He graduated from St. Bonaventure University in 1980 with a bachelor's degree in mass communication, and earned a master's degree from American University.[5] Before joining Fox, Cavuto was a principal anchor and reporter for CNBC.[6] He co-anchored CNBC's initial broadcast on April 17, 1989.[6][7] He hosted Power Lunch on CNBC, contributed to NBC's Today, and worked with the Public Broadcasting Service for 15 years reporting for Nightly Business Report. He was also a New York City bureau chief.[8] Cavuto joined Fox News in July 1996, and became host and managing editor of Your World with Neil Cavuto when the network launched in October.[9] He became a vice president of FOX Business News in March 2006. He serves all three positions concurrently.[10] Your World is Fox's main business news program.[11] He has five nominations for Cable ACE awards.[12] He is the author of More Than Money and Your Money or Your Life.[13] Both books were New York Times best sellers.[5] A frequent critic of President Donald Trump, Cavuto has been labeled a \"Trump skeptic\" by NPR and The Daily Beast.[14][15][16] In February 2020, Trump dedicated 20 minutes of a rally in Colorado Springs, Colorado, to attacking him.[17] On December 19, 2024, it was announced that Cavuto would be leaving Fox News after 28 years on air after declining to accept a new contract from Fox. Rotating hosts will helm the program until a new host is named in January 2025. Cavuto and his wife, Mary Fulling, whom he married on October 15, 1983, have three children. They live in Mendham Borough, New Jersey.[18][19] Cavuto has experienced numerous health problems,[20] saying: \"I don't hide that I have had a tough life in many respects. I fought back a near-life-ending cancer, only to end up with multiple sclerosis years later. Doctors have since told me that the odds of contracting both diseases in the same life are something like two million to one! Yet here I am, marching on, continuing to do my job when doctors who've examined my scans and MRIs tell me I shouldn't be walking or talking.\"[21] As reported on June 22, 2016, by Charles Payne on Your World, Cavuto had undergone, and was recovering from, recent cardiac surgery.[22] In October 2021, Cavuto tested positive for COVID-19. He had been vaccinated, and said: \"Had I not been vaccinated, and with all my medical issues, this would be a far more dire situation. It's not, because I did and I'm surviving this because I did.\"[23] He subsequently contracted the disease a second time, and was hospitalized with pneumonia. After recovering, he again praised the efficacy of vaccines and advocated their use.[24]",

                "content": "WASHINGTON D.C., DC — Neil Cavuto, a business journalist who hosts a weekday afternoon show on Fox News Channel and has been with the network since its inception in 1996, is leaving after Thursday's show, Fox said. A workhorse at the network, Cavuto also hosts programs at Fox's sister, the Fox Business Network, and is not considered one of the stable of opinion hosts. “Neil Cavuto's illustrious career has been a master class in journalism and we're extremely proud of his incredible 28-year run with Fox News Media,” the network said. “His programs have defined business news and set the standard for the entire industry. We wish him a heartfelt farewell and all the best on his next chapter.” Unlike many at Fox, he has not interviewed President-elect Donald Trump since 2017 and sometimes has angered him. One time came when Cavuto said on his show that Trump had “decisively lost” his debate with Democrat Kamala Harris. Cavuto remarked this summer that when the stock market goes up, Trump says it is because of investors looking forward to him being back in power, but when it's down, he blames the Democrats. On social media Thursday, Trump used all-caps to say Cavuto's departure is “GOOD NEWS FOR AMERICA.” He said it “should have happened a long time ago.” While Cavuto's exit removes a Trump irritant from Fox, that fact had nothing to do with it, said a person at the network with knowledge of the discussions but spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about contracts. Cavuto's contract was coming to an end and while he was offered an extension, he decided to leave, the person said. With the television news business hurting financially, some major personalities have reportedly been asked to take pay cuts. Some, like the “Today” show's Hoda Kotb, decided to leave instead. Cavuto, 66, has stayed on the job despite a number of health issues through the years. He has multiple sclerosis, underwent heart surgery and had bouts of long COVID. There's no immediate word on who will replace Cavuto at 4 p.m. Eastern on Fox's schedule, a coveted slot before the network's most popular show, “The Five.” ___ David Bauder writes about media for the AP.

                "content": "Manage your account Everything is coming up roses for Donald Trump. ABC News settles a lawsuit with Trump many legal experts think the network could have won, paying $15 million. Amazon gives $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund. Jeff Bezos, the founder and executive chairman of Amazon, is also the owner of the Washington Post. Remind me, what does democracy die in again? And now, Neil Cavuto is leaving Fox News. This may not seem as momentous, but in its way it is. Trump has long been critical of Cavuto, who hosts \"Your World with Neil Cavuto,\" \"Cavuto: Coast to Coast\" and \"Cavuto Live.\" A Fox News source, however, said that Cavuto's exit had nothing to do with Trump's return to office. Cavuto's contract was up at the end of the month and Cavuto chose to leave. More: Neil Cavuto is leaving Fox News after 28 years amid 'evolving' shifts in business Still. The timing is awful for viewers. Cavuto, who has been at the network for 28 years, was one of the few remaining big personalities willing to criticize Trump — doing so fairly and responsibly — and certainly the most critical of the news team. (Jessica Tarlov remains a reliable critic on \"The Five,\" but she's outnumbered.) For instance, in October Cavuto blasted Trump on the air for spreading misinformation about federal response to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. \"That kind of misinformation gets out there, and whether it's perpetrated by a politician or someone you think is someone of note and authority, it is wrong and it is bull and it cannot be tolerated,\" Cavuto said. In February Cavuto cut away from live coverage of a Trump rally to dispute Trump's false claims about the 2020 election. \"We're continuing the monitoring of the president’s remarks,\" Cavuto said, \"and I mean no offense to him if some of you might want to continue hearing. But I did have to say that even though the former president is entitled to his opinions, he’s not entitled to his own set of facts.” Bravo. He's exactly right, and with an emboldened Trump threatening his perceived enemies, it's more important than ever to say that kind of thing. Who's going to say it that strongly now? Certainly, there aren't a lot of candidates who straddle news and personality the way Cavuto does at Fox News. But that's expected; at times the prime-time hosts at times seem to serve practically as campaign boosters for Trump. But what about the rest of the media? ABC News' $15 million will go to Trump's presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over an interview anchor George Stephanopoulos conducted in March with U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, a rape survivor. Stephanopoulos asked how she could support Trump, who has been found liable of sexual abuse by a New York jury. Stephanopoulos repeatedly said Trump had been found liable of rape. Greater legal minds than mine can explain the distinction — and why it would have been difficult for Trump to prove Stephanopoulos intentionally defamed him. The smart money says ABC was worried about what would come out in discovery in emails and texts. Still, it sets the potential for a chilling precedent. And if you think it's going to appease Trump, dream on. He's already filed suit against the Des Moines Register and Gannett over a pre-election poll that showed Trump would lose Iowa; he won the state. (Note: Gannett owns The Arizona Republic.) The Register is standing firm in defense of the poll. Good. Trump has long been a fan of legal threats. If you sued someone every time a poll was wrong, there wouldn't be any polls left. (Although some people might cheer that development.) As for Bezos, who owns several companies, it seems clear he's toadying up to Trump. In addition to the Amazon donation, Bezos dined with him at Mar-a-Lago, effusively congratulated him after the election and, most damningly, killed a Post endorsement of Kamala Harris for president. All of a sudden the paper changed its policies and wasn't going to endorse anymore. Nice timing. Which brings us back to Cavuto. He is expected to address his departure on his last show Thursday. A rotating group of anchors will host his shows until a new show debuts in 2025. Too bad. Media needs more people like Cavuto, not fewer. It's going to be a long four years otherwise.

                "title": "Fair catch kick - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The fair catch kick is a rule at the professional and high school levels of American football that allows a team that has just made a fair catch to attempt a free kick[A] from the spot of the catch. The kick must be either a place kick or a drop kick, and if it passes over the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal, a field goal, worth three points, is awarded to the kicking team. The fair catch kick has its origins in rugby football's goal from mark, which has since been abolished in both major rugby codes; a similar rule, the mark, is a major part of Australian rules football. The fair catch kick is considered to be an obscure rule and it is rarely attempted. Because most fair catches are made well out of field goal range, and a team making a fair catch has possession of the ball and a first down, it is rarely to a team's advantage to attempt a fair catch kick rather than run a play from scrimmage. A team may attempt a fair catch kick if it makes a fair catch when the clock expires at the end of either half, as a half must be extended in order to allow a fair catch kick attempt. At the professional level, the most recent successful fair catch kick was made on December 19, 2024, by Cameron Dicker of the Los Angeles Chargers against the Denver Broncos; prior to that, the last successful attempt had occurred in 1976. The fair catch kick rule states that, after a player has successfully made a fair catch or has been awarded a fair catch as the result of a penalty such as kick catch interference, their team can attempt a kick from the spot of the catch;[1][2] the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) rulebook also allows a kick to be made if the down following the fair catch or awarded fair catch has to be replayed.[1] Prior to the kick, the opposing team must be lined up at least ten yards beyond the spot of the ball.[3][4] The kick itself can be either a place kick or drop kick;[5][6] a kicking tee cannot be used at the professional level, but use of a tee up to two inches in height is permitted at the high school level.[4][7] Like other field goal attempts, the kicking team is awarded three points if the kick goes above the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal and did not touch a player of the kicking team after the kick.[8][9] If the attempt fails, the opposing team is awarded control of the ball from the spot of the kick.[10][11] The opposing team can also return the kick if it does not go out of bounds.[3][11] In the NFHS rulebook, the fair catch kick is specifically defined as a free kick.[12] The National Football League (NFL) rulebook specifically states that the fair catch kick is not a free kick,[4] instead considering the fair catch kick to be a distinct type of kick.[13] Despite this, reporters at both levels describe the fair catch kick as a free kick.[14][15][16] The XFL (2020) rulebook defines the fair catch kick separately from the free kick. Under the XFL rules, a fair catch kick cannot itself be returned and the play ends when either team secures possession of the ball; the formation is executed under the XFL's rules for an onside kick, which are separate from those of the XFL's standard kickoff formation.[17] The fair catch kick found in American football originated in rugby football. A similar rule in rugby, the goal from mark, allowed a player who had fair caught a ball to attempt an uncontested free kick from the spot of the fair catch. Both major codes of rugby have eliminated the rule: rugby league abolished the goal from mark in 1922, and rugby union removed it in 1977.[18] Australian rules football has retained the rule, and it is a vital part of the Australian game; a \"fair catch\" of a ball kicked more than 15 meters in the air is called a mark, and the player making the mark is then awarded a free kick.[19] The fair catch kick has been present in the NFL rulebook since the league's inception,[14] and also remains in the NFHS rulebook.[20] The fair catch kick is not legal in National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) football; the NCAA abolished the fair catch in 1950, but re-added it a year later. When the fair catch returned to the rulebook, however, the option to attempt a kick after the fair catch was removed.[21] The fair catch kick rule is very rarely invoked,[14][16][18] and it is one of the rarest plays in football.[16][18] The rule has been regarded as \"obscure\",[14][15] \"bizarre\",[18] and \"quirky\".[22] A unique set of circumstances is required for a fair catch kick to be a viable option. For one, the fair catch would need to be made at a point on the field where a field goal attempt has a reasonable chance of being successful;[23] most fair catches are made well outside of field goal range.[24] Furthermore, for a fair catch kick to be a viable option near the end of the fourth quarter, the team attempting the kick needs to be either tied or behind by three points or fewer; even if such a situation were to occur, a coach might still decline to attempt a fair catch kick. For example, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, known for his knowledge and utilization of obscure football rules, declined the opportunity to attempt a 75-yard fair catch kick at the end of regulation in Super Bowl LI; although kicker Stephen Gostkowski was able to kick the ball that far and the game was tied, Belichick felt the risk of a return touchdown by the opposing team off a failed kick outweighed the opportunity to score from the kick.[25] Art McNally, who led the officiating department of the National Football League from 1968 to 1990, said that even in the event a fair catch is made within field goal range, most teams would attempt to score a touchdown unless there is not enough time left to score one.[26] Accordingly, most fair catch kick attempts occur when a team has fair-caught a ball from a punt from deep in their opponent's territory but there is not enough time left in the half to go for a touchdown.[18] Despite its drawbacks, there are several unique advantages to using the fair catch kick. Because the play does not start until the ball is kicked, the kicker can take a running start before kicking as opposed to the typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does not have to worry about a low snap because the ball is not snapped. Because the defense cannot come within 10 yards of the kicker before the ball is kicked, the kicker can give the ball a lower trajectory than a field goal kick from scrimmage without the threat of it being blocked. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards behind the line of scrimmage.[23] The NFL does not keep a record of fair catch kick attempts, so the exact number of attempts is unknown.[26] Out of the 27 recorded fair catch kick attempts in regular season and postseason games, seven were successful; all five known attempts in exhibition games were unsuccessful. With one exception, all fair catch kick attempts were made within the last 30 seconds of either the 2nd or 4th quarter. The last attempt was made on December 19, 2024, by Cameron Dicker of the Los Angeles Chargers. At 57 yards, it is the longest successful kick to date.",

                "title": "WATCH: Chargers utilize obscure NFL rule to hit league's first fair-catch kick field goal since 1976 - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The game between the Chargers and Broncos got a little confusing toward the end of the first half on Thursday night when Los Angeles decided to take advantage of an obscure NFL rule known as the fair-catch kick. With eight seconds left to play in the first half, the Broncos were facing a fourth-and-12 from their own 16-yard line, which was an obvious punting situation for Denver. Chargers returner Derius Davis called for a fair catch on the play, and that's where the rarely used fair-catch kick came in. Basically, the rule goes like this: If a team fair catches a punt, they're allowed to attempt a free kick on the next play. The kick isn't a typical field goal, either. The defense has to line up 10 yards off the ball -- similar to a kickoff -- and the defense is NOT allowed to try and block the kick. The \"free kick\" is more like a kickoff, except the kicker has to attempt the field goal off the ground and there's also a holder (The kicker also has the option to dropkick the ball, but that almost never happens). Here's how the NFL describes the rule: \"After a fair catch, the receiving team has the option to put the ball in play by a snap or a fair-catch kick (field goal attempt), with fair-catch kick lines established ten yards apart. All general rules apply as for a field goal attempt from scrimmage. The clock starts when the ball is kicked. (No tee permitted.)\" Now that you know how the rule works, let's get back to the game. Davis actually called for a fair catch from his own 38-yard line, but the Broncos were called for fair-catch interference on the play, which is a 15-yard penalty. That moved the ball to Denver's 47-yard line, and under the fair-catch kick rule, that meant the Cameron Dicker got to attempt a field goal from that exact spot. Dicker nailed the kick, which made him the first player since Ray Wersching in 1976 to make a fair-catch kick. Cameron Dicker makes the first free kick field goal since 1976! 🤯#TNFonPrime pic.twitter.com/sSwcJL5Gt9 Dicker's field goal cut Denver's lead to 21-13 at the half. Wersching was also playing for the Chargers when he hit his free kick, which means the only two fair-catch kicks the NFL has seen since 1970 have been converted by the Chargers, who went on to win 34-27. Although the team calling for the fair catch can take advantage of the free kick rule at any point during a game, it really only makes sense at the end of a half. If the Chargers had called for this fair catch with 20 seconds left in the half, they likely would have run a play or two to try and get the ball closer for a field goal attempt. Remember, the free kick is only an option on the very next play after a fair catch. The fair-catch kick rule is very rarely used in the NFL. The last player to attempt a fair catch field goal before Thursday night was Joey Slye, who missed a 60-yard attempt in 2019. Before Slye came along, Phil Dawson also attempted one for the 49ers in 2013, which is mostly notable because his coach at the time was Jim Harbaugh, which means he's now been on the sideline as the head coach for two fair-catch kicks. Dicker's field goal attempt was actually only the sixth fair-catch kick attempted in the NFL over the past 30 years, but everyone had missed their kick before Dicker came along. Dicker's kick was also just the fourth fair-catch kick out of 20 to be converted in the Super Bowl era. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Los Angeles Chargers just did something that hasn't been done in an NFL game since 1976: successfully executed a fair catch kick. But what is a fair-catch kick? According to the NFL rules, if a player makes a fair catch, his team may attempt a kick from the spot rather than begin its next possession. If the kick goes through the goalposts on the scoring end of the field, it's worth three points — as many as a field goal. On a fair-catch kick, the ball does not have to be snapped, and the kicker can have a bigger running start before kicking the ball. Essentially, it's just like a kickoff attempt but with a holder instead of a tee. Cameron Dicker attempted the 57-yard fair-catch kick after the Denver Broncos' punt coverage team was flagged for fair catch interference at the end of the first half of Thursday night's game. Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh elected to attempt the kick on an untimed down since the Broncos would not be allowed to return it on a potential miss. All things Chargers: Latest Los Angeles Chargers news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more. Here's the exact wording of the NFL's rule on fair catches, from Rule 10, Section 2, Article 4: \"After a fair catch is made or is awarded as the result of fair catch interference, the receiving team has the option of putting the ball in play by a snap or fair catch kick (drop kick or place kick without a tee) from the spot of the catch or succeeding spot after enforcement of any applicable penalties (3-9 and 11-4-3). This includes the 15-yard penalty enforced from the receiving team’s 20-yard line as applicable if the fair catch is made or awarded in his end zone from fair catch interference or illegal contact with the receiver after he has made a fair catch.\" Also according to the rulebook, the fair-catch kick is technically distinct from a free kick. The NFL only considers kickoffs, safety kicks or onside kicks to be free kicks and specifically states that a fair-catch kick \"is not a free kick.\" There's also this from Rule 10, Section 2, Article 5: \"If time expires during a play in which a player has signaled for a fair catch, the following shall apply: ...If the kicking team interferes with a receiver who has signaled for a fair catch, the receiving team will have the option to extend the period by attempting a fair catch kick or by a snap from scrimmage after enforcement of any applicable penalties.\" Dicker's kick was the first fair-catch kick attempted since Joey Slye did it with the Carolina Panthers against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2019. It was the first to score points since 1976, when Ray Wersching of the then-San Diego Chargers knocked one through from 45 yards out at the end of the first half against the Buffalo Bills. At 57 yards, Dicker's fair-catch kick was the longest successful attempt in NFL history. The USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast.

                "content": "After months of store closures and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Big Lots is preparing to close all of its locations, according to a press release issued by the company on Thursday. More than 400 stores have already been closed by the retailer in 2024 with the remaining ones set to hold “going out of business” sales. “The Company is preparing to commence going out of business (GOB) sales at all remaining Big Lots store locations in the coming days to protect the value of its estate,” Big Lots said in the press release. CEO Bruce Thorn said the closures could be reversed if a company sale is completed. “We all have worked extremely hard and have taken every step to complete a going concern sale. While we remain hopeful that we can close an alternative going concern transaction, in order to protect the value of the Big Lots estate, we have made the difficult decision to begin the GOB process,” Thorn said in the release. Earn rewards on your spending: Best credit cards for shopping The company said it would continue to serve customers in-store and online and did not specify how long the sales would last. Back in September, Big Lots filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection weeks after announcing plans to close 340 stores across the United States. The company said at the time that the closures were part of a sale agreement with an affiliate of Nexus Capital Management LP, according to a news release. Hope was on the horizon for the company as it announced the approval to sell most of its assets and business operations to Nexus. That hope was dashed by December, however, when the sale failed to go through. Fernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

                "content": "Ohio-based discount retailer Big Lots may have to close more stores, according to a recent filing in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, as reviewed by Newsweek. The potential for more store closures comes after a fifth notice was filed in bankruptcy court. Newsweek reached out Wednesday via email to Big Lots' press team for comment on Wednesday. On Monday, the fifth notice of store closures was filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, proposing the closure of more than a dozen Big Lots stores. The 19 new closures include five stores in California, three stores in Texas and Oregon, two in Florida and Nevada, and single stores in Georgia, Idaho, Arizona and Washington. The closures would affect Atlanta, San Antonio, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Florida's Orlando, among other cities. Big Lots, referred to as \"the debtors,\" has until 4 p.m. ET on Saturday to file an objection to the proposed closures, according to the court document. If no objection is filed and there is no court intervention, Big Lots is authorized to commence the process of store closing sales for the 19 stores across the country. Before this announcement, Big Lots had announced the closure of nearly 500 stores. The Hill reports that at least 140 of those stores have already been closed, and many are set to close by January 2025. California will have the most stores closed, with 75 out of 109 set to be shuttered in the state. In August, when a big wave of store closures was announced, a Big Lots spokesperson told Newsweek the move is part of a broader strategy to stabilize the company financially. The company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission reveal that these closures come as Big Lots grapples with significant debt and declining sales. High inflation and stiff competition have dampened consumer spending at retail chains. On September 9, Big Lots filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. At the time, the company operated about 1,300 stores nationwide, but that number has been dropping significantly since the filing. The company reported a net loss of $205 million for the first quarter of 2024 and an increase in long-term debt to $573.8 million. In a September 9 press release, Big Lots said it entered into a sale agreement with an affiliate of Nexus Capital Management for approximately $760 million, consisting of $2.5 million in cash plus payoff of remaining debt and assumption of liabilities. The retailer was co-founded by Michael Cohen and Damian Giangiacomo in 2013. Mandy Taheri is a Newsweek reporter based in Brooklyn. She joined Newsweek as a reporter in 2024.

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Megan Cerullo Edited By Alain Sherter Updated on: December 20, 2024 / 10:57 AM EST / CBS News Big Lots is preparing to close all of its stores, the bankrupt discount retailer said Thursday. The company had previously planned to sell its assets to private equity firm Nexus Capital Management, but that deal is no longer expected to proceed, according to Big Lots. Although the company continues to negotiate with Nexus as well as explore other strategic alternatives, it now plans to shutter all of its locations and is planning to host \"going out of business\" sales at all stores. Big Lots, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, and operates more than 900 locations across the U.S., sells furniture, lawn and garden, apparel, health and beauty, and other consumer goods. Big Lots appeals to deal seekers, billing itself as a place that delivers \"bargains to brag about on everything for the home, including furniture, décor, pantry and more.\" \"We all have worked extremely hard and have taken every step to complete a going concern sale,\" Big Lots CEO Bruce Thorn said in a statement. \"While we remain hopeful that we can close an alternative going-concern transaction, in order to protect the value of the Big Lots estate, we have made the difficult decision to begin the [going out of business] process.\" On its website, Big Lots announced deals of up to 50% off the entire web store, while confirming that all physical Big Lots stores are closing. Big Lots filed for bankruptcy protection in September, saying it intended to sell its business to Nexus. In August, Big Lots announced its intention close up to 315 stores, and in October disclosed plans to shut down another 56 locations in 27 states. U.S. retailers have announced more than 7,100 store closures through the end of November 2024, a 69% jump from the same time last year, according to recent data from research firm CoreSight. That comes as 45 retailers have filed for bankruptcy protection so far this year, compared with 25 retail bankruptcies for all of 2023, the report found.

                "title": "Barry Manilow - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Barry Manilow (/ˈmænɪloʊ/ MAN-il-oh; born Barry Alan Pincus on June 17, 1943) is an American singer and songwriter with a career that spans six decades. His hit recordings include \"Could It Be Magic\", \"Looks Like We Made It\", \"Mandy\", \"I Write the Songs\", \"Can't Smile Without You\", \"Weekend in New England\", and \"Copacabana (At the Copa)\". Manilow has recorded and released 51 Top 40 singles on the Adult Contemporary Chart, including 13 that hit number one, 28 that appeared within the top ten, and 36 that reached the top twenty. Manilow has released 13 platinum and six multi-platinum albums.[2] Although not a favorite artist of music critics,[3] Manilow has been praised by his peers in the recording industry. In the 1970s, Frank Sinatra predicted: \"He's next.\"[4] As well as producing and arranging albums for himself and other artists, Manilow has written and performed songs for musicals, films, and commercials for corporations such as McDonald's, Pepsi Cola, and Band-Aid. He has been nominated for a Grammy Award (winning once) as a producer, arranger and performer a total of fifteen times (and in every decade) from 1973 to 2015.[5] He has also produced Grammy-nominated albums for Bette Midler, Dionne Warwick, Nancy Wilson, and Sarah Vaughan.[6] Manilow has sold more than 85 million records as a solo artist worldwide, making him one of the world's bestselling artists.[7][8][9] Barry Manilow was born Barry Alan Pincus on June 17, 1943, in Brooklyn, New York,[10] the son of Edna Manilow and Harold Kelliher, a truck driver of Irish descent. Barry's mother made his father change his name to Pincus, which was the name of a Jewish uncle of his father from the 1800s.[11][12][13] Barry's parents were divorced when he was a baby, and his mother's Jewish family allowed no further contact between Barry and his father.[13] Barry's maternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants, and his paternal grandfather was Jewish, though his grandmother was a Catholic of Irish descent.[14] His Irish roots trace back to Limerick, Ireland.[15] Barry's grandfather had his surname changed to Manilow a few weeks before Barry's bar mitzvah.[13] Manilow grew up in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn and graduated in 1961 from the now-defunct Eastern District High School.[16] While in high school, he met Susan Deixler, and they later married for a short time.[17] He enrolled in the City College of New York, where he briefly studied before entering the New York College of Music.[18] He also worked at CBS while he was a student to pay his expenses. Afterwards, he studied musical theater at Juilliard Performing Arts School.[18] In 1964, Manilow met Bro Herrod, a CBS director, who asked him to arrange some songs for a musical adaptation of the melodrama, The Drunkard.[19] Instead, Manilow wrote an entire original score.[20][21] Herrod used Manilow's composition in the Off Broadway musical, which had an eight-year run at New York's 13th Street Repertory Theatre.[22] During this time, Manilow began work as a commercial jingle writer and singer, which continued through the remainder of the 1960s.[23] He performed many of the TV jingles that he composed, including State Farm Insurance (\"Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there\") or Band-Aid (\"I am stuck on Band-Aid, 'cause Band-Aid's stuck on me!\"), for which he adopted a childlike voice and wrote the music (Donald B Wood wrote the lyrics).[24] His singing-only credits include commercials for Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pepsi (\"all across the nation, it's the Pepsi Generation\"), McDonald's (\"you deserve a break today\"),[25] and Dr Pepper.[26] Manilow was awarded an Honorary Clio at the 50th Anniversary Clio Awards in Las Vegas in 2009 for his 1960s work as a jingle writer and singer. When accepting the award, he stated that he learned the most about making pop music by working for three or four years as a writer in the jingle industry.[27] By 1967, Manilow was the musical director for the WCBS-TV series Callback, which premiered on January 27, 1968.[28] He next conducted and arranged for Ed Sullivan's production company, arranging a new theme for The Late Show, while writing, producing, and singing his radio and television jingles.[29] At the same time, he and Jeanne Lucas performed as a duo for a two-season run at Julius Monk's Upstairs at the Downstairs club in New York.[30][31] By 1969, Manilow was signed by Columbia/CBS Music vice-president and recording artist, Tony Orlando, who went on to co-write with and produce Manilow and a group of studio musicians under the name \"Featherbed\" on the Columbia Pictures' newly acquired Bell Records label.\"[28][32][33][34] Manilow recorded and accompanied artists on the piano for auditions and performances in the first two years of the 1970s. He recorded four tracks as Featherbed, produced by Tony Orlando on Bell Records. Three of the tracks were: \"Morning\", a ballad; \"Amy\", a psychedelic-influenced pop song; and an early, uptempo version of his own co-composition (with Orlando), \"Could It Be Magic\".[28][33][34] The fourth tune recorded was \"Rosalie Rosie\", which was to be the flip side of \"Could It Be Magic\", but Bell Records went with \"Morning\" as the flip for Featherbed's second release instead. Neither of two singles released impacted on the charts.[28] Bette Midler saw Manilow's act in 1971 and chose the young musician as her pianist at the Continental Baths in New York City that year,[35] and subsequently as a producer on both her debut and second record albums The Divine Miss M (1972) and Bette Midler (1973).[36] He also acted as her musical director on the tour mounted for her first album.[37] In 1973, Manilow was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for his production role on The Divine Miss M at the 16th Grammy Awards.[38] Manilow worked with Midler from 1971 to 1975.[39] After the Featherbed singles failed to impact on the music charts, in July 1973, Bell Records released the album, Barry Manilow, which offered an eclectic mix of piano-driven pop and guitar-driven rock music, including a song called \"I Am Your Child\", which Manilow had composed with Marty Panzer.[40][41] Among other songs on the album were Jon Hendricks' vocalese jazz standard \"Cloudburst\", most successfully recorded by his group Lambert, Hendricks and Ross in 1959, and a slower-tempo version of \"Could It Be Magic\". The latter's music was based on Chopin's \"Prelude in C Minor\" and provided Donna Summer with one of her first hits. It was also covered by Take That in the 1990s, as an up-beat disco version of the song. Take That have since performed Manilow's original version during their Beautiful World Tour.[citation needed] In 1974, Clive Davis became temporary president of Bell with the goal of revitalizing Columbia Pictures's music division. With a $10 million investment by CPI, and a reorganization of the various Columbia Pictures legacy labels (Colpix, Colgems, and Bell), Davis introduced Columbia Pictures' new record division, Arista,[42] in November 1974, with Davis himself owning 20% of the new venture. Bell had its final number 1 hit in January 1975 with Manilow's breakthrough 1974 release of the single \"Mandy\" (Bell 45,613), followed shortly by the label's final hit, as well as its final single, \"Look in My Eyes Pretty Woman\" by Tony Orlando and Dawn (Bell 45,620—US #11), after which the more successful Bell albums were reissued on Arista. The final releases using the Bell imprint have the designation \"Bell Records, Distributed by Arista Records, 1776 Broadway, New York, New York 10019\" around the rim of the label.[citation needed] Davis' reorganization efforts continued to bear fruit in 1974, with the release of Manilow's second album, Barry Manilow II, with \"Mandy\" as the lead single. Manilow had not wanted to record the song, which had originally been titled \"Brandy\" when originally recorded by its co-writer Scott English, but the song was included at the insistence of Davis. The title was changed to \"Mandy\" during the actual recording session on August 20, 1974, due to the fact that there had already been a song called \"Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)\" performed by Looking Glass and released in 1972 on Davis' Epic label.[citation needed] \"Mandy\" was the start of a string of hit singles and albums that lasted through the early 1980s, coming from the multi-platinum and multi-hit albums Tryin' to Get the Feeling, This One's for You, Even Now, and One Voice. Following the success of Barry Manilow II, the first Bell Records album was remixed and reissued on Arista Records as Barry Manilow I. When Manilow went on his first tour, he included in his show what he called \"A V.S.M.\", or \"A Very Strange Medley\", a sampling of some of the commercial jingles that he had written, composed, and/or sung in the 1960s. The medley appeared later on his triple-platinum 1977 album Barry Manilow Live.[43] Beginning with Manilow's March 22, 1975, appearance on American Bandstand to promote the second album, a productive friendship with Dick Clark started.[44] Among their projects together were numerous appearances by Manilow on Clark's productions of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, singing his original seasonal favorite \"It's Just Another New Year's Eve\", American Bandstand anniversary shows, American Music Awards performances, and the 1985 television movie Copacabana, starring Manilow and executive produced by Clark.[45] Despite being a songwriter in his own right, several of Manilow's commercial successes were songs written by others. In addition to \"Mandy\", other hits that he did not write or compose include \"Tryin' to Get the Feeling Again\" (by David Pomeranz), \"Weekend in New England\" (by Randy Edelman), \"Ships\" (by Ian Hunter), \"Looks Like We Made It\" (by Richard Kerr and Will Jennings), \"Can't Smile Without You\" and \"Ready to Take a Chance Again\" (by Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel). His number 1 hit \"I Write the Songs\" was composed by Bruce Johnston of The Beach Boys. According to album liner notes, Manilow did, however, perform co-production as well as arrangement duties on all the above tracks along with Ron Dante, most famous for his vocals on records by The Archies.[citation needed] Manilow's breakthrough in Britain came with the release of Even Now, the first of many top-20 albums on that side of the Atlantic, which contained four singles that became major hits in the US. This was quickly followed by Manilow Magic – The Best Of Barry Manilow, also known as Greatest Hits. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, ABC aired four variety television specials starring Manilow, who served as an executive producer. The Barry Manilow Special with Penny Marshall as his guest premiered on March 2, 1977, to an audience of 37 million. The special was nominated for four Emmys at the 29th Primetime Emmy Awards and won in the category of Outstanding Special–Comedy, Variety or Music.[46] The Second Barry Manilow Special in 1978, with Ray Charles as his guest, was also nominated for four Emmys at the 30th Primetime Emmy Awards.[46] Manilow's \"Ready to Take a Chance Again\" originated in the film Foul Play, which also featured \"Copacabana\", from his fourth studio album Even Now. \"Ready to Take a Chance Again\" and its songwriters Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel were nominated that year for the \"Best Original Song\" Oscar at the 51st Academy Awards.[47] On February 11, 1979, a concert from Manilow's sold-out dates from his Even Now Tour at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles aired on the HBO series Standing Room Only, which was the first pay-television show to pose a serious threat to network primetime specials for ratings.[48] From the same tour in 1978, a one-hour special from Manilow's sold-out concert at the Royal Albert Hall aired in the UK.[citation needed] On May 23, 1979, ABC aired The Third Barry Manilow Special, with John Denver as his guest. This special was nominated for two Emmy awards at the 31st Primetime Emmy Awards and won for Outstanding Choreography.[46] Also in 1979, Manilow produced Dionne Warwick's \"comeback\" album Dionne, her first to go platinum. He scored a top ten hit of his own, in the fall of 1979, with the song \"Ships\" (written and composed by Ian Hunter, former lead singer of Mott the Hoople) from the album One Voice.[citation needed] During the 1980s, Manilow topped the Adult Contemporary radio charts with songs such as \"The Old Songs\", \"Somewhere Down the Road\", \"Read 'Em and Weep\" (written by Jim Steinman), and a remake of the 1941 Jule Styne and Frank Loesser standard \"I Don't Want to Walk Without You\". Manilow's songs continued to receive frequent radio airplay throughout the decade. In the UK, Manilow performed five sold-out concerts at the Royal Albert Hall. In the United States, at Radio City Music Hall, his 1984 ten-night run set a box-office sales record of nearly $2 million, making him the top draw in the 52-year history of the venue.[49] In 1980, Manilow's One Voice special, with Dionne Warwick as his guest, was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Music Direction at the 32nd Primetime Emmy Awards.[46] Also in 1980, a concert from Manilow's sold-out shows at London England's Wembley Arena was broadcast while he was on a world tour. Manilow released the self-titled Barry (1980), which was his first album to not reach the top ten in the United States, stopping at number 15. The album contained the top 10 hits \"I Made It Through the Rain\" (originally a minor hit for its writer, Gerard Kenny) and \"Bermuda Triangle\". The album If I Should Love Again followed in 1981, with two top 40 recordings that both hit number 1 on the AC chart – \"The Old Songs\" and \"Somewhere Down The Road\" and a third single that became a hit in the UK – a cover of the 1965 The Four Seasons smash \"Let's Hang On!\". This was the first of his albums that Manilow produced without Ron Dante, who had co-produced all the previous albums. Manilow's sold-out concert at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh aired nationally on Showtime and locally on Philadelphia's now-defunct PRISM. In 1982, a concert from his sold-out Royal Albert Hall show was broadcast in England. The live album and video Barry Live in Britain also came from his Royal Albert Hall shows.[citation needed] On August 27, 1983, Manilow performed a landmark open-air concert at Blenheim Palace in Britain, an event that he told the audience was \"one of the most exciting nights\" in his life.[50] It was the first such event ever held at that venue and was attended by an estimated 40,000 people. This concert was also taped for airing on Showtime. In December 1983, Manilow was reported to have endowed the music departments at six major universities in the United States and Canada.[51] The endowments were part of a continuing endeavor by Manilow to recognize and encourage new musical talent.[52] In 1984, Manilow released 2:00 AM Paradise Cafe, a jazz/blues collection of original barroom tunes recorded in one live take in the studio. That same year, Showtime aired a documentary of Manilow recording the album with a number of jazz legends including Sarah Vaughan and Mel Tormé. In 1984 and 1985, England aired two one-hour concert specials from his National Exhibition Centre (NEC) concerts. In 1985, Manilow left Arista Records for RCA Records, where he released the pop album Manilow, and began a phase of international music, as he performed songs and duets in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese. The Manilow album was a complete about-face from the Paradise Cafe album, containing a number of uptempo tracks that featured synthesizers. In 1985, Japan aired a Manilow concert special where he played \"Sakura\" on the koto.[citation needed] In his only lead acting role, he portrayed Tony Starr in the 1985 CBS film Copacabana, which was based on his 1978 hit song \"Copacabana\", alongside Annette O'Toole as Lola Lamarr and Joseph Bologna as Rico Castelli. Manilow penned all the songs for the movie, with lyrics provided by his longtime collaborators Bruce Sussman and Jack Feldman. A soundtrack album for the TV film, Copacabana: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Album, was released on RCA Records.[citation needed] In October 1986, Manilow, along with Bruce Sussman, Tom Scott, and Charlie Fox, went to Washington, D.C. for two days of meetings with legislators, including lunch with then Senator Al Gore (D-TN).[53] They were there to lobby against a copyright bill put forward by local television broadcasters that would mandate songwriter-producer source licensing of theme and incidental music on syndicated television show reruns and would disallow the use of the blanket license then in effect. The songwriters said without the blanket license, artists would have to negotiate up front with producers individually, without knowing if a series would be a success. The license now pays according to a per-use formula. Manilow said that such a bill would act as a precedent for broadcasters to get rid of the blanket license entirely.[54] The following year, McGraw-Hill published Manilow's autobiography, Sweet Life: Adventures on the Way to Paradise, which took three years to complete. While promoting the work, Manilow defended his music in a telephone interview: \"I live in laid-back L.A., but in my heart, I'm an energetic New Yorker and that's what has always come out of my music. I've always been surprised when the critics said I made wimpy little ballads.\"[55] Manilow returned to Arista Records in 1987 with the release of Swing Street. The album, a mixture of traditional after-dark and techno jazz, contained \"Brooklyn Blues\", an autobiographical song for Manilow, and \"Hey Mambo\", an uptempo Latin style duet with Kid Creole, produced with the help of Emilio Estefan, Jr., founder of Miami Sound Machine.[citation needed] CBS aired Manilow's Big Fun on Swing Street special in March 1988. It featured songs and special guests from his Swing Street and 2:00 am Paradise Cafe albums, including Kid Creole and the Coconuts, Phyllis Hyman, Stanley Clarke, Carmen McRae, Tom Scott, and Uncle Festive, a band within Manilow's band at the time. The special was nominated for two Emmys in technical categories, and won in the category of Outstanding Art Direction for a Variety or Music Program at the 40th Primetime Emmy Awards.[46] In 1988, Manilow performed \"Please Don't Be Scared\" and \"Mandy/Could It Be Magic\" at That's What Friends Are For: AIDS Concert '88, a benefit concert for the Warwick Foundation headed by Dionne Warwick and shown on Showtime a few years later. In the 1988 Walt Disney Pictures animated feature Oliver & Company, Bette Midler's character sang a new Manilow composition called \"Perfect Isn't Easy\". The 1989 release of Barry Manilow, which contained \"Please Don't Be Scared\", \"Keep Each Other Warm\", and \"The One That Got Away\", ended Manilow's streak of albums of original self-written material (he only wrote or arranged two of the album's songs) and began a phase of his recording career consisting of covers and compilations.[citation needed] From April 18 to June 10, 1989, Manilow put on a show called Barry Manilow at the Gershwin, making 44 appearances[56] at the Gershwin Theatre (also known as the Uris Theatre), where he had also recorded Barry Manilow Live in 1976. A bestselling 90-minute video of the same show was released the following year as Barry Manilow Live on Broadway. The Showtime one-hour special Barry Manilow SRO on Broadway consisted of edited highlights from this video. Manilow followed this set of shows with a world tour of the Broadway show.[citation needed] Manilow released a number of cover tunes during the 1990s, starting with tracks on the 1989 release Barry Manilow, and continuing with his 1990 Christmas LP Because It's Christmas. On the Christmas album, Manilow was joined by pop girl trio Exposé and together they recreated, note for note, a 1943 million-selling recording of \"Jingle Bells\" by Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters. Manilow has credited Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne Andrews as inspiring him, perhaps most evident in his recording of \"Jump, Shout Boogie\".[57] Consequent \"event\" albums followed, including: Showstoppers, a collection of Broadway songs (1991),[58] Singin' with the Big Bands (1994) and a late 1970s collection Summer of '78 (1996), which included the hit \"I Go Crazy\", formerly a hit for Paul Davis in 1978. The decade ended with Manilow recording a tribute to Frank Sinatra Manilow Sings Sinatra (1998) released months after Sinatra's death.[59] In 1990, Japan aired National Eolia Special: Barry Manilow On Broadway where he sang the title song \"Eolia\", which was used as a song there in a commercial for an air conditioner company of the same name, as well as other songs from his 1989–1990 Live on Broadway tour. In the early 1990s, Manilow signed on with Don Bluth to compose the songs with lyricists Jack Feldman and Bruce Sussman for three animated films. He co-wrote the Broadway-style musical scores for Thumbelina (1994) and The Pebble and the Penguin (1995). The third film, entitled Rapunzel, was shelved after the poor performance of The Pebble and the Penguin. Manilow was also to be cast as the voice of a cricket. Manilow also composed the score and wrote two songs with Bruce Sussman for Disney Sing Along Songs: Let's Go To The Circus.[citation needed] Manilow produced the 1991 album With My Lover Beside Me by legendary jazz vocalist Nancy Wilson.[58] The record is based on lyrics left behind by famed composer Johnny Mercer that had never been set to music. Manilow was invited in 1993 by Mercer's widow to complete the songs. His own recording of \"When October Goes\", with lyrics by Mercer, was released as a single in 1984, from his album 2:00 AM Paradise Cafe.[58] Further Mercer compositions were set to music by Manilow over the following years, culminating in the 1991 Nancy Wilson release. Manilow is featured in a duet on the record in the final cut \"Epilogue\".[citation needed] On February 19, 1992, Manilow testified before the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration House Committee in support of H.R. 3204, The Audio Home Recording Act of 1991.[60] The bill was signed into law on October 28, 1992, by President George H. W. Bush and became effective immediately. In 1993, PBS aired Barry Manilow: The Best of Me, which was taped at Wembley Arena in England earlier that year. The BBC also played a one-hour version of the same show including \"The Best of Me\", sung during the concert, as a bonus song or \"lucky strike extra\" as Manilow says, not seen in The Complete Collection and Then Some..., the video release of the show; however, the song was included on the DVD of the same title, with Manilow seated in front of a black curtain, lip-syncing to the recording. He performed 14 concerts as part of an extended tour covering Germany, Austria and Denmark. Manilow branched out in another direction and, with long-time lyricist Bruce Sussman, launched Copacabana, a musical play based on previous Manilow-related adaptations. They wrote new songs and it ran for two years on the London West End, and a tour company formed.[61] In December 1996, A&E aired Barry Manilow: Live By Request, the first of his two Live By Request appearances. The broadcast was A&E's most successful music program, attracting an estimated 2.4 million viewers. The show was also simulcast on the radio. In March 1997, VH-1 aired Barry Manilow: The Summer of '78, a one-hour special of Manilow solo at the piano being interviewed and playing his greatest hits as well as songs from Summer of '78, his latest release at the time. In another collaboration between Manilow and Sussman, they co-wrote the musical Harmony: A New Musical, which previewed October 7 to November 23, 1997, at the La Jolla Playhouse in La Jolla, California.[62] Later in 2003, Harmony was originally scheduled for a tryout run in Philadelphia before going to Broadway, but was canceled after financial difficulties. After a legal battle with Mark Schwartz, the show's producer, Manilow and Sussman in 2005 won back the rights to the musical.[63] In 1998, Manilow released the record album Manilow Sings Sinatra which earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1999.[38] On October 23, 1999, NBC aired the two-hour special StarSkates Salute to Barry Manilow taped at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, featuring numerous figure skaters performing to Manilow's music. Manilow also performed.[citation needed] In 2000, Manilow had two specials, Manilow Country and Manilow Live!, taped over two consecutive days at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center in Nashville, Tennessee. On April 11, 2000, The Nashville Network (TNN) aired the two-hour Manilow Country, which featured country stars Trisha Yearwood, Neal McCoy, Deana Carter, Jo Dee Messina, Lorrie Morgan, Kevin Sharp, Lila McCann, Gillian Welch and Jaci Velasquez singing their favorite Manilow hits with a \"country\" twist; Manilow also performed. This special was TNN's first High Definition (HD) broadcast and became one of TNN's highest rated concert specials.[citation needed] In June 2000, DirectTV aired the two-hour concert special Manilow Live! where Manilow had his band, a 30-piece orchestra, and a choir. This HDTV special documented the concert tour at the time with the greatest hits of his career and was also released to video. Also that year, he worked with Monica Mancini on her Concord album The Dreams of Johnny Mercer, which included seven songs of Mercer's lyrics set to Manilow's music. Meanwhile, Manilow's record contract with Arista Records was not renewed due to new management. He then got a contract at Concord Records, a jazz-oriented label in California, and started work on the long-anticipated concept album Here at the Mayflower. The album was another eclectic mix of styles, almost entirely composed and produced by Manilow himself. While Manilow was at Concord Records, the Barry Manilow Scholarship was awarded for four consecutive years (2002–2005) to the six highest-achieving students to reward excellence in the art and craft of lyric writing. The UCLA Extension course \"Writing Lyrics That Succeed and Endure\" was taught by long-time Manilow collaborator Marty Panzer, and each student received three additional \"master class\" advanced sessions as well as a three-hour private, one-on-one session with Panzer. Scholarship recipients were selected by the instructor based on progress made within the course, lyric writing ability, and the instructor's assessment of real potential in the field of songwriting.[64] In February 2002, Manilow returned to the charts when Arista released a greatest hits album, Ultimate Manilow. On May 18, 2002, Manilow returned to CBS with Ultimate Manilow, his first special on the network since his Big Fun on Swing Street special in 1988. The special was filmed in the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, California, and was nominated for an Emmy in the category of Outstanding Music Direction at the 54th Primetime Emmy Awards.[46] Produced by Manilow, Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook was released on September 30, 2003. It was the first time that the pair had worked together in more than twenty years. The album went gold, and they collaborated again in 2005 on Bette Midler Sings the Peggy Lee Songbook. On December 3, 2003, A&E aired A Barry Manilow Christmas: Live by Request, his second of two concerts for the series. The two-hour special had Manilow taking requests for Christmas songs performed live with a band and an orchestra. Manilow told the audience that he was what Clay Aiken was going to look like in thirty years, thus acknowledging an ongoing comparison between the two. Also on the special were guests Cyndi Lauper, José Feliciano, and Bette Midler (Midler, busy preparing her own tour in Los Angeles, appeared only in a pre-taped segment).[citation needed] In 2004, Manilow released two albums: a live album, 2 Nights Live! (BMG Strategic Marketing Group, 2004); and Scores: Songs from Copacabana & Harmony, an album of Manilow singing songs from his musicals. Scores was the last of Manilow's creative projects with the Concord label.[citation needed] During his third appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show on September 15, 2004, Winfrey announced that Manilow is one of the most requested guests of all time on her show. On the show, he promoted his One Night Live! One Last Time! tour. It was around this time period where Manilow appeared for the first time on the mainstream FOX program American Idol in which his back-up singer, Debra Byrd, doubles as voice coach on the series. Manilow also appeared on Clay Aiken's TV special, A Clay Aiken Christmas.[citation needed] Las Vegas Hilton executives in a press conference with Manilow on December 14, 2004, announced his signing to a long-term engagement as the house show.[65] He began the residency in February 2005 with a show entitled Manilow: Music and Passion.[66] In March 2006, Manilow's engagement was extended through 2008.[66] Manilow returned to Arista Records under Davis for a new covers album, released January 31, 2006, called The Greatest Songs of the Fifties. Manilow said he was blown away with the idea, which Davis presented when he visited Manilow's Las Vegas show. \"When he suggested this idea to me, I slapped my forehead and said, 'Why hasn't anyone thought of this idea?'\" Manilow said.[67] It was an unexpected success, debuting at number one in the Billboard 200, marking the first time a Manilow album debuted at the top of the album chart as well as the first time a Manilow album has reached number one in 29 years. It was eventually certified Platinum in the U.S., and sold more than 3 million copies worldwide.[citation needed] In March 2006, PBS aired Barry Manilow: Music and Passion, a Hilton concert recorded exclusively for the network's fundraising drive. Manilow was nominated for two Emmys, winning for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards. A sequel album to his bestselling fifties tribute album, The Greatest Songs of the Sixties was released on October 31, 2006, including songs such as \"And I Love Her\" and \"Can't Help Falling in Love\". It nearly repeated the success of its predecessor, debuting at number 2 in the Billboard 200.[citation needed] In January 2007, Manilow returned to his hometown of New York City for three shows at Madison Square Garden. These included showing onscreen Manilow performing in one of his first television appearances, while the \"live\" Manilow played along onstage. The same year saw him playing several shows on the east coast of the United States in August. Four more took place in December, half in the New York tri-state area in Uniondale and East Rutherford, and two in Cleveland and Detroit. Manilow launched another short tour in early 2008, visiting several large venues including the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. A further album in the decades themed series, The Greatest Songs of the Seventies, went on release September 18, 2007. Barry Manilow: Songs from the Seventies, a PBS concert special based on the work, was taped in Manilow's home town, Brooklyn, in October 2007. The show aired on PBS in December 2007 and was rebroadcast over New Year 2009. He appeared on American Idol on February 3, 2009, during Hollywood Week to give advice to the contestants.[citation needed] Manilow released his third Christmas album in November 2007, In the Swing of Christmas, which went Gold and earned him another Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Grammy Award nomination at the 51st Grammy Awards in 2008.[68][69] In December 2008, Manilow narrated the animated Christmas special Cranberry Christmas, which was broadcast on ABC Family and sponsored by Ocean Spray. In addition to narrating, he also contributed two original songs that he composed with his long time collaborator, lyricist Bruce Sussman: \"Christmas Is Just Around the Corner\" and \"Watch Out for Mr. Grape\". \"Christmas Is Just Around the Corner\" was also released as a single, and appeared as a bonus track on the 2009 re-release of In the Swing of Christmas.[70] In October 2009, Manilow TV, a monthly video subscription service, launched. Once a month, Barry Manilow picks a different concert from his personal archive to show to subscribers. In the first month, the first episode showed performances on April 20–21, 1996, at Wembley Arena in London.[citation needed] Manilow ended his residency at the Hilton with a show entitled \"Ultimate Manilow: the Hits\" on December 30, 2009, after 300 performances for 450,000 fans.[66] On January 26, 2010, Manilow released The Greatest Love Songs of All Time, and, in December of that year, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards.[38] He opened his new show \"Manilow Paris Las Vegas\" at the Paris Hotel & Casino at Las Vegas in March 2010.[71] On December 11, 2010, Manilow performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway.[72] Manilow completed work on his new album, 15 Minutes, in March 2011, with his official Facebook page announcing that he had completed putting \"finishing touches\" to the album on March 16, 2011.[25] On March 13, 2011, Manilow appeared at the 2011 Laurence Olivier Awards at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, singing \"Copacabana\" with the BBC Concert Orchestra and also singing with hit West End star, Kerry Ellis.[73] Since March 2011, he has hosted They Write the Songs, a documentary series for BBC Radio 2 in which he looks at the life and work of popular composers.[74] In May 2011, Manilow recorded his concerts at the O2 Arena in London, for CD and DVD release in early 2012.[75] In a June 2011 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Manilow said that his new album is influenced by Britney Spears; the album is about the pleasures and pitfalls of fame. It was influenced directly by Spears' personal struggles in late 2007.[76] The album 15 Minutes debuted at number 7 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album Chart. The first single from 15 Minutes, \"Bring on Tomorrow\", entered the U.S. Billboard Hot 200 Singles Chart's top 40, becoming Manilow's 47th top 40 hit.[citation needed] In November 2011, Manilow recorded his shows at the Paris Las Vegas for an upcoming TV special and DVD release.[citation needed] Manilow concluded his two-year residency at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas on December 11, 2012. This also ended his seven-year stay in Las Vegas.[citation needed] In January 2013, Manilow returned to Broadway with his concert series \"Manilow on Broadway\". It was his first appearance on Broadway in more than two decades.[77] On July 4, 2013, Manilow performed live on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol as part of A Capitol Fourth. This was his second appearance on the PBS program.[78] On September 6, 2013, Harmony: A New Musical started a second run. This time at Atlanta's Alliance Theatre. The musical then had performances in Los Angeles in 2014.[citation needed] On November 12, 2013, he performed at the BBC's Children in Need Rocks 2013.[79] On March 11, 2014, Manilow released Night Songs, an album of standards performed only with piano and synthesized acoustic bass by Manilow himself. It earned him a Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Grammy nomination that year at the 57th Grammy Awards.[38] On October 28, 2014, Manilow released My Dream Duets, which won him his fourth Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Grammy Award nomination at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards. This was the fifteenth Grammy Award nomination of his career with nominations occurring in every decade since the 1970s.[80][5] On February 11, 2015, Manilow began his One Last Time! tour at the CenturyLink Center Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska with stops at most major North American venues. Other destinations included Chicago at the United Center, Los Angeles at the Staples Center, and Brooklyn at the Barclay's Center for the tour finale on June 17, where Manilow celebrated his 72nd birthday during his Barclays Center debut.[81] In 2017, Billboard declared that Manilow has been on a Billboard 200 hot streak since 2002, when his greatest-hits collection Ultimate Manilow debuted and peaked at No. 3 (February 23, 2002), becoming his highest-charting set (and first top 10) since 1979's One Voice (No. 9). Since 2002, Manilow has logged a dozen top 40 efforts (including Ultimate). Further, he has notched at least one top 40 album in each of the five decades from the 1970s through the 2010s.[82] In 2019, it was announced that Manilow's original musical Harmony would make its New York debut at National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene in the Museum of Jewish Heritage, running from February 11 until March 29, 2020.[83] The run was canceled due to the start of the COVID-19 health crisis and rescheduled for Spring of 2022.[84] On February 14, 2020, Manilow released Night Songs II, which debuted at No. 32 on the Billboard 200, marking his sixth consecutive decade of top 40-charting albums beginning with Barry Manilow II in 1975.[citation needed] In April 2020, Manilow scored his 36th top-20 Billboard Adult Contemporary chart hit with \"When the Good Times Come Again\" which peaked at number 12 on the week of July 2. The song was originally recorded for his self-titled 1989 album and never released as a single. A fan made a lyric video for the song when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Manilow found the video and posted it on his Facebook page, leading his management company to send the song to radio stations for airplay.[85] In August 2020, Manilow sold his song catalog to Hipgnosis Songs Fund.[86] In 2021, Manilow started his The Hits Come Home residency at the Westgate Hotel in Las Vegas.[35] On December 11, 2023, NBC aired a Christmas special Barry Manilow's A Very Barry Christmas, featuring Manilow.[87][88] A fourteen-night residency at the London Palladium in May and June 2024 has been billed as the \"last, last UK concerts\".[89] Manilow married his high-school sweetheart, Susan Deixler, in 1964.[17] Manilow later stated that he was in love with his wife and that his passion for a music career, in addition to his lack of maturity, put a strain on their relationship. He left the woman he considered \"the perfect wife\" after just one year of marriage in pursuit of a \"wondrous musical adventure\". Manilow credits the response he received from Playboy in December 1965 for the courage to leave everything behind and begin a career in music: I asked a lot of people what I should do, and they all said different things. Finally, I was so desperate, I wrote to the Playboy Advisor.[90] Deixler had the marriage annulled in 1966.[91] After coming out as gay in 2017, Manilow stated that he had been in love with Deixler and the failure of his marriage at the time was not related to issues of sexual orientation.[17] Manilow began a relationship with TV executive Garry Kief, who soon became his manager, in 1978. The two married in 2014, after same-sex marriage became legal in California.[35] They kept the relationship and his sexual orientation private until the marriage made headlines in 2015. Manilow did not initially want his personal relationship with Kief to become public. The media began to publicize the event when a friend of Manilow's, Suzanne Somers, publicly disclosed the private exchange of vows at Manilow's home in Palm Springs, California. No official paperwork was filed, but it was reported that Manilow and Kief exchanged wedding bands as a sign of their dedication.[92][93] Manilow officially came out as gay in April 2017, telling People that he was pleasantly surprised to find that his mostly female fan base was supportive of the marriage; he had feared the news would disappoint them.[17][35][94][95] Manilow has a stepdaughter through his husband's previous marriage and an adopted granddaughter.[96] To help with the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo in 1989, which affected the Charleston, South Carolina, area, Manilow held a benefit concert November 12, 1989, at the University of South Carolina's Carolina Coliseum in Columbia where the $10 tickets sold out in three hours, and asked concertgoers to bring canned food to be donated to residents in disaster areas.[97] Before his concert, Mayor T. Patton Adams named that day Barry Manilow Day, and Manilow presented The Red Cross and The Salvation Army with checks of $42,500 each.[98] On January 15, 1994, three hours before showtime, Manilow canceled a performance at an Ethnic Pride and Heritage Festival hosted at the Convention Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Benefactors included the Children's Hospital of New Jersey in Newark, the Community Foundation of New Jersey as well as United Hospitals Medical Center Foundation and Newark Museum in Newark during the pre-inaugural activities for then New Jersey Governor-elect Christie Whitman. Manilow said that he was specifically told in writing that the concert would be part of a non-partisan event.[99] To help in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, for every U.S. dollar donated by his fans to the American Red Cross through the Manilow Fund for Health and Hope website, Manilow personally matched, and the fund itself also matched, tripling the original donation. The fund delivered $150,000, raised in 48 hours, to the American Red Cross.[100][101] On October 27, 2011, Manilow visited Joplin, Missouri, a little more than five months after a tornado destroyed one-third of that city, including its only high school. His Manilow Music Project made a contribution of $300,000 to restore the musical program and instruments that were lost.[102] On February 8, 1994, Manilow sued Los Angeles radio station KBIG (104.3 FM), seeking $13 million in damages and $15 million in punitive damages, claiming that one of their advertisements was causing irreparable damage to his professional reputation. The ad, a thirty-second spot which began airing on January 31, suggested that people listen to KBIG because it does not play Manilow's music. The lawsuit was filed in Orange County Superior Court by Los Angeles attorney C. Tucker Cheadle.[103] Two days later, KBIG/104.3 FM agreed to drop the commercial poking fun at the singer, but a lawyer representing his business interests stopped short of agreeing to withdraw a $28 million lawsuit.[104] Arizona Court of Appeals Judge Philip Espinosa sued Manilow over the audio volume of a December 23, 1993, concert he attended with his wife.[105] The judge said in the lawsuit he has had a constant ringing in his ears (tinnitus) and nearly blew his ears out. Espinosa sought unspecified damages, and the trial was set for September 23, 1997. The suit also named Manilow's production company, an Arizona concert promoter, and the city of Tucson, Arizona, which runs the convention center where the concert was held. In July 1997, to settle the suit it was reported that Manilow donated $5,000 to the American Tinnitus Association.[106] In 1979, Manilow's musical style was satirized in the song \"I Need Your Help Barry Manilow\" performed by Ray Stevens.[107] The song leads off with a musical phrase resembling the opening of \"I Write the Songs\" and also references \"Mandy\", \"Copacabana\", \"Can't Smile Without You\", \"Weekend in New England\", \"Could It Be Magic\" and \"Tryin' to Get the Feeling Again\" in a storyline where the singer details a litany of comedically unfortunate events in his life, reaching the conclusion that he needs Manilow to sing one of his more melancholy and wistful songs to comfort him, as several of Manilow's biggest hits have story lines about suffering and misfortune. The song reached number 49 on the US Billboard Hot 100 number 11 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It spent a total of eight weeks on Hot 100 chart and also charted in Great Britain, Canada, and Australia. The single's cover art is a spoof of Manilow's album Barry Manilow II, and the song's album spoofs title and cover art of Manilow's Tryin' to Get the Feeling. In 1989, an American tabloid claimed that Manilow was engaged to porn star Robin Byrd. On a June 22, 1989, appearance on The Tonight Show, Johnny Carson asked Manilow about the headline story.[108] Manilow replied that he was just friends with Byrd, an innocent picture had been taken, and that there was no truth to the supposed engagement. After he met Byrd, his band gave him a videotape of Debbie Does Dallas as a present for his birthday. Manilow told Carson that he could not watch his friend doing what she does in that movie.[109] Manilow made headlines in June 2006 when Australian officials blasted his music from 9:00 p.m. until midnight every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to deter gangs of youths from congregating in a residential area late at night.[110] In February 2022, New Zealand authorities employed a similar tactic against protesters who camped outside the country's parliament building to protest COVID-19 vaccine mandates.[111]",

                "content": "Andrew Ladd McConkey (born November 11, 2001) is an American professional football wide receiver for the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs, winning two national championships and the 2023 Wuerffel Trophy. He was selected by the Chargers in the second round of the 2024 NFL draft. McConkey attended North Murray High School in Chatsworth, Georgia.[1][2] He made the varsity team as a freshman. McConkey played quarterback, running back, defensive back, and punter and was also a return specialist.[3] In his senior year, he led North Murray to a 9–1 record and the school's first ever region championship.[4] McConkey finished the year with 36 total touchdowns and 3,051 total yards, being named the offensive player of the year for the region.[5] McConkey was a three-star recruit and committed to the University of Georgia, his only Power Five offer, on February 2, 2020.[6][7] His jersey number, 15, was retired by North Murray in 2023.[8] McConkey redshirted and was initially a member of Georgia's scout team.[9] In McConkey's redshirt freshman year, he caught five touchdowns with 28 receptions for 430 yards.[10] His first career touchdown came against Vanderbilt. McConkey also rushed for one touchdown. He was named the SEC Freshman of the Week after the 34-10 win over Auburn, where he received 135 yards and scored one touchdown.[11] McConkey played in all of Georgia's games making seven starts.[12] McConkey scored two touchdowns, one receiving, and one rushing, against Oregon in the 2022 season opener.[13] Against Kent State, McConkey recorded a career high six receptions.[14] He scored a touchdown against Florida before tallying a season-high 94 yards against #1 Tennessee.[15][16] The following week against Mississippi State, McConkey would rush for a 70-yard touchdown while also adding a 17-yard receiving touchdown.[17] He left the SEC Championship Game against LSU on December 3, 2022, due to knee tendinitis.[18] In the 2023 College Football Playoff National Championship Game, McConkey recorded five receptions for 88 yards and two touchdowns in a 65–7 victory.[19] Following the game, he announced that he would return to Georgia for the 2023 season.[20][21] The following season, McConkey missed significant time due to injuries.[22][23] He finished the regular season with 29 receptions for 456 yards and two touchdowns, and he was named the recipient of the Wuerffel Trophy.[24][25] On January 1, 2024, McConkey declared for the 2024 NFL draft.[26][27] McConkey graduated from Georgia in 2023 with a degree in finance.[28] McConkey was selected by the Los Angeles Chargers 34th overall with the pick acquired from a trade with New England Patriots.[32] On June 19, 2024, McConkey signed his four-year rookie contract with the Chargers worth $9.9 million guaranteed, with a $4 million signing bonus.[33] In his NFL debut, he scored a receiving touchdown in a 22–10 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 1.[34] A middle child, McConkey grew up a fan of the Tennessee Volunteers.[16][35] His father, Benji McConkey, was a star quarterback in high school at Dalton High,[36] while his brother, Hinton McConkey, played quarterback for the University of West Georgia in Division II in 2018.[37] McConkey writes \"1-20-16\" on his towel before games to honor his grandfather Vic McConkey, who died on that date.[38]",

                "content": "News: 14 hours agoMcConkey secured all six targets for 87 yards in the Chargers' 34-27 win over the Broncos on Thursday night. Spin: McConkey set the pace in receptions and receiving yards while sharing the team lead in targets with fellow receivers Joshua Palmer and Quentin Johnston. The rookie wideout's final catch of the night came early in the fourth quarter but was a critical one, as his 17-yard grab took the ball down to the Broncos' 19-yard line and Justin Herbert threw a go-ahead touchdown pass to Derius Davis on the next play to give the Chargers a lead they wouldn't relinquish. McConkey has come on strong down the stretch, as he'll head into a Week 17 road matchup against the Patriots on Saturday, Dec. 28 with at least six receptions and 83 receiving yards in four of the last five contests. ESPN Fantasy Projection: Though Puka Nacua did it just last season, it's not common historically that a second-day draft pick emerges as his team's go-to receiver. McConkey has a very real chance to do just that, considering the team's aggressive move to trade up for him at No. 34 overall, addressing what was an especially weak spot on the team. He's a polished route-runner who, despite a disappointing and injury-limited senior season at Georgia, excelled at the combine (4.39 40 time), a reminder of his elite speed and quickness. Expect McConkey to get an extended look during the preseason, with a high probability of emerging as Justin Herbert's preferred target before the 2024 season concludes. There's WR3 upside here.",

Unlike a physician, midwife, or nurse, a doula cannot administer medication or other medical treatment or give medical advice.[7][2] An individual might need to complete training to work as a doula, although training and certification processes vary throughout the world.[7][3][4][8] Some doulas work as volunteers; others are paid for their services by their client, medical institutions, or other private and public organizations. Doulas receive varying amounts of training, and their professionalism also varies.[4][9] The contributions of doulas during reproductive experiences and end-of-life care have been studied and have been shown to benefit their clients.[4][10][11][12] For example, a birth doula providing support during childbirth might increase likelihood of vaginal birth (rather than Caesarean section), decrease the need for pain medication during labor, and improve the perception of the birthing experience.[13][14] The benefits of a doula providing other types of support have been less well studied, but might improve a client's experience with medical care or help an individual cope with health transitions.[15][16][4][17] The concept of having a companion providing support to the birthing woman dates back to prehistoric times, evidenced by archeological findings of stone carvings and statues and anthropological studies.[18] However, the contemporary role of \"doula\" first emerged from the grassroots natural birth movement in the United States in the 1960s when women began desiring unmedicated, low-intervention births and began to have friends and others with formal or practical knowledge about childbirth provide them with support during pregnancy.[19] The term doula was first used in a 1969 anthropological study conducted by Dana Raphael, a protégée of Margaret Mead, with whom she co-founded the Human Lactation Center in Westport, Connecticut, in the 1970s.[20] Raphael suggested it was a widespread practice that a female of the same species be part of childbirth, and in human societies this was traditionally a role occupied by a family member or friend whose presence contributed to successful long-term breastfeeding.[20] Raphael derived the term from modern Greek (δούλα, doúla (Greek pronunciation: [ˈðula]), \"slave\"[21]), as told to her by an elderly Greek woman,[22] Eleni Rassias,[23] and described it as coming from \"Aristotle's time,\" an Ancient Greek word δούλα meaning \"female slave.\"[24] Two physician-researchers, Marshall Klaus and John Kennell, who conducted clinical trials on the medical outcomes of doula-attended births, adopted the term to refer to a person providing labor support.[7] In 1992, Doulas of North America (later DONA International) was co-founded by Klaus, Kennell, Phyllis Klaus, Penny Simkin, and Annie Kennedy, becoming the first organization to train and certify doulas.[25][26] The organization with the backing of the research of Klaus and Kennell helped lend credibility and professionalize doulas.[27] Due to the lobbying efforts of DONA International, the term doula was accepted into the American Heritage Dictionary and Oxford Dictionary in 2003, followed by Merriam Webster Dictionary in 2004.[26] Alternative names to this role include \"childbirth assistant\" and \"monitrice,\" but they did not catch on as \"doula\" had.[19] In 2008, activists in New York City began the Doula Project, to expand the role of the doula to other reproductive experiences beyond birth, grounded in reproductive justice framework.[28][29] The participants began working as abortion doulas and coined the term \"full-spectrum doula\" who support all pregnancy experiences and outcomes such as pregnancy termination, miscarriage and fetal loss.[28][30] Full spectrum doula groups can be found in major cities in the United States.[31] In 2019, Black maternal health advocate and Parents writer Christine Michel Carter interviewed Vice President Kamala Harris about the popularity of doulas in the Black community.[32] As a senator, in 2019 Harris reintroduced the Maternal Care Access and Reducing Emergencies (CARE) Act which aimed to address the maternal mortality disparity faced by women of color by training providers on recognizing implicit racial bias and its impact on care. Harris stated: \"We need to speak the uncomfortable truth that women—and especially Black women—are too often not listened to or taken seriously by the health care system, and therefore they are denied the dignity that they deserve. And we need to speak this truth because today, the United States is 1 of only 13 countries in the world where the rate of maternal mortality is worse than it was 25 years ago. That risk is even higher for Black women, who are three to four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related causes. These numbers are simply outrageous.\" A doula focused on birth is also known as a birth companion, nonclinical birth worker, birth coach, or post-birth supporter, by providing continuous care before, during, or after in the form of information, advocacy, physical support, and emotional support.[2][14][8][10] A birth doula is also called a labor doula. A birth doula might accompany a pregnant woman during labor and birth in place of or in addition to a partner, family member, or friend. Unlike these other birth companions, a doula has formal training in labor support.[2][14] The kinds of support provided during childbirth might include physical assistance and comfort (massage, maintaining a supporting posture, or providing water), emotional support (providing company, encouragement or simply talking in a soothing tone of voice), acting as an advocate during childbirth (supporting the birthing woman's right to make decisions about their own body and baby to the medical team) and informational support (provide information about the birthing process and non-medication based forms of pain relief, and facilitating communication between their client and health providers).[14][5] Most doula-client relationships begin a few months before the baby is due. Before the labor, the doula and the family can develop a relationship where the pregnant woman and their support person (e.g. the other parent) feel comfortable asking questions, expressing their fears and concerns, and discussing birth preferences.[24] Continuous support during labor provided by doulas has been associated with improved outcomes for both birthing women and babies, including shorter delivery, fewer cesarean sections and complications, the use of fewer medications and fetal extraction tools, less time in neonatal intensive care units, positive psychological benefits, more satisfying birth experiences, and increased breastfeeding.[11][5] Cross-country research on the effects of doulas on childbirth and postnatal care is complicated by the variety of settings, cultures, and medical systems of individual countries and the characteristics of patients. These benefits appear to be contingent on the doula providing continuous rather than intermittent assistance and knowing the specific social and cultural setting within which their services are provided.[33] Doula care can help reduce health disparities of those with the greatest need including those with less education, lower incomes, less preparation for childbirth and those lacking social support.[34][35][36][37] Research also supports the effectiveness of female friends or relatives, after minimal training, as a low-cost alternative to professional doulas.[11][38] In March 2014, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) put out a Consensus Statement titled \"Safe Prevention of Primary Cesarean Delivery\" in which it said, \"Increasing [a woman's] access to non-medical interventions during labor, such as continuous labor support, also has been shown to reduce cesarean birth rates.\"[39] As more research has become available on the positive benefits of trained labor support provided by someone not employed by the hospital, in 2017 ACOG officially announced the need for all birthing individuals to have access to continuous labor support outside hospital staff, and said, \"Evidence suggests that, in addition to regular nursing care, continuous one-to-one emotional support provided by support personnel, such as a doula, is associated with improved outcomes.\"[40][41] The official committee opinion put out by ACOG also offers other recommendations that allow birthing women more choice and access to more supportive care. Doulas could be utilized to help achieve many of these recommendations as they move towards better collaboration.[42] In 2017 the United Kingdom's Royal College of Midwives published a position statement on doulas, which supports the choice of the individual to hire a doula for their birth as long as the doula does not provide medical care.[43] A 2018 study examined women's perceptions of doulas in several different countries, including Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Malawi, Sweden, Nepal, Russia, Canada, and the United States of America and found that having continuous support from a companion such as a doula was highly appreciated by most women.[10] However, perceptions may vary from country to country due to cultural factors, such as an emphasis on modesty and privacy, which might affect what kind of support a woman prefers.[10] A 2018 study examining news media discourse in China noted that Chinese doulas needed to register with official departments or organizations and are closely linked with midwifery. The doula profession was introduced in 1996 to mainland China and demand of their services increased since then, with women citing dissatisfaction with medical care. After China's implementation of the Second-Child Policy, doula care was strongly linked to doula support in regard to family planning.[44] Tensions between doctors, nurses, and doulas have sometimes been described as a \"turf battle,\"[45] though it is also recognized that doulas and nurses can occupy complementary roles that provide opportunities for mutual learning and assistance.[46] Some hospitals have created internal doula training programs to reduce conflict between doulas and medical staff.[45][47] There is no law requiring doulas to become certified, however, certification can benefit professional doulas by providing structured education prior to entry into the field, access to a mentor, opportunities for networking, and client confidence.[48] In North America, training generally takes the form of a two- to the three-day seminar, and some experience with childbirth.[49] Trainees might have hands-on practice with various techniques used during childbirth, including maternal positions and movements, relaxation and breathing exercises and other measures that could be used for comfort. Certification can occur through organizations at various levels (local, national, or international) and some require positive evaluations from medical professionals. Certification may also require, in addition to attending a training course, time spent working or learning about maternity care and childbirth classes, and possibly a written exam.[17] Some doulas train through distance education.[46] There is a movement to encourage certification and provide documentation of it on consumer websites such as DoulaMatch where an individual can find certified doulas, childbirth educators, yoga instructors, and other birth-related professionals.[46] Doulas not trained by a formal organization can be controversial within medical settings due to a lack of formal medical education when a discussion regarding medical interventions in labor versus pursuing natural childbirth without an epidural or cesarean section arises.[45] Major doula organizations that offer certification programs include Birth Arts International, Birth Works, Birthing from Within, Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (CAPPA), DONA International, Hypnobirthing, International Childbirth Education Association (ICEA), and ProDoula.[50] Because of the lack of standardization, doula organizations provide different courses with varying requirements and anyone can refer to themselves as a doula.[51] Doulamatch.net, an online referral page for doulas, has offered a list of items that students should look for as they begin looking for training. Amy Gilliland, a researcher on doula care and culture, also lists some qualities a training program should have.[52] Some theorists have stated that it might take college-level work or more in-depth online education in order to provide some of the communication skills that might be necessary.[53] In 2010, a survey of professional Canadian doulas found that the common motivations for doula work include \"desire to support women in childbirth, personal interest, and a wish to share their own positive birth experience with others\" but did not see the work as a means to create steady income.[54] Doulas of color also found motivation in providing care for their racial, ethnic and cultural communities so as to provide culturally competent care.[55] Volunteer doulas often saw doula work as a way to \"help others, to establish a practice as an employed doula, and to have a route into nursing or midwifery.\"[56] From 2021 to present, Canada has specifically focused research on the cultural significance of indigenous practices in doula work.[57][58][59] A 2004 study of North American doulas identified challenges to doula work such as lack of support from clinicians, balancing doula work with family and other work obligations, and being on call.[60] Volunteer doulas also found challenges in individuals' poor understanding of the doula's role, lack of clear boundaries, and complex socio-economic issues.[56] Additionally, doulas often are challenged with the task to navigate their role in medicalized (hospital) births.[61] Due to the social hierarchy and privilege that medical professionals have in medical settings doulas are often subordinate to doctors and physicians. Doulas have to negotiate the power dynamics between the patient and medical provider, while also establishing their legitimacy and role in the process of childbirth.[62] They, therefore, have to be cognizant of the medical environment in which their client chooses to give birth in order to effectively advocate for their client's needs.[63] An antepartum doula provides help and support to someone who has been put on bed rest or is experiencing a high-risk pregnancy. Emotional, physical and practical support can be provided by an antepartum doula in this circumstance.[64] Postpartum doulas provide educational support and practical support in the home in the first weeks and months after childbirth or after adding an infant to the family. The same doula often provides both birth and postpartum services.[2] Their services include a mixture of emotional support and practical help, such as infant care, breastfeeding support, information, advocacy and referral, partner support, sibling care, and household organization/work as the family adjusts to the addition of a new baby.[65] There is some evidence that postpartum doula support can increase breastfeeding and decrease postpartum depression.[5][66] Other workers overlap in some of these services, such as maternity nurses, health visitors, newborn care specialists, lactation consultants, and, historically, monthly nurses. Full-spectrum doulas extend the role of a birth attendant and provide support for all reproductive experiences which connect the role to the larger reproductive justice movement.[3] This can include support for abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, queer family planning, adoption, and fertility as well as extending services to women, men, transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.[3][67][68] Abortion doulas focus on providing support to clients having an induced abortion. They provide emotional, physical, and informational support virtually or in person.[3][15] Full-spectrum doulas often identify as activists as well as service providers and emphasize the human rights of their clients in the hopes of ending social stereotypes.[3] Abortion doulas provide care before, during, and after an abortion, with support varying by person and their informational, emotional, physical, and practical needs. Doulas work in a variety of situations, including community collectives and as solo practitioners, and provide abortion support as a service in their full-spectrum practice. There are no certifications specifically for abortion doulas that are administered nationally or through individual states.[69] In the United States following the landmark decision, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, doulas expect to be contacted more frequently about abortion support as access becomes more limited. They are taking precautions to retain online anonymity to better protect patients and themselves and navigate the threat of legal action.[69] A gender doula provides care before, during, and after the gender transition process for transgender and non-binary individuals.[70] Gender doulas may also serve as patient advocates for their clients against medical practitioners who may misgender or undermine the gender identity of the client. End-of-life or death doulas care for critically ill adults in geriatric care,[17] and during death.[71] While some doulas work independently or on a volunteer basis, others might work in association with a health care service, such as a palliative care service. The roles of an end-of-life doula include not only physical tasks, such as assisting with posture or making the bed comfortable but also emotional and psychological tasks, such as providing guidance and support. In the United States, doulas can be found in hospital, community-based programs as well as private practice or doula agencies. They might also be reimbursed by insurance companies or out-of-pocket by clients.[72][73][74] Since insurance companies typically do not cover the cost of hiring a doula, they are more popular among middle- and upper-class parents than amongst parents with lower incomes.[45][75] Since doula care has the potential to lower maternity costs and reduce health disparities, there is a push for coverage through Medicaid reimbursement programs. As of 2022, four states, Oregon, Minnesota, Virginia and Wisconsin, have implemented reimbursement programs.[34][76] In 2019, New York State launched a doula pilot program for Medicaid reimbursement in Erie and Kings Counties.[77] In that same year, New York State passed a bill to certify doulas to lend legitimacy to the profession and to pave the way for Medicaid reimbursement from the federal government, becoming the first state to do so. Doulas in New York, however, expressed concern about the bill, having not been involved with the bill's writing, citing that state certification would make doulas more beholden to the formal medical system, be a hit to business if certification programs are not approved by the state, and might prevent community doulas from working with low-income individuals.[78][79] In the UK, the National Health Service and promotion of midwifery for low-risk pregnancies provide a continuity of care unavailable to North American pregnant women, but still are seeing an upswing in doulas. This pattern has been suggested to result from the lack of midwives available and a move to provide doulas to individuals at greater risk for poor outcomes.[56] A 2019 study reviewed perceptions of labor companionship across mostly high income countries and found barriers that prevent the universal implementation of doula care. These challenges are due to a multitude of factors dealing with perception (for example, providers not understanding the benefits or roles and other medical aspects being seen as more important) and logistics (chiefly, gaps in policy, difficulty of integration, and lack of training).[80] Community-based doulas work with underserved communities of which they are often members to provide a sense of cultural humility that fosters trust and strengthens relationships between the doula and their client. The services provided are often low cost, and expand in the amount of support offered compared to traditional doulas and consider physical, social spiritual and emotional needs. Services include an increased amount of home visits, preparation for the birthing experience, education, guidance navigating health care systems, language support, screening for mental health, and food security needs.[81] Additionally, community-based doula models provide insight in the creation of policies that will support those families and underserved communities.[81] These doulas also actively engage policy makers by recommendations on certification and Medicaid coverage, integration into medical care, and participating on advisory boards.[82] Since the 1980s, women incarcerated in the US has increased nearly 800 percent, of which an estimated 12,000 pregnant women are incarcerated annually. Pregnant prisoners are allowed to be shackled in more than 20 states and are forced to return to jail within 24 hours without their infants.[83] The environmental factors of the penal system are shown to increase the risks associated with poor perinatal outcomes and have long-term health risks for the women and their children.[84] The implementation of prison doulas rose out of the movement to end shackling for pregnant and laboring women from the prison abolition, human rights, reproductive justice, and birth justice movements in the early 2000s.[84][85] Prison doula organizations work with those incarcerated to provide prenatal care, childbirth education, birth attendance, and breast feeding support. By providing doula services to jails, prisons, recovery centers, and county hospitals, doulas work to improve birth experiences and bonding as well as to challenge the dehumanizing penal environment.[85] In studies of women who received doula services while incarcerated, the women reported increased happiness around their pregnancy; greater feelings of empowerment; a sense of normalcy around birth; and support during separation from their infant.[84][86] While well-received, prison doula support is not widespread in the United States and most programs are local due to the lack of an established federal standard of medical care for pregnant incarcerated individuals.[83] In 2018, Washington was the first state to provide access to midwifery and doula services for incarcerated women for prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care. However, the bill does not establish means of funding the services, and does not establish guidelines for care.[87]",

                "content": "NHL NFL NBA WJC CFL MLB Curling TSN+ Video Listen Betting The Shift Bardown ... Son Heung-min scored a spectacular goal directly from a corner to fire Tottenham into the English League Cup semifinals in a thrilling 4-3 win over Manchester United on Thursday. Spurs will play Premier League leader Liverpool for a place in the final, and Arsenal was drawn against Newcastle in the other last-four matchup. Son’s strike in the 88th-minute at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium came as Spurs tried to hold off a dramatic comeback from United, having led 3-0 in the second half. United had pulled it back to 3-2 and was pushing for an equalizer when Son whipped in a curling right-footed shot past goalkeeper Altay Bayindir. “Obviously we made it harder than it should have been, for sure,\" Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou said and added, “Are you not entertained?” United’s players complained Bayindir had been fouled by Tottenham’s Lucas Bergvall as Son’s shot flew past him. Replays appeared to show contact between the two, but with no VAR at this stage of the competition, there was no chance of a review. Jonny Evans scored again for United in stoppage time, but Spurs held on for the win that had looked all but certain shortly after halftime. Having gone ahead through Dominic Solanke’s goal from close range in the 15th, Tottenham took control after the break. Dejan Kulusevski doubled the lead a minute after the restart and Solanke fired in his second in the 54th. United head coach Ruben Amorim made a triple substitution — bringing on Joshua Zirkzee, Amad Diallo and Kobbie Mainoo. It quickly had an impact with Zirkzee forcing Fraser Forster into a flying save and then capitalizing on a loose pass by the Tottenham goalkeeper to make it 3-1. Forster was guilty of another mistake in the 70th when his attempted clearance was closed down by Diallo and ricocheted over the line. United increased the pressure, but Son’s unlikely goal gave Spurs a cushion again — and it proved to be the decisive strike after Evans’ late header reduced the deficit again. “I know the studio (punditry team) is probably going into meltdown over my lack of tactics,” Postecoglou said. “I love the fact that we go out there and take it to oppositions.” ___ James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer © 2024 All rights reserved.",
