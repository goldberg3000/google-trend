                "content": "James Earl Carter Jr. (October 1, 1924 – December 29, 2024) was an American politician and humanitarian who served as the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. A member of the Democratic Party, he served from 1963 to 1967 in the Georgia State Senate and from 1971 to 1975 as the 76th governor of Georgia. Carter was the longest-lived president in U.S. history and the first to live to 100 years of age. Born and raised in Plains, Georgia, Carter graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946 and joined the U.S. Navy's submarine service. He returned home after his military service and revived his family's peanut-growing business. Opposing racial segregation, Carter supported the growing civil rights movement, and became an activist within the Democratic Party. He served in the Georgia State Senate from 1963 to 1967 and then as Governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975. As a dark-horse candidate not well known outside Georgia, Carter won the Democratic nomination and narrowly defeated the incumbent president, Gerald Ford of the Republican Party, in the 1976 presidential election. Carter pardoned all Vietnam War draft evaders on his second day in office. He created a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. Carter successfully pursued the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, and the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. He also confronted stagflation. His administration established the U.S. Department of Energy and the Department of Education. He was the only president to serve a full term without appointing a justice to the Supreme Court. The end of his presidency was marked by the Iran hostage crisis, an energy crisis, the Three Mile Island accident, the Nicaraguan Revolution, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In response to the invasion, Carter escalated the Cold War by ending détente, imposing a grain embargo against the Soviets, enunciating the Carter Doctrine, and leading the multinational boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Carter defeated challenger Ted Kennedy in the 1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries but lost the general election in a landslide to Ronald Reagan, the Republican nominee. After leaving the presidency, Carter established the Carter Center to promote and expand human rights; in 2002, he received a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in relation to it. He traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections, and further the eradication of infectious diseases. Carter was a key figure in the nonprofit housing organization Habitat for Humanity. He has also written numerous books, ranging from political memoirs to poetry, while continuing to comment on global affairs, including two books on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Polls of historians and political scientists generally rank Carter as a below-average president. Scholars and the public more favorably view his post-presidency, which was the longest in U.S. history. James Earl Carter Jr. was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, at the Wise Sanitarium, where his mother worked as a registered nurse.[1] Carter thus became the first American president born in a hospital.[2] He was the eldest child of Bessie Lillian Gordy and James Earl Carter Sr., and a descendant of English immigrant Thomas Carter, who settled in the Colony of Virginia in 1635.[3][4] In Georgia, numerous generations of Carters worked as cotton farmers.[5] Plains was a boomtown of 600 people at the time of Carter's birth. His father was a successful local businessman who ran a general store and was an investor in farmland.[6] Carter's father had previously served as a reserve second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps during World War I.[6] During Carter's infancy, his family moved several times, settling on a dirt road in nearby Archery, which was almost entirely populated by impoverished African American families.[2][7] His family eventually had three more children: Gloria, Ruth, and Billy.[8] Carter got along well with his parents even though his mother was often absent during his childhood since she worked long hours, and although his father was staunchly pro-segregation, he allowed Jimmy to befriend the black farmhands' children.[9] Carter was an enterprising teenager who was given his own acre of Earl's farmland, where he grew, packaged, and sold peanuts.[10] Carter also rented out a section of tenant housing that he had purchased.[2] Carter attended Plains High School from 1937 to 1941, graduating from the eleventh grade since the school did not have a twelfth grade.[11] By that time, Archery and Plains had been impoverished by the Great Depression, but the family benefited from New Deal farming subsidies, and Carter's father took a position as a community leader.[10][12] Carter himself was a diligent student with a fondness for reading.[13] A popular anecdote holds that he was passed over for valedictorian after he and his friends skipped school to venture downtown in a hot rod. Carter's truancy was mentioned in a local newspaper, although it is not clear he would have otherwise been valedictorian.[14] As an adolescent, Carter played on the Plains High School basketball team, and also joined Future Farmers of America, which helped him develop a lifelong interest in woodworking.[14] Carter had long dreamed of attending the United States Naval Academy.[10] In 1941, he started undergraduate coursework in engineering at Georgia Southwestern College in nearby Americus, Georgia.[15] The next year, Carter transferred to the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, where civil rights icon Blake Van Leer was president.[16] While at Georgia Tech, Carter took part in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps.[17] In 1943, he received an appointment to the Naval Academy from U.S. Representative Stephen Pace, and Carter graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1946.[18][17] He was a good student but was seen as reserved and quiet, in contrast to the academy's culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen.[19] While at the Academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith, a friend of his sister Ruth.[20] The two wed shortly after his graduation in 1946, and were married until her death on November 19, 2023.[21][22] Carter was a sprint football player for the Navy Midshipmen.[23] He graduated 60th out of 821 midshipmen in the class of 1947[a] with a Bachelor of Science degree and was commissioned as an ensign.[25] From 1946 to 1953, the Carters lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York, and California, during his deployments in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.[26] In 1948, he began officer training for submarine duty and served aboard USS Pomfret.[27] Carter was promoted to lieutenant junior grade in 1949, and his service aboard Pomfret included a simulated war patrol to the western Pacific and Chinese coast from January to March of that year.[28] In 1951, Carter was assigned to the diesel/electric USS K-1 (SSK-1), qualified for command, and served in several positions, to include executive officer.[29] In 1952, Carter began an association with the Navy's fledgling nuclear submarine program, led by then-Captain Hyman G. Rickover.[30] Rickover had high standards and demands for his men and machines, and Carter later said that, next to his parents, Rickover had the greatest influence on his life.[31] Carter was sent to the Naval Reactors Branch of the Atomic Energy Commission in Washington, D.C., for three-month temporary duty, while Rosalynn moved with their children to Schenectady, New York.[32] On December 12, 1952, an accident with the experimental NRX reactor at Atomic Energy of Canada's Chalk River Laboratories caused a partial meltdown, resulting in millions of liters of radioactive water flooding the reactor building's basement. This left the reactor's core ruined.[33] Carter was ordered to Chalk River to lead a U.S. maintenance crew that joined other American and Canadian service personnel to assist in the shutdown of the reactor.[34] The painstaking process required each team member to don protective gear and be lowered individually into the reactor for 90 seconds at a time, limiting their exposure to radioactivity while they disassembled the crippled reactor. When Carter was lowered in, his job was simply to turn a single screw.[35] During and after his presidency, Carter said that his experience at Chalk River had shaped his views on atomic energy and led him to cease the development of a neutron bomb.[36] In March 1953, Carter began a six-month course in nuclear power plant operation at Union College in Schenectady.[26] His intent was to eventually work aboard USS Seawolf, which was intended to be the second U.S. nuclear submarine.[37] His plans changed when his father died of pancreatic cancer in July, two months before construction of Seawolf began, and Carter obtained a release from active duty so he could take over the family peanut business.[38][39] Deciding to leave Schenectady proved difficult, as Rosalynn had grown comfortable with their life there.[40][41] She later said that returning to small-town life in Plains seemed \"a monumental step backward.\"[42] Carter left active duty on October 9, 1953.[43][44] He served in the inactive Navy Reserve until 1961 and left the service with the rank of lieutenant.[45] Carter's awards include the American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, China Service Medal, and National Defense Service Medal.[46] As a submarine officer, he also earned the \"dolphin\" badge.[47] After debt settlements and division of his father's estate among its heirs, Jimmy inherited comparatively little.[48] For a year, he, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in public housing in Plains.[b] Carter was knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, and he set out to expand the family's peanut-growing business.[50] Transitioning from the Navy to farming was difficult as his first-year harvest failed due to a drought, and Carter had to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat.[51] Meanwhile, he took classes and studied agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business's books.[52] Though they barely broke even the first year, the Carters grew the business and became quite successful.[49][52] As racial tension inflamed in Plains by the 1954 Supreme Court of the United States ruling in Brown v. Board of Education,[53] Carter favored racial tolerance and integration but often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies. By 1961, Carter began to speak more prominently of integration as a member of the Baptist Church and chairman of the Sumter County school board.[54][55] In 1962, he announced his campaign for an open Georgia State Senate seat 15 days before the election.[56] Rosalynn, who had an instinct for politics and organization, was instrumental to his campaign. While early counting of the ballots showed Carter trailing his opponent, Homer Moore, this was later proven to be the result of fraudulent voting. The fraud was found to have been orchestrated by Joe Hurst, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Quitman County.[56] Carter challenged the election result, which was confirmed fraudulent in an investigation. Following this, another election was held, in which Carter won against Moore as the sole Democratic candidate, with a vote margin of 3,013 to 2,182.[57] The civil rights movement was well underway when Carter took office. He and his family had become staunch John F. Kennedy supporters. Carter remained relatively quiet on the issue at first, even as it polarized much of the county, to avoid alienating his segregationist colleagues. Carter did speak up on a few divisive issues, giving speeches against literacy tests and against an amendment to the Georgia Constitution that he felt implied a compulsion to practice religion.[58] Carter entered the state Democratic Executive Committee two years into office, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules. He became the chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission, which oversaw the disbursement of federal and state grants for projects such as historic site restoration.[59] When Bo Callaway was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1964, Carter immediately began planning to challenge him. The two had previously clashed over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college program by the state, and Carter saw Callaway—who had switched to the Republican Party—as a rival who represented aspects of politics he despised.[60] Carter was reelected to a second two-year term in the state Senate,[61] where he chaired its Education Committee and sat on the Appropriations Committee toward the end of the term. He contributed to a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern State University a four-year program. He leveraged his regional planning work, giving speeches around the district to make himself more visible to potential voters. On the last day of the term, Carter announced his candidacy for the House of Representatives.[62] Callaway decided to run for governor instead;[63] Carter changed his mind, deciding to run for governor too.[64] In the 1966 gubernatorial election, Carter ran against liberal former governor Ellis Arnall and conservative segregationist Lester Maddox in the Democratic primary. In a press conference, he described his ideology as \"Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road ... I believe I am a more complicated person than that.\"[65] He lost the primary but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force Arnall into a runoff election with Maddox, who narrowly defeated Arnall.[66] In the general election, Republican nominee Callaway won a plurality of the vote but less than a majority, allowing the Democratic-majority Georgia House of Representatives to elect Maddox as governor.[66] This resulted in a victorious Maddox, whose victory—due to his segregationist stance—was seen as the worst outcome for the indebted Carter.[66] Carter returned to his agriculture business, carefully planning his next campaign. This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter; he declared himself a born again Christian, and his last child, Amy, was born during this time.[67][68] In the 1970 gubernatorial election, liberal former governor Carl Sanders became Carter's main opponent in the Democratic primary. Carter ran a more modern campaign, employing printed graphics and statistical analysis. Responding to polls, he leaned more conservative than before, positioning himself as a populist and criticizing Sanders for both his wealth and perceived links to the national Democratic Party. He also accused Sanders of corruption, but when pressed by the media, he did not provide evidence.[69][70] Throughout his campaign, Carter sought both the black vote and the votes of those who had supported prominent Alabama segregationist George Wallace. While he met with black figures such as Martin Luther King Sr. and Andrew Young and visited many black-owned businesses, he also praised Wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in Georgia. Carter's appeal to racism became more blatant over time, with his senior campaign aides handing out a photograph of Sanders celebrating with Black basketball players.[69][70] Carter came ahead of Sanders in the first ballot by 49 percent to 38 percent in September, leading to a runoff election. The subsequent campaign was even more bitter; despite his early support for civil rights, Carter's appeal to racism grew, and he criticized Sanders for supporting Martin Luther King Jr. Carter won the runoff election with 60 percent of the vote and won the general election against Republican nominee Hal Suit. Once elected, Carter changed his tone and began to speak against Georgia's racist politics. Leroy Johnson, a black state senator, voiced his support for Carter: \"I understand why he ran that kind of ultra-conservative campaign. I don't believe you can win this state without being a racist.\"[69] Carter was sworn in as the 76th governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971. In his inaugural speech, he declared that \"the time for racial discrimination is over\",[71] shocking the crowd and causing many of the segregationists who had supported him during the race to feel betrayed. Carter was reluctant to engage with his fellow politicians, making him unpopular with the legislature.[72][73] He expanded the governor's authority by introducing a reorganization plan submitted in January 1972. Despite initially having a cool reception in the legislature, the plan passed at midnight on the last day of the session.[74] Carter merged about 300 state agencies into 22, although it is disputed whether that saved the state money.[75] On July 8, 1971, during an appearance in Columbus, Georgia, he stated his intention to establish a Georgia Human Rights Council to help solve issues ahead of any potential violence.[76] In a news conference on July 13, 1971, Carter announced that he had ordered department heads to reduce spending to prevent a $57 million deficit by the end of the 1972 fiscal year, specifying that each state department would be affected and estimating that 5 percent over government revenue would be lost if state departments continued to fully use allocated funds.[77] On January 13, 1972, he requested that the state legislature fund an early childhood development program along with prison reform programs and $48 million (equivalent to $270 million in 2023) in paid taxes for nearly all state employees.[78] On March 1, 1972, Carter said he might call a special session of the general assembly if the Justice Department opted to turn down any reapportionment plans by either the House or Senate.[79] He pushed several reforms through the legislature, providing equal state aid to schools in Georgia's wealthy and poor areas, setting up community centers for mentally disabled children, and increasing educational programs for convicts. Under this program, all such appointments were based on merit rather than political influence.[80][81] In one of his more controversial decisions, he vetoed a plan to build a dam on Georgia's Flint River, which attracted the attention of environmentalists nationwide.[82][83] Civil rights were a high priority for Carter, who added black state employees and portraits of three prominent black Georgians to the capitol building: Martin Luther King Jr., Lucy Craft Laney, and Henry McNeal Turner. This angered the Ku Klux Klan.[83] He favored a constitutional amendment to ban busing for the purpose of expediting integration in schools on a televised joint appearance with Florida governor Reubin Askew on January 31, 1973,[84] and co-sponsored an anti-busing resolution with Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference.[85][86] After the U.S. Supreme Court threw out Georgia's death penalty statute in Furman v. Georgia (1972), Carter signed a revised death-penalty statute that addressed the court's objections, thus reintroducing the practice in the state. He later regretted endorsing the death penalty, saying, \"I didn't see the injustice of it as I do now.\"[87] Ineligible for reelection, Carter looked toward a potential presidential run and engaged in national politics. He was named to several southern planning commissions and was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, where liberal U.S. Senator George McGovern was the likely nominee. Carter tried to ingratiate himself with the conservative and anti-McGovern voters. He was fairly obscure at the time, and his attempt at triangulation failed; the 1972 Democratic ticket was McGovern and senator Thomas Eagleton.[88][c] On August 3, Carter met with Wallace in Birmingham, Alabama, to discuss preventing the Democrats from losing in a landslide,[90] but they did.[91] Carter regularly met with his fledgling campaign staff and decided to begin putting a presidential bid for 1976 together. He tried unsuccessfully to become chairman of the National Governors Association to boost his visibility. On David Rockefeller's endorsement, he was named to the Trilateral Commission in April 1973. The next year, he was named chairman of both the Democratic National Committee's congressional and gubernatorial campaigns.[92] In May 1973, Carter warned his party against politicizing the Watergate scandal,[93] which he attributed to president Richard Nixon's isolation from Americans and secretive decision-making.[94] On December 12, 1974, Carter announced his presidential campaign at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. His speech contained themes of domestic inequality, optimism, and change.[95][96] Upon his entrance in the Democratic primaries, he was competing against sixteen other candidates, and was considered to have little chance against the more nationally known politicians such as Wallace.[97] His name recognition was very low, and his opponents derisively asked \"Jimmy Who?\".[98] In response to this, Carter began to emphasize his name and what he stood for, stating \"My name is Jimmy Carter, and I'm running for president.\"[99] This strategy proved successful. By mid-March 1976, Carter was not only far ahead of the active contenders for the presidential nomination, but led incumbent Republican president Gerald Ford by a few percentage points.[100] As the Watergate scandal was still fresh in the voters' minds, Carter's position as an outsider, distant from Washington, D.C. proved helpful. He promoted government reorganization. In June, Carter published a memoir titled Why Not the Best? to help introduce himself to the American public.[101] Carter became the front-runner early on by winning the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. His strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there, traveling over 50,000 miles (80,000 kilometres), visiting 37 states, and delivering over 200 speeches before any other candidate had entered the race.[102] In the South, he tacitly conceded certain areas to Wallace and swept them as a moderate when it became clear Wallace could not win the region. In the North, Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters. While he did not achieve a majority in most Northern states, he won several by building the largest singular support base. Although Carter was initially dismissed as a regional candidate, he would clinch the Democratic nomination.[103] In 1980, Lawrence Shoup noted that the national news media discovered and promoted Carter, and stated: What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media. It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge, propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls. This helped Carter win key primary election victories, enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President-elect in the short space of 9 months.[104] During an interview in April 1976, Carter said, \"I have nothing against a community that is... trying to maintain the ethnic purity of their neighborhoods.\"[105] His remark was intended as supportive of open housing laws, but specifying opposition to government efforts to \"inject black families into a white neighborhood just to create some sort of integration\".[105] Carter's stated positions during his campaign included public financing of congressional campaigns,[106] his support for the creation of a federal consumer protection agency,[107] creating a separate cabinet-level department for education,[108] signing a peace treaty with the Soviet Union to limit nuclear weapons,[109] reducing the defense budget,[110] a tax proposal implementing \"a substantial increase toward those who have the higher incomes\" alongside a levy reduction on taxpayers with lower and middle incomes,[111] making multiple amendments to the Social Security Act,[112] and having a balanced budget by the end of his first term of office.[113] On July 15, 1976, Carter chose U.S. senator Walter Mondale as his running mate.[114] Carter and Ford faced off in three televised debates,[115] the first United States presidential debates since 1960.[115][116] For the November 1976 issue of Playboy, which hit newsstands a couple of weeks before the election, Robert Scheer interviewed Carter. While discussing his religion's view of pride, Carter said: \"I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times.\"[117][118] This response and his admission in another interview that he did not mind if people uttered the word \"fuck\" led to a media feeding frenzy and critics lamenting the erosion of boundary between politicians and their private intimate lives.[119] Carter once had a sizable lead over Ford in national polling, but by late September his lead had narrowed to only several points.[120][121] In the final days before the election, several polls showed that Ford had tied Carter, and one Gallup poll found that he was now slightly ahead.[122] Most analysts agreed that Carter was going to win the popular vote, but some argued Ford had an opportunity to win the electoral college and thus the election.[123][124] Carter ultimately won, receiving 297 electoral votes and 50.1% of the popular vote to Ford's 240 electoral votes and 48.0% of the popular vote.[125] Carter's victory was attributed in part[126] to his overwhelming support among black voters in states decided by close margins, such as Louisiana, Texas, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Mississippi, Wisconsin, and Ohio.[127] In Ohio and Wisconsin, where the margin between Carter and Ford was under two points, the black vote was crucial for Carter; if he had not won both states, Ford would have won the election.[127][128] Ford phoned Carter to congratulate him shortly after the race was called. He was unable to concede in front of television cameras due to bad hoarse voice, and so First Lady Betty did so for him.[129] Vice President Nelson Rockefeller oversaw the certification of election results on January 6, 1977. Although Ford carried Washington, Mike Padden, an elector from there, cast his vote for Ronald Reagan, the then-governor of California and Carter's eventual successor.[130] Preliminary planning for Carter's presidential transition had already been underway for months before his election.[131][132] Carter had been the first presidential candidate to allot significant funds and a significant number of personnel to a pre-election transition planning effort, which then became standard practice.[133] He set a mold that influenced all future transitions to be larger, more methodical and more formal than they were.[133][132] On November 22, 1976, Carter conducted his first visit to Washington, D.C. after being elected, meeting with director of the Office of Management James Lynn and United States secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld at the Blair House, and holding an afternoon meeting with President Ford at the White House.[134] The next day, he conferred with congressional leaders, saying that his meetings with cabinet members had been \"very helpful\" and that Ford had offered his assistance if he needed anything.[135] Relations between Ford and Carter were relatively cold during the transition.[136] During his transition, Carter announced the selection of numerous designees for positions in his administration.[137] A few weeks before his inauguration, Carter moved his peanut business into the hands of trustees to avoid a potential conflict of interest.[138] He also asked incoming members of his administration to divest themselves of assets through blind trusts.[139] Carter was inaugurated as the 39th president on January 20, 1977.[140] One of Carter's first acts was the fulfillment of a campaign promise by issuing an executive order declaring unconditional amnesty for Vietnam War-era draft evaders, Proclamation 4483.[141][142] Carter's tenure in office was marked by an economic malaise, a time of continuing inflation and recession and a 1979 energy crisis. Under Carter, the U.S. experienced its first ever government shutdown in May 1980, though it affected only the Federal Trade Commission.[143] Carter attempted to calm various conflicts around the world, most visibly in the Middle East with the signing of the Camp David Accords;[144] giving back the Panama Canal to Panama; and signing the SALT II nuclear arms reduction treaty with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. His final year was marred by the Iran hostage crisis, which contributed to his losing the 1980 election to Ronald Reagan.[145] Whistleblowers have alleged, most recently in 2023, that people working on the Reagan campaign's behalf convinced Iran to prolong the crisis to reduce Carter's chance of reelection.[146] Carter's presidency had a troubled economic history of two roughly equal periods. The first two years were a time of intense stagflation, primarily due to recovery from a previous recession that had left fixed investment at extreme lows and unemployment at 9%.[147] Under Carter, the unemployment rate declined from 8.1% when he took office to 5.7% by July 1978,[148][149] but during the early 1980s recession it returned to its pre-1977 level.[150] The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measured a 6.6% unemployment rate average during the Carter administration.[151] His last two years were marked by double-digit inflation, very high interest rates,[152] oil shortages, and slow economic growth.[153] Due to economic stimulus legislation, such as the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, proposed by Carter and passed by Congress, real household median income had grown by 5.2%, with a projection of 6.4% for the next quarter.[154] The 1979 energy crisis ended this period of growth, and as inflation and interest rates rose, economic growth, job creation and consumer confidence declined sharply.[152] Federal Reserve Board chairman G. William Miller's relatively loose monetary policy had already contributed to somewhat higher inflation,[155] rising from 5.8% in 1976 to 7.7% in 1978. The sudden doubling of crude oil prices by OPEC, the world's leading oil exporting cartel,[156] forced inflation to double-digit levels, averaging 11.3% in 1979 and 13.5% in 1980.[147] The sudden shortage of gasoline as the 1979 summer vacation season began exacerbated the problem and came to symbolize the crisis to the general public;[152] the acute shortage, originating in the shutdown of Amerada Hess refining facilities, led the federal government to sue the company that year.[157] In 1978, Carter declared a federal emergency in the neighborhood of Love Canal in the city of Niagara Falls, New York. More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which had been built on top of a toxic waste landfill. The Superfund law was created in response to the situation.[158] Federal disaster money was appropriated to demolish the approximately 500 houses, the 99th Street School, and the 93rd Street School, which had been built on top of the dump; and to remediate the dump and construct a containment area for the hazardous wastes. This was the first time that such a process had been undertaken. Carter acknowledged that several more \"Love Canals\" existed across the country, and that discovering such hazardous dumpsites was \"one of the grimmest discoveries of our modern era\".[159] Moralism typified much of Carter's action.[160] On April 18, 1977, he delivered a televised speech declaring that the current energy crisis was the \"moral equivalent of war\". He encouraged energy conservation and installed solar water heating panels on the White House.[161][162] He wore sweaters to offset turning down the heat in the White House.[163] On August 4, 1977, Carter signed the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, forming the Department of Energy, the first new cabinet position in eleven years.[164] Carter emphasized that the House of Representatives had \"adopted almost all\" of the energy proposal he had made five months earlier and called the compromise \"a turning point in establishing a comprehensive energy program.\"[165] The following month, on October 13, Carter stated he believed in the Senate's ability to pass the energy reform bill and identified energy as \"the most important domestic issue that we will face while I am in office.\"[166] On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said the continued discussions about his energy reform proposal had been \"long and divisive and arduous\" as well as hindering to national issues that needed to be addressed with the implementation of the law.[167] In an April 11, 1978, news conference, Carter said his biggest surprise \"in the nature of a disappointment\" since becoming president was the difficulty Congress had in passing legislation, citing the energy reform bill in particular: \"I never dreamed a year ago in April when I proposed this matter to the Congress that a year later it still would not be resolved.\"[168] The Carter energy legislation was approved by Congress after much deliberation and modification on October 15, 1978. The measure deregulated the sale of natural gas, dropped a longstanding pricing disparity between intra- and interstate gas, and created tax credits to encourage energy conservation and the use of non-fossil fuels.[169] On March 1, 1979, Carter submitted a standby gasoline rationing plan per the request of Congress.[170] On April 5, he delivered an address in which he stressed the urgency of energy conservation and increasing domestic production of energy sources such as coal and solar.[171] During an April 30 news conference, he said it was imperative that the House commerce committee approve the standby gasoline rationing plan and called on Congress to pass the several other standby energy conservation plans he had proposed.[172] On July 15, 1979, Carter delivered a nationally televised address in which he identified what he believed to be a \"crisis of confidence\" among American people,[173] under the advisement of pollster Pat Caddell who believed Americans faced a crisis in confidence from events of the 1960s and 1970s, before his presidency.[174] Some later called this his \"malaise speech\",[173] memorable for mixed reactions[175][176] and his use of rhetoric.[174] The speech's negative reception centered on a view that he did not emphasize his own efforts to address the energy crisis and seemed too reliant on Americans.[177] Carter typically refused to conform to Washington's rules.[178] He avoided phone calls from members of Congress and verbally insulted them. He was unwilling to return political favors. His negativity led to frustration in passing legislation.[179] During a press conference on February 23, 1977, Carter stated that it was \"inevitable\" that he would come into conflict with Congress and added that he had found \"a growing sense of cooperation\" with Congress and met in the past with congressional members of both parties.[180] Carter developed a bitter feeling following an unsuccessful attempt at having Congress enact the scrapping of several water projects,[181] which he had requested during his first 100 days in office and received opposition from members of his party.[182] As a rift ensued between the White House and Congress afterward, Carter noted that the Democratic Party's liberal wing opposed his policies the most ardently, attributing this to Ted Kennedy's wanting the presidency.[183] Thinking he had support from 74 Congressmen, Carter issued a \"hit list\" of 19 projects that he claimed were \"pork barrel\" spending that he said he would veto if they were included in legislation.[184] He found himself again at odds with Congressional Democrats, as House Speaker Tip O'Neill found it inappropriate for a president to pursue what had traditionally been the role of Congress. Carter was also weakened by signing a bill that contained many of the \"hit list\" projects he had intended to veto.[185] In an address to a fundraising dinner for the Democratic National Committee on June 23, 1977, Carter said, \"I think it's good to point out tonight, too, that we have evolved a good working relationship with the Congress. For eight years we had government by partisanship. Now we have government by partnership.\"[186] At a July 28 news conference, assessing the first six months of his presidency, Carter spoke of his improved understanding of Congress: \"I have learned to respect the Congress more in an individual basis. I've been favorably impressed at the high degree of concentrated experience and knowledge that individual members of Congress can bring on a specific subject, where they've been the chairman of a subcommittee or committee for many years and have focused their attention on this particular aspect of government life which I will never be able to do.\"[187] On May 10, 1979, the House voted against giving Carter authority to produce a standby gas rationing plan.[188] The following day, Carter delivered remarks in the Oval Office describing himself as shocked and embarrassed for the American government by the vote and concluding \"the majority of the House Members are unwilling to take the responsibility, the political responsibility for dealing with a potential, serious threat to our Nation.\" He furthered that a majority of House members were placing higher importance on \"local or parochial interests\" and challenged the lower chamber of Congress with composing their own rationing plan in the next 90 days.[189] Carter's remarks were met with criticism by House Republicans, who accused his comments of not befitting the formality a president should have in their public remarks. Others pointed to 106 Democrats voting against his proposal and the bipartisan criticism potentially coming back to haunt him.[190] At the start of a news conference on July 25, 1979, Carter called on believers in the future of the U.S. and his proposed energy program to speak with Congress as it bore the responsibility to impose his proposals.[191] Amid the energy proposal opposition, The New York Times commented that \"as the comments flying up and down Pennsylvania Avenue illustrate, there is also a crisis of confidence between Congress and the President, sense of doubt and distrust that threatens to undermine the President's legislative program and become an important issue in next year's campaign.\"[192] In 1977, Carter appointed Alfred E. Kahn to lead the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). He was part of a push for deregulation of the industry, supported by leading economists, leading think tanks in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the Carter administration, and even some in the airline industry. This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978.[193] Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act into law on October 24, 1978. The main purpose of the act was to remove government control over fares, routes and market entry (of new airlines) from commercial aviation. The Civil Aeronautics Board's powers of regulation were to be phased out, eventually allowing market forces to determine routes and fares. The Act did not remove or diminish the FAA's regulatory powers over all aspects of airline safety.[194] In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell malt, hops, and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the effective 1920 beginning of prohibition in the United States.[195] This deregulation led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s had developed into a strong craft microbrew culture in the United States, with 9,118 microbreweries, brewpubs, and regional craft breweries in the United States by the end of 2021.[196] In the late 1970s, the Chrysler Cooperation—one of the \"Big Three\" automobile manufacturers in the U.S.—faced near-certain bankruptcy as it projected a loss of $1 billion.[197] Carter proposed that the company forgo salary increases and bonuses, implying that it would be done \"without decimating the company or putting it on its knees\", but the company had already frozen wage increases and bonuses months before, to no avail.[198] In December 1979, Congress passed H.R. 5860, the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979, to bail Chrysler out with $3.5 billion (equivalent to $10.9 billion in 2023) in aid.[199] The bill turned over $162 million in stock to Chrysler's workers, eliminated around $125 million in wage increases, and gave Chrysler $500 million in bank loans.[197] Carter signed it into law in January, saying that the bill saved thousands of jobs.[197] During his presidential campaign, Carter embraced healthcare reform akin to the Ted Kennedy-sponsored bipartisan universal national health insurance.[200] Carter's proposals on healthcare while in office included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal,[201] and a June 1979 proposal that provided private health insurance coverage.[202] Carter saw the June 1979 proposal as a continuation of progress in American health coverage. President Harry S. Truman proposed a designation of health care as a basic right of Americans and Medicare and Medicaid were introduced under President Lyndon B. Johnson.[203][204] The April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal was passed in the Senate,[205] but later defeated in the House.[206] During 1978, he met with Kennedy over a compromise healthcare law that proved unsuccessful.[207] He later said Kennedy's disagreements thwarted his plan to provide a comprehensive American health care system.[208] In 1980, Carter signed into law the Mental Health Systems (MHSA) Act, which allocated block grants to states to bolster the establishment and growth of community health services and provided funding to states to create and implement community-based health services. The MHSA was considered landmark legislation in mental health care.[209] By September 1981, the Reagan administration had repealed most of the law.[210] Early into his term, Carter collaborated with Congress to fulfill his campaign promise to create a cabinet level education department. In an address from the White House on February 28, 1978, Carter argued \"Education is far too important a matter to be scattered piecemeal among various government departments and agencies, which are often busy with sometimes dominant concerns.\"[211] On February 8, 1979, the Carter administration released an outline of its plan to establish an education department and asserted enough support for the enactment to occur by June.[212] On October 17, the same year, Carter signed the Department of Education Organization Act into law,[213] establishing the United States Department of Education.[214] Carter expanded the Head Start program with the addition of 43,000 children and families,[215] while the percentage of nondefense dollars spent on education was doubled.[216] Carter was complimentary of the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson and the 89th United States Congress for having initiated Head Start.[217] In a speech on November 1, 1980, Carter stated his administration had extended Head Start to migrant children and was \"working hard right now with Senator Bentsen and with Kika de la Garza to make as much as $45 million available in federal money in the border districts to help with the increase in school construction for the number of Mexican school children who reside here legally\".[218] During Carter's administration, the United States Foreign Service \"lifted its ban on gay and lesbian personnel\". In 1977, Jimmy Carter's administration became the first American presidential administration to invite gay male and lesbian rights activists to the White House to discuss federal policy with regard to ending employment discrimination in federal employment on the basis of sexual orientation and related issues (presidential advisor Midge Costanza having issued the invitation).[219] From the onset of his presidency, Carter attempted to mediate the Arab–Israeli conflict.[220] After a failed attempt to seek a comprehensive settlement between the two nations in 1977 (through reconvening the 1973 Geneva conference),[221] Carter invited the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin to the presidential lodge Camp David in September 1978, in hopes of creating a definitive peace. While the two sides could not agree on Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, the negotiations resulted in Egypt formally recognizing Israel, and the creation of an elected government in the West Bank and Gaza. This resulted in the Camp David Accords, which ended the war between Israel and Egypt.[222] The accords were a source of great domestic opposition in both Egypt and Israel. Historian Jørgen Jensehaugen argues that by the time Carter left office in January 1981, he was \"in an odd position—he had attempted to break with traditional U.S. policy but ended up fulfilling the goals of that tradition, which had been to break up the Arab alliance, sideline the Palestinians, build an alliance with Egypt, weaken the Soviet Union and secure Israel.\"[223] In an address to the African officials at the United Nations on October 4, 1977, Carter stated the U.S.'s interest to \"see a strong, vigorous, free, and prosperous Africa with as much of the control of government as possible in the hands of the residents of your countries\" and pointed to their unified efforts on \"the problem of how to resolve the Rhodesian, Zimbabwe question.\"[224] At a news conference later that month, Carter outlined that the U.S. wanted to \"work harmoniously with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe in particular\", as well as do away with racial issues such as apartheid, and for equal opportunities in other facets of society in the region.[225] Carter visited Nigeria from March 31 to April 3, 1978, to improve relations;[226] the first U.S. president to do so.[227] He reiterated interest in convening a peace conference on Rhodesia that involved all parties and said the U.S. was moving as it could.[228] The elections of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister of the United Kingdom[229] and Abel Muzorewa for Prime Minister of Zimbabwe Rhodesia,[230] South Africa turning down a plan for South West Africa's independence, and domestic opposition in Congress were seen as a heavy blow to the Carter administration's policy toward South Africa.[231] On May 16, 1979, the Senate voted in favor of lifting economic sanctions against Rhodesia, seen by some Rhodesians and South Africans as a potentially fatal blow to joint diplomacy efforts the United States and Britain had pursued in the region for three years and any compromise between the Salisbury leaders and guerrillas.[232] On December 3, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance promised Senator Jesse Helms that when the British governor arrived in Salisbury to implement an agreed Lancaster House settlement and the electoral process began, the President would take prompt action to lift sanctions against Zimbabwe Rhodesia.[233] Carter sought closer relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC), continuing the Nixon administration's drastic policy of rapprochement. The two countries increasingly collaborated against the Soviet Union, and the Carter administration tacitly consented to the Chinese invasion of Vietnam. In December 1978, he announced the United States' intention to formally recognize and establish full diplomatic relations with the PRC starting on January 1, 1979, while severing ties with Taiwan, including revoking a mutual defense treaty with the latter.[234][235] In 1979, Carter extended formal diplomatic recognition to the PRC for the first time. This decision led to a boom in trade between the United States and the PRC, which was pursuing economic reforms under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.[236] After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Carter allowed the sale of military supplies to China and began negotiations to share military intelligence.[237] In January 1980, Carter unilaterally revoked the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic of China (ROC), which had lost control of mainland China to the PRC in 1949, but retained control of the island of Taiwan. Conservative Republicans challenged Carter's abrogation of the treaty in court, but the Supreme Court ruled that the issue was a non-justiciable political question in Goldwater v. Carter. The U.S. continued to maintain diplomatic contacts with the ROC through the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act.[238] During Carter's presidency, the U.S. continued to support Indonesia as a cold war ally, despite human rights violations in East Timor. The violations followed Indonesia's December 1975 invasion and occupation of East Timor. Under Carter's administration military assistance to Indonesia increased, peaking in 1978.[239][240] This was antithetical to Carter's stated policy of \"not selling weapons if it would exacerbate a potential conflict in a region of the world\".[241][242] During a news conference on March 9, 1977, Carter reaffirmed his interest in having a gradual withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and said he wanted South Korea to eventually have \"adequate ground forces owned by and controlled by the South Korean government to protect themselves against any intrusion from North Korea.\"[243] On May 19, The Washington Post quoted Chief of Staff of U.S. forces in South Korea John K. Singlaub as criticizing Carter's withdrawal of troops from the Korean peninsula. Later that day, Press Secretary Rex Granum announced that Carter had summoned Singlaub to the White House, and confirmed that Carter had seen the Washington Post article.[244] Carter relieved Singlaub of his duties on May 21 after a meeting between the two.[245][246] During a news conference on May 26, 1977, Carter said South Korea could defend itself with reduced American troops in case of conflict.[247] From June 30 to July 1, 1979, Carter held meetings with president of South Korea Park Chung Hee at the Blue House for a discussion on relations between the U.S. and South Korea as well as Carter's interest in preserving his policy of worldwide tension reduction.[248] On April 21, 1978, Carter announced a reduction in American troops in South Korea scheduled to be released by the end of the year by two-thirds, citing lack of action by Congress in regard to a compensatory aid package for the South Korean government.[249] On November 15, 1977, Carter pledged that his administration would continue positive relations between the U.S. and Iran, calling its contemporary status \"strong, stable and progressive\".[250] On December 31, 1977, he called Iran under the Shah an \"island of stability\" made possible by the \"admiration and love your people give to [the Shah]\".[251][252] Carter praised the Shah's \"great leadership\" and spoke of \"personal friendship\" between them.[253] American support for the unpopular Shah increased anti-American sentiment in Iran, which intensified after the Shah, who was dying of cancer, left Iran for the last time in January 1979 and Carter allowed him to be admitted to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York on October 22, 1979.[254] On November 4, 1979, a group of Iranian students took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The students belonged to the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line and supported the Iranian Revolution.[255] Fifty-two American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for the next 444 days. They were freed immediately after Ronald Reagan succeeded Carter as president on January 20, 1981. During the crisis, Carter remained in isolation in the White House for more than 100 days, until he left to participate in the lighting of the National Menorah on the Ellipse.[256] A month into the affair, Carter announced his commitment to resolving the dispute without \"any military action that would cause bloodshed or arouse the unstable captors of our hostages to attack them or to punish them\".[257] On April 7, 1980, he issued Executive Order 12205, imposing economic sanctions against Iran,[258] and announced further government measures he deemed necessary to ensure a safe release.[259][260] On April 24, 1980, Carter ordered Operation Eagle Claw to try to free the hostages. The mission failed, leaving eight American servicemen dead and two aircraft destroyed.[261][262] The failure led Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, who had opposed the mission, to resign.[263] Released in 2017, a declassified memo produced by the CIA in 1980 concluded \"Iranian hardliners—especially Ayatollah Khomeini\" were \"determined to exploit the hostage issue to bring about President Carter's defeat in the November elections.\" Additionally, Tehran in 1980 wanted \"the world to believe that Imam Khomeini caused President Carter's downfall and disgrace.\"[264] On February 8, 1977, Carter said he had urged the Soviet Union to align with the U.S. in forming \"a comprehensive test ban to stop all nuclear testing for at least an extended period of time\", and that he was in favor of the Soviet Union ceasing deployment of the RSD-10 Pioneer.[265] During a June 13 press conference, he said that at the beginning of the week, the U.S. would \"work closely with the Soviet Union on a comprehensive test ban treaty to prohibit all testing of nuclear devices underground or in the atmosphere\", and Paul Warnke would negotiate demilitarization of the Indian Ocean with the Soviet Union beginning the following week.[266] At a December 30 news conference, Carter said that during \"the last few months, the United States and the Soviet Union have made great progress in dealing with a long list of important issues, the most important of which is to control the deployment of strategic nuclear weapons\", and that the two countries sought to conclude SALT II talks by the spring of the next year.[267] The talk of a comprehensive test ban treaty materialized with the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II by Carter and Leonid Brezhnev on June 18, 1979.[268][269] In 1979, the Soviets intervened in the Second Yemenite War. The Soviet backing of South Yemen constituted a \"smaller shock\", in tandem with tensions that were rising due to the Iranian Revolution. This played a role in making Carter's stance on the Soviet Union more assertive, a shift that finalized with the impending Soviet-Afghan War.[270] In his 1980 State of the Union Address, Carter emphasized the significance of relations between the two regions: \"Now, as during the last 3½ decades, the relationship between our country, the United States of America, and the Soviet Union is the most critical factor in determining whether the world will live at peace or be engulfed in global conflict.\"[271] Communists under the leadership of Nur Muhammad Taraki seized power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978.[272] The new regime signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union in December of that year.[272][273] Due to the regime's improvement of secular education and redistribution of land coinciding with mass executions and political oppression, Taraki was deposed by rival Hafizullah Amin in September.[272][273][274] Amin was considered a \"brutal psychopath\" by foreign observers and had lost control of much of the country, prompting the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan on December 24, 1979, execute Amin, and install Babrak Karmal as president.[272][273] In the West, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was considered a threat to global security and the oil supplies of the Persian Gulf, as well as the existence of Pakistan.[273][275] These concerns led Carter to expand collaboration between the CIA and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which had begun in July 1979, when the CIA started providing $695,000 worth of non-lethal assistance (e.g., \"cash, medical equipment, and radio transmitters\") to the Afghan mujahideen.[276] The modest scope of this early collaboration was likely influenced by the understanding, later recounted by CIA official Robert Gates, \"that a substantial U.S. covert aid program\" might have \"raise[d] the stakes\", thereby causing \"the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended.\"[275][277] According to a 2020 review of declassified U.S. documents by Conor Tobin in the journal Diplomatic History: \"The primary significance of this small-scale aid was in creating constructive links with dissidents through Pakistan's ISI that could be utilized in the case of an overt Soviet intervention ... The small-scale covert program that developed in response to the increasing Soviet influence was part of a contingency plan if the Soviets did intervene militarily, as Washington would be in a better position to make it difficult for them to consolidate their position, but not designed to induce an intervention.\"[276] On December 28, 1979, Carter signed a presidential finding explicitly allowing the CIA to transfer \"lethal military equipment either directly or through third countries to the Afghan opponents of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan\" and to arrange \"selective training, conducted outside of Afghanistan, in the use of such equipment either directly or via third country intermediation.\"[276] His finding defined the CIA's mission as \"harassment\" of Soviet troops; at the time, \"this was not a war the CIA expected to win outright on the battlefield,\" in the words of Steve Coll.[278] Carter was determined to respond harshly to what he considered a dangerous provocation. In a televised speech on January 23, 1980, he announced sanctions on the Soviet Union, promised renewed aid and registration to Pakistan and the Selective Service System, and committed the U.S. to the Persian Gulf's defense.[275][277][279][280] Carter imposed an embargo on grain shipments to the USSR, tabled SALT II, requested a 5% annual increase in defense spending,[281][282] and called for a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which was ultimately joined by 65 other nations.[283][284][285] British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher enthusiastically backed Carter's tough stance.[275] National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski played a major role in organizing Carter's policies on the Soviet Union as a grand strategy.[286] In early 1980, Carter determined the thrust of U.S. policy for the duration of the war: he initiated a program to arm the mujahideen through Pakistan's ISI and secured a pledge from Saudi Arabia to match U.S. funding for this purpose. Despite huge expenditure, the Soviet Union was unable to quell the insurgency and withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 amid the economic, political, and social turmoil within the USSR, precipitating its collapse two years later.[287][275] The routing of U.S. aid through Pakistan led to some controversy, as weapons sent to Karachi were frequently controlled by Pakistan, whose government influenced which rebels received assistance. Despite this, Carter has expressed no regret over his decision to support what he still considers the Afghan freedom fighters.[275] Carter made twelve international trips to 25 countries as president.[288] He was the first president to make a state visit to Sub-Saharan Africa when he went to Nigeria in 1978.[227] His travel also included trips to Europe, Asia, and Latin America. He made several trips to the Middle East to broker peace negotiations. His visit to Iran from December 31, 1977, to January 1, 1978, took place less than a year before the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.[289] The September 21, 1977, resignation of Bert Lance, who was director of the office of management and budget in the Carter administration, came amid allegations of improper banking activities before his tenure and was an embarrassment to Carter.[290] Carter became the first sitting president to testify under oath as part of an investigation of him,[291][292] as a result of United States Attorney General Griffin Bell appointing Paul J. Curran as a special counsel to investigate loans made to the peanut business Carter owned by a bank controlled by Lance and Curran's position as special counsel not allowing him to file charges on his own.[293][d] Curran announced in October 1979 that no evidence had been found to support allegations that funds loaned from the National Bank of Georgia had been diverted to Carter's 1976 presidential campaign, ending the investigation.[294] Carter's reelection campaign was based primarily on attacking Ronald Reagan. The campaign frequently pointed out and mocked Reagan's proclivity for gaffes, using his age and perceived lack of connection to his native California voter base against him.[295] Later, the campaign used similar rhetoric as Lyndon Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign, portraying Reagan as a warmonger who could not be trusted with the nuclear arsenal.[296] Carter attempted to deny the Reagan campaign $29.4 million (equivalent to $91 million in 2023) in campaign funds, due to dependent conservative groups already raising $60 million to get him elected—an amount that exceeded the limit of campaign funds. Carter's attempt was later denied by the Federal Election Commission.[297] Carter announced his reelection campaign in December 1979.[298] A month earlier, Senator Ted Kennedy had announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination.[299] During the Democratic presidential primaries, questions about Kennedy were a frequent subject of Carter's press conferences.[300][301] Despite winning key states such as California and New York, Kennedy surprised his supporters by running a weak campaign. Carter won most of the primaries and secured renomination. He later wrote that the strongest opposition to his policies came from the Democratic Party's liberal wing, which he attributed to Kennedy's ambition to replace him as president.[302] Kennedy had mobilized the liberal wing, which weakened Carter's support in the general election.[303] Carter and Mondale were formally nominated at the 1980 Democratic National Convention in New York City.[304] Carter delivered a speech notable for its tribute to the late Hubert Humphrey, whom he initially called \"Hubert Horatio Hornblower\",[305] and Kennedy made \"The Dream Shall Never Die\" speech, in which he criticized Reagan and did not endorse Carter.[306] Along with Reagan and Kennedy, Carter was opposed by centrist John B. Anderson, who had previously contested the Republican presidential primaries, and upon losing to Reagan, reentered the race as an independent. Anderson advertised himself as a more liberal alternative to Reagan's conservatism.[307] As the campaign went on, Anderson's polling numbers dropped and his base was gradually pulled to Carter or Reagan.[308] Carter hasd to run against his own \"stagflation\"-ridden economy, while the hostage crisis in Iran dominated the news every week. He was attacked by conservatives for failing to \"prevent Soviet gains\" in less-developed countries, as pro-Soviet governments had taken power in countries including Angola, Ethiopia, Nicaragua and Afghanistan.[309] His brother, Billy Carter, caused controversy due to his association with Muammar Gaddafi's regime in Libya.[310] Carter alienated many liberal college students, who were expected to be one of his strongest support bases, by reactivating the Selective Service System on July 2, 1980, reinstating registration for the military draft. His campaign manager and former appointments secretary, Timothy Kraft, stepped down five weeks before the general election amid what turned out to be an uncorroborated allegation of cocaine use.[311] On October 28, Carter and Reagan participated in the sole presidential debate of the election cycle in which they were both present, due to Carter refusing to participate in debates that included Anderson.[312] Though initially trailing Carter by several points,[313] Reagan experienced a surge in polling after the debate.[314] This was in part influenced by Reagan deploying the phrase \"There you go again\", which became the election's defining phrase.[315] It was later discovered that in the final days of the campaign, Reagan's team acquired classified documents Carter used to prepare for the debate.[316] Reagan defeated Carter in a landslide, winning 489 electoral votes. The Senate went Republican for the first time since 1952.[317] In his concession speech, Carter admitted that he was hurt by the outcome of the election but pledged \"a very fine transition period\" with President-elect Reagan.[318] Shortly after losing reelection, Carter told the White House press corps that he intended to emulate the retirement of Harry S. Truman and not use his subsequent public life to enrich himself.[319] Diplomacy was a large part of Carter's post-presidency. These diplomatic efforts began in the Middle East, with a September 1981 meeting with prime minister of Israel Menachem Begin,[320] and a March 1983 tour of Egypt that included meeting with members of the Palestine Liberation Organization.[321] In 1994, president Bill Clinton sought Carter's assistance in a North Korea peace mission, during which Carter negotiated an understanding with Kim Il Sung.[322][323] Carter outlined a treaty with Kim, which he announced to CNN without the Clinton administration's consent to spur American action.[324] In March 1999, Carter visited Taiwan and met with President Lee Teng-hui. During the meeting, Carter praised the progress Taiwan made in democracy, human rights, economy, culture, science and technology.[325] In 2003, Carter championed a plan to hold elections in Venezuela amid protests aimed at doing so.[326] Ultimately, no elections were held. In 2006, Carter stated his disagreements with Israel's domestic and foreign policy while saying he supported the country,[327][328] extending his criticisms to Israel's policies in Lebanon, the West Bank, and Gaza.[329] In July 2007, Carter joined Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg, South Africa, to announce his participation in The Elders, a group of independent global leaders who work together on peace and human rights issues.[330][331] After the announcement, Carter participated in visits to Darfur,[332] Sudan,[333][334] Cyprus, the Korean Peninsula, and the Middle East, among others.[335] He attempted to travel to Zimbabwe in November 2008, but was stopped by President Robert Mugabe's government.[336] In December 2008, Carter met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,[337][338] and in a June 2012 call with Jeffery Brown, stressed that Egyptian military generals could take full executive and legislative power to form a new constitution favoring themselves if their announced intentions came true.[339] On August 10, 2010, Carter traveled to North Korea to secure the release of Aijalon Gomes, successfully negotiating his release.[340][341] Throughout the latter part of 2017, as tensions between the U.S. and North Korea persisted, Carter recommended a peace treaty between the two nations,[342] and confirmed he had offered himself to the Trump administration as a willing candidate to be diplomatic envoy to North Korea.[343] Carter began his first year out of office with a pledge not to critique the Reagan administration, saying it was \"too early\".[344] He sided with Reagan on issues like building neutron arms after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,[345] but frequently spoke out against his administration, denouncing many of its actions in the Middle East;[346] in 1987, Carter said that Reagan was incapable of preserving peace in the Middle East.[347] He condemned the handling of the Sabra and Shatila massacre,[348] the lack of efforts to rescue and retrieve four American businessmen from West Beirut in 1984,[349] Reagan's support of the Strategic Defense Initiative in 1985,[350] and his claim of an international conspiracy on terrorism.[351] In 1987 he criticized Reagan for conceding to terrorist demands,[352] nominating Robert Bork for the Supreme Court,[353] and his handling of the Persian Gulf crisis.[354] On January 16, 1989, before the inauguration of George H. W. Bush, Carter told Gerald Ford that Reagan had experienced a media honeymoon, saying that he believed Reagan's immediate successor would be less fortunate.[355] Carter had a mostly poor relationship with Bill Clinton, who snubbed him from his inauguration ceremony. He doubted the morality of the Clinton administration, particularly with respect to the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the pardon of Marc Rich.[356] In July 2001, Carter said he was \"disappointed in almost everything\" President George W. Bush had done, but after the September 11 attacks, he offered only praise, calling on Americans to support Bush with \"complete unity\".[357] Later, Carter opposed the Iraq War[358] and what he considered an attempt by Bush and Tony Blair to oust Saddam Hussein with \"lies and misinterpretations\".[359] In 2004, Carter said that he believed Bush exploited the September 11 attacks and blamed the media for not criticizing him.[360] In 2007, Carter said the Bush administration \"has been the worst in history\" on foreign affairs;[361] he later said he was just comparing Bush's tenure to Nixon's.[362] Tony Fratto responded to Carter's comments on the Bush administration's behalf by saying that the comments increased Carter's irrelevance.[363] By the end of Bush's second term, Carter considered Bush's tenure disappointing, as he told Forward Magazine of Syria.[364] Though he praised President Barack Obama in the early part of his tenure,[365] Carter stated his disagreement with using drone strikes against suspected terrorists, Obama's choice to keep Guantanamo Bay detention camp open,[366] and the federal surveillance programs Edward Snowden revealed.[367][368] During Donald Trump's presidency, Carter spoke favorably of the chance for immigration reform[369] and criticized Trump for his handling of the U.S. national anthem protests.[370] In October 2017, he defended Trump in an interview with The New York Times, criticizing the media's coverage of him as harsher \"than any other president certainly that I've known about\".[371][372] In 2019, Trump called Carter and expressed concern that China was \"getting ahead\" of the United States. Carter agreed, saying that China's strength came from its lack of involvement in armed conflict and calling the U.S. \"the most warlike nation in the history of the world.\"[373] Carter was considered a potential candidate in the 1984 presidential election,[374][375] but did not run and instead endorsed Walter Mondale for the Democratic nomination.[376][377] After Mondale secured the nomination, Carter critiqued the Reagan campaign,[378] spoke at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, and advised Mondale.[379] After the election, in which Reagan defeated Mondale, Carter said the loss was predictable because Mondale's platform included raising taxes.[380] In the 1988 presidential election, Carter ruled himself out as a candidate and predicted Vice President George H. W. Bush would be the Republican nominee.[381] Carter foresaw unity at the 1988 Democratic National Convention,[382] where he delivered an address.[383] After the election, which Bush won, Carter said Bush would have a more difficult presidency than Reagan because he was not as popular.[384] During the 1992 presidential election, Carter met with Senator Paul Tsongas, who sought his advice.[385] Carter spoke favorably of former governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton,[386] and criticized Ross Perot, a Texas billionaire who was running as an independent.[387] As the primary concluded, Carter spoke of the need for the 1992 Democratic National Convention to address certain issues not focused on in the past,[388] and campaigned for Clinton after he became the Democratic nominee,[389] publicly stating his expectation to be consulted during Clinton's presidency.[390] Carter endorsed Vice President Al Gore days before the 2000 presidential election,[391] and in subsequent years voiced his opinion that Gore won the election,[392] despite Bush's eventual victory following the Supreme Court's ruling in Bush v. Gore.[393] In the 2004 presidential election, Carter endorsed John Kerry and spoke at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.[394] He also voiced concern about another voting mishap in Florida.[395] During the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, it was speculated that Carter would endorse Barack Obama over his main primary rival Hillary Clinton, as Carter spoke favorably of Obama, as did other members of the Carter family.[396][397] Carter also commented on Clinton ending her bid when superdelegates voted after the June 3 primary.[398] Carter criticized the Republican nominee, John McCain.[399][400] Carter warned Obama against selecting Clinton as his running mate.[401] Carter endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination during the primary season of the 2012 presidential election, though he clarified that his backing of Romney was due to him considering the former Massachusetts governor the candidate that could best assure a victory for President Obama.[402] Carter delivered a videotape address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.[403] Carter was critical of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump shortly after the latter entered the primary, predicting that he would lose.[404][405] As the primary continued, Carter said he would prefer Trump to his main rival, Ted Cruz,[406] though he rebuked the Trump campaign in remarks during the primary[407] and in his address to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Carter believed that Trump would not have been elected without Russia's interference in the 2016 election,[408] and \"that Trump didn't actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election, and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.\" When questioned, he agreed that Trump is an \"illegitimate president\".[409][410] In a 2017 discussion with Senator Bernie Sanders, Carter revealed he voted for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries.[411] Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter delivered a recorded audio message endorsing Joe Biden for the virtual 2020 Democratic National Convention. On January 6, 2021, following the U.S. Capitol attack, along with the other three still living former presidents, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton,[412] Jimmy Carter denounced the attack, releasing a statement saying that he and his wife were \"troubled\" by the events, also stating that what had occurred was \"a national tragedy and is not who we are as a nation\", and adding that \"having observed elections in troubled democracies worldwide, I know that we the people can unite to walk back from this precipice to peacefully uphold the laws of our nation\".[413] Carter delivered a recorded audio message for the inauguration of Joe Biden on January 20, 2021, as the Carters were unable to attend the ceremony in person.[414] In November 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overruled a three-judge panel of the court and scheduled a rehearing of the case against the Trump administration-proposed land swap in Alaska to allow a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. In an unusual action, Carter had filed an opinion in support of the suit by environmental groups, saying the swap violated the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Anilca) passed in 1980 near the end of Carter's term. Carter said the act \"may be the most significant domestic achievement of my political life\" at the time of his filing.[415] In August 2024, Carter's son Chip said his father wanted to live to 100 to vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.[416] He achieved this on October 16, the second day of early voting in Georgia.[417][418] Carter criticized the Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina,[419] and built homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.[420] He also partnered with former presidents to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities,[421] in addition to writing op-eds about the goodness seen in Americans who assist each other during natural disasters.[422] In 1982, Carter founded the Carter Center,[423] a non-governmental and non-profit organization with the purpose of advancing human rights and alleviating human suffering,[424] including helping improve the quality of life for people in more than 80 countries.[425] Among these efforts has been the contribution of the Carter Center working alongside the World Health Organization to the near-eradication of dracunculiasis, also called Guinea worm disease. The incidence of this disease has decreased from 3.5 million cases in the mid-1980s, to 25 cases in 2016,[426][427] and four in the first seven months of 2024, according to the Carter Center's statistics.[428] Carter attended the dedication of his presidential library[429] and those of Presidents Ronald Reagan,[430] George H. W. Bush,[431] Bill Clinton,[432][433] and George W. Bush.[434] He delivered eulogies at the funerals of Coretta Scott King,[435] Gerald Ford,[436][437] and Theodore Hesburgh.[438] In 2007, Carter founded the New Baptist Covenant organization for social justice.[439][440] As of August 2019[update], Carter was Honorary Chair for the World Justice Project[441] and formerly served as one for the Continuity of Government Commission.[442] He continued to occasionally teach Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church as of 2019.[443] Carter also taught at Emory University in Atlanta, and in June 2019 was awarded tenure for 37 years of service.[444] Carter's Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, a New York Times Best Seller book, published in 2006, generated controversy for characterizing Israel's policies in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as amounting to apartheid.[445] In an interview, Carter defined apartheid as the \"forced separation of two peoples in the same territory with one of the groups dominating or controlling the other.\"[446] In remarks broadcast over radio, he said that Israel's policies amounted to an apartheid worse than South Africa's:[447] When Israel does occupy this territory deep within the West Bank, and connects the 200-or-so settlements with each other, with a road, and then prohibits the Palestinians from using that road, or in many cases even crossing the road, this perpetrates even worse instances of apartness, or apartheid, than we witnessed even in South Africa.[447] Carter defended himself against accusations of antisemitism by saying \"the hope is that my book will at least stimulate a debate, which has not existed in this country. There's never been any debate on this issue, of any significance.\"[447] He expressed his opinion that Israel will not have peace until it agrees to withdraw from the occupied territories, adding, \"the greatest commitment in my life has been trying to bring peace to Israel.\"[447] In his 2010 book We Can Have Peace in the Holy Land, Carter cites Israel's unwillingness to withdraw from the territories and settlement expansion as the primary obstacle to peace in the Middle East.[448] The Carter family experienced another family peanut business dilemma when it accumulated a one-million-dollar debt in 1981. Former President Carter began writing books to pay off this debt. As of July 2019, he had \"published more than 30, from a children's book to reflections on his presidency\".[449] Carter's hobbies included painting,[450] fly fishing, woodworking, cycling, tennis, and skiing.[451] He also had an interest in poetry, particularly the works of Dylan Thomas.[452] During a state visit to the UK in 1977, Carter suggested that Thomas should have a memorial in Poets' Corner at Westminster Abbey;[453] this later came to fruition in 1982.[452][454] Carter was a personal friend of Elvis Presley, whom he and Rosalynn met on June 30, 1973, before Presley was to perform onstage in Atlanta.[455] They remained in contact by telephone two months before Presley's sudden death in August 1977. Carter later recalled an abrupt phone call received in June 1977 from Presley who sought a presidential pardon from Carter, to help George Klein's criminal case; at the time Klein had been indicted for only mail fraud, and was later found guilty of conspiracy.[456][457] According to Carter, Presley was almost incoherent because of barbiturates; although he phoned the White House several times again, this was the last time they spoke.[458] The day after Presley's death, Carter issued a statement and explained how he had \"changed the face of American popular culture\".[459] Carter filed a report with both the International UFO Bureau and the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena,[460] stating that he sighted an unidentified flying object in October 1969.[461][462][463] From a young age, Carter showed a deep commitment to evangelical Christianity.[464][465] Carter taught Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia.[466] At a private inauguration worship service, the preacher was Nelson Price, the pastor of Roswell Street Baptist Church of Marietta, Georgia.[467] An evangelical Christian, Carter appealed to voters after the scandals of the Nixon Administration, and is credited with popularizing the term \"born again\" into American lexicon during the 1976 American presidential campaign.[465][468][469][470] As president, Carter prayed several times a day, and professed that Jesus was the driving force in his life. He was greatly influenced by a sermon he had heard as a young man that asked: \"If you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?\"[471] In 2000, after the Southern Baptist Convention announced it would no longer permit women to become pastors, he renounced his membership, saying: \"I personally feel that women should play an absolutely equal role in service of Christ in the church.\"[472] He remained a member of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship.[464] Carter's support for the Equal Rights Amendment[473] led many evangelical conservatives to leave the Democratic Party, contributing to the development of the Christian right in American politics.[474] Carter had three younger siblings, all of whom died of pancreatic cancer: sisters Gloria Spann (1926–1990) and Ruth Stapleton (1929–1983), and brother Billy Carter (1937–1988).[475] He was first cousin to politician Hugh Carter and a distant cousin to the Carter family of musicians.[476] He was related to Motown founder Berry Gordy by way of their white great-grandfather James Thomas Gordy, who fathered a child with a black woman he enslaved.[477] Carter married Rosalynn Smith on July 7, 1946, in the Plains Methodist Church, the church of Rosalynn's family.[478] They had three sons, Jack, James III \"Chip\", and Donnel; one daughter, Amy; nine grandsons (one of whom is deceased), three granddaughters, five great-grandsons, and eight great-granddaughters.[479] Mary Prince (an African American woman wrongly convicted of murder, and later pardoned) was their daughter Amy's nanny for most of the period from 1971 until Jimmy Carter's presidency ended.[480][481][482] Carter had asked to be designated as her parole officer, thus helping to enable her to work in the White House.[481][e] The Carters celebrated their 77th anniversary on July 7, 2023. On October 19, 2019, they became the longest-wed presidential couple, having overtaken George and Barbara Bush at 26,765 days.[485] After Rosalynn's death on November 19, 2023, Carter released the following statement: Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished. She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.[486] The Carters' eldest son, Jack Carter, was the 2006 Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in Nevada and lost to Republican incumbent John Ensign. Jack's son Jason Carter is a former Georgia state senator,[487] and in 2014 was the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia, losing to the Republican incumbent, Nathan Deal. On December 20, 2015, while teaching a Sunday school class, Carter announced that his 28-year-old grandson Jeremy Carter had died of unspecified causes.[488] On August 3, 2015, Carter underwent an elective surgery to remove a small mass on his liver, and his prognosis for a full recovery was initially said to be excellent. On August 12, he announced he had been diagnosed with cancer that had metastasized, without specifying where the cancer had originated.[489] On August 20, Carter disclosed that melanoma had been found in his brain and liver, and that he had begun treatment with the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and was about to start radiation therapy. His healthcare was managed by Emory Healthcare of Atlanta. His family history of cancer includes both of his parents and all three of his siblings.[490] On December 5, he announced that his medical scans no longer showed any cancer.[491] Carter broke his hip in a fall at his Plains home on May 13, 2019, and underwent surgery the same day at the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Georgia.[492] On October 6, an injury above his left eyebrow received in another fall at home required 14 stitches[493] and resulted in a black eye.[494] On October 21, Carter was admitted to the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center after sustaining a minor pelvic fracture from falling at home for the third time in 2019.[495] He was able to resume teaching Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church on November 3.[496][497] On November 11, 2019, Carter was hospitalized at the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta for a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain caused by bleeding connected with his falls.[498][499] He was released from the hospital on November 27.[500][498] On December 2, 2019, Carter was readmitted to the hospital for a urinary tract infection. He was released on December 4.[501][502] On February 18, 2023, the Carter Center announced that following a \"series of short hospital stays\", Carter decided to \"spend his remaining time at home with his family\" in Plains to \"receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention\"[503][504] for an unspecified illness.[505][506] At 100 years old, Carter was the longest-lived former U.S. president, a title he held until his passing.[507] He was the earliest-serving living former president since Gerald Ford's death in 2006. In 2012, he surpassed Herbert Hoover as the longest-retired president. In 2017 and 2021, Carter became the first president to live to the 40th anniversary of his inauguration and post-presidency respectively. In 2017, Carter, then 92, became the oldest former president ever to attend an American presidential inauguration.[508][509] On March 22, 2019, he became the longest-lived US president, surpassing George H. W. Bush, who died a few months earlier at the age of 94 years, 171 days.[510] He said in a 2019 interview with People that he never expected to live as long as he had and that the best explanation for longevity was a good marriage.[511] Carter entered hospice care six months before celebrating his 99th birthday at his home.[512] The Carter Center announced Jimmy Carter 100: A Celebration in Song, an event concert to celebrate Carter's 100th birthday that featured appearances by musicians and celebrities. The event took place on September 17, 2024, at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia.[513] On October 1, 2024, Carter turned 100, the first president to do so.[514] Local events to celebrate his birthday included a F-18 Super Hornet flyover formation by eight Navy pilots from Naval Air Station Oceana, which Carter viewed from his backyard, and a naturalization ceremony for 100 new citizens at Plains High School, which Chip Carter attended.[515][516] Carter made arrangements to be buried in front of his home at 209 Woodland Drive in Plains. In 2006, he said that a funeral in Washington, D.C., with visitation at the Carter Center, was also planned.[517] Carter asked President Biden to deliver his eulogy.[518] Carter died at his home in Plains, Georgia, on December 29, 2024, at the age of 100. His son, James E. Carter III, announced his death that afternoon.[519][520][521] This followed his February 2023 decision to enter hospice care.[522] Shortly after the announcement, President Joe Biden released a statement honoring Carter's legacy, calling him a \"man of principle, faith, and humility.\" The Biden administration also announced plans to hold an official state funeral.[523] When Carter left office in 1981, scholars and even many Democrats viewed his presidency as a failure.[524][525][526][527] Betty Glad, a political scientist at the University of Illinois, summarized the public consensus on Carter: \"he didn't have a well-developed political philosophy and gave people a feeling he didn't quite know where he was headed.\"[528] Historians have ranked Carter's presidency as below average.[529][530] After leaving office, he told allies he predicted history would be kinder to him than voters were in the 1980 election.[528] In a 1982 Chicago Tribune survey, when 49 historians and scholars were asked to rank the best and worst U.S. presidents, Carter was ranked the tenth worst.[531] In 2006, conservative British historian Andrew Roberts ranked Carter the worst U.S. president.[532] Yet some of Carter's policy accomplishments have been more favorably received.[533] The 2009 documentary Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace credits Carter's efforts at Camp David, which brought peace between Israel and Egypt, with bringing the only meaningful peace to the Middle East.[534][535] Stuart E. Eizenstat, who served as Carter's chief White House domestic policy adviser, wrote, \"Carter's accomplishments at home and abroad were more extensive and longer lasting than those of almost all modern presidents.\"[536] While historians generally consider Carter a below-average president, his post-presidency activities have been universally praised, including his peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts.[529][530] The Independent wrote in 2009, \"Carter is widely considered a better man than he was a president.\"[537] In exit polls from the 1976 presidential election, many voters still held Ford's pardon of Nixon in 1974 against him.[538] By comparison, Carter was viewed as a sincere, honest, and well-meaning southerner.[537] During his presidency, polls generally showed that most Americans saw Carter as likable and \"a man of high moral principles\".[539] In the 1980 election, Reagan projected an easy self-confidence, in contrast to Carter's serious and introspective temperament. Carter was portrayed as more pessimistic and indecisive than Reagan, who was known for his charm and delegation of tasks to subordinates.[540] Reagan used the economic issues, the Iran hostage crisis, and the lack of Washington cooperation to portray Carter as a weak and ineffectual leader. Carter was the first elected incumbent president since Herbert Hoover in 1932 to lose a reelection bid.[541] Carter began his presidency with an approval rating between 66% and 75%.[542][543] He maintained approval ratings above 50% until March 1978,[543] and the following month his approval rating fell to 39%,[544] primarily due to the declining economy.[545] His ratings briefly rebounded after the Camp David Accords in late 1978[546] but dipped during the 1979 energy crisis and got as low as 28% in July 1979.[547] At the beginning of the Iran hostage crisis, his approval rating surged to 61%, up 23 points from his pre-crisis rating.[548] Polls also found that up to 77% of Americans approved of Carter's initial response to the crisis,[548] but by June 1980, amid heated criticism from across the political spectrum[549] for his failure to free the hostages, his approval rating slumped to 33%; that same month Reagan surpassed Carter in pre-1980 election polling.[550] As Carter was leaving office, a Gallup poll found that 48% of Americans thought he had been an \"average\" or \"above average\" president, 46% said he had been \"below average\" or \"poor\", and only 3% thought he had been \"outstanding\".[551] His average approval rating during his entire presidency was 46%,[552][553] and he left office as one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents in history.[554] In a 1990 Gallup survey, 45% of respondents said they approved of the overall job Carter did as president, leaving only Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson with lower ratings.[555] In a 2006 poll, 61% of respondents said they approved of the job Carter did as president, his highest rating since 1979.[556] The next year, a Gallup survey found that 69% of respondents had a favorable opinion of Carter.[557] Carter received the American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award in 1984.[144] The Jimmy Carter Library and Museum was opened in 1986.[558] The following year, the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park was established as a National Historic Site[559] and in 2021, renamed as a national historical park.[560] In 1991, Carter was made an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa at Kansas State University,[561] and was elected to the American Philosophical Society.[562] In 1998, the U.S. Navy named the third and final Seawolf-class submarine USS Jimmy Carter, honoring Carter and his service as a submarine officer.[563] Carter received the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights, given in honor of human rights achievements,[564] and the Hoover Medal, recognizing engineers who have contributed to global causes.[565] Carter's 2002 Nobel Peace Prize[566] was partially a response to president George W. Bush's threats of war against Iraq and Carter's criticism of the Bush administration.[567] In 2009, the Souther Field Airport in Americus, Georgia, was renamed Jimmy Carter Regional Airport.[568] In November 2024, Carter received his 10th nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for audio recordings of his books. He has won three times—for Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis (2007), A Full Life: Reflections at 90 (2016), and Faith: A Journey For All (2018).[569][570][571][572][573][574] On February 21, 2024, the White House Historical Association unveiled its official 2024 White House Christmas ornament honoring Carter's naval service and efforts for peace. This was the first time a president being honored was alive at the time of the unveiling.[575]",

Jimmy Carter served as the 39th President of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He was awarded the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize for work to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development. Jimmy Carter aspired to make Government “competent and compassionate,” responsive to the American people and their expectations. His achievements were notable, but in an era of rising energy costs, mounting inflation, and continuing tensions, it was impossible for his administration to meet these high expectations. Carter, who has rarely used his full name–James Earl Carter, Jr.–was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. Peanut farming, talk of politics, and devotion to the Baptist faith were mainstays of his upbringing. Upon graduation in 1946 from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Carter married Rosalynn Smith. The Carters have three sons, John William (Jack), James Earl III (Chip), Donnel Jeffrey (Jeff), and a daughter, Amy Lynn. After seven years’ service as a naval officer, Carter returned to Plains. In 1962 he entered state politics, and eight years later he was elected Governor of Georgia. Among the new young southern governors, he attracted attention by emphasizing ecology, efficiency in government, and the removal of racial barriers. Carter announced his candidacy for President in December 1974 and began a two-year campaign that gradually gained momentum. At the Democratic Convention, he was nominated on the first ballot. He chose Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota as his running mate. Carter campaigned hard against President Gerald R. Ford, debating with him three times. Carter won by 297 electoral votes to 241 for Ford. Carter worked hard to combat the continuing economic woes of inflation and unemployment. By the end of his administration, he could claim an increase of nearly eight million jobs and a decrease in the budget deficit, measured in percentage of the gross national product. Unfortunately, inflation and interest rates were at near record highs, and efforts to reduce them caused a short recession. Carter could point to a number of achievements in domestic affairs. He dealt with the energy shortage by establishing a national energy policy and by decontrolling domestic petroleum prices to stimulate production. He prompted Government efficiency through civil service reform and proceeded with deregulation of the trucking and airline industries. He sought to improve the environment. His expansion of the national park system included protection of 103 million acres of Alaskan lands. To increase human and social services, he created the Department of Education, bolstered the Social Security system, and appointed record numbers of women, blacks, and Hispanics to Government jobs. In foreign affairs, Carter set his own style. His championing of human rights was coldly received by the Soviet Union and some other nations. In the Middle East, through the Camp David agreement of 1978, he helped bring amity between Egypt and Israel. He succeeded in obtaining ratification of the Panama Canal treaties. Building upon the work of predecessors, he established full diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China and completed negotiation of the SALT II nuclear limitation treaty with the Soviet Union. There were serious setbacks, however. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan caused the suspension of plans for ratification of the SALT II pact. The seizure as hostages of the U. S. embassy staff in Iran dominated the news during the last 14 months of the administration. The consequences of Iran’s holding Americans captive, together with continuing inflation at home, contributed to Carter’s defeat in 1980. Even then, he continued the difficult negotiations over the hostages. Iran finally released the 52 Americans the same day Carter left office.

                "content": "Jimmy CarterDownload high resolution photo » Jimmy Carter (James Earl Carter, Jr.), thirty-ninth president of the United States, was born Oct. 1, 1924, in the small farming town of Plains, Georgia, and grew up in the nearby community of Archery. His father, James Earl Carter, Sr., was a farmer and businessman; his mother, Lillian Gordy Carter, a registered nurse. He was educated in the public school of Plains, attended Georgia Southwestern College and the Georgia Institute of Technology, and received a B.S. degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1946. In the Navy he became a submariner, serving in both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets and rising to the rank of lieutenant. Chosen by Admiral Hyman Rickover for the nuclear submarine program, he was assigned to Schenectady, New York, where he took graduate work at Union College in reactor technology and nuclear physics and served as senior officer of the pre-commissioning crew of the Seawolf, the second nuclear submarine. On July 7, 1946, he married Rosalynn Smith of Plains. When his father died in 1953, he resigned his naval commission and returned with his family to Georgia. He took over the Carter farms, and he and Rosalynn operated Carter's Warehouse, a general-purpose seed and farm supply company in Plains. He quickly became a leader of the community, serving on county boards supervising education, the hospital authority, and the library. In 1962 he won election to the Georgia Senate. He lost his first gubernatorial campaign in 1966, but won the next election, becoming Georgia's 76th governor on January 12, 1971. He was the Democratic National Committee campaign chairman for the 1974 congressional and gubernatorial elections. President Jimmy Carter On Dec. 12, 1974, he announced his candidacy for president of the United States. He won his party's nomination on the first ballot at the 1976 Democratic National Convention and was elected president on Nov. 2, 1976. Jimmy Carter served as president from Jan. 20, 1977 to Jan. 20, 1981. Significant foreign policy accomplishments of his administration included the Panama Canal treaties, the Camp David Accords, the treaty of peace between Egypt and Israel, the SALT II treaty with the Soviet Union, and the establishment of U.S. diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. He championed human rights throughout the world. On the domestic side, the administration's achievements included a comprehensive energy program conducted by a new Department of Energy; deregulation in energy, transportation, communications, and finance; major educational programs under a new Department of Education; and major environmental protection legislation, including the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which doubled the size of the national park system and tripled the wilderness areas.

                "content": "James \"Jimmy\" Earl Carter Jr. (October 1, 1924 – December 29, 2024) was an American politician and philanthropist. He was the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He was a member of the Democratic Party. Before becoming president, Carter was a Georgia state senator from 1963 to 1967 and the 80th governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975. He was born and grew up in Plains, Georgia. Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and joined the United States Navy. In 1953, Carter left the military and returned home to Georgia to take charge of the family's peanut-growing business. Carter was against racial segregation and supported the growing civil rights movement. He became an activist in the Democratic Party. From 1963 to 1967, Carter was in the Georgia State Senate, and in 1970, he was elected as Governor of Georgia. He was governor until 1975. At first, he was not seen as a serious presidential candidate as not many people knew him outside of Georgia. Carter eventually won the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination and was elected president, beating then-Republican President Gerald Ford. On his second day in office, Carter pardoned all the Vietnam War draft evaders. During Carter's term as president, he created the Department of Energy and the Department of Education. He also created a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter helped create the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II), and the return of the Panama Canal Zone to Panama. However, the economy during his presidency was bad as it had stagflation, high inflation, high unemployment and slow economic growth. The end of his presidential term was remembered for the 1979–1981 Iran hostage crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In 1980, Carter ran against Senator Ted Kennedy in the Democratic primaries and won re-nomination at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. Carter lost the 1980 presidential election. He lost to the Republican nominee Ronald Reagan, who won in a huge victory. Polls of historians and political scientists usually see Carter as an below-average president. He became more popular for his humanitarian work after leaving office. In 1982, Carter created the Carter Center to focus on human rights across the world. He has traveled to support peace talks, look over elections, and support ending deadly diseases. In 2002, he won the Nobel Peace Prize. Carter is seen as an important person in the Habitat for Humanity charity. He has written over 30 books from memoirs to poetry. Carter is the longest-lived president, the longest-retired president, the first to live forty years after their inauguration, and the first former president to reach the age of 100. Carter died on December 29, 2024 while in hospice care in Plains. Carter was born on October 1, 1924, at Lillian Carter Health and Rehabilitation in Plains, Georgia.[1] Carter was the first U.S. president to be born in a hospital.[2] He was the oldest son of Bessie Lillian (née Gordy) and James Earl Carter Sr.[3] He was distantly related to President Richard Nixon and Bill Gates.[4] The family moved many times when Carter was an infant.[5] The Carters settled on a dirt road in nearby Archery.[6] Carter went to Plains High School from 1937 to 1941.[7] He also joined the Future Farmers of America and liked woodworking.[8][9] After high school, Carter went to Georgia Southwestern College, in Americus, Georgia.[10] He took extra math classes at Georgia Tech.[11] In 1943, Carter was accepted to the United States Naval Academy.[12] While at the academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith.[13] The two married shortly after his graduation in 1946.[13] He was a sprint football player for the Navy Midshipmen.[14] Carter graduated 60th out of 820 midshipmen in the class of 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and became an ensign.[15][16] From 1946 to 1953, Carter and Rosalynn lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York and California, during his time in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.[16] In 1948, he began officers' training for being in a submarine.[16] He was promoted to lieutenant junior grade in 1949.[16] In 1952, Carter began his work with the US Navy's nuclear submarine program.[17] He was sent to the Naval Reactors Branch of the Atomic Energy Commission in Washington, D.C. for three month.[18] During this time, Rosalynn moved with their children to Schenectady, New York.[17][18] In March 1953, Carter began nuclear power school at Union College in Schenectady.[19] Carter's father died and he was released from active duty to allow him to take over the family peanut business.[20] Carter left active duty on October 9, 1953.[20] He was not active at the Navy Reserve until 1961, and left the service as a lieutenant.[21] His awards included the American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, China Service Medal, and National Defense Service Medal.[22] Carter's father, James died after having recently been elected to the Georgia House of Representatives.[23] For a year, Jimmy, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in public housing in Plains.[24] Carter is the only U.S. president to have lived in public housing before he took office.[24] Carter wanted to expand the family's peanut-growing business.[25] His first-year harvest failed because of droughts, however Carter wanted to open many bank lines of credit to keep the farm going.[25] He also took classes and read on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business.[26] Even though they struggled at first, the Carters grew the peanut business and became successful.[25][26] Carter, who was against racial segregation, was inspired to run for office over the racial tensions in the country.[27] By 1961 he was a known member of the Plains community and the Baptist Church as well as chairman of the Sumter County school board.[28] At the school board, Carter spoke against racial segregation in public schools.[28] In 1962, Carter announced his run for a seat in the Georgia State Senate.[29] At first, the results showed Carter losing, but this was the result of fraudulent voting done by the Democratic Party chairman in Quitman County.[30] Carter challenged the results; when fraud was confirmed, a new election was held, which he won.[29] Beginning in 1962, Americus was known where black protesters were hit and abused.[31] Carter did not say anything about this at first.[32] He did speak about some race issues such as giving speeches against literacy tests and against a change to the state constitution.[32] When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Carter called it \"the greatest blow that I had suffered since my father died\".[33] Two years later, Carter was in charge of the Democratic Executive Committee, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules.[34] He became chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission.[34] When Bo Callaway was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 1964, Carter wanted to run against him in the next election.[35] The two had fought over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college.[35] Carter wanted it to go to his alma mater, Georgia Southwestern College, but Callaway wanted the funding to go to downtown Columbus.[35] Carter was re-elected in 1964 to a second two-year term.[36] For a time in the State Senate, he was in charge of its Education Committee and also was part of the Appropriations Committee toward the end of his second term.[37] Before his term ended he worked on a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern a four-year program.[38] The last day of the term, he announced his run for the United States House of Representatives.[39] Carter ran for the United States House of Representatives for Georgia's 3rd district in 1966 against Bo Callaway.[35] However, Callaway ended his campaign to run for Governor of Georgia.[35] Callaway became a Republican in 1964.[40] Carter later wanted to run for governor against Callaway.[35] In the Democratic primary, he ran against the liberal former Governor Ellis Arnall and the conservative Lester Maddox.[41] Governor Maddox was not allowed to run for a second term as governor in 1970.[42] Carter had to run against Carl Sanders in the 1970 Democratic primary.[43] Carter was more conservative than before during this primary election.[44] That September, Carter was beating Sanders in the first round by 49% to 38%.[45] Since no one won more than half the vote, they went into a second round.[45] Carter won the Democratic nomination with 59% of the vote against Sanders's 40%.[46] In the general election, Carter beat Republican candidate Hal Suit, winning 59% of the vote against Suit's 40%.[47] Carter became the 76th Governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971.[48] In his inaugural speech, he said that \"the time of racial discrimination is over. ... No poor, rural, weak, or black person should ever have to bear the additional burden of being [without] the opportunity for an education, a job or simple justice\".[48] Time ran a story on the progressive \"New South\" governors elected that year in a May 1971 cover.[49] The cover of the magazine had Carter.[49] Lester Maddox, who Carter replaced as governor, became lieutenant governor.[48] Richard Russell Jr., then President pro tempore of the United States Senate, died in office during Carter's second week in office.[50] Carter picked David H. Gambrell, state Democratic Party chair, to replace Russell's in the United States Senate.[50] Carter wanted to grow the governor's power while making the state government easier to run.[51] He supported a bill that could give him the power of executive restructuring and to force a vote on it.[51][52] The plan was not popular in the state legislature.[51] But after two weeks of talking about the plan, it was passed.[51] He lowered the number of state agencies from 300 to 22.[53] In April 1971, while on television, Carter was asked if he supported the idea of governor and lieutenant governor running together.[54] He said, \"I've never really thought we needed a lieutenant governor in Georgia. The lieutenant governor is part of the executive branch of government and I've always felt—ever since I was in the state Senate—that the executive branches should be separate\".[54] In July 1971, while in Columbus, Georgia, Carter created a Georgia Human Rights Council that would help solve issues in the state of any possible violence.[55] In January 1972, Carter wanted to give state money for an Early Childhood Development Program and prison reform programs.[56] In April 1972, Carter went to Latin and South America for a possible trade deal with Georgia.[57] Carter said that he had met with Brazilian President Emílio Garrastazu Médici.[57] Many said he was acting like President Kennedy.[57] The number of black state workers, judges, and board members grew when Carter was governor.[58] He put paintings of Martin Luther King Jr. in the capitol building, while the Ku Klux Klan were at the ceremony protesting.[59] While on television with Governor of Florida Reubin Askew in January 1973, Carter said he supported a constitutional amendment to ban busing and to make desegregation in schools faster.[60] He supported an anti-busing plan with George Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference.[61][62] Carter signed a new death penalty law after the United States Supreme Court rejected it.[63] Carter later said he did not support the death penalty, saying, \"I didn't see the injustice of it as I do now\".[63] Carter wanted to give equal state aid to schools in the rich and poor areas of Georgia.[64] He helped create centers for mentally handicapped children and education programs for convicts.[65][66] He also wrote a program that made picking federal judges based on their experience over their political party possible.[67][68] In an unpopular move,[69] Carter rejected a plan to build a dam on Georgia's Flint River.[70] He said that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was not giving the right numbers on the project's cost and possible harm on the region.[70] The veto became popular with environmentalists across the country.[70] Carter was not allowed to run for re-election because of term limits.[71] Wanting to run for president, Carter was active in national politics and public appearances.[72] He was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, where Carter hoped he would be George McGovern's vice presidential pick.[72] He supported Senator Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson, to not support George Wallace.[73][74] In May 1973, Carter told the Democratic Party to not make the Watergate scandal a political issue.[75] On December 12, 1974, Carter announced his candidacy for President of the United States at National Press Club in Washington, D.C.[76] He talked about inequality, optimism, and change.[77][78] When Carter first announced his presidential run for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, he was seen as having little chances against better-known politicians.[79] However, by March 1976 Carter was doing better in polls against other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination.[79] He was also ahead of President Ford by a few percentage points.[79] Carter wrote Why Not the Best? in June 1976 to help make his name known for the American public.[80] Carter won the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.[79] In the South, Carter ran as a moderate and in the North, Carter ran as a conservative Christian.[81] He had visited 37 states, and gave over 200 speeches before any other candidate entered the race.[82] Carter ended up winning 30 states, with a total of 6,235,609 (39.2%) of the popular vote.[83] He was officially nominated as the Democratic nominee at the national convention.[84] He picked U.S. Senator Walter Mondale from Minnesota as his vice president pick.[84] During his presidential campaign in April 1976, Carter said to an interviewer, \"I have nothing against a community that is ... trying to maintain the ethnic purity of their neighborhoods\".[85] Carter said he understood why some neighborhoods were against desegregation.[85] However, he also supported open-housing laws that make it illegal not to sell or rent a house or apartment to a person based on their race.[85] His comments were unpopular with many Americans.[85] Carter's campaign supported congressional campaigns using public financing,[86] creating a federal agency for consumer protection,[87] creating a separate department for education,[88] signing an agreement that would stop the Soviet Union from using nuclear weapons,[89] lowering money given to the military,[90] increasing taxes for the rich and lowering them for the middle class,[91] supporting the Social Security Act,[92] and having a budget that would give money to government resources.[93] Carter and President Gerald Ford were in three televised debates during the 1976 election.[94] The debates were the first presidential debates since 1960.[94][95] Carter was interviewed by Robert Scheer of Playboy for the November 1976 issue, which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election.[96] While discussing his religion's view of pride, Carter said: \"I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times\".[96][97] He also said in another interview that he did not mind if people said the word \"fuck\".[98] This led to a media to criticize the idea if politicians should be separated from their political campaigns and their private intimate lives.[98] Carter began the race with a lead over Ford, who narrowed the gap during the campaign, but lost to Carter in by a small margin on November 2, 1976.[99] Carter won the popular vote by 50.1 percent to 48.0 percent for Ford, and received 297 electoral votes to Ford's 240.[100] Carter won fewer states than Ford, with Carter winning 23 states compared to Ford winning 27.[100] Carter was inaugurated as president on January 20, 1977.[3] On April 18, 1977, Carter gave a televised speech saying that the U.S. energy crisis during the 1970s was like war.[101] He supported energy conservation by all Americans and added solar water heating panels on the White House.[102][103] He wore sweaters because he turned down the heat in the White House.[104] On August 4, 1977, Carter created the Department of Energy.[105] During the signing event, Carter said the current \"crisis of energy shortages\" made him create the Department of Energy.[106] Carter said that the House of Representatives had created many energy saving ideas.[107] A month later, on October 13, Carter stated he believed in the Senate's power to pass the energy reform bill.[108] He said that \"the most important domestic issue that we will face while I am in office\" was the energy crisis.[108] On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said plans about his energy reform proposal were not being made and that Congress was not being respectful.[109] In April 1978, Carter said his biggest surprise since becoming president was the how hard it was for Congress to pass an energy reform bill.[110] On March 1, 1979, Carter wanted to create a gasoline rationing plan with Congress approving it.[111] On April 5, he talked about how important energy conservation is.[112] At the end of the month, Carter said it was important that the Congress pass his gas rationing plan.[113] On July 15, 1979, Carter said the crisis was a \"crisis of confidence\" among the American people.[114][115] Many did not like Carter's speech.[116][117][118] People thought Carter for not doing enough to solve the crisis.[119] Many believed he wanted Americans to do most of the work instead of the government.[119] In 1978, Carter said the Love Canal accident in the city of Niagara Falls, New York was a federal emergency.[120] During the 1940s, the canal was used as the site to dump chemical products from dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins.[121] More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which was built on top of a toxic waste landfill.[120] The Superfund law was created because of Love Canal.[122] Carter said that many places like \"Love Canals\" existed across the country.[123] He said that discovering hazardous dumpsites was \"one of the [saddest] discoveries of our modern era\".[123] In 1979, the Environmental Protection Agency said that people living near the Love Canal accident were at risk for leukemia.[124][125][126] Carter had many problems with the economy when he became president.[127] He tried to continue the recovery from the severe 1973–75 recession.[128] His economy also had high inflation, with very high interest rates, oil shortages, and slow economic growth.[127] In his first two years, Carter created millions of new jobs.[129][130] The 1979 energy crisis ended job growth, however, and both inflation and interest rates rose.[131] Economic growth, job creation, and consumer confidence quickly went down.[131] There was also not a lot of gasoline because of the oil crisis.[132] Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act into law on October 24, 1978.[133] The main purpose was to remove government control over fees, routes and airline market from commercial aviation.[133] The Civil Aeronautics Board's powers of regulation were removed.[133] The act did not remove the FAA's powers over airline safety.[134] In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell malt, hops, and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the beginning of Prohibition in the United States.[135] This led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s.[136] During his presidential campaign, Carter wanted to fix healthcare in the country.[137] Carter's plans on healthcare included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal,[138] and a June 1979 plan that gave private health insurance coverage.[139] Carter saw the June 1979 plan as a growing part of Medicare and Medicaid.[140][141] The April 1977 mandatory health care cost plan was passed in the Senate,[142] and later was not approved in the House.[143] During 1978, Carter also had meetings with Kennedy for a healthcare law that did not pass the U.S. House.[144] Carter later blamed Kennedy for his healthcare plans not being approved in Congress.[145] Carter worked with Congress to create an education department.[146] In February 1978, Carter said that education is very important and should not be in control over many departments.[147] On February 8, 1979, Carter released a plan to create an education department.[146] On October 17, 1979, Carter signed a law that created the United States Department of Education.[148] Carter grew the Head Start program by adding 43,000 children and families.[149] In a November 1980 speech, Carter said he would allow the Head Start to migrant children and wanted to increase building schools near the Mexico–United States border in Texas.[150] In September 1977, Carter and General Omar Torrijos signed the Panama Canal Treaty.[151] The treaties would give Panama control of the Panama Canal after 1999.[151] This would remove United States control of the canal.[151] The second treaty said that Panama would have full control of the canal.[151] The treaty was not popular with conservatives.[151] In September 1978, Carter created many political agreements between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at Camp David.[152] The two agreements were signed at the White House.[152] The second of these frameworks helped create the 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty.[153] Carter spoke to African officials at the United Nations about his support of democratic elections and power in African countries.[154] Carter later said his plans for wanting \"to work with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe\" and to end racial issues like apartheid.[155] Carter visited Nigeria from March 31 to April 3, 1978, trying to fix relations with the country.[156] He was the first U.S. president to visit Nigeria.[157] Carter wanted to create peace in Rhodesia.[158] On May 16, 1979, the Senate voted in favor of President Carter ending economic sanctions against Rhodesia.[159] In November 1977, Carter said he wanted to have a good partnership between the United States and Iran.[160] In November 1979, a group of Iranian students took over the United States Embassy in Tehran.[161] The students were in support of the Iranian Revolution.[161] 52 Americans were held hostage for the next 444 days until they were freed on January 20, 1981.[162] They were freed on the day Ronald Reagan replaced Carter as president.[162] During the crisis, Carter never left the White House for more than 100 days.[163] In December 1979, Carter said he wanted to solve the issue without using the military or violence.[164] On April 7, 1980, Carter passed Executive Order 12205, adding economic sanctions against Iran[165] and announced more action to make sure the hostages were released safely.[166][167] On April 24, 1980, Carter pushed for Operation Eagle Claw to try to free the hostages.[168] The mission failed as military helicopters crashed killing eight American military people.[168][169] Whistleblowers have said that people working on Ronald Reagan's campaign convinced Iran to not release the hostages to make sure Carter was not re-elected.[170] On February 8, 1977, Carter said he had wanted the Soviet Union to work with the United States to stop nuclear testing.[171] During a June 13 meeting, Carter said that the United States would begin to talk to the Soviet Union about demilitarization of the Indian Ocean.[172] On December 30, Carter said that the United States and the Soviet Union have made great progress on talking about important issues.[173] These talks helped create the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II by Carter and Leonid Brezhnev on June 18, 1979.[174][175] Nur Muhammad Taraki and other Communists took power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978.[176] Following an uprising in April 1979, Taraki was removed by Khalq rival Hafizullah Amin in September.[177] By December, Amin's government had lost control of much of the country.[176] This caused the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan.[176] Carter was surprised by the invasion.[178] The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was seen as a threat and Carter saw the Soviet Union as dangerous.[179] Carter announced sanctions on the Soviet Union.[179][180] He created an embargo on grain to the Soviet Union.[181][182] Carter also supported not taking part of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.[183] British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher supported Carter's actions towards the Soviet Union.[184] In early 1980, Carter created a program to arm the mujahideen.[185] The Soviets were unable to fight off them off and left Afghanistan in 1989.[185] In March 1977, Carter supported removing American troops from South Korea.[186] He wanted South Korea to have their own military forces to protect themselves from North Korea.[186] Carter's move to remove the troops was unpopular with military officials.[187] In May, Carter said he believed South Korea would be able to defend themselves without as many American troops.[188] From June 30 to July 1, 1979, Carter had meetings with President of South Korea Park Chung-hee at the Blue House.[189] Carter said that the liberal part of the Democratic Party did not support his policies the most.[190] He said they were caused by Senator Ted Kennedy's plan to replace him as president.[190] Kennedy announced his plans to run for president in November 1979.[191][192][193] Kennedy did not run a good campaign and Carter won most of the primaries.[194] Carter won the Democratic re-nomination, however, Kennedy gave Carter weak support from the Liberal Democrats in the general election.[194] Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale were nominated at the Democratic National Convention in New York City.[195] Carter's campaign for re-election in 1980 was not easy as he ran against Republican Ronald Reagan.[196] His campaign manager and former appointments secretary, Timothy Kraft, left the campaign five weeks before the election because of possible cocaine use.[197] On October 28, Carter and Reagan had the only presidential debate of the election.[198] Reagan was losing to Carter at first,[199] but after the debates, Reagan became popular.[200] Carter lost his re-election to Reagan in a landslide victory.[196] Reagan won 489 of the electoral votes and Carter won 49.[196] After the election, Carter said that he was hurt by the outcome of the election.[201] Shortly after losing his re-election bid, Carter told the White House press corps that he wanted his retirement to be similar than that of Harry S. Truman and not use his public life to make himself rich.[202] In October 1986, his presidential library was opened in Atlanta, Georgia.[203] At aged 88, Carter built homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy,[204] and partnered with former presidents to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[205] Carter went to the opening ceremonies of his presidential library[203] and those of Presidents Ronald Reagan,[206] George H. W. Bush,[207] Bill Clinton,[208][209] and George W. Bush.[210] He gave eulogies at the funerals of Coretta Scott King[211] Gerald Ford,[212][213] Theodore Hesburgh,[214] and John Lewis.[215] He has gone to the state funeral of every former president since he left office: Nixon in 1994, Reagan in 2004, Ford in 2006 and Bush Sr. in 2018.[213][216][217] When going to the first inauguration of Donald Trump in 2017, he became the oldest former president to go to one.[218] In 1982, Carter founded the Carter Center,[219] a non-governmental and non-profit organization with the purpose of spreading human rights and end human suffering.[220] He wanted to help improve the quality of life for people in more than 80 countries.[221] In 1994, President Bill Clinton wanted Carter's help in a North Korea peace mission.[222][223] Carter talked with Kim Il-sung about a possible peace deal.[224] Carter went to North Korea to help release of Aijalon Gomes in August 2010.[225][226] In 2017, Carter said that he had talked to the Trump administration about having him talk to North Korea about peace.[227] In October 1984, Carter was named an honorary citizen of Peru.[228] Carter supported the country's elections in 2001,[229] and supported the Peruvian government after meeting President of Peru Alan García in April 2009, where he was honored with a medal.[230] In his February 1986 talks with Tomás Borge, Carter helped support the release of journalist Luis Mora and labor leader Jose Altamirano,[231] while in Nicaragua for three days.[232] Carter went to Cuba in May 2002 and talked to Fidel Castro.[233] He went to Cuba again for three days in March 2011.[234] Carter went to the Middle East in September 1981 meeting with Prime Minister of Israel Menachem Begin.[235] In March 1983, he went to Egypt to talk about the Palestine Liberation Organization.[236] In December 2008, he met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.[237][238] Carter went to Syria in April 2008,[239] visiting the grave of Yasser Arafat in Ramallah[240] and he said he was not working with the Bush administration about meeting with Hamas leaders.[241] In July 2007, Carter worked Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg, South Africa to create The Elders.[242] This group was meant focus on peace talks.[242][243] Carter wanted to travel to Zimbabwe to support human rights in November 2008, but was stopped by President Robert Mugabe's government.[244] Carter went to Egypt and Tunisia in 1995 and 1996 to talk about violence in the Great Lakes region of Africa.[245] He had an important role in talking about the Nairobi Agreement in 1999 between Sudan and Uganda.[246] During the presidency of George W. Bush, Carter was against the Iraq War.[247] He believed Bush wanted to remove Saddam Hussein by using lies.[248] In May 2007, Carter stated the Bush administration \"has been the worst in history\" in terms of its impact in foreign affairs,[249] Carter did not support Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina.[250] Though he supported President Barack Obama in the early part of his presidency,[251] Carter criticized his use of drone strikes against suspected terrorists, Obama's choice to keep Guantanamo Bay detention camp open,[252] and use of surveillance programs.[253][254] In July 2016, Carter announced his support of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's presidential nomination during the 2016 Democratic National Convention.[255] Carter said that the 2016 election would \"define the US for a generation\".[255] He originally supported Vermont U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and voted for him during the primaries in 2016.[256] During the Donald Trump presidency, Carter supported immigration reform through Congress,[257] and did not support Trump's response during the national anthem protests.[258] In September 2019, Carter said he would support an \"age-limit\" for presidential candidates.[256] In August 2020, he supported former Vice President Joe Biden for president during a video played at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.[259] In October 2024, weeks after turning 100, Carter voted for Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election by absentee ballot.[260] Carter and Rosalynn Smith were married on July 7, 1946 in the Plains Methodist Church, the church of Rosalynn's family.[261] They have three sons, one daughter, eight grandsons, three granddaughters, and two great-grandsons.[262][263] Carter and his wife Rosalynn were well known for their work as volunteers with Habitat for Humanity.[264] Carter's hobbies included painting,[265] fly-fishing, woodworking, cycling, tennis, and skiing.[266] He also liked poetry.[267] Carter was also a personal friend of Elvis Presley.[268] Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, met him on June 30, 1973, before Presley was to perform onstage in Atlanta.[268] The day after Presley's death, Carter issued a statement and explained how he had \"changed the face of American popular culture\".[269] In 2000, Carter ended his membership with the Southern Baptist Convention, saying the group's ideas did not support with his Christian beliefs.[270] Carter became the oldest to ever attend a presidential inauguration in 2017, at age 92, and the first to live to the 40th anniversary of their own.[271][272] Two years later, on March 22, 2019, he became the nation's longest-lived president.[273] On October 1, 2019, Carter became the first U.S. president to live to the age of 95.[274] In May 2023, it was announced that his wife Rosalynn had dementia.[275][276] She entered hospice care alongside her husband on November 17, 2023,[277] and died two days later at the age of 96.[278] He went to her funeral in Atlanta on November 28 alongside all living former first ladies, former President Bill Clinton and President Joe Biden.[279] She was buried at their home that they built, where Carter also planned to be buried.[280] On October 1, 2024, Carter turned 100, the first president to do so.[281][282] On August 3, 2015, Carter had surgery to remove \"a small mass\" on his liver. On August 12, however, Carter announced he had been diagnosed with cancer that had metastasized.[283] On August 20, he said that melanoma had been found in his brain and liver.[284] On December 6, 2015, Carter said that his medical scans no longer showed any cancer.[285] On May 13, 2019, Carter broke his hip at his Plains home and had surgery in Americus, Georgia.[286] On October 6, 2019, Carter got 14 stitches above his left eyebrow after injuring it during another fall at home.[287] A few weeks later, Carter was hospitalized after having a minor pelvic fracture after falling again at home.[288] A month after his fall, Carter was hospitalized in November at the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta to relieve pressure on his brain.[289] The surgery was successful, and Carter was released from the hospital on November 27.[290][291] In February 2021, it was announced that Carter and his wife both received their doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.[292] In late February 2023, Carter stopped medical treatment and started hospice care at home.[293] He was being treated for an \"aggressive form\" of melanoma.[294] On March 13, 2023 it was revealed by President Joe Biden that Carter had asked him to deliver his eulogy after his death.[295] His grandson said in June 2024 that Carter is no longer awake every day.[296] Two months later, Carter said he hoped to vote for the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 presidential election.[297] Later that month, his grandson said that Carter was really sick, although he hoped to turn 100 years old and vote to in the 2024 election.[298] Carter died at his home in Plains on December 29, 2024, almost three months following his 100th birthday.[299][300][301] Shortly after his death, President Joe Biden honored Carter's legacy, calling him a \"man of principle, faith, and humility.\"[302] A state funeral will be held on January 9, 2025.[303] Carter's presidency was at first seen as unpopular in historical rankings of American presidents.[304][305][306] Although his presidency was unpopular, his peace and humanitarian works since he left office have made Carter one of the most popular former presidents in American history.[307][308] Carter's presidency was seen by scholars and many Democrats as a failure.[309][310][311][312] In a 1982 Chicago Tribune survey, when 49 historians and scholars were asked to rank the best and worst U.S. presidents, Carter was ranked the 10th worst.[313][314] The documentary Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace (2009) says that Carter's works at Camp David, which brought peace between Israel and Egypt, with bringing the only meaningful peace to the Middle East.[315][316] His post-presidency activities have been more popular with The Independent saying that \"Carter is widely considered a better man than he was a president.\"[317] His presidential approval numbers was just 31 percent before the 1980 election, but 64 percent approved of his presidency in a 2009 poll.[318] In Gallup's ratings of previous U.S. presidents, Carter's presidency had a favorability rating of 45% in 1990, which was below most other presidents and left only Richard Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson with lower ratings.[319] In a 2018 retrospective poll, Carter's presidency received a 55% favorability rating, its highest since 1980.[320] Carter has had many awards since his presidency. In 1998, the U.S. Navy named the third and last Seawolf-class submarine honoring former President Carter and his service as a submariner officer.[321] That year he also received the United Nations Human Rights Prize, given in honor of human rights achievements,[322] and the Hoover Medal.[323] He won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize.[324] Carter has been nominated ten times for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for audio recordings of his books, and has won three times in 2007, 2016 and 2019.[325][326][327][328] In November 2024, at age 100, Carter got his tenth nomination.[329] This made him the oldest nominee ever.[329] The Souther Field Airport in Americus, Georgia was renamed Jimmy Carter Regional Airport in 2009.[330] Death and state funeral of Jimmy Carter Dunant / Passy (1901) · Ducommun / Gobat (1902) · Cremer (1903) · IDI (1904) · Suttner (1905) · Roosevelt (1906) · Moneta / Renault (1907) · Arnoldson / Bajer (1908) · Beernaert / Estournelles de Constant (1909) · IPB (1910) · Asser / Fried (1911) · Root (1912) · La Fontaine (1913) · International Committee of the Red Cross (1917) · Wilson (1919) · Bourgeois (1920) · Branting / Lange (1921) · Nansen (1922) · Chamberlain / Dawes (1925) Briand / Stresemann (1926) · Buisson / Quidde (1927) · Kellogg (1929) · Söderblom (1930) · Addams / Butler (1931) · Angell (1933) · Henderson (1934) · Ossietzky (1935) · Lamas (1936) · Cecil (1937) · Nansen Office (1938) · International Committee of the Red Cross (1944) · Hull (1945) · Balch / Mott (1946) · QPSW / AFSC (1947) · Boyd Orr (1949) · Bunche (1950) Jouhaux (1951) · Schweitzer (1952) · Marshall (1953) · UNHCR (1954) · Pearson (1957) · Pire (1958) · Noel‑Baker (1959) · Lutuli (1960) · Hammarskjöld (1961) · Pauling (1962) · International Committee of the Red Cross / League of Red Cross Societies (1963) · King (1964) · UNICEF (1965) · Cassin (1968) · ILO (1969) · Borlaug (1970) · Brandt (1971) · Kissinger / Le (1973) · MacBride / Sato (1974) · Sakharov (1975) B.Williams / Corrigan (1976) · AI (1977) · Sadat / Begin (1978) · Mother Teresa (1979) · Esquivel (1980) · UNHCR (1981) · Myrdal / García Robles (1982) · Wałęsa (1983) · Tutu (1984) · IPPNW (1985) · Wiesel (1986) · Arias (1987) · UN Peacekeeping Forces (1988) · Dalai Lama (1989) · Gorbachev (1990) · Suu Kyi (1991) · Menchú (1992) · Mandela / de Klerk (1993) · Arafat / Peres / Rabin (1994) · Pugwash Conferences / Rotblat (1995) · Belo / Ramos-Horta (1996) · ICBL / J.Williams (1997) · Hume / Trimble (1998) · Médecins Sans Frontières (1999) · Kim (2000) UN / Annan (2001) · Carter (2002) · Ebadi (2003) · Maathai (2004) · IAEA / ElBaradei (2005) · Yunus / Grameen Bank (2006) · Gore / IPCC (2007) · Ahtisaari (2008) · Obama (2009) · Xiaobo (2010) · Sirleaf / Gbowee / Karman (2011) · EU (2012) · Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (2013) · Yousafzai / Satyarthi (2014) · Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet (2015) · Juan Manuel Santos (2016) · International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (2017) · Mukwege / Murad (2018) · Ahmed (2019) · World Food Programme (2020) · Ressa / Muratov (2021) · Bialiatski / Memorial / Center for Civil Liberties (2022) · Mohammadi (2023) · Nihon Hidankyo (2024)",

                "content": "• Carter dies at 100: Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States, has died at age 100. Carter was “surrounded by his family” at his home in Plains, Georgia, in his final moments, the Carter Center said in a statement Sunday. • Biden and Trump remember: President Joe Biden said Carter “stands as a model of what it means to live a life of meaning and purpose,” and remembered Carter as a “dear friend.” President-elect Donald Trump said Americans owe the former president “a debt of gratitude.” Preparations are underway for a state funeral. • Carter’s early life: Carter was a peanut farmer and US Navy lieutenant before going into politics, eventually serving one term as governor of Georgia and as president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He was the only former US president to reach 100 years old. • Rosalynn Carter’s legacy: The former president’s wife of more than 75 years, who was known for her mental health advocacy and humanitarian work, died in November 2023 at 96. The Carters were the longest-married presidential couple in US history. Our live coverage of former President Jimmy Carter’s death has ended. Read the posts below to see the outpouring of reactions and reflections on his legacy, or get the latest here. After former President Jimmy Carter died Sunday, the world rushed to offer condolences and shared the accomplishments of the 39th president, who was 100. Here is what happened on Sunday: Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer from Plains, Georgia, who served in the US Navy, was president from 1977 to 1981. Championing human rights at the center of US foreign policy, Carter forged a still-standing peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. He also established the Department of Energy in 1977. Shortly after his presidency, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, established The Carter Center, which has monitored international elections and promoted public health across the world. See photos of his life and legacy: Boze Godwin, a former mayor of Plains, Georgia, and a longtime friend of Jimmy Carter who knew the former president since Godwin was 10 years old, described his late friend as “a person [who] never forgot the people here, regardless of what position he held.” Speaking with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Sunday night, Godwin recalled Carter as a “very honest, very straightforward and a very hard-working person” who felt like part of the community and “just like one of us” following his and Rosalynn Carter’s return to their hometown of Plains after he served as president. “He is going to be buried here, and that’s a deliberate move to keep people coming back to visit on his part,” Godwin said. “Even in death, he hadn’t forgotten the town.” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Sunday ordered flags lowered to half-staff at all state buildings and grounds following the death of former President and Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter. “On this day, December 29, 2024, the date of his death, we honor the memory of Georgia native, Jimmy Carter, as a revered community activist, veteran, statesman, author, former Governor of Georgia, and former President of the United States,” Kemp’s executive order read. The flags will remain lowered to half-staff for 30 days, until sunset on January 28, 2025, according to the executive order issued Sunday. Former President Jimmy Carter delivered several memorable speeches throughout his political career, spanning his time as governor of Georgia to his service as the 39th president of the United States. Here are some of his most memorable speeches: From the 1979 national address that came to be known as the “malaise” speech to his acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize, watch former President Jimmy Carter’s most memorable speeches. Members of the Carter Protective Division of the US Secret Service are in mourning tonight as agents privately share stories in person and in group messages of the agency’s work guarding the former president and his family for nearly half a century, a law enforcement official tells CNN. “We’ve been planning for (today),” said the official, “but it’s still a gut punch.” While in office and beyond, the Secret Service has maintained a protective detail for the Carter family based in Georgia. “We’re not finished,” said the official, noting the Secret Service was working with the Defense Department to plan for Carter’s expected return to Washington, DC, for a memorial service and his final resting back in Georgia. “Dozens and dozens of (Secret Service) agents had the honor of a lifetime to serve the Carters” the official said. “We’re coming to grips with the fact this era is now ending.” CNN has reached out to the Secret Service for formal comment on Carter’s passing. Fans at Northwest Stadium outside Washington, DC, observed a moment of silence ahead of a game in honor of former President Jimmy Carter on Sunday, hours after his death. The matchup was poignant for the night: the Washington Commanders, the NFL team from the nation’s capital, were playing the Atlanta Falcons, from Carter’s home state of Georgia. The approximately 65,000 football fans fell silent to mark the occasion and cheered for the former president when it ended. Former President Jimmy Carter’s active post-presidency extended to relationships with his seven White House successors, with some of them leaning on his experience, advice and his diplomatic abilities. Carter also used his platform to speak out against some presidents – when he felt it was warranted. Joe Biden: President Joe Biden and first lady Dr. Jill Biden visited with Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter at their Plains, Georgia, home during an April 2021 trip to Atlanta for a rally marking Biden’s 100th day in office. “It was great to see President Carter. He reminded me that I was the first person to endorse him outside of Georgia. And we sat and talked about the old days,” Biden told reporters after the 2021 visit. He added, “Rosalynn was great too. We just had a nice time. It was just – they’re old friends.” It marked their first and only in-person meeting until the 2023 memorial service for Rosalynn Carter. The Carters did not attend Biden’s inauguration due to the pandemic. Biden was the first US senator to endorse Carter in his 1976 presidential bid, according to the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library. “We believe being ‘right’ on the issues is not enough in 1976. Our nation and our party need a president who is not only right, but who has demonstrated ability to accomplish our common goals,” Biden and Sen. Birch Bayh wrote in a joint letter at the time, adding, “We believe that person is Jimmy Carter.” Biden celebrated Carter’s 100th birthday with a video released in October, calling him a “moral force for our nation and the world” and a “beloved friend.” Donald Trump: Carter was in touch with then-President Donald Trump and his administration multiple times during Trump’s presidency. In 2018, Carter said he received a briefing on North Korea and said he’d be willing to travel to North Korea on the Trump administration’s behalf. Carter wrote Trump a letter on US-China trade relations and spoke with him by phone in April 2019. While the White House referred to the call as a “very good telephone conversation” and said that Trump “has always liked President Carter,” the relationship deteriorated later that year when Carter called for a full investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and suggested it “would show that Trump didn’t actually win the election in 2016.” Carter later issued stark warnings about Trump’s decision to withhold funding from the World Health Organization amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Trump, for his part, called Carter a “nice man” and a “terrible president” during a G20 Summit press conference in June 2019. In the days before Carter’s death, Trump, now president-elect, railed against Carter’s efforts toward a pair of treaties negotiated during his term regarding the Panama Canal. President Barack Obama: Carter candidly said in 2014 that then-President Barack Obama did not reach out to him for advice. Asked by NBC News if Obama seeks his counsel, Carter said, “Unfortunately, the answer is no. President Obama doesn’t. But previous presidents have called on me and the Carter Center to take action.” Carter cited his organization’s “strong and public position of equal treatment between the Palestinians and the Israelis” as a reason for his distance from Obama: “I think this was a sensitive area in which the president didn’t want to be involved.” Here’s how world leaders have reacted to the death of former President Jimmy Carter: The top uniformed leader of the US Navy issued a statement Sunday mourning the passing of former President Jimmy Carter, who previously served as a naval officer. “Today we mourn the loss of a shipmate as we celebrate and honor the life and memory of an exemplary public servant and patriot, President Jimmy Carter, who earned our admiration with his courage and won our hearts with his compassion,” said Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Lisa Franchetti. After studying reactor technology and nuclear physics at Union College in Schenectady, New York, Carter was assigned to the submarine force. He served in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets before he was tapped by Adm. Hyman Rickover to serve as a senior officer of the pre-commissioning crew of the Seawolf, the second US nuclear submarine. “From humble beginnings on a peanut farm in Georgia, he began his adult life in the Navy, entering the Naval Academy during World War II. He said that his naval service prepared him for the rest of his life, instilling courage, self-sacrifice, idealism, and self-discipline which would combine to form his moral core,” said Franchetti. “His legacy and beliefs are imbued in the Sailors that set sail aboard the USS Jimmy Carter,” the chief of naval operations said, in reference to the Seawolf-class nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine that continues to bear Carter’s name. Former President Jimmy Carter was the first American president to be interviewed on a fledgling Cable News Network, participating in an interview with CNN on the eve of its launch. “During the morning I had an interview with a new cable news network being put into operation by Ted Turner. This is for the inaugural day, Sunday night. Daniel Schorr was one of the interviewers. I spent about an hour with them,” Carter wrote in his diary on May 31, 1980, one day before CNN’s official launch on cable airwaves. In an annotated version of that diary published in 2011, Carter reflected on the moment. “No one at the time realized what a profound change the inauguration of CNN would bring to domestic and worldwide news coverage. Soon, whenever I visited foreign leaders, whatever the continent, they would almost inevitably be tuned to this channel — even though the telecasts were in English,” he said. Carter has participated in numerous subsequent interviews with CNN. Paige Alexander, the CEO of The Carter Center, said the former president lived a life of “service” and “integrity.” “’What would Jimmy Carter do?’ is a question that we have over 3500 staff, people who probably ask themselves on a pretty regular basis,” Alexander told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. Carter’s efforts on behalf of his Carter Center, founded to “wage peace, fight disease and build hope,” yielded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. Asked how the Carter Center will carry on in the following years, Alexander said the former president “set such an excellent foundation for us to build on.” “And I think, as he always talked about, there is a need to change during difficult times. And so that flexibility, whether it’s eradicating or eliminating diseases or looking at the the legacy he has from the Camp David Accords, which gave Israel and the Middle East the most important period of security we’ve seen in decades – these are actions that we need to take into consideration as we move forward at The Carter Center,” she added. Andrew Young, civil rights leader and former United Nations ambassador, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that he was “pleasantly surprised” former President Jimmy Carter lived to cast a vote in the 2024 US Presidential Election. “He constantly reminded us of the importance of voting,” Young, Atlanta’s former mayor, said Sunday. “One of the things he did that I don’t think any other governor has done, he deputized every high school principal in the state of Georgia as a registered voter, so that nobody, during his time as governor, nobody could graduate from a Georgia high school without being a registered voter,” Young said. President Joe Biden said in his remarks Sunday that his fondest memory of Jimmy Carter was when the late-former president asked for his endorsement for president. “Maybe my fondest memory of Jimmy Carter was, uh, when he grabbed me by the arm and said, uh, um, ‘I need you to help me with my campaign.’ And I said, ‘I’ve only been around a couple of years, Mr. Governor.’ He said, ‘no, it’ll make a difference.’ And I said, ‘I’m not sure it will.’ He said, ‘no, it will.” Biden was one of the first senators to endorse Carter’s 1976 presidential campaign. Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972 at age 29. “When I endorsed him for president, I told him why I was endorsing him not only for his policies, but his character, his decency, the honor he communicated to everyone,” Biden added. Biden also remembered that Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, “were very kind to Jill and me. When we lost our son Beau, they were there for us.” Joseph “Beau” Biden III, an Iraq War veteran who served as the attorney general of Delaware, died in 2015 at age 46 after a battle with brain cancer. “I think that what Jimmy Carter is an example of is just simple decency, simple decency and I think that’s what the rest of the world looks to America for,” Biden said. President-elect Donald Trump offered his “highest respect” to former President Jimmy Carter, who died at age 100 on Sunday, while noting in a Truth Social post he “strongly disagreed with him philosophically and politically.” “President Jimmy Carter is dead at 100 years of age. While I strongly disagreed with him philosophically and politically, I also realized that he truly loved and respected our Country, and all it stands for. He worked hard to make America a better place, and for that I give him my highest respect. He was a truly good man and, of course, will be greatly missed. He was also very consequential, far more than most Presidents, after he left the Oval Office. Warmest condolences from Melania and I to his wonderful family!” Trump said. In an earlier statement, Trump thanked Carter for his tenure as president, arguing Carter “did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans.” Remember: Trump has often criticized Carter’s record in public remarks throughout his political career. In the months leading up to the 2024 election, Trump often used Carter as a foil to diminish President Joe Biden’s record. On Carter’s birthday earlier this year, Trump attacked Biden at a campaign rally in Wisconsin by labeling Carter “the happiest man,” arguing he’d be considered “a brilliant president by comparison” to Biden. President Joe Biden in remarks Sunday said former President Jimmy Carter “stands as a model of what it means to live a life of meaning and purpose.” “Jimmy Carter stands as a model of what it means to live a life of meaning and purpose, a life of principle, of faith and humility. His life dedicated to others,” Biden said. “Every time he was summoned, he stepped up. Every time. Politically, personally, morally. And you know everything. The one thing I admired most about him, he thought and believed that — he really did believe this. And I do as well — everybody deserves an even shot. No guarantees, just a shot,” he continued. During remarks on Sunday night, President Joe Biden said former President Jimmy Carter “was just as courageous in his battle against cancer as he was in everything in his life,” and commented on cancer being a shared bond between the Bidens and Carters. “Our son, Beau, died, (and) when he died, Jimmy and Rosa were there to help us heal,” Biden said. “Jimmy knew the ravage of the disease too well. He lost his father, his brother, his sisters, to this terrible disease. So when Jimmy was diagnosed, we did our best to comfort him,” Biden added. President Joe Biden in remarks Sunday called former President Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday, a “remarkable leader” and a “dear friend.” “America and the world, in my view, lost a remarkable leader. He was a statesman, a humanitarian,” Biden said. “And Jill and I lost a dear friend. I’ve been hanging out with Jimmy Carter for over 50 years.” Part of President Carter’s enduring legacy will be the dozens of books he authored during his life. “Of all our modern Presidents, Jimmy Carter was America’s most protean author,” Jonathan Karp, the CEO of Simon & Schuster, said in a statement shared with CNN. Karp said, “Carter wrote memoirs, calls to action, fiction, poetry, and children’s books” — everything from “appreciations of Scripture and nature” to “advice on how to live a meaningful life.” Simon & Schuster published 13 of Carter’s 32 total books, and Karp said Carter “delighted in reading the audiobook versions of his work, for which he won three Grammy awards.” Sunday evening, as word of Carter’s death spread, several of his past books began to see sudden increases in sales on Amazon. President Joe Biden will give remarks on President Jimmy Carter’s passing at 7 p.m. ET, the White House says. Earlier, the president honored his “dear friend” in a lengthy statement released Sunday, shortly after the former president’s passing in Georgia. Biden called Carter an “extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian.” “Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend,” the president wrote. “But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well.” Vice President Kamala Harris called former President Jimmy Carter’s life “a testament to the power of service” in a statement after his passing Sunday. “President Jimmy Carter was guided by a deep and abiding faith — in God, in America, and in humanity,” Harris wrote. “He reminded our nation and the world that there is strength in decency and compassion.” Harris said she had the “privilege of knowing President Carter for years.” “I will always remember his kindness, wisdom, and profound grace. His life and legacy continue to inspire me — and will inspire generations to come,” she wrote. “Our world is a better place because of President Carter.” Carter’s grandson, Jason Carter, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution this year that the former president wanted to live long enough to cast a ballot for Harris, the Democratic nominee. He did just that, voting by mail for the vice president, who lost to President-elect Donald Trump in November. Notable figures and organizations all over the United States are celebrating former President Jimmy Carter’s work as a public servant and humanitarian worker, highlighting his kindness, devotion and decency. There has been a particular outpouring from his home state of Georgia. Here is a roundup of some of the statements so far: Former President George W. Bush and Laura Bush hailed former President Jimmy Carter as a “man of deeply held convictions.” “President Carter dignified the office,” the Bushes said in a statement. “And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn’t end with the presidency.” Bush’s father, former President George H.W. Bush died in 2018. Carter had surpassed the senior Bush as the oldest living former president in US history in March 2019. The George & Barbara Bush Foundation also remembered the 39th president saying Carter, “set the standard for the modern post-presidency.” “He set the standard for the modern post-presidency, living a life of humble service to others through his humanitarian work at the Carter Center and Habitat for Humanity – Jimmy Carter was a true Point of Light,” the foundation said in a post on Instagram. Carter’s efforts on behalf of his Carter Center, founded to “wage peace, fight disease and build hope,” yielded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. The first few days of January are set to an incredibly busy time on Capitol Hill with leadership elections, the certification of the election on January 6, nomination hearings and the inauguration of a new president which has all become even more complicated by the expected services to remember former President Jimmy Carter. On January 3, according to the constitution, the House and Senate will convene to swear in members of the new Congress and elect a new Speaker of the House. The Senate has already elected their leadership. With the narrow majority in the House and several GOP hardliners already raising concerns with Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership strategy, the speaker nomination process could drag out. The following week on Monday, January 6, heightened security is expected around the Capitol for the certification of the election — the fourth anniversary of the attack on the Capitol. It is unclear how Capitol Police and Secret Service will handle the lying in state for Carter and public access to his viewing amid these heightened security concerns. Then on January 20, President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated and ahead of that, nomination hearings will begin on his picks for key cabinet positions. In just the month of January, there will be three distinct national special security events with the lying in state of Carter, the counting and certification of the electoral results and the presidential inauguration on January 20. Discussions are ongoing amongst House and Senate leaders around the timing of the lying in state for Carter, according to a source familiar with the conversations, but based on past protocol, the date could be right around January 6. Former President Barack Obama said in a statement that former President Jimmy Carter “taught all of us what it means to live a life of grace, dignity, justice, and service.” “Whenever I had a chance to spend time with President Carter, it was clear that he didn’t just profess these values. He embodied them,” Obama said. “Maranatha Baptist Church will be a little quieter on Sundays, but President Carter will never be far away — buried alongside Rosalynn next to a willow tree down the road, his memory calling all of us to heed our better angels. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Carter family, and everyone who loved and learned from this remarkable man,” he continued. Obama referenced the church where Carter taught Sunday school in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, since the 1980s. Maranatha is also the church where a funeral service was held for Carter’s wife, Rosalynn, who died last year. US members of Congress from Georgia took to social media Sunday evening to share condolences and praises of Jimmy Carter following the death of the 39th president of the United States. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene: “He lived a long blessed life,” she posted to X, along with a photo of Carter. “May he rest in peace.” Greene represents Georgia’s 14th Congressional District. Democratic Rep. Nikema Williams: In a statement, Williams said she named her only son after Carter and hailed the former president as a “force for peace, human rights, and a voice for marginalized communities.” Williams represents Georgia’s 5th Congressional District. Republican Rep. Mike Collins said Carter’s “dedication to public service, leadership, humanitarian work, and Christian spirit touched the lives of countless individuals.” Collins represents Georgia’s 10th Congressional District. GOP Rep. Buddy Carter: “President Carter was an amazing Georgian and a firm believer in Christ. Today, he goes to be with his beloved wife, Rosalynn, in Heaven,” he said. “Please join me in praying for the whole Carter family, the State of Georgia, and the country following this tremendous loss.” He represent’s 1st Congressional District. Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson said he knows of “no man in his post presidency who has had a greater impact on humanity than President Carter.” Johnson added, “President Carter restored honest competence, integrity, and humility to the Office of the Presidency. He led the nation with vision and courage, although his Southern heritage was used to belittle him in the eyes of many.” Johnson represents Georgia’s 4th Congressional District. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp issued a statement on former President Jimmy Carter’s death on Sunday, as he and his family joined “all Georgians and the entire nation in mourning,” the statement read. “As the only American president thus far to come from Georgia, he showed the world the impact our state and its people have on the country. And as a son of Plains, he always valued Georgians and the virtues of our state, choosing to return to his rural home after his time in public office,” Kemp said. “When he left the White House, the Carters’ contributions continued. From teaching Sunday school to congregants and visitors alike over the years to their tireless work supporting Habitat for Humanity and the Carter Center’s efforts to address global health issues, Georgians are accustomed to seeing Jimmy Carter hard at work,” the statement read. The death of former President Jimmy Carter will constitute a rare event in America: a state funeral. Public observances honoring Carter’s legacy will be held in Atlanta and Washington, DC, followed by a private interment in Plains, Georgia, according to the Carter Center. Final arrangements for his state funeral are still pending, the center said. The last president to die was George H.W. Bush in 2018. Part of his state funeral was held at the Washington National Cathedral, where 3,000 political leaders and family members congregated to say goodbye to the 41st president. In attendance was Carter himself, along with Bush’s son, former President George W. Bush and the other living former commanders in chief: Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and then-President Donald Trump. More on the arrangements: The schedule for Carter’s state funeral will be released by the Joint Task Force - National Capital Region, which has detailed the history and traditions of state funerals. The Joint Task Force says “a state funeral is a 7 to 10 day event and consists of three stages,” which include ceremonies in the former president’s home state, ceremonies in Washington, DC, and ceremonies in the state where the former president would like to be interred — in Carter’s case, in Plains, Georgia. “To honor a great American, I will be ordering an official state funeral to be held in Washington D.C.,” President Joe Biden said in a statement Sunday after honoring the life of Carter. After the current president announces a former president’s death, the president then appoints the Defense Department to conduct the funeral, according to the Joint Task Force. The chain of command then ultimately places the commander of Joint Task Force National Capital Region to conduct the ceremonies, which will likely include leaders from across the world. While the military provides guidelines for state funerals, “typically, family desires determine the number, location and sequence of public ceremonies and observances consistent with military regulations,” according to the Joint Task Force. CNN reported during Bush’s funeral that all presidents oversee plans for their own funeral. President Joe Biden honored his “dear friend” Jimmy Carter in a lengthy statement released Sunday shortly after the former president’s passing in Georgia. Biden called Carter an “extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian.” “Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend,” the president wrote. “But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well.” He said with Carter’s “compassion and moral clarity,” the former president had worked to “eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil rights and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless, and always advocate for the least among us.” “He saved, lifted, and changed the lives of people all across the globe,” Biden wrote. The president also honored Carter’s “great character and courage, hope and optimism,” and talked about his long marriage to Rosalynn Carter. “We will miss them both dearly, but take solace knowing they are reunited once again and will remain forever in our hearts,” Biden wrote. He thanked the Carter family and staff and told “young people in this nation and for anyone in search of what it means to live a life of purpose and meaning – the good life – study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, faith, and humility.” Biden wrote that he was ordering a state funeral to be held in Washington. The president is in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands, for the week between Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Affordable housing nonprofit Habitat for Humanity called late President Jimmy Carter “a true friend” to the organization in a statement posted to X on Sunday. “(Carter) worked so tirelessly to make the world a better place. Please join us in remembering him and celebrating the positive impact he had on so many,” the statement reads. Some background: The Carter Work Project with Habitat for Humanity — which has has helped build, renovate or repair more than 4,300 homes alongside more than 100,000 volunteers across 14 countries — began with a run in Manhattan. Habitat for Humanity was founded in Americus, Georgia, in 1976, just about 10 miles from the Carters’ home in Plains, Georgia, where they lived since leaving the White House in 1981. Carter had been asked to get involved with the organization and had volunteered casually, but it wasn’t until he was in New York City for meetings and out on a run on the Lower East Side that the Carter Work Project seed was planted. “He ran by a group of students struggling to do a Habitat project, and he just made a comment, ‘We need to do something to help these students,’” Habitat for Humanity International CEO Jonathan Reckford told CNN in 2019. Soon after, Reckford said, the Carters took a bus ride back to Manhattan “with a boatload of folks from south Georgia” and worked on the Mascot Flats apartment building, the inaugural 1984 Carter Work Project, for a week. The volunteers – including the former first couple – slept on the floor of a local church basement each night. The Carters had been offered a small room at the church, which they gave up to a young couple who had skipped their honeymoon to attend the build. Since 1984, Carter Work Project took the former first couple across the United States and around the globe to 14 countries, from Wisconsin and South Dakota to Hungary and the Philippines. CNN’s Ashley R. Williams contributed reporting to this post. President-elect Donald Trump said the nation owes former President Jimmy Carter “a debt of gratitude” following the former president’s death on Sunday. “I just heard of the news about the passing of President Jimmy Carter. Those of us who have been fortunate to have served as President understand this is a very exclusive club, and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the Greatest Nation in History,” Trump wrote in a social media post on Sunday. “The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude,” he continued. “Melania and I are thinking warmly of the Carter Family and their loved ones during this difficult time. We urge everyone to keep them in their hearts and prayers.” Sens. Raphael Warnock and John Ossoff of Georgia have shared warm words for former President Jimmy Carter, who hailed from the state and founded the Atlanta-based Carter Center. Warnock praised Carter as “one of my heroes” after the Georgian’s death Sunday and recalled his personal relationship with the former president. “I’m honored to have had the opportunity to know President Carter—the first president I remember from my childhood, and someone with whom I developed a meaningful friendship. He brought his family to worship at my church. At a family dinner, I remember the President and his amazing wife, Rosalyn, holding my daughter, then just two months old, as if she were their own granddaughter. They were among my favorite people,” Warnock, who is also senior pastor at Atlanta’s historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, said in a statement. Ossoff remembered Carter for his “commitment to democracy and human rights, his enduring faith, his philanthropic leadership, and his deep love of family.” “I join all Georgians and all Americans in mourning his loss. May Jimmy Carter’s memory be a blessing,” Ossoff said in a statement. The 39th president died at 100 in Plains, Georgia, surrounded by his family, according to the Carter Center. The former president attended his wife’s memorial events, including a private burial and a televised tribute service in Atlanta, where he was seated in the front row in a reclined wheelchair. He did not deliver any remarks. Former President Jimmy Carter died Sunday at the age of 100, according to a statement from the Carter Center. Lawmakers are remembering Carter’s legacy as the 39th president of the United States. Here’s what they are saying: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer: Carter was “one of our most humble and devoted public servants,” he said in a statement mourning the loss of the former president. “From his legacy as President, to his dedication to improving human rights across the globe, and his tireless efforts alongside his wife Rosalynn, in building a better world through Habitat for Humanity, he inspired millions with his unwavering commitment to justice and equality,” Schumer’s statement read. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell: “President Carter served during times of tension and uncertainty, both at home and abroad. But his calm spirit and deep faith seemed unshakeable. Jimmy Carter served as our commander-in-chief for four years, but he served as the beloved, unassuming Sunday school teacher at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia for forty. And his humble devotion leaves us little doubt which of those two important roles he prized the most,” McConnell said. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin: The senator called Carter “an inspiration to those of us who aspire to lead a life of service.” Sen. John Thune: The South Dakota Republican praised Carter as a “dedicated public servant.” In a brief statement, he said, “President Carter dedicated his life to serving the people of Georgia and our great country – as a naval officer, a governor, and as the 39th President of the United States.” House Speaker Mike Johnson: In a statement, he said “the world is a more peaceful place” because of the work of Carter. “President Carter’s story was one of humble beginnings, and his life is a testament to the boundless opportunities available in this great nation,” Johnson’s statement read. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries: He said he is “thankful” for the “incredible life, legacy and leadership” of Carter. Jeffries posted to X, “He was a great man, a great role model and a great humanitarian.” Sen. Andy Kim: The New Jersey Democrat wrote on X, “President Jimmy Carter gave us a pure and lasting example of a public servant. His life and legacy will forever be a lesson on the power in one person’s will to do good. I’m sending love to the Carter family today as we honor his life and untiring, humble mission to help others.” CNN’s Morgan Rimmer, Danya Gainor and Alayna Treene contributed to this post. The accomplishments during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday at age 100, are “unparalleled” in the past century, his biographer said Sunday. “His accomplishments are quite amazing. And unparalleled, I would argue, in this century,” Carter biographer Kai Bird said, after listing several of the former president’s biggest accomplishments. Bird argued Carter “created the modern vice presidency” and made the controversial decision to appoint Paul Volcker chairman of the Federal Reserve “knowing that Volcker was going to jack up interest rates and restrict the money supply in a way that would be perhaps disastrous to his own reelection bid.” He also pointed to Carter’s foreign policy decisions, including treaties declaring the canal neutral and open to all vessels and providing for joint US-Panamanian control of the territory until the end of 1999, when Panama would be given full control — an issue recently politicized by President-elect Donald Trump. “Many Americans say that he turned out to be an excellent ex-president, but a failed president. And Jimmy hated that. He actually thought that he succeeded in his presidency in many ways that are surprising. He actually accomplished a great deal. If you look at his legislative record, both in terms of foreign policy and domestic issues, it’s it’s quite amazing. It’s more productive than most presidents,” he added. Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton released a statement on the passing of former President Jimmy Carter and remembered his legacy as a public servant. “Hillary and I mourn the passing of President Jimmy Carter and give thanks for his long, good life. Guided by his faith, President Carter lived to serve others—until the very end,” the Clintons wrote. President Jimmy Carter died peacefully at home in Plains, Georgia, “surrounded by his family,” the Carter Center said in an official statement Sunday. Carter is survived by his children — Jack, Chip, Jeff and Amy — along with 11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren, the center said. “My father was a hero, not only to me but to everyone who believes in peace, human rights, and unselfish love,” said Chip Carter in the statement. “My brothers, sister, and I shared him with the rest of the world through these common beliefs. The world is our family because of the way he brought people together, and we thank you for honoring his memory by continuing to live these shared beliefs,” Chip Carter said. Public observances honoring Carter’s legacy will be held in Atlanta and Washington, DC, followed by a private interment in Plains, according to the Carter Center. Final arrangements for his state funeral are still pending, the center said. In the summer of 1945, Jimmy Carter, then a fresh-faced US Naval Academy student, met Eleanor Rosalynn Smith. After their first date, Carter told his mother: “She’s the girl I want to marry.” Rosalynn rejected his first proposal but accepted the second a few weeks later. They wed in 1946 and would eventually become the longest-married presidential couple in history. Carter was asked the secret of his enduring marriage on CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper” in July 2015. “Rosalynn has been the foundation for my entire enjoyment of life … First of all, it’s best to choose the right woman, which I did. And secondly, we give each other space to do our own things,” Carter said. “We try to be reconciled before we go to sleep at night, and try to find everything we can think of that we like to do together. So we have a lot of good times.” When he published his book “A Full Life” shortly before he was diagnosed with cancer in 2015, Carter contemplated his own mortality. He wrote that he was at peace with his accomplishments as president as well as his unrealized goals. He said he and Rosalynn were “blessed with good health and look to the future with eagerness and confidence, but are prepared for inevitable adversity when it comes.” Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens released a statement remembering Jimmy Carter’s legacy as “Georgia’s only President.” “I was born into a state led by Governor Carter. When I learned the Pledge of Allegiance at Miles Elementary School, a photo of President Carter hung on the wall. And for the last four decades, I have watched Jimmy Carter and his beloved Rosalynn be the very definition of servant leaders, representing the best that our state and our nation have to offer,” Dickens said. He added, “My heart goes out to the entire Carter family here in Atlanta, across Georgia and our nation. I am so proud that President Carter’s legacy will continue to endure here in Atlanta through The Carter Center. As we mourn this loss, let us also tell our children the story of the boy from Plains who would be President.” CNN’s Devon Sayers contributed to this report. The White House has been notified that former President Jimmy Carter has died, according to a White House official. Preparations for the state funeral have begun, according to a law enforcement official. Former President Jimmy Carter has died at the age of 100, according to a statement from the Carter Center. Carter was the 39th US president, serving one term in office. The former president began home hospice care in February 2023 after a series of short hospital stays. Former first lady Rosalynn Carter died on November 19, 2023. Jimmy Carter was widely revered for championing human rights during and after his presidency. He served one term as governor of Georgia and president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. Here is a look at some key moments from his life: Read more about his life here. Former President Jimmy Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize for his worldwide peace and human rights work in 2002. Carter won praise throughout his life for his tireless efforts, both as a president and after leaving office, in trying to bring peace to places from Haiti to North Korea. In 2002, the five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee praised Carter’s decades of “untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.” Carter told CNN he was called by the committee at 4:30 a.m. ET, about 30 minutes before he normally got up. He said he did not mind getting the early wake-up call. “Obviously, I’m very grateful to the Nobel Committee for choosing me. I think they’ve announced very clearly that the work of the Carter Center has been a wonderful contribution to the world for the last 20 years,” he said. He was repeatedly nominated for the prize, worth $1 million, and came close to winning in 1978, when he brought Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat together to sign the Camp David peace accord, but his presidency faltered under the weight of the Iran hostage crisis. At the time, Carter told a news conference that he would give most of the $1 million prize to the Carter Center, which he founded after losing his 1980 re-election bid to Ronald Reagan. He said he shared the honor with his wife, Rosalynn, and the staff at the Carter Center. “When I left the White House I was a fairly young man and I realized I maybe have 25 more years of active life,” Carter said, “so we capitalized on the influence that I had as a former president of the greatest nation in the world and decided to fill vacuums.” Carter traveled around the globe monitoring elections, promoting human rights, and helping provide health care and food to the world’s poor. In 1979, former President Jimmy Carter did himself significant political damage in an extraordinary address to the nation on the energy crisis. Carter listed criticisms of his presidency, painting a picture of a listless nation trapped in a moral and spiritual funk. “It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation,” Carter said. Ultimately, the speech came back to haunt Carter and made it easy for opponents, not least Ronald Reagan, to portray him as a pessimistic and uninspiring leader. Still, in the late 1970s, it seemed conceivable that Carter’s command of foreign policy at the height of the Cold War would give him a fair shot at a second term. But a swelling of revolutionary Islam – heralding a trend that would confound future presidents — conspired to sweep him out of the White House. The Iran hostage crisis: In October 1979, the United States let the Shah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi — who had been overthrown by the Iranian Revolution a few months earlier — enter the country for medical treatment. That infuriated Islamic revolutionaries who saw him as an oppressive US puppet and wanted him returned to Iran for trial. On November 4, a year before the US election, students who supported the Islamic revolution seized the US Embassy in Tehran and took 66 Americans hostage. The 444-day standoff transfixed the nation, souring the national mood day by day as television news bulletins tallied how long the hostages had been in custody. Gradually it dashed Carter’s hopes of a second term. His fortunes were also battered by a daring and ultimately disastrous rescue bid in which a US helicopter carrying special forces crashed in the desert, killing eight US servicemen. At the same time, the Cold War was approaching a pivotal point. After the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, Carter decided to boycott the Summer Olympics in Moscow and asked the Senate to delay ratification of SALT II. As November 1980 approached, a sense of Soviet belligerence and the lengthening humiliation of the hostage crisis fostered an impression of US power under siege. “It was a perfect storm of unpleasant events, and that inability of Carter to get those Iranian hostages released before the 1980 elections spelled doomsday,” said Brinkley. Carter wrote in his memoirs that his destiny was out of his hands as the election approached, but prayed the hostages would be released. “Now, my political future might well be determined by irrational people on the other side of the world over whom I had no control,” he said. “If the hostages were released, I was convinced my election would be assured; if the expectations of the American people were dashed again, there was little chance I could win.” Throughout the campaign, Reagan berated Carter as an ineffectual leader consigning America to perpetual decline. “A recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his,” Reagan charged. The actor-turned-California governor pulled off a stunning landslide on Election Day 1980, winning 489 electoral votes. In the final humiliation for Carter, on January 20, 1981, 20 minutes after Reagan was sworn in, Iran released the hostages. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

                "title": "Game recap: 5 takeaways from Packers’ loss to Vikings",
                "content": "packers.com editor MINNEAPOLIS – The Packers fell way behind and then rallied late, but it wasn't enough in a 27-25 defeat to the Vikings on Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium. Here are five takeaways from the tough loss: Because the Vikings, after the Packers scored two touchdowns for 15 points to cut a 17-point deficit to two, got two first downs to run out the clock. The second one was converted on a third-and-3, the Packers' last chance to get the ball back, and QB Sam Darnold floated a pass in the flat that running back Cam Akers caught above his shoetops while falling backwards. The Vikings went into victory formation and the comeback went for naught. \"Our guys continue to fight and scratch and claw, but we just can't put ourselves in a hole like that,\" Head Coach Matt LaFleur said. \"It took too long to get going offensively, and that was the result.\" A fumble on the game's opening drive, a failed fourth down in scoring territory, two illegal formation flags that wiped out first downs, a 12-men-in-the-huddle penalty, and an offside on a missed field goal that gave the Vikings another crack at the kick on the final play of the first half … it all added up to a frustrating afternoon and, in the end, too much to overcome. LaFleur clearly disagreed with one of the illegal formation calls, as well as the offside on the field goal, but to no avail. Those occurred on back-to-back possessions late in the first half that helped end a Green Bay drive and give Minnesota three points for a 13-3 lead at intermission. The deficit then got worse when the Vikings scored a TD to open the second half. \"I'm not going to make excuses for it,\" LaFleur said of the flags. \"They saw it differently.\" Green Bay's defense was already shorthanded in the secondary due to injuries and then lost safety Zayne Anderson to a concussion early from a tackle on kickoff coverage. The thinning depth in the back end wasn't helped by a pass rush that struggled to get to Darnold, who was rarely pressured and sacked just once in 43 pass attempts. He completed an efficient 33 for 377 yards and three TDs, with one INT, for a 116.1 rating, generating several big gains downfield. \"You've got to get pressure on these guys if they're going to drop back that many times,\" LaFleur said. \"If you don't, it's going to be a long day. \"They've got a lot of weapons.\" Indeed, on a day the Packers stopped the Vikings' ground game for the most part (23 carries for 72 yards, not including kneel-downs), four pass catchers each compiled 68 or more yards for Darnold, led by Justin Jefferson with eight catches for 92 yards. Cornerback Carrington Valentine's interception in the third quarter set up running back Josh Jacobs' rushing touchdown to make it 20-10. Jacobs, who overcame the early fumble to gain 69 yards on 17 carries, scored a rushing TD for the seventh straight game, tying Paul Hornung's franchise record set in 1960. But the Vikings came right back with a touchdown to resume their 17-point lead. The Packers finally got going on offense, but it was sitting with just those 10 points through 3½ quarters that they most regret. LaFleur and QB Jordan Love discussed the Vikings playing more man coverage than they anticipated and the Packers being slow to adjust. But the other mistakes factored into missed chances, too, and the Packers were well under 200 yards of total offense until their two fourth-quarter TD drives. \"It's tough,\" said Love, who was 19-of-30 for 185 yards with a TD (to Malik Heath) and 91.7 rating. \"Obviously it ended up being a close game, but we know it's hard when you put yourself in a hole and are down early and shooting yourself in the foot. \"It's hard to get out of that hole, and when it's a good team like the Vikings that makes it even tougher.\" The loss dropped the Packers to 11-5 and took the No. 5 seed out of play for Green Bay. The Vikings improved to 14-2 and have a shot at the NFC's No. 1 seed and first-round bye when they play the Lions in the regular-season finale. Green Bay's seed will be determined, in part, by how Washington fares. The Commanders are also 11-5 following their Sunday night overtime win over the Falcons, and if they win in Week 18 over the Cowboys, they will be the No. 6 seed and the Packers will get the No. 7. If the Packers win and the Commanders lose, Green Bay gets the No. 6 seed. Regardless, the Packers already knew they'd have to be road warriors in the postseason, and that won't change no matter what happens against the Bears next week. \"That's going to be our reality,\" Love said. \"We're going to have to find ways when the playoffs start to go into these road atmospheres and win.\" Week 18 to determine Green Bay's playoff seeding Team knows it's up to them to change the narrative after fourth division loss Green Bay's second-half rally not enough vs. Vikings It's almost do-or-die time Late rally by Green Bay comes up short Follow the Green Bay Packers vs. Minnesota Vikings game with live updates from U.S. Bank Stadium Team will rotate captains on a weekly basis Rookie safety back after missing last two games for Packers Green Bay Packers vs. Minnesota Vikings channel listing, radio & streaming options Green Bay announces roster move ahead of Sunday's matchup vs. Vikings Kevin O'Connell's early tenure similar to Matt LaFleur's in one-possession contests COPYRIGHT © GREEN BAY PACKERS, INC.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Vikings got a big lead on the rival Green Bay Packers back in September, going up 28-0 before nearly coughing up the advantage entirely. Three months later, they offered up a sequel for the U.S. Bank Stadium crowd, nearly surrendering a 27-10 fourth-quarter lead before outlasting their NFC North rivals for a critical 27-25 victory, their ninth straight on the 2024 season. Sam Darnold turned in an MVP-caliber performance to help Minnesota dominate much of the afternoon, while Brian Flores' defense suffocated Jordan Love and Co. until the final quarter, when Green Bay surged back to life thanks to a couple of surgical drives through the air. Vikings kicker Will Reichard also contributed to the game's close finish, missing two of four field goals while also failing to hit the landing zone on a kickoff, granting the Packers favorable field position. Sunday's anticipated showdown started slowly, with both sides trading stingy defensive stands, but Darnold settled in after feeding speedy wide receiver Jalen Nailor, who saw an uptick in opportunities with Green Bay zeroing in on star pass catcher Justin Jefferson. From there, he had little trouble spreading the ball to the array of weapons in Kevin O'Connell's lineup, with Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson all corralling at least five catches against a \"D\" missing star corner Jaire Alexander. Flores' group, meanwhile, all but rendered the Packers' pass game a non-factor early. Missing deep threat Christian Watson, Love managed just 45 yards through the air in the game's first two quarters, and while bruising back Josh Jacobs had a heavy workload up the middle, Green Bay spent most of the rematch playing catch-up. Things finally clicked late, with Love guiding a pair of fourth-quarter touchdown drives while feeding Romeo Doubs, but it was too little, too late. The win bumps the Vikings to 14-2 on the season and sets up a winner-take-all against the Lions in Week 18 for the NFC North title and home-field advantage. It also drops the Packers to 11-5 in the North. Take your pick of Darnold's pretty throws, basically. This one to Addison helped give Minnesota a 20-3 advantage, showcasing the quarterback's steadiness as a pocket-climber and downfield thrower: The Vikings (14-2) will close their 2024 season with a pivotal Week 18 rematch in Detroit, where they'll fight the Lions (13-2) for the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs, plus the NFC North crown. The Packers (11-5), meanwhile, will finish their regular season against the Chicago Bears (4-12), who fell to the Seattle Seahawks in an ugly 6-3 contest in Week 17. It wasn't pretty late, but Minnesota pulls it off, sealing the deal by getting a first down on a Sam Darnold-to-Cam Akers dump-off. Jordan Love's late-game heroics were strong, but it was too little, too late for Green Bay. The Vikings officially improve to 14-2, while the Packers drop to 11-5. What a finish. Wow. Down 20-3 earlier, the Packers are suddenly within two points after Jordan Love orchestrates a beautiful nine-play scoring series. Feeding his entire makeshift receiving corps, including Romeo Doubs, Bo Melton and Dontayvion Wicks, he ultimately hits Malik Heath over the middle for the score. It's now 27-25 Vikings, and Minnesota has a chance to seal it by moving the chains on the ensuing drive. But things suddenly look tight, and the Vikings' errors on the margins could come back to bite them; they had 12 men on the field on the Packers' score, and kicker Will Reichard's two field goal misses look even more glaring now. Don't turn this one off just yet. The Vikings have been dominating, but seemingly out of nowhere Matt LaFleur produces a nine-play, 67-yard scoring series headlined by a couple of long strikes from Jordan Love -- first to Bo Melton, then to Tucker Kraft. Josh Jacobs and Emanuel Wilson then share touches on the ground, with the latter powering forward for the score. It's 27-18 after Love finds Romeo Doubs for the two-point try, meaning Green Bay isn't done yet. Brian Flores' secondary nowhere to be found on this drive. The Vikings have a chance to go up 30-10, but Will Reichard bangs a 43-yard field goal off the uprights. He's now missed two of four field goal tries on the day. Probably the only blemish for Minnesota thus far. Green Bay has nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Down 27-10 with the clock ticking in the fourth, Jordan Love's pocket collapses and Andrew Van Ginkel sandwiches him for the sack to force a punt. That means the Packers went backwards two yards on their six-play series. They have just nine first downs on the day. We can't call this one yet, because the Pack did threaten a comeback against these Vikings despite falling behind 28-0 in their September meeting, but boy does this one look good for Minnesota. Sam Darnold is 21 of 22 on passes between the numbers against the Packers, per ESPN. In other words, the Vikings are absolutely killing it over the middle of the field. Green Bay not having Quay Walker and Jaire Alexander hasn't helped. It's partly why everything's coming up purple in this one. Everybody eats in Minnesota! Sam Darnold slings another beauty to Jordan Addison, who's up to six catches on the day, and after a couple of Aaron Jones tosses, Cam Akers gets the dump-off screen, fighting through a few would-be tacklers to reach the end zone and put the Vikings up 27-10. The Packers have no answers for the wide array of weapons. Minnesota now has 22 first downs to Green Bay's eight, and owns the time-of-possession battle 27:33 to 16:36. It's been a one-sided affair except for the one Darnold pick. Four plays after Carrington Valentine's interception of Sam Darnold, the Packers score their first touchdown of the day, feeding Josh Jacobs at the goal line. It's now 20-10 Vikings, and we've got ourselves a ballgame. Jeff Hafley's \"D\" had struggled to get off the field for a while, so perhaps this will turn the tide. Absolutely desperate for a big play, Green Bay gets one on the defensive side, baiting Sam Darnold into a sideline shot. Aiming for T.J. Hockenson with pressure in his face, Darnold instead zips it to Packers cornerback Carrington Valentine, with star safety Xavier McKinney also in the area. The much-needed takeaway puts Green Bay in scoring range about halfway through the third. Christian Watson's injury-related absence is being felt by the Packers offense. Jordan Love has just a single pass completion over 10 yards in this game. Nobody's really separating downfield, and while Matt LaFleur's focus has been on wearing down Minnesota with Josh Jacobs, that approach isn't necessarily ideal when you're down 20-3. The Packers need a splash play in a hurry. Jordan Love may have the most gifted arm in the NFC North, but it's yet to matter today. After finding Jalen Nailor for another big gain, Sam Darnold stands tall amid pressure off the edge and threads a perfect downfield end-zone shot to Jordan Addison, making up for an earlier deep shot that got broken up. Rookie safety Javon Bullard is on the wrong end of the pass coverage for Green Bay, and all of a sudden Minnesota leads this by three scores. That's passing touchdown No. 34 for Darnold on the year. Will Reichard misses from 55 yards out on a last-second field goal try, but the Packers get flagged for offsides, giving the Vikings a second chance at extra points. Reichard delivers from 50, and we go into the break with Minnesota up 10 points, owning a 13-3 advantage. Credit to Brian Flores' defense for really limiting the Jordan Love-led aerial attack thus far. Sam Darnold also looks especially sharp, even with Justin Jefferson blanketed by the Green Bay secondary, zipping some chain-moving darts into tight windows. Jalen Nailor is up to 59 yards on four catches as Sam Darnold's top target in lieu of Justin Jefferson drawing extra attention from the Packers. His latest reception, a 16-yarder, comes in a tight window and helps set up a 25-yard Will Reichard field goal, and we've got ourselves a 10-3 ballgame in favor of Minnesota. That scoring drive goes 69 yards over 10 plays. Halftime is fast approaching. Josh Jacobs gets a big workload on Green Bay's latest series, and the Packers push the rock to the Vikings 23, but on fourth-and-3, Jordan Love gets jumpy in the pocket and can't quite connect with Jayden Reed over the middle. Reed has yet to secure a catch on the day, and the ball goes back to Minnesota. Love is 7 of 11 for 45 yards so far, and only Dontayvion Wicks has more than one catch. Most of Matt LaFleur's attack has centered on Jacobs' bruising ground game. The Vikings are toughing it out. Injury alert: Vikings edge rusher Pat Jones II walks off after taking a shot to the knee from Packers tight end Tucker Kraft. Required some attention from trainers before limping his way to the sidelines. Justin Jefferson is getting almost no looks as the Packers focus their attention on the Vikings' top pass catcher, but that opens the door for Jalen Nailor, who outraces the entire Green Bay secondary for a 31-yard score. That's Sam Darnold's 33rd touchdown pass of the year, and it puts the Vikes up 7-3 in this one. Josh Jacobs rumbles into Minnesota territory with another strong dose of touches, but the Vikings hold firm inside the 10, with Josh Metellus stuffing Luke Musgrave on third down. So Green Bay goes up first but settles for a 22-yard field goal from Brandon McManus. It's 3-0 Packers at U.S. Bank Stadium. This one's been a gritty defensive affair thus far, with Brian Flores and Jeff Hafley both showcasing strong stuff. Jordan Addison burns Keisean Nixon on the outside for a potential score, but Sam Darnold floats it high rather than with velocity, and Nixon makes a leaping recovery to break up the connection. Then Will Reichard boots a field goal try from 57 yards out, and it bounces off the crossbar. So we're still at 0-0 here. Darnold is facing some heat up the middle from the Packers front. Green Bay takes to the air on its second series, perhaps as a response to Josh Jacobs' early fumble, and Jordan Love tries for three straight downfield shots, nearly connecting with Dontayvion Wicks. But the passes are just off, and the last one is nearly picked by Harrison Smith over the middle. So it's a punt, and the Vikings are back in control. Three drives so far, and three defensive stands. Josh Jacobs' fumble put Minnesota in a great position near midfield, but Jeff Hafley's defense shows up, putting pressure in Sam Darnold's face on back-to-back plays to force a punt. Kenny Clark got the first pressure, and Rashan Gary nearly came up with a sack on third down. Green Bay starts strong with a couple of tough Josh Jacobs carries and a quick first-down catch by Dontayvion Wicks, but then Jacobs coughs up the ball on a hit from Jerry Tillery. Vikings safety Cam Bynum (who else?) jumps on it, and we've got out first turnover already. Former Vikings Pro Bowl defensive lineman Pat Williams shows up at U.S. Bank Stadium to blow the pregame Gjallarhorn ahead of the opening kickoff. A \"Skol\" chant follows, and we're ready to go. The Packers win the coin toss and elect to receive the ball. It's Jordan Love up first in Minnesota. The fake snow is falling inside U.S. Bank Stadium as the Vikings and Packers prepare to take the field. Live from U.S. Bank Stadium, we've got you covered with all the key notes and analysis from today's matchup. First up: The Packers are without some big names in Minnesota, with Jaire Alexander, Christian Watson and Quay Walker among notable inactives. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. PHILADELPHIA -- In a battle of backup quarterbacks, the host Philadelphia Eagles (13-3) had the definitive edge over the Dallas Cowboys (7-9) as they dominated in a decisive 41-7 Week 17 victory. They clinched the 2024 NFC East division title with the win. It's their first division title since 2022, a year that ended with them as the Super Bowl runner up. It's also their 11th NFC East division title since 2001, which is the most in the division in that span. Philadelphia also now has their fourth ever 13-win season, which is key because they have reached the Super Bowl in each of the last three occurrences (2004, 2017, 2022). After two three-and-outs to start the game, the Eagles scored on their next six drives -- four touchdowns and two field goals. Philadelphia also secured its first sweep of the Cowboys since 2011. Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett, the 2022 first-round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers who is filling in for an injured Jalen Hurts (concussion), produced a strong performance. He threw for 143 yards and a touchdown on 10 of 15 passing while adding a 1-yard rushing score via the tush push to end the first half. He threw a 22-yard scoring strike to Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith with 6:38 left in the half after Smith cooked backup Cowboys corner Andrew Booth by multiple steps for the touchdown. Pickett exited the game early in the third quarter after aggravating his ribs injury on a late hit by Dallas defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa, who was penalized for roughing the passer. He clearly hit Pickett late after the football was gone. As a result, Eagles third-string quarterback Tanner McKee, a 2023 sixth-round pick out of Stanford, subbed into the game. McKee's first full drive ended with him throwing his first NFL regular-season touchdown pass to Eagles No. 1 receiver A.J. Brown on a 20-yard scoring strike. Brown got a stop on Cowboys All-Pro corner DaRon Bland, and McKee threw a perfectly placed pass over Brown's outside shoulder for the touchdown. That increased the Eagles' lead to 34-7 over the Cowboys with 2:44 left in the third quarter. He then hit Smith on an underneath throw, and he took the football all the way to the house with ease for a 25-yard receiving touchdown. McKee finished with 54 yards passing and two touchdowns on 3 of 4 passing, and Smith totaled 120 yards receiving and two touchdowns on six catches. Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush, their eight-year veteran backup who is filling in for an injured Dak Prescott (hamstring tear), played slightly better than his first start of the season back in Week 10, a 34-6 home defeat against the Eagles. He threw a 69-yard pick six to Philadelphia safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson on the opening drive of the game, but he bounced back to throw a 4-yard goal-line fade touchdown to Dallas wide receiver Jalen Tolbert on the game's second possession. At the end of the first half, Rush sailed a deep throw intended for wide receiver Brandin Cooks on third-and-5, and Gardner-Johnson picked him off for the second time. He returned the football down to the Eagles' 35-yard line with 36 seconds left in the half. It's Gardner-Johnson's second career game with multiple interceptions, and both have come against the Cowboys. Rush finished the game with 147 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions on 15 of 28 passing. With a massive lead, 2024 NFL rushing yards leader Saquon Barkley was able to take over in the second half. He went off for 167 yards on 31 carries Sunday afternoon to become the ninth player in NFL history to register at least 2,000 rushing yards in a single season. Here are the five main takeaways from the Eagles' Week 17 victory: The Eagles defense took a massive hit once Gardner-Johnson was ejected from last Sunday's loss to the Washington Commanders as a result of two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Gardner-Johnson's ejection certainly affected how the Eagles defense played Jayden Daniels, who was 16 of 24 for 150 yards and three touchdowns to one interception (105.9 passer rating) after the defender's disqualification. The Commanders scored 22 fourth-quarter points in the comeback victory, all with Gardner-Johnson off the field. Gardner-Johnson was back for this game and made an impact on the first series. On third-and-3 from the Eagles' 35-yard line, Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush threw a pass across the middle of the field and Gardner-Johnson read it for the interception. He took the takeaway 69 yards the other way for a touchdown to give the Eagles an early 7-0 lead with 11:55 remaining in the first quarter. Gardner-Johnson later had his second interception that set the Eagles up for a touchdown in the final seconds of the first half. The Eagles had three takeaways in the first half, all of which led to points. Even when Gardner-Johnson is struggling in coverage, he's making turnover-worthy plays for the Eagles to change the course of a game. In 28 games with the Eagles, Gardner-Johnson has 12 interceptions (6+ in each season played). He's a difference maker on this defense. Whatever the scripted game plan was in the first quarter of Pickett's start (filling in for Jalen Hurts as he was ruled out with a concussion), it wasn't what the Eagles were hoping for. A Landon Dickerson false start on the first play based the Eagles up to a first-and-15. Two incomplete passes and a checkdown to Kenneth Gainwell resulted in the first Eagles three-and-out. On the Eagles' second offensive possession, Pickett didn't even throw the football. With DeVonta Smith on the sidelines (wrist injury), the Eagles had Saquon Barkley carry the ball on three consecutive plays -- one via direct snap -- before choosing to punt on fourth-and-1 on their own 46-yard line. The decision to punt showed a lack of trust in Pickett to get the first down, with his arm or legs, or hand the ball off and get the first down. Six plays for 14 yards on the Eagles' first two series, and a lack of trust in Pickett. Different quarterback, same slow start. The Eagles opened things up for Pickett on the third drive, as he went 6 of 6 for 72 yards and a touchdown -- a 22-yard pass to DeVonta Smith. In the second quarter, 8 of 11 for 128 yards with a touchdown for a 141.5 passer rating. This doesn't include the rushing touchdown he had to get the Eagles up 24-7 at halftime. Pickett found an early connection with Smith once the Eagles opened up the passing game, hitting him three times for 74 yards and a score -- including a 49-yard pass to Smith that resulted in the 1-yard touchdown run just before the half. While it took the Eagles three series to get Pickett comfortable, opening things up for the quarterback certainly sparked the offense. Pickett left the game with a rib injury in the third quarter, yet the Eagles offense didn't miss a beat once third-string quarterback Tanner McKee entered the game. McKee, elevated to the No. 2 quarterback with Hurts out, threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to A.J. brown to put the Eagles up 34-7 late in the third quarter. The Eagles had a run-heavy offense once McKee entered the game with a big lead, yet he went 2 of 3 for 29 yards and a touchdown pass to Brown on his first series. He then followed with a 25-yard touchdown pass to DeVonta Smith on his second series, going 3 of 4 for 54 yards and two touchdowns for a 154.2 rating on his first two series. Whether it was Pickett or McKee, the Eagles offense was clicking from the second quarter on. Barkley reached the 2,000-yard rushing plateau on Sunday, becoming the ninth running back to amass 2,000 rushing yards in a season. He's eighth all-time for rushing yards in a season with 2,005. The chase is officially on in regards to Dickerson's record. Barkley finished with 31 carries for 167 yards, averaging 5.4 yards per carry. putting himself in striking distance of the mark. Dickerson rushed for 2,105 yards in 1984 and Barkley is 101 yards away from passing him. Barkley is averaging 125.3 rushing yards per game this season, which would put him on pace to pass Dickerson. Will the Eagles play him in Week 18? The 2,000-yard plateau was a goal of Barkley's and he achieved it. Just 101 yards away from Dickerson is approachable, even if the Eagles do play a meaningless game in Week 18. One of the hardest records in sports is Dickerson's rushing record. This mark can be broken if the Eagles decide to play barkley in Week 18, but it will likely be his call. The Cowboys have inserted 2021 third overall pick quarterback Trey Lance into the game with 2:24 left to play. Cowboys wide receiver Jalen Brooks and Cowboys cornerback Troy Pride, along with Eagles cornerback Sidney Brown, were ejected for fighting. Cowboys All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey drills a 61-yard field goal off the right upright for a missed field goal. The Eagles take over at the Cowboys' 49 up 41-7 with 4:40 left to play. Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith caught an underneath pass from Tanner McKee and left the Dallas defense in the dust for a 25-yard receiving touchdown, his second score of the day. The Eagles lead 41-7 with 10:03 left to play. Utter domination. Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is now up to 2,005 rushing yards, and he is the ninth player in NFL history to run for over 2,000 yards in a single season. Dallas commits their fourth turnover of the day with running back Rico Dowdle fumbling on third-and-5. Philadelphia linebacker Nolan Smith forced the fumble, and Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean recovered the loose ball. Philadelphia takes over at their own 25 up 34-7 with 14:20 left in the game. Tanner McKee threw his first NFL regular season touchdown pass to Eagles No. 1 receiver A.J. Brown for a 20-yard scoring strike. Brown got a step on Cowboys All-Pro corner DaRon Bland, and McKee threw a perfectly placed pass over Brown's outside shoulder for the touchdown. The Eagles lead 34-7 over the Cowboys with 2:44 left in the third quarter. Eagles backup quarterback Kenny Pickett (ribs) is officially questionable to return. He initially suffered a ribs injury a week ago against the Washington Commanders. Third-string quarterback Tanner McKee is primed to lead this drive after the Cowboys went run-run-pass for a three-and-out on their latest drive. The Eagles lead 27-7 with 6:34 left in the third quarter. An A.J. Brown receiving touchdown gets nullified by a holding penalty on Landon Dickerson trying to contain Cowboys All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons. Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett suffered an injury on the play, and Philadelphia subbed in third-stringer Tanner McKee to take the snap on third-and-goal from the Cowboys' 17. He handed off to Barkley for a gain of nine, and the Eagles took three more points on a 26-yard field goal. Philadelphia leads 27-7 with 8:03 left in the third quarter. The Eagles are marching up the field with ease to start the second half. Following a near interception by Pickett, it's been all runs by Saquon Barkley. A disaster for Dallas on their last drive of the half. Quarterback Cooper Rush sailed a deep throw intended for wide receiver Brandin Cooks on third-and-5, and Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson picked off Rush for the second time. He returned the football down to the Eagles' 35 with 36 seconds left in the half. It's Gardner-Johnson's second career game with multiple interceptions, and both have come against the Cowboys. Philly extends their lead to 10, 17-7, following Jake Elliott's 31-yard field. They can double dip with points since they start the second half with the football. Dallas has 1:55 on the clock and one timeout left. The Cowboys commit their second turnover of the half with tight end Jake Ferguson getting stripped by Eagles linebacker Oren Burks. Philadelphia defensive tackle Jordan Davis recovered the loose ball for the takeaway. Philadelphia takes over at the Cowboys' 39 up 14-7 with 6:27 left to play. The Eagles crowd is now chanting \"Dallas sucks.\" Dallas' lack of depth at cornerback because of injuries was just on full display. Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith cooked backup corner Andrew Booth with ease, getting open by multiple steps, which is how Philadelphia fill-in quarterback Kenny Pickett was able to hit him for a 22-yard touchdown. Philadelphia is back in front by seven, 14-7, with 6:38 left in the first half. The Cowboys take a deep shot down the left sideline to wide receiver Jonathan Mingo on third-and-1 instead of running with Dowdle, and it doesn't work. Mingo cooked Eagles first-round rookie corner Quinyon Mitchell, but he couldn't track Rush's throw. That led to the football harmlessly hitting the ground for an incompletion. Dallas punts it away, and Philadelphia fair-caught the football at their own 19. It's seven to seven with 12:49 left in the first half. After NFL rushing yards leader Saquon Barkley didn't touch the football on the Eagles' opening drive, the Eagles gave up three consecutives runs. However, he netted nine yards, and the Eagles punted the football away for a touchback. Philadelphia decided they would take their chances vs. Cooper Rush instead of potentially giving Dallas a short field if they bungled a fourth down attempt with Kenny Pickett at quarterback. It's a 7-7 game with 56 seconds left in the first quarter. Dallas goes three-and-out up against their own goal line, and they punt it away. The Cowboys got good hang time on the punt, so they were able to limit returner Cooper DeJean to just a yard on the return. The Eagles will have their second offensive possession starting at their own 37 in a 7-7 game with 2:48 left in the first quarter. Following a first down false start penalty, Eagle backup quarterback Kenny Pickett threw two consecutive incompletions, and then a short five-yarder to running back Kenneth Gainwell. Philadelphia goes three-and-out to start, and Dallas gets the football back on their own nine after a 52-yard punt by the Eagles. Eagles edge rusher Bryce Huff (shoulder) is questionable to return. Cooper Rush bounced back in a big way from his pick-six by capping the Cowboys' ensuing drive with a four-yard touchdown pass on a goal line fade to wide receiver Jalen Tolbert. Dallas continues to fight for head coach Mike McCarthy. This game is tied at seven with 5:38 left in the first quarter. Kenny Pickett and the Eagles offense will take the field for the first time today up next. With All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb out, Brandin Cooks is the Cowboys' clear cut No. 1 option in the passing game early on. Quarterback Cooper Rush has targeted him five times already, and Cooks has hauled in two of them for 38 yards, including 22 yards on the last play to move the chains on a third-and-9. Cooper Rush had been on a roll with wins in four of the last five games, which included a stretch of nine touchdowns to one interception, but he makes a critical error on the opening drive. He looked to force the football to Brandin Cooks on a third-and-3, but Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson jumped the route and took it all the way back for a 69-yard pick-six. It's Philadelphia's first defensive touchdown of the season, and the Eagles now lead 7-0 with 11:43 left in the first quarter. The Cowboys offense led by quarterback Cooper Rush and running back Rico Dowdle start with the football first. Cowboys three-time All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons has helped power a defensive renaissance in Dallas sparked by his return from his high ankle sprain along with an increased comfort in defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer's scheme in his first season working with the Cowboys defense after playing the last three under Dan Quinn, who is now the Washington Commanders head coach. He leads the NFL in both sacks (8.5) and quarterback pressures (42) since Week 10, and as a result, the Cowboys defense is one of the NFL's most disruptive in that span, ranking top five in the entire NFL in third down conversion rate allowed (35%, fifth-best in the NFL), sacks (28, best in the NFL), sack rate (10.4%, best in the NFL), quarterback pressure rate (39.3%, fifth-best in the NFL) and takeaways (15, tied for the second-most in the NFL). Cowboys All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey has made 36 field goals thus far in 2024. With just one more made field goal on Sunday in Philadelphia, Aubrey will set the franchise single season record for makes in a season, which would break a tie with his own record of 36 that he set in his first year last season in 2023. Cowboys running back Rico Dowdle is 97 rushing yards away from his first 1,000-yard season. If he accomplishes the feat on Sunday in Philadelphia, it would make him the first undrafted player in Cowboys history to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. Since Week 9, Dowdle ranks second in the NFL with 494 rushing yards after contract, trailing only Saquon Barkley's 566 in that span, according to Pro Football Focus. Dallas Cowboys three-time All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons knows he gave the Philadelphia Eagles (12-3), Dallas' Week 17 opponent, bulletin board material last week. \"Nah, at this point, it's f--- Philly, now,\" Parsons said on Dec. 19. \"Even if we got eliminated, like, I got to crush Philly. F--- them. I hate them now. I be seeing them just talking so much on socials. I don't know, my Twitter page got consumed by Philly [fans]. Man, ugh. They say don't look forward to some things, but I'm excited about the matchup [next week in Week 17], too.\" This Thursday, he acknowledged that beating the Eagles on Sunday would \"probably\" make their year. \"That probably makes the year you know what I'm saying? That sets everything off,\" Parsons said when asked how it would feel to beat the Eagles on Sunday. \"Us getting that win, away game in Philly. Knowing how they're trying to get the No. 1 seed. Can set them back a little bit. They're fighting for everything. They're fighting for where they want to be in the playoffs. We're just fighting to whoop them. They got more to lose than we do, so that'll be a great feeling right there.\" Check out his full remarks below. After two consecutive losses in Rush's first two starts this season versus the Eagles (34-6) and versus the Houston Texans (34-10), Dallas has won four of their last five games with Rush under center. His play has definitely picked up in this stretch. Rush has thrown for nine touchdowns and just one interception while averaging 226.2 passing yards per game and 6.9 yards per pass attempt with a 64.4% completion percentage in that stretch. That's good for a 100.5 passer rating since Week 12, 12th in the league in that span. The Dallas Cowboys have won and covered in four of their last five games. Cowboys Last 5 Games Covered? Week 12 +10.5 at Commanders Yes Week 13 -4 vs Giants Yes Week 14 +4.5 vs Bengals No Week 15 +2.5 at Panthers Yes Week 16 +4.5 vs Buccaneers Yes The Dallas Cowboys (7-8), who were eliminated from postseason contention last week, have gotten hot of late with victories in four of their last five games. Despite being eliminated, head coach Mike McCarthy and his staff, who are in the final season of their current coaching contracts, aren't looking to simply play the young guys. Their mindset is still to seek wins first and foremost, which is why McCarthy is still starting a 31-year-old career backup in Cooper Rush over 2021 third overall pick quarterback Trey Lance. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. PHILADELPHIA -- In a battle of backup quarterbacks, the host Philadelphia Eagles (13-3) had the definitive edge over the Dallas Cowboys (7-9) as they dominated in a decisive 41-7 Week 17 victory. They clinched the 2024 NFC East division title with the win. It's their first division title since 2022, a year that ended with them as the Super Bowl runner up. It's also their 11th NFC East division title since 2001, which is the most in the division in that span. Philadelphia also now has their fourth ever 13-win season, which is key because they have reached the Super Bowl in each of the last three occurrences (2004, 2017, 2022). After two three-and-outs to start the game, the Eagles scored on their next six drives -- four touchdowns and two field goals. Philadelphia also secured its first sweep of the Cowboys since 2011. Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett, the 2022 first-round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers who is filling in for an injured Jalen Hurts (concussion), produced a strong performance. He threw for 143 yards and a touchdown on 10 of 15 passing while adding a 1-yard rushing score via the tush push to end the first half. He threw a 22-yard scoring strike to Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith with 6:38 left in the half after Smith cooked backup Cowboys corner Andrew Booth by multiple steps for the touchdown. Pickett exited the game early in the third quarter after aggravating his ribs injury on a late hit by Dallas defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa, who was penalized for roughing the passer. He clearly hit Pickett late after the football was gone. As a result, Eagles third-string quarterback Tanner McKee, a 2023 sixth-round pick out of Stanford, subbed into the game. McKee's first full drive ended with him throwing his first NFL regular-season touchdown pass to Eagles No. 1 receiver A.J. Brown on a 20-yard scoring strike. Brown got a stop on Cowboys All-Pro corner DaRon Bland, and McKee threw a perfectly placed pass over Brown's outside shoulder for the touchdown. That increased the Eagles' lead to 34-7 over the Cowboys with 2:44 left in the third quarter. He then hit Smith on an underneath throw, and he took the football all the way to the house with ease for a 25-yard receiving touchdown. McKee finished with 54 yards passing and two touchdowns on 3 of 4 passing, and Smith totaled 120 yards receiving and two touchdowns on six catches. Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush, their eight-year veteran backup who is filling in for an injured Dak Prescott (hamstring tear), played slightly better than his first start of the season back in Week 10, a 34-6 home defeat against the Eagles. He threw a 69-yard pick six to Philadelphia safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson on the opening drive of the game, but he bounced back to throw a 4-yard goal-line fade touchdown to Dallas wide receiver Jalen Tolbert on the game's second possession. At the end of the first half, Rush sailed a deep throw intended for wide receiver Brandin Cooks on third-and-5, and Gardner-Johnson picked him off for the second time. He returned the football down to the Eagles' 35-yard line with 36 seconds left in the half. It's Gardner-Johnson's second career game with multiple interceptions, and both have come against the Cowboys. Rush finished the game with 147 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions on 15 of 28 passing. With a massive lead, 2024 NFL rushing yards leader Saquon Barkley was able to take over in the second half. He went off for 167 yards on 31 carries Sunday afternoon to become the ninth player in NFL history to register at least 2,000 rushing yards in a single season. Here are the five main takeaways from the Eagles' Week 17 victory: The Eagles defense took a massive hit once Gardner-Johnson was ejected from last Sunday's loss to the Washington Commanders as a result of two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Gardner-Johnson's ejection certainly affected how the Eagles defense played Jayden Daniels, who was 16 of 24 for 150 yards and three touchdowns to one interception (105.9 passer rating) after the defender's disqualification. The Commanders scored 22 fourth-quarter points in the comeback victory, all with Gardner-Johnson off the field. Gardner-Johnson was back for this game and made an impact on the first series. On third-and-3 from the Eagles' 35-yard line, Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush threw a pass across the middle of the field and Gardner-Johnson read it for the interception. He took the takeaway 69 yards the other way for a touchdown to give the Eagles an early 7-0 lead with 11:55 remaining in the first quarter. Gardner-Johnson later had his second interception that set the Eagles up for a touchdown in the final seconds of the first half. The Eagles had three takeaways in the first half, all of which led to points. Even when Gardner-Johnson is struggling in coverage, he's making turnover-worthy plays for the Eagles to change the course of a game. In 28 games with the Eagles, Gardner-Johnson has 12 interceptions (6+ in each season played). He's a difference maker on this defense. Whatever the scripted game plan was in the first quarter of Pickett's start (filling in for Jalen Hurts as he was ruled out with a concussion), it wasn't what the Eagles were hoping for. A Landon Dickerson false start on the first play based the Eagles up to a first-and-15. Two incomplete passes and a checkdown to Kenneth Gainwell resulted in the first Eagles three-and-out. On the Eagles' second offensive possession, Pickett didn't even throw the football. With DeVonta Smith on the sidelines (wrist injury), the Eagles had Saquon Barkley carry the ball on three consecutive plays -- one via direct snap -- before choosing to punt on fourth-and-1 on their own 46-yard line. The decision to punt showed a lack of trust in Pickett to get the first down, with his arm or legs, or hand the ball off and get the first down. Six plays for 14 yards on the Eagles' first two series, and a lack of trust in Pickett. Different quarterback, same slow start. The Eagles opened things up for Pickett on the third drive, as he went 6 of 6 for 72 yards and a touchdown -- a 22-yard pass to DeVonta Smith. In the second quarter, 8 of 11 for 128 yards with a touchdown for a 141.5 passer rating. This doesn't include the rushing touchdown he had to get the Eagles up 24-7 at halftime. Pickett found an early connection with Smith once the Eagles opened up the passing game, hitting him three times for 74 yards and a score -- including a 49-yard pass to Smith that resulted in the 1-yard touchdown run just before the half. While it took the Eagles three series to get Pickett comfortable, opening things up for the quarterback certainly sparked the offense. Pickett left the game with a rib injury in the third quarter, yet the Eagles offense didn't miss a beat once third-string quarterback Tanner McKee entered the game. McKee, elevated to the No. 2 quarterback with Hurts out, threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to A.J. brown to put the Eagles up 34-7 late in the third quarter. The Eagles had a run-heavy offense once McKee entered the game with a big lead, yet he went 2 of 3 for 29 yards and a touchdown pass to Brown on his first series. He then followed with a 25-yard touchdown pass to DeVonta Smith on his second series, going 3 of 4 for 54 yards and two touchdowns for a 154.2 rating on his first two series. Whether it was Pickett or McKee, the Eagles offense was clicking from the second quarter on. Barkley reached the 2,000-yard rushing plateau on Sunday, becoming the ninth running back to amass 2,000 rushing yards in a season. He's eighth all-time for rushing yards in a season with 2,005. The chase is officially on in regards to Dickerson's record. Barkley finished with 31 carries for 167 yards, averaging 5.4 yards per carry. putting himself in striking distance of the mark. Dickerson rushed for 2,105 yards in 1984 and Barkley is 101 yards away from passing him. Barkley is averaging 125.3 rushing yards per game this season, which would put him on pace to pass Dickerson. Will the Eagles play him in Week 18? The 2,000-yard plateau was a goal of Barkley's and he achieved it. Just 101 yards away from Dickerson is approachable, even if the Eagles do play a meaningless game in Week 18. One of the hardest records in sports is Dickerson's rushing record. This mark can be broken if the Eagles decide to play barkley in Week 18, but it will likely be his call. The Cowboys have inserted 2021 third overall pick quarterback Trey Lance into the game with 2:24 left to play. Cowboys wide receiver Jalen Brooks and Cowboys cornerback Troy Pride, along with Eagles cornerback Sidney Brown, were ejected for fighting. Cowboys All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey drills a 61-yard field goal off the right upright for a missed field goal. The Eagles take over at the Cowboys' 49 up 41-7 with 4:40 left to play. Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith caught an underneath pass from Tanner McKee and left the Dallas defense in the dust for a 25-yard receiving touchdown, his second score of the day. The Eagles lead 41-7 with 10:03 left to play. Utter domination. Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is now up to 2,005 rushing yards, and he is the ninth player in NFL history to run for over 2,000 yards in a single season. Dallas commits their fourth turnover of the day with running back Rico Dowdle fumbling on third-and-5. Philadelphia linebacker Nolan Smith forced the fumble, and Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean recovered the loose ball. Philadelphia takes over at their own 25 up 34-7 with 14:20 left in the game. Tanner McKee threw his first NFL regular season touchdown pass to Eagles No. 1 receiver A.J. Brown for a 20-yard scoring strike. Brown got a step on Cowboys All-Pro corner DaRon Bland, and McKee threw a perfectly placed pass over Brown's outside shoulder for the touchdown. The Eagles lead 34-7 over the Cowboys with 2:44 left in the third quarter. Eagles backup quarterback Kenny Pickett (ribs) is officially questionable to return. He initially suffered a ribs injury a week ago against the Washington Commanders. Third-string quarterback Tanner McKee is primed to lead this drive after the Cowboys went run-run-pass for a three-and-out on their latest drive. The Eagles lead 27-7 with 6:34 left in the third quarter. An A.J. Brown receiving touchdown gets nullified by a holding penalty on Landon Dickerson trying to contain Cowboys All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons. Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett suffered an injury on the play, and Philadelphia subbed in third-stringer Tanner McKee to take the snap on third-and-goal from the Cowboys' 17. He handed off to Barkley for a gain of nine, and the Eagles took three more points on a 26-yard field goal. Philadelphia leads 27-7 with 8:03 left in the third quarter. The Eagles are marching up the field with ease to start the second half. Following a near interception by Pickett, it's been all runs by Saquon Barkley. A disaster for Dallas on their last drive of the half. Quarterback Cooper Rush sailed a deep throw intended for wide receiver Brandin Cooks on third-and-5, and Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson picked off Rush for the second time. He returned the football down to the Eagles' 35 with 36 seconds left in the half. It's Gardner-Johnson's second career game with multiple interceptions, and both have come against the Cowboys. Philly extends their lead to 10, 17-7, following Jake Elliott's 31-yard field. They can double dip with points since they start the second half with the football. Dallas has 1:55 on the clock and one timeout left. The Cowboys commit their second turnover of the half with tight end Jake Ferguson getting stripped by Eagles linebacker Oren Burks. Philadelphia defensive tackle Jordan Davis recovered the loose ball for the takeaway. Philadelphia takes over at the Cowboys' 39 up 14-7 with 6:27 left to play. The Eagles crowd is now chanting \"Dallas sucks.\" Dallas' lack of depth at cornerback because of injuries was just on full display. Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith cooked backup corner Andrew Booth with ease, getting open by multiple steps, which is how Philadelphia fill-in quarterback Kenny Pickett was able to hit him for a 22-yard touchdown. Philadelphia is back in front by seven, 14-7, with 6:38 left in the first half. The Cowboys take a deep shot down the left sideline to wide receiver Jonathan Mingo on third-and-1 instead of running with Dowdle, and it doesn't work. Mingo cooked Eagles first-round rookie corner Quinyon Mitchell, but he couldn't track Rush's throw. That led to the football harmlessly hitting the ground for an incompletion. Dallas punts it away, and Philadelphia fair-caught the football at their own 19. It's seven to seven with 12:49 left in the first half. After NFL rushing yards leader Saquon Barkley didn't touch the football on the Eagles' opening drive, the Eagles gave up three consecutives runs. However, he netted nine yards, and the Eagles punted the football away for a touchback. Philadelphia decided they would take their chances vs. Cooper Rush instead of potentially giving Dallas a short field if they bungled a fourth down attempt with Kenny Pickett at quarterback. It's a 7-7 game with 56 seconds left in the first quarter. Dallas goes three-and-out up against their own goal line, and they punt it away. The Cowboys got good hang time on the punt, so they were able to limit returner Cooper DeJean to just a yard on the return. The Eagles will have their second offensive possession starting at their own 37 in a 7-7 game with 2:48 left in the first quarter. Following a first down false start penalty, Eagle backup quarterback Kenny Pickett threw two consecutive incompletions, and then a short five-yarder to running back Kenneth Gainwell. Philadelphia goes three-and-out to start, and Dallas gets the football back on their own nine after a 52-yard punt by the Eagles. Eagles edge rusher Bryce Huff (shoulder) is questionable to return. Cooper Rush bounced back in a big way from his pick-six by capping the Cowboys' ensuing drive with a four-yard touchdown pass on a goal line fade to wide receiver Jalen Tolbert. Dallas continues to fight for head coach Mike McCarthy. This game is tied at seven with 5:38 left in the first quarter. Kenny Pickett and the Eagles offense will take the field for the first time today up next. With All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb out, Brandin Cooks is the Cowboys' clear cut No. 1 option in the passing game early on. Quarterback Cooper Rush has targeted him five times already, and Cooks has hauled in two of them for 38 yards, including 22 yards on the last play to move the chains on a third-and-9. Cooper Rush had been on a roll with wins in four of the last five games, which included a stretch of nine touchdowns to one interception, but he makes a critical error on the opening drive. He looked to force the football to Brandin Cooks on a third-and-3, but Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson jumped the route and took it all the way back for a 69-yard pick-six. It's Philadelphia's first defensive touchdown of the season, and the Eagles now lead 7-0 with 11:43 left in the first quarter. The Cowboys offense led by quarterback Cooper Rush and running back Rico Dowdle start with the football first. Cowboys three-time All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons has helped power a defensive renaissance in Dallas sparked by his return from his high ankle sprain along with an increased comfort in defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer's scheme in his first season working with the Cowboys defense after playing the last three under Dan Quinn, who is now the Washington Commanders head coach.

With just one more made field goal on Sunday in Philadelphia, Aubrey will set the franchise single season record for makes in a season, which would break a tie with his own record of 36 that he set in his first year last season in 2023.

Saquon Barkley eclipsed the 2,000-yard mark on a 23-yard run in the fourth quarter and the franchise-record (2,146 by LeSean McCoy in 2013) for scrimmage yards in a season early in the game. He needed 33 yards to break the scrimmage record going into today. \"I'm not going to lie, but just being a fan of the game and the running back position, to reach a milestone and put myself up there with eight other backs that I respect, and some of them I grew up watching, definitely means a lot. But at the same time, I wouldn't be able to do that without this team. Like I said, you can't be great without the greatness of others, and I'm just happy I was able to be a part of the team and be able to reach a milestone like that,\" Barkley said after the game. Philadelphia was without star quarterback Jalen Hurts, who suffered a concussion last week against Washington. Linebacker Nakobe Dean was also out with an abdomen injury. Kenny Pickett made his first start as an Eagle and went 10/15 for 143 yards and touchdown before leaving the game with a rib injury. Tanner McKee came in for the second half as the Eagles held a big lead and went 3/4 for 54 yards and two touchdowns.

Get ready for a home playoff game at Lincoln Financial Field during Wild Card Weekend. The Eagles' 41-7 triumph over the rival Cowboys featured everything that has made this a 13-win team with one week remaining in the regular season. Pickett and McKee combined for three touchdowns and a 141.9 passer rating in the 41-7 win. Linebacker Nakobe Dean is out with an abdomen injury. The Eagles (12-3) return to Lincoln Financial Field for the first of two home games to close out the regular season. A win guarantees more company at home into the postseason, while Dallas (7-8) is relishing the role of spoiler. The Eagles can clinch the NFC East with a win or tie on Sunday. This is the second straight year that Allen is among the 15 finalists for induction into Canton. The Eagles also elevated running back Tyrion Davis-Price and linebacker Dallas Gant from the practice squad for Sunday's game. Britain Covey, Jalen Hurts, and Will Shipley are out for Sunday. Nakobe Dean is doubtful with an abdomen injury. Pickett was a full participant in Thursday's practice as Jalen Hurts remains in the concussion protocol. Copyright © 2024 Philadelphia Eagles.

                "content": "Saquon Rasul Quevis Barkley[1] (/ˈseɪkwɒn/ SAY-kwon; born February 9, 1997) is an American professional football running back for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions, where he set several school records for his offensive production over three seasons, before forgoing his senior year to enter the NFL. In 2017, Barkley finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting with 304 total votes, third in Maxwell Award voting, and received multiple national and Big Ten Conference awards and recognition. During his three-year collegiate career, Barkley set Penn State records for most all-purpose career yards (5,538), most career rushing touchdowns (43), most career receiving yards by a running back (1,157), most rushing yards by a freshman and sophomore, and most total yards in a single game. Barkley was selected second overall by the New York Giants in the 2018 NFL draft, setting several NFL and team records en route to making the 2018 Pro Bowl and being named the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. He confronted injuries in the 2020 season, but was again named to the Pro Bowl in 2022. A free agent following the 2023 season, Barkley signed a three-year deal with the Eagles, setting numerous franchise records and rushing for over 2,000 yards. Barkley was born in Bronx, New York, the son of Alibay Barkley, a boxer, and Tonya Johnson. He has three brothers and two sisters. His brother Alibay Jr. was a baseball player drafted by the Los Angeles Angels, and his great uncle is former WBC middleweight champion Iran Barkley.[2] In 2001, Barkley and his family moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley in search of a safer and more suburban environment.[3] The family later moved to neighboring Allentown and, in 2005, to Coplay, Pennsylvania.[4] Barkley attended Whitehall High School in Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania, which competes in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, an elite division of large high schools in the Lehigh Valley and Poconos known nationally for producing a large number of NFL and other professional athletes.[5] At Whitehall High School, Barkley rushed for 3,646 yards with 63 touchdowns from his sophomore to senior year, including 1,856 yards and 31 touchdowns as a senior.[6] Barkley was rated as a four-star recruit and committed to Penn State to play college football.[7][8] He originally committed to Rutgers before changing to Penn State.[9] In addition to football, Barkley also lettered in basketball and track and field at Whitehall. As a senior in 2015, he won Eastern Pennsylvania Conference gold medals in both the 100-meter dash (11.15 seconds) and in the long jump (22'2.5\" or 6.77m) at the PIAA District 11 meet, where he also earned a second-place finish in the 100-meter dash with a time of 10.90 seconds, which set a Whitehall High School record.[10] Later in the track and field season, Barkley set personal best marks of 46'2.5\" (14.08m) in the shot put and 6'0\" (1.83m) in the high jump.[11] Barkley was considered a top NCAA Division I football prospect and received multiple football scholarship offers, including from Missouri, North Carolina, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Pitt, Rutgers, Syracuse, and Temple. He chose to accept an offer from Penn State.[12] Sources: On September 10, 2021, Whitehall High School retired Barkley's jersey number (#21). Earlier, the school had retired the jersey numbers of two other alumni who went on to have successful NFL careers: Matt Millen, who played from 1980 until 1991 with the Oakland and Los Angeles Raiders, the San Francisco 49ers, and the Washington Redskins; and Dan Koppen, who played from 2003 until 2013 with the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos.[13] At Penn State, Barkley earned immediate playing time as a true freshman in 2015.[14] After rushing for one yard on one carry during his first game, he rushed for 115 yards with a touchdown in his second game against Buffalo.[15] He followed up that performance by rushing for 195 yards and two touchdowns on 21 carries in his third game against Rutgers.[16] In October, he missed two games due to injury.[17] In his first game back against top-ranked Ohio State on October 17, 2015, he rushed for 194 yards on 26 carries.[18][19] During his freshman year at Penn State in 2015, Barkley rushed for 1,076 yards on 182 carries.[20] During the offseason, Barkley received praise for his freshman year performance and was awarded second-team All-Big Ten with some votes for first team status and being named BTN.com Freshman of the Year.[21] In the first game of his sophomore year at Penn State in 2016, Barkley rushed for 105 yards and a touchdown in a 33–13 win over Kent State.[22] In week two, in a renewed rivalry game against Pitt, Penn State trailed in the second quarter 28–7 before Barkley led Penn State back, scoring five touchdowns with his fifth coming with 5:00 left in the fourth quarter, to bring the Nittany Lions within three points. However, quarterback Trace McSorley threw an interception in the Pitt end zone with 1:41 left that denied the Nittany Lions' hopes of completing the comeback.[23] In week five against Minnesota, in what would become a recurring theme for the 2016 Penn State football team, Penn State again was forced to come back from a halftime deficit. In overtime, after being held to only 38 yards on 19 carries during regular playing time, Barkley's first play in overtime, a 25-yard touchdown run, gave Penn State the victory.[24] In week six against Maryland, Barkley had his first ever 200-yard rushing game at Penn State, finishing with 31 carries for 202 yards and one touchdown.[25] In week seven, in a matchup versus Ohio State, Barkley rushed for 99 yards on 12 carries with one 37 yard run in a 24–21 win over the second ranked Buckeyes.[26] In week eight, Barkley and no. 24 Penn State scored a season high 62 points versus Purdue as Barkley rushed for a career-high 207 yards and a career-high long 81 yard run, along with 70 yards in receiving yards and two touchdowns, giving him a total of 277 yards in the game. Penn State defeated Purdue 62–24 and improved to 6–2 and 4–1 in Big Ten play.[27] On November 1, 2016, Barkley was named a semi-finalist for the Maxwell Award, granted to the all-around best collegiate football player of the year.[28] On November 5, Barkley rushed for 167 yards and a touchdown against Iowa. He added 44 yards and another touchdown in receiving for a total of 211 all-purpose yards in Penn State's 41–14 victory.[29] After the regular season, Barkley was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, Ameche–Dayne Running Back of the Year and First Team All-Big Ten.[30] On December 3, 2016, Barkley had 19 carries for 83 yards, rushed for a touchdown, and caught another touchdown on a wheel route. His efforts helped Penn State recover from a 28–7 deficit to stun Wisconsin, 38–31, in the 2016 Big Ten Championship Game.[31] In the 2017 Rose Bowl on January 2, Barkley had 25 carries for 194 yards, averaging 7.8 yards per carry, including a 79-yard rushing touchdown that gave Penn State a 28–27 lead. After trailing 13–0, Penn State scored seven touchdowns on seven consecutive possessions, including four touchdowns on four consecutive offensive plays, including Barkley's 79-yard touchdown. Barkley scored the first, fourth, and seventh touchdowns for Penn State, giving the Nittany Lions a 49–35 lead in the fourth quarter, though USC ultimately went on to win the game, 52–49.[32] At the close of his sophomore year at Penn State, Barkley had set Penn State records for most rushing yards in a season by a freshman (1,076) and by a sophomore (1,496). In the first game of the 2017 season against Akron, Barkley ran 14 times for 172 yards, two rushing touchdowns, and a long run of 80 yards. He also caught two passes for 54 receiving yards. For his efforts, Barkley was named co-Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week.[33] In Penn State's 2017 Big Ten opener, at Iowa, Barkley led Penn State to a 21–19 win, recording 358 all-purpose yards. He also set a school record for most all-purpose yards in a single game, recording 211 rushing yards, a rushing touchdown, 94 receiving yards, and 53 kick return yards.[34] For his efforts, Barkley was again named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week.[35] In the first Big Ten home game of his junior year against the Indiana, Barkley rushed 20 times for just 56 yards, an unusually underwhelming rushing day for him. Despite this, he still had a major impact on the game, returning the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown, catching four passes for 52 yards, and throwing a 16-yard pass to receiver DaeSean Hamilton late in the fourth quarter to cap a 45–14 Penn State win. This made Barkley the first player in Big Ten history to record a return and passing touchdown in the same game.[36] Barkley was named Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week.[36] One month later against Ohio State, Barkley again returned the opening kickoff back 97 yards for a touchdown, but was limited for the rest of the game recording 44 rushing yards on 21 carries, 36 of which came on a touchdown run in the second quarter.[37] In his final collegiate game at Penn State, Barkley rushed for 137 yards and scored two touchdowns, one of them a 92-yard effort to put Penn State up 28–7 over the Washington Huskies in the 2017 Fiesta Bowl, which Penn State went on to win 35–28.[38] On December 31, 2017, following Penn State's Fiesta Bowl victory, Barkley declared his intention to forgo his senior year at Penn State and enter the 2018 NFL draft.[39] Penn State: Entering the 2018 NFL draft, Barkley was widely projected to be a top 10 NFL pick.[39] In the weeks leading up to the NFL Combine, Barkley's stock rose even higher. By late February 2018, some mock drafts projected him as high as the second selection overall,[64] the highest for a running back since Reggie Bush in 2006. ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr., who has history of not supporting the selection of running backs in the NFL draft's first round, said \"Barkley is a once in a lifetime talent; teams that pass on this young man will be sorry.\"[65] At the combine, Barkley had a performance that was widely praised, running a 4.4 second 40-yard dash and doing 29 bench presses of 225 pound weight, tying for the most reps by any running back at this combine.[66] According to NFL analyst Ian Rapoport, the Cleveland Browns were \"strongly considering\" drafting Barkley first overall, which would have made him the first running back since Ki-Jana Carter in 1995 to be selected first overall.[67] Barkley was selected by the New York Giants with the second overall selection in the 2018 draft.[69] On July 22, 2018, Barkley signed a four-year rookie contract, worth $31.2 million fully guaranteed.[70] Barkley scored his first NFL touchdown, a 68-yard rush, in the season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Overall in his first NFL game, he rushed for 106 yards and scored a touchdown in the Giants' 20–15 loss.[71] The following week, in a 20–13 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, Barkley recorded 14 receptions, setting a Giants' all-time franchise record for most catches in a game. He also tied the NFL single game record for most catches in a game by an NFL rookie.[72] In Week 3, in the Giants' 27–22 victory over the Houston Texans, Barkley recorded 82 rushing yards, rushed for a touchdown, and caught five passes for 35 receiving yards.[73] The following week, in the Giants' loss to the New Orleans Saints, Barkley recorded 100 scrimmage yards with 44 rushing yards and 56 receiving yards and a rushing touchdown.[74] In Week 5, against the Carolina Panthers, he recorded four receptions for 81 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns and rushed for 48 yards in the Giants' 33–31 loss.[75] In the Giants' Week 6 Thursday Night Football game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Barkley finished with 130 rushing yards, including a 50-yard touchdown and 99 receiving yards, totaling 229 all-purpose yards in the Giants 34–13 loss to Philadelphia.[76] In Week 11 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Barkley rushed for his NFL career-high to date with 142 yards and three touchdowns as the Giants won 38–35,[77][78] and for his efforts he was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[79] In Week 12's 25–22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Barkley rushed for 101 yards and scored a 51-yard touchdown, becoming the first player since John Fuqua in 1970 to rush for two 50-plus yard touchdowns against the Eagles in a single season.[80][81] In Week 13 against the Chicago Bears, Barkley had 125 rushing yards and three receptions for 21 yards in the 30–27 overtime win.[82][83] During Week 14, in the Giants' 40–16 win over the Redskins, Barkley rushed for 170 yards, including a 78-yard touchdown, becoming the first Giants rookie to surpass 1,000 rushing yards in a season, and setting the franchise's single-season record for rookies with 15 touchdowns scored.[84] In the regular season finale against the Dallas Cowboys, Barkley had 17 carries for 109 yards, his seventh game with over 100 rushing yards on the season, and he scored a touchdown in the Giants' 36–35 loss.[85] In recognition of his rookie season accomplishments, Barkley was elected to the 2019 Pro Bowl, where he helped the NFC win the Skills Showdown.[86] Barkley received numerous awards during and after his rookie season, including Pepsi Rookie of the Year,[87] FedEx Ground NFL Player of the Year,[88] AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year[89] and was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team and AP All-Rookie teams.[90] Entering his second NFL season, Barkley was ranked No. 16 on the NFL's Top 100 players for 2019.[91][92] Barkley was chosen by his teammates as one of seven team captains for the 2019 season, an honor rarely bestowed on players after only one year on the team.[93] In Week 1 against the Cowboys, Barkley rushed 11 times for 120 yards, including a 59-yard run, in the Giants' 35–17 loss.[94] In this game, he fumbled the ball for the first time in his NFL career.

Barkley's 0.4 yards per attempt was a career low.[105] During the following week's 17–13 loss to the Bears, Barkley was carted off the field after suffering a knee injury, which was later diagnosed as a torn anterior cruciate ligament, which ended his 2020 season.[106][107] During the game, Barkley rushed to the right and engaged with Bears safety Eddie Jackson, who wrestled him down to the ground near the sideline at the end of a six-yard run. Barkley immediately grabbed the back of his right knee and removed his helmet.[108] Jackson later voiced his concern on Twitter, sending prayers and support.[109] Barkley was placed on injured reserve on September 22, 2020.[110] On April 28, 2021, the Giants picked up the fifth-year option on Barkley's contract,[111] worth a guaranteed $7.217 million for the 2022 season.[112] In Week 5 against the Dallas Cowboys, Barkley's foot landed on Jourdan Lewis and his ankle rolled.[113] On November 3, 2021, the Giants announced that Barkley was being placed in the NFL's COVID-19 protocol.[114] In the 2021 season, Barkley had 593 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, 41 receptions, 263 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in 13 games.[115] Against the Tennessee Titans in Week 1, Barkley rushed for 164 yards, a touchdown, and caught six passes for 30 yards in the 21–20 comeback win. He converted the go-ahead two point conversion late in the fourth quarter.[116] Barkley's performance on Sunday resulted in him receiving the NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[117] In Week 3, Barkley had 126 scrimmage yards and a rushing touchdown in the 23–16 loss to the Cowboys.[118] In Week 4, Barkley had 146 rushing yards in the 20–12 victory over the Bears.[119] He was named to the Pro Bowl.[120] In Week 10 against the Texans, he had 35 carries for 152 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 24–16 victory.[121] Overall, he finished the 2022 season with 295 carries for 1,312 rushing yards and ten rushing touchdowns to go along with 57 receptions for 338 receiving yards.[122] He finished fourth in the NFL and first in the NFC in rushing yards.[123] In the Wild Card Round of the playoffs, he had 109 scrimmage yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 31–24 victory over the Minnesota Vikings.[124] He was ranked 31st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[125] On March 7, 2023, the Giants placed the non-exclusive franchise tag on Barkley.[126] He signed the franchise tag after it was adjusted to add a $2 million signing bonus and incentives on July 26.[127][128] During Week 8 against the New York Jets, Barkley finished with 128 rushing yards on 36 carries as the Giants lost 10–13 in overtime.[129] In Week 11 against the Commanders, he had 140 scrimmage yards and two receiving touchdowns in the victory.[130] In Week 18 against Philadelphia, he had two rushing touchdowns in the victory.[131] He finished the 2023 season with 247 carries for 962 rushing yards and six rushing touchdowns to go with 41 receptions for 280 receiving yards and four receiving touchdowns in 14 games and starts.[132] On March 13, 2024, Barkley signed a three-year $37.75 million deal with the Philadelphia Eagles, of which $26 million is guaranteed and could increase to $46.75 million with bonuses.[133][134] Prior to signing with the Eagles, Barkley admitted he was \"fed up\" with negotiations with the Giants, calling their approach \"a little disrespectful.\" He felt slighted by the team's insistence that he prove his value on the open market, which he described as a \"slap in the face.\"[135] In his Eagles debut, Barkley rushed for 109 yards with two rushing touchdowns and a receiving touchdown in a 34–29 victory over the Green Bay Packers, becoming the first Eagles player to score three touchdowns in their debut with the team since Terrell Owens in 2004.[136] His performance earned him NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[137] The following week against the Falcons, Barkley rushed for 95 yards and caught four of five passes for 21 yards, but a late fourth-quarter drop that could have sealed the win for the Eagles proved costly as they lost 22–21.[138] Barkley had 17 carries for 147 yards and scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to lead the Eagles to a 15–12 win over the Saints in Week 3.[139] Barkley made his return to MetLife Stadium against the Giants in Week 7, rushing for 176 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries in a 28–3 victory over his former team.

                "content": "The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, an arena they share with the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League.[10] The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA with 17 championships, the second most in the league behind the Boston Celtics.[11] The franchise began in 1946 as the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL).[12] After one season, a new ownership relocated the team to Minneapolis, Minnesota,[13][12] and renamed the team as the Minneapolis Lakers.[14] The Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America, where they won the 1949 BAA championship. Following the merger of the NBL and the BAA into the NBA in 1949, the Lakers won four of the next five NBA championships.[15] After struggling financially in the late 1950s, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season. The Lakers made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost every series to the Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain, and won their sixth NBA title in 1972, led by coach Bill Sharman. After the retirement of Chamberlain, the team traded for superstar Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Two big changes came in 1979, first, Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers, and pioneered a vision of basketball as entertainment as well as sport.[16] Second, the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson first overall in the 1979 NBA draft. The combination of Johnson, a prodigy point guard, and dominant center in Abdul-Jabbar provided the Lakers with superstars to anchor their roster. The promotion of head coach Pat Riley in 1981 and addition of forward James Worthy through the 1982 draft established the Lakers as an NBA powerhouse throughout the 1980s. The franchise won five championships in a nine-year span, including two out of three marquee Finals matchups against the Celtics. The Lakers were defeated by their Boston archrivals in the 1984 Finals, but triumphed over them in 1985 and 1987. After Riley departed and Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, and Worthy retired, the Lakers struggled in the early 1990s. It was not until 1996 when the team traded with the Charlotte Hornets for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant and signed center Shaquille O'Neal that the Lakers returned to dominance during the early 2000s. The superstar duo, along with Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, led the Lakers to three consecutive championships between 2000 and 2002, securing the franchise's second \"three-peat\".[17] The dynamic \"Shaq-and-Kobe\" era ended when the Lakers traded away O'Neal after the team lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 Finals. It was not until the Lakers traded for Pau Gasol that Bryant and Jackson returned to the NBA Finals, losing to the Celtics in 2008 but winning championships in 2009 and 2010. The 2010 Finals marked the latest matchup of the Lakers and Celtics, with Los Angeles winning its 16th title. Jackson retired in 2011, and the Lakers endured their longest playoff drought in franchise history. Gasol departed in 2014, and Bryant retired in 2016. After rebuilding seasons with young, highly rated prospects, the Lakers signed superstar LeBron James in 2018.[18] In 2019, the team traded several of those prospects for star big man Anthony Davis.[19] The Lakers—led by James, Davis, and coach Frank Vogel—won the team's 17th championship in 2020, tying the Celtics for the most titles until 2024.[20] The Lakers hold the record for NBA's longest winning streak, 33 straight games, set in 1971–72.[21] 26 Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles, while four have coached the team. Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, O'Neal, and Bryant won a combined eight NBA MVP awards with the Lakers.[22] The franchise was founded in 1946 as the Detroit Gems and played in the National Basketball League (NBL) during the 1946–47 season where it finished last in the league with only 4 wins in 44 games. Though the team was scheduled to continue in the NBL the following season,[23] its ownership, faced with high losses due to low attendance and lack of homecourt, decided on selling the team to Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota for $15,000[13][24] Minneapolis sportswriter Sid Hartman played a key behind-the-scenes role in helping put together the deal and later the team.[25] Inspired by Minnesota's nickname, \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\", the team rechristened themselves the Lakers.[26][27] Hartman helped them hire John Kundla from College of St. Thomas, to be their first head coach, by meeting with him and selling him on the team.[28][29] As the franchise had the worst record in the NBL the previous season, it got the first pick in the 1947 Professional Basketball League of America dispersal draft, which they used to select George Mikan. Led by Mikan, the Lakers had a solid roster, which also featured forward Jim Pollard and playmaker Herm Schaefer.[30] In their first season, they led the league with a 43–17 record, later winning the NBL championship that season.[31] In 1948, the Lakers moved from the NBL to the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and Mikan's 28.3 point per game (ppg) scoring average set a BAA record. In the 1949 BAA Finals they won the championship, beating the Washington Capitols four games to two.[32] Following the season, the BAA and the NBL merged to form the National Basketball Association (NBA).[33] In the newly formed league, the Lakers improved to 51–17 record and won their third straight professional championship.[34] In the 1950–51 season, Mikan won his third straight scoring title at 28.4 ppg and the Lakers went 44–24 to win their second straight division title.[35] One of those games, a 19–18 loss against the Fort Wayne Pistons, became infamous as the lowest scoring game in NBA history.[36] In the playoffs, they defeated the Indianapolis Olympians in three games but lost to the Rochester Royals in the next round.[30] During the 1951–52 season, the Lakers won 40 games, finishing second in their division.[37] They faced the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals, which they won in seven games.[38] In the 1952–53 season, Mikan led the NBA in rebounding, averaging 14.4 rebounds per game (rpg), and was named MVP of the 1953 NBA All-Star Game.[35] After a 48–22 regular season, the Lakers defeated the Fort Wayne Pistons in the Western playoffs to advance to the NBA Finals.[38] They then defeated the New York Knicks to win their second straight championship.[39] Though Lakers star George Mikan suffered from knee problems throughout the 1953–54 season, he was still able to average 18 ppg.[40] Clyde Lovellette, who was drafted in 1952, helped the team win the Western Division.[40] The team won its third straight championship in the 1950s and sixth in seven seasons when it defeated the Syracuse Nationals in seven games.[39] Following Mikan's retirement in the 1954 off-season, the Lakers struggled but still managed to win 40 games. Although they defeated the Rochester Royals in the first round of the playoffs, they were defeated by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the semifinals.[41] Although they had losing records the next two seasons, they made the playoffs each year.[37] Mikan came back for the last half of the 1955–56 season, but struggled and retired for good after the season.[42] Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956–57. The Lakers had one of the worst seasons in team history in 1957–58 when they won a league-low 19 games.[43] They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace Kundla. Mikan was fired in January when the team was 9–30, and Kundla was rehired.[37][44] The Lakers earned the top pick in the 1958 NBA draft and used it to select Elgin Baylor. Baylor, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year and co-MVP of the 1959 NBA All-Star Game, averaged 24.9 ppg and 15.0 rpg helping the Lakers improve to second in their division despite a 33–39 record.[45] After upsetting the Hawks in six games in the division finals, they returned to the NBA Finals, but were swept by the Celtics, beginning their long rivalry.[46] In their last year in Minneapolis, the Lakers went 25–50. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and traveling to St. Louis when their plane crash-landed.[49] Snow storms had driven the pilot 150 miles off course when he was forced to land in a cornfield. No one was hurt.[50] Their record earned them the number two pick in the 1960 NBA draft. The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia University.[51] During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles.[52] Led by Baylor's 34.8 ppg and 19.8 rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the year before in West's first season.[53] On November 15 that season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks while grabbing 25 rebounds.[54] In doing so, Baylor broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers made the playoffs.[37] They came within two points of the NBA Finals when they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.[55] Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8 ppg respectively,[56] the Lakers improved to 54–26 in 1961–62, and made the finals. In a game five victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61,[57] despite fouling out of the game.[58] The Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven.[56] Frank Selvy, after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game,[59][60] missed a potential game-winning 18 foot jump shot in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later.[60] Los Angeles won 53 games in 1962–63, behind Baylor's 34.0 ppg and West's 27.1 ppg[61] but lost in the NBA Finals in six games to the Celtics.[61] After falling to 42–38 and losing in the first round of the 1964 NBA playoffs to the Hawks, the team won 49 games in 1964–65. The Lakers surged past the Baltimore Bullets in the division finals, behind West's record-setting 46.3 ppg in the series.[62] They lost again to the Celtics in the Finals however, this time in five games.[63] Los Angeles lost in the finals to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points.[64] Down by 16 entering the fourth quarter, and 10 with a minute and a half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments, which fell just short.[65] After dropping to 36 wins and losing in the first round of the 1967 NBA playoffs, they lost in the finals to the Celtics again in 1968.[37] Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. On July 9, 1968, the team acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers.[67] In his first season as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league-leading 21.1 rpg.[68] West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, and Los Angeles won their division.[69] The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston for the first time in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry West's 53 points,[70] and had a 3–2 lead after five.[71] Boston won the series in seven games however,[72] and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons.[73] West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award.[74] In 1970, West won his first scoring title at 31.2 ppg, the team returned to the finals, and for the first time in 16 years, they did not have to face the Celtics; instead playing the New York Knicks, who defeated them 4–3.[75][76] The next season the Lakers were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks, led by future Laker Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in the Western Conference Finals.[77] The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner Jack Kent Cooke brought in Bill Sharman as head coach,[78] and Elgin Baylor announced his retirement early in the season after realizing that his legs were not healthy enough.[78] Sharman increased the team's discipline.[79] He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots.[80] They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December.[78] They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104.[81] By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in major American professional team sports.[82][83] The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96.[84] Chamberlain averaged a low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game.[85] West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game.[85] The team failed to score 100 points just once all year,[86] and at the end of the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year.[87] The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.[88][89] The Lakers won 60 games in the 1972–73 season, and took another Pacific Division title.[90] Wilt Chamberlain, playing in his final season, again led the league in rebounding and set the NBA record for field-goal percentage at 72.7% which stood for several decades.[90] The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven games in the conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals.[90] They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.[91] During the 1973–74 season, the team was hampered by the loss of West, who played only 31 games before his legs gave out.[92] Goodrich, averaging 25.3 points, helped the team to a late-season surge.[92] Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division.[92] They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.[93] After missing the playoffs in the 1974–75 season, the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVPs by that time.[94] Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade to either New York or Los Angeles.[95] He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played.[96] The Lakers struggled in January, going 3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.[96] West and Cooke settled their differences—and the former Laker's lawsuit—and Cooke hired him to replace Sharman as the team's coach.[97] West became upset, however, when Cooke refused to spend the money necessary to acquire forward Julius Erving, who the Nets were selling.[98] Behind another MVP season from Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles won the Pacific Division, finishing the 1976–77 season a league-best 53–29.[99] They defeated the Warriors in a seven-game series to open the postseason before being swept by Portland in the Western Conference Finals.[96] During the off-season, Los Angeles picked up Jamaal Wilkes from Golden State and signed first-round draft pick Norm Nixon. In the first two minutes of the first game of the 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar punched Bucks center Kent Benson for an overly aggressive elbow and broke his hand.[100] Two months later, a healthy Abdul-Jabbar got into an altercation with Houston Rockets center Kevin Kunnert after a rebound. The team's starting power forward, Kermit Washington, who was averaging 11.5 points and 11.2 rebounds,[101] entered the fight, and when Rudy Tomjanovich ran in from the bench to break up the action, Washington punched him in the face.[102] Tomjanovich nearly died from the punch, suffering a fractured skull and other facial injuries, which prematurely ended his playing career.[103] Washington, who stated that he assumed Tomjanovich was a combatant, was suspended for two months by the NBA, and released by the Lakers.[104] The team won 45 games despite being down a starter in Washington and not having Abdul-Jabbar for nearly two months, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to Seattle.[105] During the 1978–79 season, the team posted a 47–35 record but lost to the SuperSonics in the semifinal round of the playoffs.[96] In the 1979 NBA draft, Los Angeles selected 6-foot, 9-inch point guard Magic Johnson from Michigan State with the first overall pick.[106] It took Johnson's teammates time to acclimate themselves to his passing ability, as his \"no-look\" passes often caught them unaware. Once they adjusted, his passing became a key part of Los Angeles' offense.[107] The Lakers won 60 games in Johnson's rookie year, and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals. Johnson won the Finals MVP award, after starting at center for the injured Abdul-Jabbar in game six, and tallying 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists.[108] The team fell off in the 1980–81 season, though, as the Lakers lost Johnson for most of the season to a knee injury.[109] The team turned in a 54–28 record and finished second behind the Phoenix Suns in the Pacific Division.[109] The Rockets, led by Moses Malone, defeated Los Angeles in the first round of the playoffs.[109] Early in the 1981–82 season, Johnson complained to the media about head coach Paul Westhead and demanded a trade.[110] Westhead was fired shortly after Johnson's criticisms, and although Lakers' owner Jerry Buss stated that Johnson's comments did not factor into the decision, Johnson was vilified by the national media and booed both on the road and at home.[111][112][113] Buss promoted assistant coach Pat Riley to \"co-head coach\" with Jerry West (although West considered himself Riley's assistant) on November 19 and the team won 17 of its next 20 games.[109][114][115] Nicknamed \"Showtime\" due to the team's new Johnson-led fast break-offense, the Lakers won the Pacific Division title and swept both the Suns and Spurs in the 1982 playoffs.[116] Los Angeles stretched its postseason winning streak to nine games by taking the first contest of the NBA Finals from the 76ers.[109][117] The team won the Finals 4–2 to finish a 12–2 playoff run.[109] On draft night in 1982, the Lakers had the first overall pick (the result of a trade with Cleveland midway through the 1979–80 season, when the Lakers had sent Don Ford and a 1980 first-round pick to the Cavaliers for Butch Lee and their 1982 selection) and selected James Worthy from North Carolina.[118] The Lakers won the Pacific Division at 58–24, but Worthy suffered a leg injury in the last week of the season and missed the rest of the season.[119] Nevertheless, they advanced to play Philadelphia in the 1983 NBA Finals after defeating Portland and San Antonio.[119] The Sixers, however, won the series and the championship in four games.[118] After the season West replaced Sharman as the team's GM.[120] In the 1983–84 season, Los Angeles went 54–28, and played Boston in the Finals for the first time since 1969.[121] The Lakers won two of the first three games. However, Kevin McHale's hard clothesline foul of Lakers forward Kurt Rambis on a fast break is credited as a turning point of the series.[122] Boston won three of the next four to win the title and send Los Angeles's record to 0–8 in Finals series against the Celtics.[121] Using the past year's Finals defeat as motivation, the team won the Pacific Division for the fourth straight year and lost just two games in the Western Conference playoffs. In the NBA Finals, the Celtics were again the Lakers' final hurdle. Los Angeles lost game one of the NBA Finals by a score of 148–114, in what is remembered as the \"Memorial Day Massacre\".[123] The Lakers, behind 38-year-old Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar, recovered to defeat the Celtics in six games.[124] The team won the title in the Boston Garden and became the first visiting team to ever win an NBA championship in Boston, as the Golden State Warriors later achieved this feat in 2022.[123] In the 1985–86 season, the Lakers started 24–3 and went on to win 62 games and their fifth straight division title.[126] The Rockets, however, defeated the Lakers in five games in the Western Conference Finals. Houston won the series when Ralph Sampson hit a 20-foot jumper as time expired in game five at The Forum.[126] Prior to the 1986–87 season, the Lakers moved A.C. Green into the starting lineup, and acquired Mychal Thompson from the Spurs.[127] Johnson won his first career MVP Award while leading the Lakers to a 65–17 record,[127] and Michael Cooper was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year.[127] Before the season, Riley had made the decision to shift the focus of the offense to Johnson over the 40-year-old Abdul-Jabbar.[128] The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals by sweeping the Nuggets, defeating the Warriors in five games, and sweeping the SuperSonics in the Western Conference Finals.[129] The Lakers defeated Boston in the first two games of the Finals, and the teams split the next four games, giving Los Angeles their second championship in three seasons.[127] The series was highlighted by Johnson's running \"baby hook\" shot to win game four at Boston Garden with two seconds remaining.[130] Johnson was named the NBA Finals MVP, in addition to regular season MVP.[131] At the Lakers' championship celebration in Los Angeles, coach Riley brashly declared that Los Angeles would repeat as NBA champions,[127] which no team had done since the 1968–69 Boston Celtics. Looking to make good on Riley's promise in the 1987–88 season, the Lakers took their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title with a 62–20 record. They swept the Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Finals before pulling out a tough seven-game series win over the Utah Jazz led by youngsters Karl Malone and John Stockton. A seven-game Western Conference finals win over the Dallas Mavericks propelled the Lakers to the NBA Finals once again. In their seventh trip to the Finals in nine years, they met the Detroit Pistons. Los Angeles would take the series in seven games, and James Worthy's game seven triple-double earned him a Finals MVP award.[132] The win marked their fifth title in nine years, but would also mark their last title until 2000. In the 1988–89 season, Los Angeles won 57 games and their eighth consecutive Pacific Division crown. They swept through the playoffs defeating Portland, Seattle, and Phoenix. In an eighth trip to the NBA Finals in 10 years, they once again faced the Detroit Pistons.[133] Hampered by injuries to Byron Scott and Johnson, the Lakers were swept by Detroit.[134] Following the 1989 Finals, on June 28, 1989, after 20 professional seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar announced his retirement. The Lakers still cruised through the Pacific Division, winning their ninth consecutive division crown with a 63–19 record. However, after beating the Rockets in the first round, they lost four games to one in the second round of the playoffs to the Suns.[135] Riley announced he was stepping down after the season citing burnout,[136] and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy.[137] Riley's departure received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had grown tired of his intense practices and felt he tried to take too much credit for the team's successes.[138] Following the season, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request.[139] The 1990–91 Lakers failed to win the Pacific Division for the first time in 10 years, but still finished with a 58–24 record. After cruising through the Western Conference playoffs, the Lakers found themselves in the NBA Finals once again, their ninth trip to the Finals in 12 years. The 1991 Finals represented a changing of the guard as the Lakers were defeated in five games by the Chicago Bulls, led by superstar Michael Jordan.[140] On November 7, 1991, Magic Johnson announced he had tested positive for HIV and would retire immediately.[141] In their first season without Johnson, the team won 43 games to earn the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoffs.[37] The Lakers were defeated in the first round by Portland. Following the season, head coach Mike Dunleavy was fired. The Lakers would lose 43 games in 1992–93 under Randy Pfund, their first losing season since 1976. The Lakers would still make the playoffs, and would become the first eighth seed to win the opening two games on the road against a number one seed when they took a 2–0 lead against Phoenix.[142] They lost the next two games at home however, then game five in Phoenix in overtime.[142] During the 1993–94 season, Pfund was fired during the season that would result in the Lakers failing to make the playoffs for the first time since 1976. Magic Johnson, would coach the final 16 games of the season with former teammate Michael Cooper as his lead assistant.[143] Johnson decided not to take the job permanently due to what he felt was a lack of commitment from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing streak to finish 33–49.[144][145] Under new coach Del Harris, Los Angeles made the playoffs each of the next two seasons but was eliminated in the second and first rounds respectively.[146][147] The team was led by young guards Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones.[148] Johnson came out of retirement to return as a player in the 1995–96 season to lead the then 24–18 Lakers to a 29–11 finish.[149] After some run-ins with Van Exel, displeasure with Harris's strategies, and a first-round loss to the Rockets, Johnson decided to retire for the final time after the season.[150] During the 1996 off-season, the Lakers acquired 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th overall out of Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in that year's draft, by Charlotte. Los Angeles also signed free-agent Shaquille O'Neal.[151] Trading for Bryant was West's idea, and he was influential in the team's signing of the all-star center.[152] \"Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers\", O'Neal later said.[153] They used their 24th pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher.[154] During the season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos to Phoenix for Robert Horry.[155] O'Neal led the team to a 56–26 record, their best effort since 1990–91, despite missing 31 games due to a knee injury.[156] O'Neal averaged 26.2 ppg and 12.5 rpg and finished third in the league in blocked shots (2.88 bpg) in 51 games.[156][157] The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs as O'Neal scored 46 points in Game 1 against the Trail Blazers, marking the highest single-game playoff scoring output by a Laker since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics in 1969.[156] In the next round, the Lakers lost in five games to the Utah Jazz.[156] In the 1997–98 season, O'Neal and the Lakers had the best start in franchise history, 11–0.[158] O'Neal would miss 20 games on the season due to an abdominal injury.[158] Los Angeles battled Seattle for the Pacific Division title most of the season. In the final two months, the Lakers won 22 of their final 25 games,[158] finishing 61–21, but still finished second to Seattle in the standings.[158] The Lakers defeated Portland three games to one in the first round to advance to face Seattle. Although the Sonics won the first game, the Lakers responded with four straight wins, taking the series,[158] but were swept by the Jazz in the Western Conference Finals.[158] During the 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell were traded to the Charlotte Hornets.[159] The team also acquired J. R. Reid, B. J. Armstrong, and Glen Rice.[160] Head coach Del Harris was fired in February after a three-game losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former Laker Kurt Rambis.[161] The team finished 31–19 in the strike-shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference.[162] The Lakers defeated Houston in the first round of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round. Game four of the series would be the last game ever played at the Great Western Forum.[163] Before the 1999–2000 season, West was prepared to hire Rambis as the team's full-time coach before an outcry from fans and members of the organization caused him to seek out a bigger name.[164] Los Angeles hired former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who had coached that team to six championships, and gave him a lucrative $6 million a year contract.[165] He brought along assistant Tex Winter and they installed Winter's version of the triangle offense.[166] The Lakers signed veterans Brian Shaw, John Salley, Ron Harper, and A.C. Green, who was a Laker during the \"Showtime\" era.[155] The team also moved to a new arena, the Staples Center.[167] Led by league MVP O'Neal, the Lakers won 31 of their first 36 games.[168] They finished 67–15, the highest win total since they won 65 in the 1986–87 season.[168] Then eliminated Sacramento and Phoenix in the first two rounds of the playoffs.[169] After the Lakers took a three games to one lead in the Western Conference Finals against Portland, the Trail Blazers won the next two games to force a game seven.[170] The Lakers, who trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter, would go on 19–4 run to tie the game and eventually win 89–84 to advance to the NBA Finals.[170] In their first trip to the Finals since 1991, the Lakers defeated Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers four games to two win their first title since 1988.[171] West retired from his spot in the team's front office after the season after a power struggle between him and Jackson over control of the team's operations.[172] After the season, starters Rice and Green left the team,[173] and Los Angeles signed Horace Grant.[174] The following season, the Lakers won 11 fewer regular season games than the prior year,[175] but swept the first three rounds of the playoffs, defeating the Portland, Sacramento, and San Antonio.[176] They met Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals. Although the Sixers took game one in overtime,[177] the Lakers won the next four games to win their second straight title. Their 15–1 postseason record was the best in NBA history.[178] The Lakers won 58 games in 2001–02. In the playoffs, they swept Portland and defeated San Antonio four games to one to advance to the Western Conference Finals to face Sacramento.[181] The series would go on to be known as one of the greatest playoff matchups in NBA history. The series extended to all seven games and ended in a Lakers victory.[182] In game one, Bryant scored 30 points as the Lakers won, 106–99. The series would then shift in Sacramento's favor, with the Kings winning the next two games. Facing a deficit in game 4, the Lakers had the ball with under 20 seconds to play. After misses by both Bryant and O'Neal, Kings center Vlade Divac tapped the ball away from the rim in an attempt to wind down the clock. It went straight into Robert Horry's hands, who drained a game-winning three with under three seconds to play. After the Kings won game five on a buzzer-beater by Mike Bibby, the Lakers were faced with a must-win game six. In one of the most controversial playoff games in league history (Tim Donaghy's betting scandal), the Lakers would win by four points.[183] The Lakers went on to win game seven in overtime, with the Kings missing numerous potentially game-saving shots and free throws. The Lakers then achieved a three-peat by sweeping Jason Kidd and the New Jersey Nets in the NBA Finals.[184] O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP awards, making him the only player besides Michael Jordan to win three consecutive Finals MVPs.[185] The Lakers would attempt a four-peat the following year, but started the 2002–03 season 11–19.[186] However, they finished the season 39–13 to finish 50–32.[187] They defeated Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, but the four-peat attempt ended as they were eliminated by San Antonio in six games in the second round.[188] During the 2003–04 season, the team was the subject of intense media coverage generated by the teaming of four stars and the sexual-assault case involving Kobe Bryant.[189][190] Before the season, the Lakers signed two-time MVP Karl Malone formerly of the Jazz, and former Seattle Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton to join O'Neal and Bryant,[191] forming the first \"superteam\" of the 21st century.[192][193] Three of the \"big four\", however, struggled with injuries: O'Neal suffered from a strained calf, Malone an injured knee, and Bryant an injured shoulder.[194][195] The Lakers started 18–3 and finished 56–26 and won the Pacific Division title, entering the playoffs as the No. 2 seed. They defeated Houston, San Antonio, and Minnesota to advance to the NBA Finals.[196] In the Finals, they would lose to Detroit in five games. During the 2004 off-season, the team entered a rebuilding phase when O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, Caron Butler, and a first-round draft pick.[197] Bryant and O'Neal had clashed in the past,[198] and the media credited their feud as one of the motivating factors for the trade.[199] Jackson did not return as head coach, and wrote a book about the team's 2003–04 season, in which he heavily criticized Bryant and called him \"uncoachable\".[200][201][202] The Lakers front office said that the book contained \"several inaccuracies\".[203] The Lakers also traded Rick Fox and Gary Payton to Boston, for Chris Mihm, Marcus Banks, and Chucky Atkins before the 2004–05 season.[204] Derek Fisher, frustrated with losing playing time, opted out of his contract and signed with the Warriors.[204] The team hired Rudy Tomjanovich to replace Jackson.[204] After sitting out the first half of the 2004–05 season, Malone announced his retirement on February 13, 2005.[205] Tomjanovich coached the team to a 22–19 record before resigning due to health problems.[206] Assistant Frank Hamblen was named interim head coach to replace Tomjanovich for the remainder of the season.[207] Bryant (ankle) and Odom (shoulder) suffered injuries, and the Lakers finished 34–48, missing the playoffs for only the fifth time in franchise history and the first time since 1994.[37] With the tenth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft, the Lakers selected Andrew Bynum, a center from St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey.[208] The team also traded Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins to Washington for Kwame Brown and Laron Profit.[209] Jackson returned to coach the team after Rudy Tomjanovich resigned midway through the previous season.[210] On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points against Toronto, the second-highest total in NBA history.[211] Ending the season 45–37, the team made the playoffs after a one-season absence.[212] After taking a three games to one lead in the first round, Phoenix came back to take the series in seven games.[213] In the following season, the Lakers won 26 of their first 39 games,[214] but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40.[214] They were eliminated in the first round by Phoenix again.[214] Frustrated by the team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the off-season.[215] Buss initially agreed to seek a trade,[216] but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.[217] After re-acquiring Derek Fisher, the Lakers started the 2007–08 season with a 25–11 record, before Andrew Bynum, their center who was leading the league in field-goal percentage, went out for the year due to a knee injury in mid-January.[218] In what would become a crucial transfer for the franchise's return to championship form, they acquired the six-time all-star power forward Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade in early February and went 22–5 to finish the season.[219] The Lakers' 57–25 record earned them the first seed in the Western Conference.[220] Bryant was awarded the league's MVP award, becoming the first Laker to win the award since O'Neal in 2000.[221][222] In the playoffs, they defeated the Nuggets in four games, the Jazz in six, and the defending champion Spurs in five, but lost to the Celtics in six games in the NBA Finals.[223] In the 2008–09 season, the Lakers finished 65–17; the best record in the Western Conference.[224] They defeated the Jazz in five games, the Rockets in seven and the Nuggets in six, to win the Western Conference title. They then won their 15th NBA championship by defeating the Orlando Magic in five games in the NBA finals.[225] Bryant was named the NBA Finals MVP for the first time in his career.[226] The Lakers, who had added Ron Artest (Metta World Peace)[227] in place of Trevor Ariza in their starting lineup, finished the 2009–10 season with the best record in the Western Conference for the third straight time. On January 13, 2010, the Lakers became the first team in NBA history to win 3,000 regular-season games by defeating the Dallas Mavericks 100–95.[228] They defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Utah Jazz, and the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference playoffs. In the finals, the Lakers played the Boston Celtics for the 12th time. They rallied back from a 3–2 disadvantage in the series and erased a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter of the seventh game to defeat the Celtics. This series win gave them their 16th NBA title overall and 11th since they moved to Los Angeles.[229] Bryant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, despite a 6–24 shooting performance in game seven.[230] After much speculation, head coach Phil Jackson returned for the 2010–11 season.[231] In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the New Orleans Hornets in the first round.[232] But their opportunity for a three-peat was denied by the Dallas Mavericks in a four-game sweep of the second round. After the season, it was announced that Jackson will not be returning to coach the Lakers.[233] After Jackson's retirement, former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown was hired as head coach on May 25, 2011.[234] Before the start of the shortened 2011–12 season, the Lakers traded Lamar Odom to the Dallas Mavericks after Odom requested to be traded.[235] On the trade deadline long time Laker Derek Fisher along with a first round draft pick were traded to the Houston Rockets for Jordan Hill.[236] With a 41–25 regular season record the Lakers entered the playoffs as the third seed, the team defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round in seven games but were eliminated by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round in five games.[237][238] On July 4, 2012, Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns agreed to a sign-and-trade deal that would send him to the Lakers in exchange for the Lakers' 2013 and 2015 first round draft picks, 2013 and 2014 second round draft picks, and $3 million. The trade was made official on July 11, 2012, the first day the trade moratorium was lifted.[239] On August 10, 2012, in a four-team trade the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum and acquired Dwight Howard.[240] The combination of these players with Bryant and Gasol led media outlets to refer to them as a \"superteam\" comparable to the 2003-04 Lakers.[241][242] On November 9, 2012, Mike Brown was relieved of coaching duties after a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season.[243] Assistant Coach Bernie Bickerstaff took over as interim head coach, leading the Lakers to a 5–5 record. On November 12, 2012, the Lakers hired Mike D'Antoni as head coach.[244] On February 18, 2013, Lakers owner Jerry Buss died from cancer at age 80.[245] On the court, D'Antoni coached the Lakers to a 40–32 record the rest of the way to finish 45–37, their worst record since 2007. The Lakers clinched a playoff berth on the final game of the season and finished seventh in the Western Conference after beating the Houston Rockets on April 16, 2013.[246][247] The Lakers battled injuries all season, the most prominent of which is the Achilles tendon rupture to Kobe Bryant that ended his season after 78 games. The absence of Bryant was sorely felt as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs.[248] Nevertheless, Bryant passed Lakers legend Wilt Chamberlain to become the fourth all-time leading scorer in NBA history on March 30, 2013, against the Sacramento Kings.[249] On December 8, 2013, Bryant played in his first game since tearing his Achilles tendon on April 12, 2013.[250] However, on December 17, 2013, he suffered a broken bone in his knee, and did not return for the remainder of the season.[251][252] On March 25, 2014, the Lakers scored 51 points in the third quarter against the New York Knicks, the most points scored in a quarter in the history of the franchise.[253] The Lakers went on to miss the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2005, for just the second time in the last two decades and for just the sixth time in franchise history. On April 30, 2014, Mike D'Antoni resigned from his position as head coach after a 27–55 season.[254] After spending the majority of the off-season without a head coach, the Lakers named former player Byron Scott as the new head coach.[255] After the season, he was the frontrunner to become the new Lakers head coach. Scott interviewed three times for the position, which had become vacant after Mike D'Antoni's resignation.[256] On July 28, 2014, he signed a multi-year contract to coach the Lakers.[257] During the first game of the 2014–15 season, the seventh overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, Julius Randle went down with a broken leg, which ended his rookie season. The Lakers began their season losing 10 of their first 16 games. After playing only 35 games, Kobe Bryant tore a rotator cuff in his shoulder ending his season. Nick Young was also forced to end his season with a fractured kneecap, leaving the team with a record of 14–41.[258] With 27 games left in the regular season, Byron Scott gave rookie Jordan Clarkson more playing time. Clarkson, the 46th overall pick in the 2014 draft, finished his rookie season with game stats of 11.9 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 3.5 apg, and shooting 44.8% from the field.[259] The Lakers' season ended with a record of 21–61, the fourth worst record in the league and at the time the worst record in franchise history. The next season, the Lakers had the second overall pick of the 2015 NBA draft, which they used to select Ohio State freshman point guard D'Angelo Russell. The team also selected Larry Nance Jr. with the 27th overall pick.[260] On November 30, 2015, Bryant announced he would retire at the end of the season after 20 seasons with the team.[261] In Bryant's last season the team missed the playoffs for the third straight year with a 17–65 record, the worst in franchise history.[262] On April 24, 2016, the Lakers announced that they would not exercise their option on Byron Scott's contract for the following season.[263] On April 29, the team announced another former Laker, Luke Walton, as their new head coach. At the time of his hiring, Walton was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, who were in the playoffs, so he could not officially begin his duties as head coach until the Warriors' playoff run was over.[264] The Lakers earned the second overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft,[265] and selected Brandon Ingram from Duke University.[266] The team also selected Ivica Zubac with the 32nd overall pick.[267] On February 21, 2017, the Lakers fired general manager Mitch Kupchak, while Magic Johnson was named as the president of basketball operations. The team's governor Jeanie Buss, also announced the removal of her brother, Jim Buss, from his position as executive vice president of basketball operations.[268][269] On March 7, 2017, the Lakers hired Rob Pelinka as the general manager, signing him to a five-year deal.[270] The Lakers again earned the second overall pick, this time, in the 2017 NBA draft,[271] and selected Lonzo Ball from UCLA.[272] The Lakers also acquired Kyle Kuzma from the University of Utah with the 27th overall pick from a draft-day trade, along with Brook Lopez in exchange for D'Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov.[273] The Lakers also traded their 28th overall pick, Tony Bradley, in exchange for the 30th overall pick, Josh Hart, from Villanova University and the 42nd overall pick, Thomas Bryant, from Indiana University.[274] In February 2018, Nance Jr. and Clarkson were traded away to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye, and a 2018 first-round draft pick.[275] On July 2, 2018, Randle was renounced by the Lakers.[276] On July 9, 2018, the Lakers signed LeBron James to a four-year, $154 million contract.[277][278] By the Christmas Day game, the Lakers were six games over .500 before James sustained a groin injury leading to several weeks of missed games. Ball and Ingram also ended their seasons early due to injuries. On February 7, 2019, Zubac was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers along with Michael Beasley in exchange for Mike Muscala.[279] On April 9, 2019, Johnson stepped down as the team's president of basketball operations,[280] and two days later, the Lakers parted ways with head coach Walton after the team failed to reach the playoffs for the sixth straight year.[281] On May 13, Frank Vogel was named the Lakers' head coach.[282] The Lakers received the fourth overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft lottery.[283] On July 6, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans for Ball, Ingram, Hart, and three first-round picks, including the number four overall in the 2019 draft.[284] This trade officially ended the young core era of the Lakers; only Kuzma remained out of the group of players. Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Lakers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season.[285] The Lakers finished the regular season with a 52–19 record, entering the playoffs for the first time since 2013,[286] and as the top seed for the first time since 2010.[287] They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010.[288] They defeated the Miami Heat 4–2 to win the 2020 NBA Finals,[289] and James was named the Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career.[290] The win gave Los Angeles their 17th championship in franchise history, tying the Boston Celtics for the most all-time.[291] Primary Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, who took over the team in 2017, would also become the first female controlling owner of an NBA team to win the NBA Finals.[292] During the 2021 off-season, the Lakers picked up many NBA veterans, the most notable of which was Russell Westbrook, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade with the Washington Wizards. Kyle Kuzma, the last player left from the Lakers' young core era, was traded away, along with others. Other veterans picked up during the off-season included Carmelo Anthony, DeAndre Jordan, and returning players Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo.[293] Alex Caruso left the Lakers and signed with the Chicago Bulls, and veteran locker-room voice Jared Dudley retired.[294][295] The Lakers made a surprising run in the 2023 Playoffs, making the Western Conference Finals, but were defeated by the eventual champion Denver Nuggets. On December 9, 2023, the Lakers won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament after defeating the Indiana Pacers in the championship game. James was named the inaugural tournament MVP.[296] They finished the 2023–24 season 47–35 and beat the New Orleans Pelicans in the Play-In to make the playoffs as the seventh seed. On June 27, 2024, the Lakers selected Bronny James, the son of LeBron, at 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, forming the first father-son duo in NBA history.[297] JJ Redick was hired as head coach of the Lakers.[298] On October 23, 2024, the team made NBA history as being the first one to have father and son (LeBron James & Bronny James) play together as they beat Minnesota Timberwolves on their season opening game.[299] The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the Lakers involves the two most storied basketball franchises in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. It has been called the best rivalry in the NBA.[300] The two teams have met a record 12 times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s and three times in the 1980s. The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4–2. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games. The two teams were tied for the highest number of championships, with 17 titles apiece, until the Celtics surpassed this record in the 2024 NBA Finals; together, the 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history. The all-time series record for the Lakers vs Celtics is 209–165 with the Celtics being the forerunners. Boston is the only NBA team with an overall winning record against the Lakers.[301] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Detroit Pistons developed in the late 1980s.[302]: 228 Both teams faced each other in back-to-back finals appearances in the 1988 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games and the 1989 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in 4 games. The rivalry reemerged in the early 2000s as both teams squared off against one another in the 2004 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in five games. The Lakers have a lengthy history with the Golden State Warriors as both franchises relocated to California during the early 1960s. Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike, unlike the Dodgers–Giants rivalry of MLB, or the 49ers–Rams rivalry of the NFL in which both teams express fierce animosity against one another.[303][304] The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991. Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers. Both teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams relocated to California in the early 1960s.[305][306] The Lakers lead the all time regular season series 262–173, and the postseason series 25–11.[307][308] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers is unique because they were the only two NBA teams to share an arena, the Crypto.com Arena. It is also one of only two intra-city rivalries in the NBA, the other being the new crosstown rivalry between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets. Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers.[309][310] Some contend that the term rivalry was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful.[311] The Lakers and the Phoenix Suns rivalry didn't develop until the 2000s where the teams were led by Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash, respectively. The San Antonio Spurs and the Lakers, developed what some would classify as a rivalry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 1999, the teams have met in the NBA Playoffs five times, with the clubs combining to appear in seven consecutive NBA Finals (from 1999 to 2005). Additionally, the teams combined to win five NBA championships from 1999 to 2003; the Spurs won the NBA championship in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014 while the Lakers won the championship in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010. From 1999 to 2004 the clubs' rivalry was often considered the premier rivalry in the NBA,[312] and each time the clubs faced each other in the playoffs the winner advanced to the NBA Finals. In 2008, the teams met again in the Western Conference Finals where the Spurs were handily defeated only to beat the Lakers when they met again in 2013. The Kings and the Lakers have faced each other in the playoffs nine times between 1949 and 2002, and since the Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985, both have been based in California. The 2002 Western Conference Finals was one of the most bitterly contested in NBA history, with many controversial calls in game 6.[313] The Lakers would win the series in game 7. Berger and Chalfen purchased the NBL's disbanded Detroit Gems for $15,000 in 1947, changed their name to the Lakers, and relocated them to Minnesota. Max Winter bought a third of the club in their early years and sold his share to Mikan in 1954. Berger bought Mikan's share in 1956 giving him a controlling (⅔) interest.[314] After Mikan retired, attendance plummeted and the team lost money for several seasons, leading the ownership group to put the team up for sale in 1957.[315] Marty Marion, a retired baseball player and manager, and his business partner Milton Fischman attempted to purchase the team with the intention of moving the club to Kansas City, Missouri.[315][316] Mikan offered to mortgage his home in an attempt to buy the team and keep the club in Minnesota.[317] The Lakers were sold to a group of investors led by Bob Short, however.[314] The team was sold to Short's group with the agreement that it would not be relocated to Kansas City but kept in Minnesota.[318] Short's ownership group consisted of 117 Minnesota businesses and private citizens, who amassed a total of $200,000 for the purchase; $150,000 to buy the team and $50,000 to run it.[314] By 1958 Short had become 80% owner of the team by buying out his partners,[314] but the team was floundering. Attendance remained poor, and the NBA had put the Lakers on \"financial probation\", notifying them that if they did not meet certain ticket sales numbers they could be bought out by the league and relocated. Short was forced to move the team to Los Angeles in 1960; the club had lost $60,000 in the first half of the 1959–60 season alone.[319] The NBA's owners originally voted 7–1 against the move.[320] When Short indicated that he might take the team to a new rival league that was developing, however, the owners held another vote that same day and allowed the relocation (8–0).[321] Aided by Baylor's drawing power,[322][323] and the new locale, the team's finances improved when they arrived in LA.[324][325] Short sold the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for a then league record amount of $5.175 million.[326] Short insisted the deal be conducted in cash as he was wary of Cooke, so guards transported the money in a cart from one New York bank to another.[327] Cooke was a more hands-on owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations.[328] He personally financed construction of the Forum in 1967 at a cost of $16.5 million.[329][330] He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67 million.[331] Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce.[332][333] Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate.[330][334] Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998,[335] and until October 2010 Magic Johnson was a minority owner as well.[336] Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988.[337] In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league.[335] In 2013, Buss died at the age of 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer.[338][339][340] His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote.[341][342] Buss' succession plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.[342][343] Given the team's proximity to Hollywood, the Lakers fanbase includes numerous celebrities, many of whom can be seen at the Staples Center during home games.[344] Jack Nicholson, for example, has held season tickets since the 1970s, and directors reportedly need to work their shooting schedules around Lakers home games.[345] From 2002 and 2007 the team averaged just over 18,900 fans, which placed them in the top ten in the NBA in attendance. Red Hot Chili Peppers' song \"Magic Johnson\", from their 1989 album Mother's Milk, is a tribute to the former point guard, and frontman Anthony Kiedis and bassist Michael \"Flea\" Balzary are frequently seen attending home games.[346] In 2008, the team sold out every home game,[347] and in 2010, the Lakers had the most popular team merchandise among all NBA teams, and Bryant the most popular jersey.[348] The Laker nickname came from the state of Minnesota being the Land of 10,000 Lakes.[14][349] The team's colors are purple, gold and white.[350][6][351] The Lakers logo consists of the team name, \"Los Angeles Lakers\" written in purple on top of a gold basketball. The team usually wears white jerseys for Sunday and holiday home games.[350][352] List of the last five seasons completed by the Lakers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Los Angeles Lakers seasons. The Lakers have won 17 NBA titles and have appeared in the NBA Finals 15 other times.[37] These appearances include eight NBA Finals appearances in the 1980s. The best record posted by the team was 69–13, in 1972; the worst record was 17–65, in 2016.[37] Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage Bryant holds most individual team records for longevity including most games played (1,333), and most minutes logged (48,298). Johnson holds all significant assist records for the club including career assists (10,141), assists in a game (24), and highest assist average for a season (13.1). Johnson also has the most triple doubles, with his 138 over 100 more than the next closest player (Bryant; 17). Elmore Smith holds team records for blocks in a game (17), blocks per game for a season (4.85), and career blocks per game (3.93). The scoring records are mostly shared by Elgin Baylor and Bryant, with Baylor having the highest average for a career (27.4) while Bryant has the highest points scored in a single game (81). Baylor, Bryant and West hold the top five single-season scoring averages, with Bryant occupying the first (35.4) and fourth (31.6) spots, while Baylor has the second (34.8), and third (34.0), and West the fifth (31.3).[353][354] The Lakers hold several NBA records as a team including most consecutive games won overall (33) and most consecutive road games won (16), both of which came during the 1971–72 season,[355] highest field-goal percentage for a season at 54.5% (1984–85),[356] and highest road winning percentage at 0.816 (1971–72).[66] They also hold records for having (into the 2009–10 season) the most wins (3,027), the highest winning percentage (61.9%), and the most NBA Finals appearances (31).[37][357] The 2000–01 team set the NBA record for best playoff record at 15–1, which was later broken by the Golden State Warriors in 2017.[358] The 1971–72 team holds franchise records in wins (69), most points scored, and largest margin of victory; both of the latter came in the team's 63 point win versus Golden State (162–99).[359] They also held the record for most wins at home in the regular season (going 36–5 in 1971–72, then 37–4 in both 1976–77 and 1979–80) unil the Boston Celtics set the current record of 40–1 in the 1985–86 season. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, located at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles. The arena opened in fall 1999 and seats up to 18,997 for Lakers games.[360] Owned and operated by AEG and L.A. Arena Company, the arena is also home to the Los Angeles Clippers, the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings.[360] Before moving to Staples Center, for 32 seasons (1967–1999), the Lakers played their home games at The Forum in Inglewood, California, located approximately 10 miles southwest of the team's current home.[167] During the 1999 preseason, the Lakers played their home games at the Forum before officially moving into Crypto.com Arena, and once again hosted a preseason game versus the Golden State Warriors on October 9, 2009, this time to commemorate the team's 50th-anniversary season in Los Angeles.[361] In the first seven years in Los Angeles, the team played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, south of downtown Los Angeles.[362] While the team played in Minneapolis, the team played their home games at the Minneapolis Auditorium and the Minneapolis Armory from 1947 to 1960.[363] Roster Last transaction: December 29, 2024 The Lakers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA.[364] A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[365] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. The Lakers have had three first overall picks in their history: Elgin Baylor (selected in 1958), Magic Johnson (selected in 1979) and James Worthy (selected in 1982).[368] The Lakers have also had six lottery picks in their history: Eddie Jones (selected tenth overall in 1994), Andrew Bynum (selected tenth overall in 2005), Julius Randle (selected seventh overall in 2014), D'Angelo Russell (selected second overall in 2015), Brandon Ingram (selected second overall in 2016) and Lonzo Ball (selected second overall in 2017).[368] Other draft picks include Jerry West and Gail Goodrich in the 1960s, Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon in the 1970s, A.C. Green and Vlade Divac in the 1980s, Elden Campbell, Nick Van Exel, Derek Fisher and Devean George in the 1990s, and Luke Walton, Sasha Vujačić, and Ronny Turiaf in the 2000s.[368] There have been 29 head coaches for the Lakers franchise. John Kundla coached the team in Minneapolis when they won their first five BAA/NBA championships from 1949 to 1954.[52] Pat Riley is second in franchise history in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins.[369] Phil Jackson broke Riley's regular-season wins record in 2009, and he passed Riley's playoff wins and games coached records in 2010.[369] Jackson, Riley, Kundla, and Bill Sharman have all been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for their coaching careers. George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Jerry West, Pat Riley, Magic Johnson, Kurt Rambis, Byron Scott and Luke Walton have all played and head-coached for the Lakers. Jackson, who had two stints as head coach, was coach from 2005 to 2011. In May 2011, Mike Brown was named his replacement for the 2011–12 season.[370] Brown was fired[371] on November 9, 2012, after a 1–4 start. Assistant coach Bernie Bickerstaff served as interim head coach for five games before the Lakers selected Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. D'Antoni resigned at the end of the 2013–14 season. In July 2014, Byron Scott was hired as head coach.[372] After the 2015–16 season ended, Scott was fired. On April 29, 2016, former Lakers player Luke Walton was named as Scott's replacement,[373] and served as head coach until the end of the 2018–19 season.[374] Frank Vogel was named his successor on a multiyear deal announced on May 13, 2019.[375] Vogel was fired following the conclusion of the 2021–22 season.[376] On June 6, 2022, Darvin Ham was named as Vogel's successor as head coach.[377] However, Ham was fired by the Lakers on May 3, 2024, after the Lakers were eliminated in Game 5 of the first round by the Denver Nuggets. Among his accomplishments was leading the Lakers to their first In-Season Tournament championship.[378] On June 24, 2024, former NBA player JJ Redick was hired as the 29th coach in team history.[379] The Lakers have 41 Hall of Famers (31 players, 5 head coaches, 1 assistant coach, and 4 contributors) who contributed to the organization.[380][381][382] Notes: The Lakers have retired thirteen jersey numbers and an honorary microphone in honor of their players and broadcaster:[392][393][394][395][396] On January 13, 2025, Michael Cooper will have his #21 jersey retired.[397] In addition, several other players and coaches who were instrumental to the franchise's success during its days in Minneapolis have a banner commemorating them as Hall of Fame members of the Minneapolis Lakers, although jersey numbers for these players are not retired by the franchise:[400] For 41 years, Chick Hearn was the team's broadcaster until his death in 2002. He broadcast 3,338 consecutive games between November 21, 1965, and December 16, 2001.[401] Hearn came up with West's \"Mr. Clutch\" nickname.[402] He was a part of the team's \"inner sanctum\" when Cooke was owner, and was consulted on basketball decisions.[403] Paul Sunderland, who had filled in for a couple of games while Hearn recuperated in the 2001–02 season, was named the permanent play-by-play announcer. Stu Lantz was retained as the color commentator.[404] When Sunderland's contract expired in the summer of 2005, the team chose not to renew it.[405] Then, Joel Meyers moved in alongside Lantz as the television announcer, with Spero Dedes and former Laker player Mychal Thompson on the radio.[406] For the 2011–12 season, Bill Macdonald became the new television play-by-play announcer, joining Lantz who remained as the color analyst. Meanwhile, John Ireland joined Mychal Thompson to call the games on radio.[407] Beginning in the 2009–10 season, Lakers radio broadcasts were heard on KSPN (Los Angeles ESPN Radio affiliate) in English and KWKW in Spanish.[406][408] KLAC had the team's radio broadcast rights from the 1976–77 season until the 2008–09 season.[408][409] Until 2011, telecasts had been split between KCAL-TV (road games) and Fox Sports West (home games), unless they are chosen for national broadcasts on ABC.[410] KCAL had been the Lakers' over-the-air television broadcaster since 1977, dating back to when the station was the RKO General-owned KHJ-TV, the longest relationship between an NBA team and a television station. Prior to KHJ, Laker games were televised on KTLA. The Lakers had been on Fox Sports West since 1985, dating to when it was the original Prime Ticket and owned by Buss.[411] On February 14, 2011, Time Warner Cable and the Lakers announced the formation of two new regional sports networks (one in English, one in Spanish) that would exclusively televise the team's games and related programming for 20 years starting with the 2012–13 season.[412] The said networks were originally known as Time Warner Cable SportsNet, before it was renamed Spectrum SportsNet in 2016 upon Charter Communications' purchase of Time Warner Cable.[413]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Washington Commanders are back in the playoffs. Despite an inspired performance by Falcons rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr., Washington prevailed in overtime after their rookie quarterback, Jayden Daniels, hit tight end Zach Ertz for the game-winning score in the extra session. Washington (11-5) has clinched its first playoff berth since 2020 with Sunday night's 30-24 win. The Commanders also clinched a playoff berth for the Los Angeles Rams. Conversely, Atlanta (8-8) lost control of its own playoff destiny. The Commanders scored 17 unanswered points after trailing 17-7 at halftime, but Atlanta forced overtime after Penix hit Kyle Pitts on a 13-yard touchdown pass with 1:19 left in regulation. The Falcons could have won it in regulation, but Riley Patterson's 56-yard field goal try at the buzzer was short. In overtime, Daniels led the Commanders on a 12-play, 70-yard drive that was punctuated by his third touchdown pass of the night. Daniels also led both teams with 127 yards on 16 carries. Penix threw for 223 yards with a touchdown and a pick in a losing effort. Here's a closer look at how Washington punched its playoff ticket. Without taking anything away from Atlanta, Washington's win was largely the result of Dan Quinn's team not getting in its own way as much in the second half and in overtime after committing several costly errors in the first half. One of those mistakes was a special teams penalty on a Falcons punt that extended the drive and ultimately led to a touchdown for the visiting team. The Commanders were flagged a whopping 13 times for 108 yards, but Daniels largely overcame the sloppy play with breathtaking plays. Daniels' night also included some history; he broke former Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III's rookie record for rushing yards by a quarterback. With A.J. Terrell following Terry McLaurin's every move, Commanders wideout Olamide Zaccheaus stepped up with eight grabs for 85 yards that included his 7-yard touchdown catch on Washington's first drive. Defensively, the Commanders set up the game's first score after picking off Penix on the game's fifth play. In the second half, Washington was able to get Atlanta's offense off the field on its first two possessions. The Falcons had run just nine plays prior to their game-tying touchdown drive in the final moments of regulation. The Falcons sacked Daniels five times, but they weren't able to bring him down when it mattered most. They also were unable to come up with a fourth-down stop, as the Commanders converted on all three of their fourth-down tries. While the loss surely hurts, Falcons fans should take solace in Penix's performance. After a shaky opening drive, Penix quickly found his rhythm, leading the Falcons on three scoring drives in the first half. Two of those drives ended with touchdowns by running back Bijan Robinson, who rushed or 82 yards on 13 carries in the game's first 30 minutes. Penix then led an improbable, game-tying drive near the end of regulation that included a 31-yard completion to Drake London (who caught seven passes for 106 yards) on a fourth-and-11 play. His touchdown pass to Pitts was on a fourth-and-13 play. Speaking of Robinson, his lack of involvement in the second half loomed large in the loss. He had just eight yards on four carries in the second half after being an integral part of the Falcons' success in the first half. One of Washington's most important plays of the night took place on a fourth-and-5 on the Falcons' 39-yard line late in the third quarter. On the play, Daniels threw a short pass to running back Jeremy McNichols, who was initially short of the first-down market before fighting for the necessary yardage. The 6-yard gain helped set up the Commanders' go-ahead touchdown at the start of the fourth quarter. Daniels' game-winning touchdown pass was a dart that corralled by Ertz, who caught six passes for 72 yards and two scores. \"I like our teams' chances against anyone.\" -- Daniels with NBC Sports afterward when asked about Washington's playoff prospects Atlanta will play host to the Panthers in their regular-season finale. The Falcons need to win and have the Buccaneers lose to the Saints in order to capture the NFC South division title and the playoff berth that comes with it. The Commanders will wrap up the regular season in Dallas against the rival Cowboys. Washington clinches the playoff spot and right now is the No. 6 seed ahead of the Packers due to the conference record tiebreaker. That'll be settled next week. Atlanta now needs the Buccaneers to lose next week in order to win the NFC South. For the second week in a row, Jayden Daniels leads a game-winning, walk-off drive. This time, he sends the Commanders to the playoffs with a strike to Zach Ertz over the middle of the field. That drive was basically all Daniels the whole way. What a performance: 24 of 36 for 227 yards, 3 touchdowns and 1 interception, plus 16 (SIXTEEN) carries for 127 yards. WOW. Daniels' escapability is just unreal. Riley Patterson's 56-yard field goal came up way short, so the Davis penalty escapes ignominy. We're headed to an extra period. This penalty on Michael Davis being pass interference rather than holding may have just won Atlanta the game. Wow. Noah Igbinoghene may have gotten away with illegal contact on that last throw to Drake London. Their feet got tangled so it wasn't pass interference, but Igbinoghene had hands on London farther than 5 yards downfield. EXTREMELY suspect time management from the Falcons. Wow. They let the clock run all the way down to 12 seconds when they still had an extra timeout. Wow. Might have just cost themselves a chance to win the game. AJ Terrell got away with a pretty obvious pass interference on second down and Olamide Zaccheus had a ball hit him in the facemask on third, and now the Falcons will have 40 seconds to drive for the game-winning score, with two timeouts still in their pocket. And Penix comes back on the very next snap and makes up for it with his best throw of the night. Fantastic job by Kyle Pitts to make the contested catch over the middle. Extra point tied it up. What a drive. Yikes. Second time Penix has missed an open corner route for a touchdown. Absolutely massive loss for the Falcons on a bad snap on first-and-goal results in a 21-yard loss. It'll be second-and-goal from the 26-yard line after the two-minute warning. Atlanta tried to go with the direct snap to Bijan again and it backfired in a big way. Penix has made two really nice throws to the wide left side of the field to extend this drive. Falcons still have a shot to tie. Washington tacked on a field goal after the Cosmi penalty, and now leads by 7. The Falcons have 4:32 to drive the field for a game-tying touchdown, armed with two timeouts. Oh boy, that could be a huge penalty. Holding on Sam Cosmi wipes a Zaccheus TD off the board and now it'll be third-and-goal from the 13 with Washington up by 4 points. Daniels just broke the record for rushing yards by a rookie quarterback. It was, of course, previously held by Robert Griffin III for this same Washington franchise. Second time tonight that Penix has gotten stripped but the Falcons have recovered the fumble. He's got to have better ball security in the pocket, especially when he's trying to step up and through the rush. What a move by Ray-Ray McCloud! Stayed on his feet through a pair of tacklers on third down and created a whole bunch of yards after the catch by himself. Moved the Falcons into plus territory as they try to take the lead here. Another fantastic drive from Washington culminates with a trip to the end zone. This time it's Chris Rodriguez scoring on a pitch play from 2 yards out to cap a 14-play, 70-yard drive that again took more than 7 minutes off the clock. Really nice coverage from A.J. Terrell on a third-down deep shot to Terry McLaurin forced Washington into fourth-and-5. Naturally, Daniels converted it again, this time with a checkdown over the middle to Jeremy McNichols. He was nearly stood up just before the line to gain but appeared to reach out and convert it at the last second. Atlanta got away with one on third down, as Penix got stripped of the ball but fell on it himself before a defender could recover the fumble. Washington will get it back with a chance to tie or take the lead. Big drive for Zach Ertz. He had the huge gain earlier and now he steps up on third-and-long inside the red zone and makes a great contested grab in the front of the end zone to get Washington back within one score. 15 plays, 79 yards and a touchdown in a drive that took more than half the third quarter. Second fourth-down conversion of the night for Washington. Now 18 of 21 on the year. Zach Ertz has basically been a catch-and-fall guy for years now, He just had a MASSIVE catch and run for a huge gain on a scramble-drill play after Daniels evaded pressure in the pocket. Washington's offensive line is getting totally bowled over here. Just got bailed out by an illegal contact penalty. Some really, really bad clock management from Atlanta on this final drive, and then Penix airmailed an open corner route on third down, so the Falcons settled for a Riley Patterson field goal to take a 10-point lead into the break. Washington gets the ball to begin the third quarter. It looked like the second score of the night for Bijan Robinson, but apparently the ball was behind him as he went through the front corner of the end zone, so they took the score off the board. Michael Penix then got stopped on a QB sneak from inside the 1-yard line. Falcons still trying to punch it in. And then Bijan took it into the end zone anyway, bouncing it outside the tackle box and easily jumping into the end zone to give the Falcons their first lead of the night. Really undisciplined performance from the Washington defense so far. Already three penalties to extend drives. After a penalty set Washington's drive back inside the red zone, Kaden Elliss came up with a huge play to shut down the scoring opportunity. Looks like Daniels got fooled by the coverage and never saw Elliss dropping into his zone, and just threw the ball right into the defender's chest. Former Falcons WR Olamide Zaccheus has 5-53-1 against his former team less than 5 minutes into the second quarter. One of the best games of his career already. That looked like the third miscommunication of the game for the Falcons already. The snap operation isn't on the same page, and neither are the receivers. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

Just in case, he proved it again on \"Sunday Night Football.\" With a playoff berth on the line at a raucous Northwest Stadium, Daniels led the Commanders down the field in overtime and hit Zach Ertz for the game-winning touchdown to defeat the Falcons 30-24. Before overtime came around, Daniels led a second-half turnaround that turned a 17-7 deficit into a 24-17 lead. The Commanders nearly removed the suspense and stretched the lead to two possessions in the fourth quarter, but a holding call erased a touchdown and gave Michael Penix Jr. an opportunity he didn't take lightly. Penix, who struggled out of halftime, made a statement of his own by taking the Falcons down the field to tie the game. Faced with 4th-and-Goal from the 13-yard line, he hit Kyle Pitts for the game-tying touchdown to keep Atlanta's NFC South hopes alive and well. When the Falcons had the chance to win the game, though, they came up just short — literally. Riley Patterson was a yard or two shy of the crossbar on a potential game-winning field goal from 56 yards out, and Penix never touched the ball again. The Commanders won the overtime coin toss, and Daniels used his deadly combination of arm talent and mobility to methodically march down the field. NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule The ramifications are wide-reaching. Washington is headed to the playoffs for the first time since 2020, while the Rams are in as NFC West champions. The Seahawks are eliminated, and the Buccaneers now just need a win over the Saints or a Falcons loss to clinch the NFC South. Washington's win also dropped the Packers down the No. 7 seed in the NFC. For Daniels, the Offensive Rookie of the Year Award seems inevitable despite stellar seasons from Malik Nabers, Brock Bowers, and Bo Nix. With 31 total touchdowns and more than 850 rushing yards after 127 on Sunday night, Daniels' rookie season could stand the test of time — and it will end in the playoffs. The Sporting News tracked live updates and highlights from \"Sunday Night Football\" between the Falcons and Commanders. Check out all of the key moments you might have missed. (All times Eastern) 11:38 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Daniels hits Ertz for the game-winning touchdown! The Commanders have 11 wins and are going to the playoffs for the first time since 2020, when they won the NFC East with a losing record. The Rams are in, the Seahawks are out, and the Buccaneers are in control of the NFC South. What a game. DANIELS TO ERTZTHE @COMMANDERS ARE GOING TO THE PLAYOFFS! pic.twitter.com/OzzGe0upei 11:35 p.m. — Daniels barrels his way all the way to the 2-yard line, bouncing off defenders but coming up just short of the end zone. It's 3rd & Goal. 11:34 p.m. — Daniels uses his legs to pick up another first down. He has 121 yards on the ground tonight, and it's 1st & Goal for the Commanders. 11:32 p.m. — Chris Rodriguez Jr. goes for a first down as the Commanders inch closer. 11:32 p.m. — As a reminder, a field goal doesn't end the game here. A touchdown would. 11:31 p.m. — Daniels runs for a first down and much more on 3rd & 2. It looked like he would just pick up a few yards, but he continues to run all over this Falcons defense. Washington is in fringe field goal range. 11:29 p.m. — Daniels hits Ertz for a first down to get the drive started on a positive note for Washington. 11:25 p.m. — The Commanders will start overtime with the ball, and the crowd is happy about it. 11:22 p.m. — Patterson's field goal is SHORT. It had the accuracy. It did not have the distance. We're going to overtime. Kick is no good!! We're headed to OT 👀📺: #ATLvsWAS on NBC/Peacock📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/DHKr8Gpg1x 11:20 p.m. — Michael Davis is called for a massive pass interference penalty that will set up a Riley Patterson field goal attempt from about 56 yards out. That cannot happen from any defender in that moment, and now Davis will hold his breath, as will all of Washington D.C. 11:18 p.m. — Penix throws incomplete on back-to-back plays, and Atlanta is down to seven seconds. The Falcons need a rapid completion just to get into fringe field goal range. 11:17 p.m. — Darnell Mooney hauls in a 26-yard pass from Penix! He stays in bounds, though, and the Falcons hold onto their timeout. Penix finding his guys with the game on the line!📺: #ATLvsWAS on NBC/Peacock📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/eWd5KPKWPh 11:17 p.m. — The Falcons will start from their own 19 and have 40 seconds to get into field goal range. They'll have to balance the risk here, as a turnover would be deadly. 11:16 p.m. — What would have been a game-breaking catch goes through the hands of Zaccheaus on third down. The Falcons force a punt and actually will have some time to work with here. 11:15 p.m. — Daniels is sacked for a one-yard loss on first down. That's a terrific start for Atlanta. 11:12 p.m. — We don't need to ask what Jayden Daniels is made of because we all saw it last week, but another game-winning drive would be the latest statement in his Offensive Rookie of the Year campaign. 11:11 p.m. — That was Penix's first career touchdown pass. Win or lose, he won't forget that one. 11:08 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Ice in his veins! Penix lasers a throw to Kyle Pitts, who this time holds onto the ball and ties the game with a 13-yard touchdown grab. Raheem Morris opts against a two-point try, but there's enough time for the Commanders to win it with a field goal anyway. Washington has 79 seconds. OMG KYLE PITTS TD!!!📺: #ATLvsWAS on NBC/Peacock📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/8sE8kkub9Y 11:08 p.m. — Penix badly overthrows London in the end zone. It comes down to fourth down. 11:07 p.m. — Penix hits London for 13 yards, so the Falcons will have two shots at the end zone here. 11:04 p.m. — Bijan Robinson lines up for the direct snap but can't come up with it! It bounces all the way back to the 26-yard line, and Atlanta goes from 1st & Goal at the five to 2nd & Goal from the 26. What a huge blunder. CHAOS!!📺: #ATLvsWAS on NBC/Peacock📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/rcMBO3yHYT 11:03 p.m. — Now the Falcons are playing a little lighter. Ray-Ray McCloud rips off a 14-yard run to set up 1st & Goal. 11:02 p.m. — The Falcons CONVERT on a pass to a wide open Drake London. They're in the red zone. What a moment for Atlanta.

The Falcons are a yard past midfield with more than four minutes remaining. 10:53 p.m. FIELD GOAL — The door is still open for the Falcons.

That's Sam Cosmi's second costly penalty of the night. 10:46 p.m. — Now Daniels hits John Bates for 14 yards to set up 1st & Goal. On a night in which Terry McLaurin has been quiet, Kliff Kingsbury has found a way to get the most out of everyone else. 10:45 p.m. — The Falcons' defense is getting shredded right now. The Commanders start this drive with plays of 16, 7, 11 and 12 yards to push themselves into the red zone. This one is getting out of hand for Atlanta. 10:40 p.m. — Penix gets sacked on 3rd & 10! A teammate recovers his fumble, but the Falcons are forced to punt and really need a defensive stop here. Penix is sitting on just 121 yards. 10:32 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Chris Rodriguez Jr. gets past AJ Terrell and rumbles into the end zone! The Commanders have taken the lead early in the fourth quarter.

It's a range game for the wideout, at least in his eyes. 10:23 p.m. — Wow, Jeremy McNichols picks up the first down on 4th & 5 with an extra effort after catching the pass from Daniels. That was close, but it keeps the drive alive for Washington.

The Commanders' defense gets a big three-and-out. 10:10 p.m. — That was Daniels' 24th touchdown pass of the season. Only six other rookies have thrown for at least 24 touchdowns, one of them being Bo Nix. 10:08 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — More third down magic from the Commanders! Daniels hits Zach Ertz for a 10-yard touchdown to trim the deficit to three.

That could be very consequential. 9:40 p.m. — The Falcons can't get it into the end zone, but Riley Patterson sends one through from 39 yards to push Atlanta's lead to two possessions. Falcons up by 10 at halftime. 9:36 p.m. — Penix looks mature on this drive, which started with two nice rubs by Robinson.

His second touchdown of the night puts the Falcons up by seven, pending the extra point. 9:16 p.m. — Bijan Robinson is really making the most of his runs, using his patience to pick up eight yards after a roughing-the-passer penalty sets up the Falcons. Atlanta is on the doorstep. 9:15 p.m. — Now the Falcons' running game is finding momentum. Robinson runs for 17 yards between two runs, and Atlanta mixes in Tyler Allgeier to approach the red zone. Allgeier has three carries on this drive, all for at least five yards. 9:11 p.m. — The Falcons go into Washington territory on a nice 14-yard gain by Drake London. 9:07 p.m. INTERCEPTION — Daniels is picked off by Kaden Elliss!

The Falcons can't, but an Atlanta win would leave them one win away from an NFC South title. If the Vikings hold on, the Commanders would move to the No. 6 seed with a win AND clinch the NFC West for the Rams.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. LANDOVER, Md. (AP) Jayden Daniels felt tired. Tired from a game that went well past 60 minutes. Tired from running all over the field for the better part of three-plus hours. It was all worth it after carrying the Washington Commanders into the playoffs. Daniels connected with Zach Ertz in overtime for his third touchdown pass of the game to clinch a playoff spot by beating the Atlanta Falcons 30-24 in overtime Sunday night in a back-and-forth prime-time showdown between highly drafted rookie quarterbacks. “The fan base waited a long time for this,” Daniels said. “I really can’t put into words how much it means to them and how much it means to me to be able to go out there and lead this franchise and this team to opportunities like that.” Daniels ran for a season-high 127 yards, including 42 in OT, and completed 24 of 36 passes for 227 yards and had two TD passes to Ertz and another to Olamide Zaccheaus to make the playoffs in his rookie year. In his latest comeback performance in a season full of them, the No. 2 overall pick in the draft in April shook off an interception and a 10-point halftime deficit and led the winning drive in overtime that was capped with the 2-yard pass to Ertz. “You want to be in these moments,” said veteran linebacker Bobby Wagner, who saw a look in Daniels' eyes late in the game that foreshadowed another winning performance. “Him getting hit and making big plays, his confidence, his demeanor never changes. You know that he knows he’s going to make a play, and everybody on the sideline and on the field believes he’s going to make a play.” The Commanders (11-5) could move up to the sixth seed in the NFC and set up a wild-card round game at Tampa Bay or the Los Angeles Rams if they win their regular-season finale at Dallas next weekend. They otherwise would be seventh and visit division-rival Philadelphia unless Green Bay loses to Chicago. The Falcons (8-8) lost control of their chances of winning the NFC South and ensuring a home playoff game. They now need to beat Carolina and for the Buccaneers to lose to New Orleans to qualify altogether. “Control what your controllables are,” Atlanta coach Raheem Morris said. “Go out there and win our football game. That’s all we can do. Everything else is out of our control. Those things don’t matter. Thing we got to do is prepare for this football game. Prepare for the Panthers.” Atlanta was in control for the first half of the game, gashing Washington’s defense with the running game until abandoning it. Bijan Robinson had 82 yards and two touchdown runs on 13 carries until a minute was left in the second quarter - but had just 8 yards the rest of the way. Penix did his best to try to carry the Falcons back after they fell behind 24-17 late. The eighth pick in the draft made his second professional start and finished a 12-play, 68-yard drive with a touchdown pass to Kyle Pitts to tie it with 1:19 left. A throw from Penix to Drake London drew a pass interference penalty with 2 seconds left in regulation and gave Riley Patterson a chance at a go-ahead field goal. But Patterson's 56-yard attempt fell short as time expired and Atlanta never got the ball back. “We just went back to our technique and fundamentals: Keep it simple for stopping the run and keep it on the passing game,” Commanders linebacker Frankie Luvu said. “Shout out to the quarterback, man. He threw a couple balls at the end of the game. He’s a hell of a player, man, and pulse of that team and they fought. It’s always a fight with them.\" Penix finished 19 of 35 for 223 yards with the TD pass and an interception. Daniels has 30 combined touchdowns and tied Russell Wilson for the third most by a rookie QB and passed Robert Griffin III for the most yards rushing with 864. ... Ertz became the ninth tight end in NFL history to eclipse 8,000 yards receiving. ... London had seven catches for 106 yards to reach 1,000 for the first time in his career. Washington lost starting center Tyler Biadasz to a left ankle injury when he was rolled up on during a running play late in the second quarter that was negated by a holding penalty on left tackle Brandon Coleman. ... Right tackle Cornelius Lucas, filling in for injured starter Andrew Wylie - inactive because of a groin injury - also left with a groin injury.

                "content": "It took nearly a full overtime period but the Washington Commanders won 30-24 over the Atlanta Falcons on \"Sunday Night Football\" to reach 11 wins for the first time since 1991. Washington's offense went 70 yards in seven minutes and culminated in quarterback Jayden Daniels finding tight end Zach Ertz for the game-winning 2-yard touchdown pass. Daniels had a historic night, completing 24 of 36 passes for 227 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception. He also led the Commanders with 127 rushing yards on 16 carries. Daniels broke the rookie quarterback rushing yards record, previously held by former Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III, in the third quarter. Washington took control early by converting an interception by Falcons rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr. to a touchdown. Atlanta scored 17 unanswered points by halftime, though, and a 10-point deficit was the biggest Washington's faced all season at the break. Atlanta running back Bijan Robinson scored two rushing touchdowns in the first half and finished the night with 17 carries for 90 yards and two scores. The Commanders came out strong in the second half with a 15-play drive that took up nearly eight minutes of time in the third quarter. Daniels found Ertz for his fifth touchdown of the season to cut the deficit to 17-14. Washington chewed another seven minutes of clock on their ensuing drive capped off by a go-ahead touchdown run by Chris Rodriguez. Their ensuing drive took 5:30 off the clock but finished off with a field goal. Atlanta fought back on their next drive as Penix Jr. threw his first NFL touchdown pass to tight end Kyle Pitts on 4th-and-goal and tie the game 24-24. A quick stop by the Falcons' defense gave the Penix Jr. and company the ball back with 40 seconds to go. They got into field goal range but Riley Patterson couldn't hit the 56-yard attempt. Penix Jr. completed 19 of 35 passes for 223 yards, one touchdown, and an interception in his second career start. Washington began overtime on offense and didn't let Atlanta's offense back on the field. Daniels repeatedly went to former Falcons wide receiver Olamide Zaccheaus on the night as Atlanta cornerback A.J. Terrell blanketed Terry McLaurin, his typical top target. Zaccheaus tied a career-high with eight catches for 85 yards and a touchdown, but had a critical drop on their final drive of regulation. Both teams had more success on the ground. Washington had 216 yards rushing and Atlanta tallied 126 by the final whistle. Washington overcame multiple miscues, including Daniels' interception and 108 yards in penalties, for their 11th win of the season. The Commanders (11-5) close out the regular season on the road next week against the Dallas Cowboys (7-9). This loss moves Atlanta (8-8) one game back from NFC South leader Tampa Bay (9-7). The Falcons head home for their regular season finale against the Carolina Panthers (4-12) and need the Buccaneers to lose to the New Orleans Saints to have a chance to win the division and make the playoffs.

Then you'll enjoy getting our NFL newsletter delivered to your inbox Jayden Daniels' 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Zach Ertz gave the Commanders the win in overtime. More importantly, the win secured the Commanders' first playoff berth since the 2020 season. It also clinched a postseason spot for the Los Angeles Rams, who are NFC West winners due to a strength of victory tiebreaker over the Seattle Seahawks. Washington's gone 68 yards in more than seven minutes to take it deep into the red zone. Washington is facing third-and-goal from the 2-yard line with 2:45 to go in overtime. Washington won the coin toss and elected to receive the ball and start overtime on offense. Atlanta's Riley Patterson attempted a 56-yard field goal but it fell well short and \"Sunday Night Football\" is headed to overtime. A zero-yard sack and two incomplete passes meant the Commanders took just 39 seconds off the clock before punting back to the Falcons. Atlanta gets the ball back on its own 19-yard line with 40 seconds to go and two timeouts. After a 21-yard loss on first-and-goal on a botched snap, the Falcons were able to battle back and score on a Michael Penix Jr. pass to tight end Kyle Pitts on fourth-and-goal. The 13-yard touchdown pass is Penix Jr.'s first as an NFL quarterback and Riley Patterson's extra point is good to tie the game with 1:19 to go in the fourth quarter. Facing first-and-goal from the Washington 5-yard line, the Falcons tried a direct snap to running back Bijan Robinson but it went through his hands and back for a 21-yard loss. The Falcons will be facing second-and-goal from the Commanders' 26-yard line after the two-minute warning. Washington took more than five minutes to drive 52 yards for their third scoring drive of the second half. A holding call on third-and-goal nullified a touchdown pass from Jayden Daniels to Olamide Zaccheaus to keep the Falcons in contention and force a field goal. Zane Gonzalez knocked it through from 31 yards out to give Washington a seven-point lead with 4:32 to go. The rookie quarterback rushed for 7 yards on first-and-10 from the Falcons' 48-yard line in the fourth quarter, giving him 820 rushing yards on the season. That mark breaks the previous record of 815 yards held by fellow Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III set in the 2012 NFL season. Atlanta's offense picked up a first down to pass midfield but Commanders defensive lineman Dorance Armstrong sacked Michael Penix Jr. for an eight-yard loss on 3rd-and-10. The Falcons punt for the second time in a row in the second half and Washington's offense takes over from their own 36-yard line with 10:02 to go in the game. The Commanders took another seven minutes off the clock with a 14-play, 70-yard drive culminating in a 2-yard touchdown run by second-year running back Chris Rodriguez. Zane Gonzalez's extra point is good and Washington takes the lead again for the first time since the first quarter. Quarterback Jayden Daniels used his legs on the drive multiple times, scrambling for 39 yards and two first downs on the drive. He also found Jeremy McNichols for a key conversion on fourth-and-5 in Falcons territory. Washington's dominated time of possession in the third frame. The Commanders out-gained the Falcons 125 yards to minus-1 in the quarter. Washington's offense has the ball at the Falcons' 14-yard line facing second-and-5 to open the final quarter of the game. Atlanta managed just five yards before Washington defensive lineman Dante Fowler Jr. got a strip sack on third-and-5. Michael Penix Jr. recovered the ball, but the Falcons had to punt for just the second time all game. Washington's offense gets the ball back at its own 30-yard line with 5:06 to go in the third quarter. Washington's offense took nearly eight full minutes off the clock in their opening drive of the second half. Jayden Daniels fired a pass to tight end Zach Ertz on third-and-8 for a 10-yard touchdown. Zane Gonzalez's extra point is good as the Commanders make it a one-score game. Multiple key plays kept the drive going at crucial moments. An illegal contact penalty on the Falcons' defense on 3rd-and-22 kept Washington's offense on the field. Ertz had a 37-yard catch-and-run — his longest catch in three seasons — to get Washington past midfield. Daniels' 4-yard run on fourth-and-1 from the Falcons' 16-yard line gave the Commanders a new set of downs and closer to the end zone. Atlanta's field goal with two seconds to go sealed a two-score lead after the first half. After Washington's opening drive touchdown, the Falcons have clamped down on defense. The Commanders kicked two punts and threw and interception on their three drives after their first touchdown. Atlanta's pass rush has sacked Jayden Daniels twice and both quarterbacks have thrown one interception through the first two quarters. Washington will get the ball to start the third quarter. The Falcons went 51 yards in less than two minutes to make it a two-score game behind a 39-yard field goal by Liam McCullough. Michael Penix Jr. completed 3 of 5 passes for 32 yards on the drive. A holding penalty and 10-yard sack on consecutive plays forced the Washington offense into a third-and-30 from their own 35-yard line. The Commanders couldn't overcome that and will settle for a punt on the other side of the two-minute warning. Atlanta will have a chance to score before halftime with all three timeouts. Atlanta's offense capitalized on the interception by marching 72 yards in 11 plays for a go-ahead touchdown. Bijan Robinson's second-and-2 run from the Commanders' 4-yard line was initially ruled a touchdown run but was called back due to the ball going out of bounds before crossing the plane of the end zone. Two plays later, he made good on that miss with a 1-yard score. The Falcons ran the ball eight times on the drive for 49 yards. After a holding penalty backed the Commanders out of the red zone, Jayden Daniels dropped back and threw an interception to Falcons linebacker Kaden Elliss. Elliss had a short return to give the ball back to the Falcons offense at their own 29-yard line with 10:37 to go in the second quarter. Facing third-and-6 from their own 33-yard line, Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr. dropped back and threw deep for running back Bijan Robinson, who had a step on his defender. The pass fell incomplete and the Falcons were forced to punt. Washington takes over at its own 28-yard line with less than a minute to go in the first quarter. Falcons rookie linebacker JD Bertrand got to Jayden Daniels for a 13-yard sack on second-and-10 and Washington's offense couldn't recover. The Commanders punted for the first time tonight and the Falcons will take over at their own 27-yard line with 2:48 to go in the first quarter. Two key penalties against the Commanders kept the Falcons alive for a 10-play, 70-yard drive capped off by a rushing touchdown by Bijan Robinson off a direct snap. Liam McCullough's extra point is good and the game is tied with 5:10 to go in the first quarter. The Falcons were lined up for a field goal on fourth-and-4 from the Washington 28-yard line. But rookie cornerback Mike Sainristil was lined up offsides and a 5-yard penalty gives Atlanta another shot near the red zone. Following the turnover, the Commanders made the most of a short field with a seven-play touchdown drive in a matter of three minutes. Rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels faked a handoff and rolled out to his left before finding Olamide Zaccheaus for a 7-yard touchdown on fourth-and-2. Zane Gonzalez's extra point is good and Washington takes the first lead of the game with 9:33 to go in the first quarter. The rookie dropped back for his third pass of the game and threw it to Commanders safety Quan Martin. Washington's offense takes over at the Falcons' 38-yard line with 12:45 to go in the first quarter. Rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr. will have the first drive of the game in his second start of the season.

Here's how Atlanta can get to the playoffs. They clinch a playoff spot with wins in their last two games. However, things get dicey with a Falcons loss tonight. Atlanta would hand control of the division back to Tampa Bay with one week to go. Under that scenario, here is how Atlanta can make the postseason: The Falcons cannot make the playoffs as a wild-card team. The Commanders have several different paths into the postseason. They are as follows: The only way the Commanders can be eliminated from postseason contention is if they finish with the same record as the Falcons and Buccaneers. That would allow the Falcons to win the NFC South and the Buccaneers to displace the Commanders in the wild-card race by virtue of Tampa Bay's head-to-head win over Washington in Week 1. Here’s how the NFC East stacks up entering the “SNF” matchup between the Commanders and Falcons: Here’s how the NFC South lines up entering the “SNF” matchup between the Falcons and Commanders: Here's how the AFC and NFC stack up entering “SNF”: AFC In the hunt: Miami Dolphins (8-8), Cincinnati Bengals (8-8) NFC In the hunt: Seattle Seahawks (9-7), Atlanta Falcons (8-7) x – clinched playoff berth y – clinched division z – clinched home-field advantage, first-round bye Here’s how the top 15 picks of the first round of the 2025 NFL draft stack up entering the “SNF” game: The Falcons travel North to take on the Commanders and Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. NEW ORLEANS (AP) Aidan O'Connell and the Las Vegas Raiders played with a lot of energy - and looked pretty sharp - for a last-place team that had every excuse to be sluggish and sleep-deprived. O'Connell passed for two touchdowns, tight end Brock Bowers broke two rookie NFL records, and the Raiders won for just the fourth time this season, 25-10 over the struggling New Orleans Saints on Sunday. The convincing victory came after flight delays so long on Saturday that players didn't get into their New Orleans hotel until after midnight - less than 12 hours before kickoff. “These guys didn’t blink, flinch,\" Raiders coach Antonio Pierce said with a satisfied grin. \"We got in at 1 o'clock in the morning, got up this morning and rolled.” Bowers' seven catches for 77 yards gave him 108 receptions for 1,144 yards this season, eclipsing Mike Ditka's 1961 rookie tight end mark of 1,067 yards receiving and Puka Nacua's 2023 mark of 105 catches by a rookie at any position. Bowers also surpassed Darren Waller's franchise mark of 107 receptions in a season, which had stood since 2020. “It's pretty shocking to me,” Bowers said of his records, saying he had “no clue what to expect, coming from college to the NFL.” Ameer Abdullah rushed for 115 yards for the Raiders (4-12) - the journeyman running back's first 100-yard game in his 10 NFL seasons. “I'm not surprised by it,” Abdullah said. “I put a lot of work in. I'm very consistent. ... I'm happy for it, but I still think there's a lot more out there for me.” O'Connell finished with 242 yards passing, including a 3-yard TD pass to Jakobi Meyers and an 18-yarder to Tre Tucker as the Raiders won their second straight on the heels of a 10-game skid. “Better late than never,” O'Connell said. “We have a resilient bunch of guys and I'm sure it was probably harder for people to believe that when we were losing a lot of games.” Daniel Carlson kicked four field goals - his longest from 54 yards - for Las Vegas. With former Raiders QB Derek Carr unable to suit up for the Saints (5-11) because of his injured left, non-throwing hand, rookie Spencer Rattler received his fifth career start. He remained winless as a starter after completing 20 of 36 passes for 218 yards and one TD with two interceptions. Saints interim coach Darren Rizzi cited dropped passes, untimely penalties and breakdowns in pass blocking as the leading causes of his team's offensive anemia. “I felt like Spencer really never got settled in there, and he was moving around,” Rizzi said. “And he made some plays moving around, to his credit.” Rattler also rushed for 46 yards to finish as New Orleans' leading rusher for a second straight week. “It’s no secret our team is in a dark time right now,” Saints linebacker Demario Davis said. The Saints used trickery to take an early 7-3 lead. Running back Kendre Miller took what looked like a toss sweep to the right before throwing a lateral back to his left, where Rattler caught it and threw 30 yards downfield to wide-open tight end Foster Moreau in the end zone. Las Vegas moved in front for good on O'Connell's short scoring pass to Meyers with a minute left in the second quarter. After congregating for their flight on Saturday, only to learn of mechanical issues with their plane, Raiders players were sent home for several hours. “It was pretty weird,” O’Connell said. “I kind of got back home and my wife and my dog both looked at me like, ‘What are you doing here?’ It was fun to be home for an extra couple hours but last night was a late night.” The Raiders returned to team headquarters for meetings that normally would have been held in their New Orleans hotel before finally flying two times zones east. “It was kind of funny when we came in this morning,\" O'Connell said. “It was really a lot of juice from a lot of guys that I think kind of saw it as a challenge and tried to just enjoy it.” Saints: Miller left the game with concussion symptoms in the second quarter. LB Jaylan Ford appeared to seriously injure his lower right leg on punt coverage in the fourth quarter. DE Payton Turner left with an ankle injury. WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling briefly went down, but walked off on his own, after a hard collision over the middle. Raiders: Host the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.

                "content": "NEW ORLEANS, Louis.-- The Las Vegas Raiders are set to face the New Orleans Saints on the road today. After winning for the first time in months last week against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Raiders are looking to win consecutive games for the first time this season. However, a win in New Orleans would likely be detrimental to the team's draft position this offseason. Still, the Raiders are facing a Saints team that has lost three of its last four and 10 of its last 13 games, meaning the Raiders have a legitimate shot of winning. The Saints and Raiders are alike in many ways. Both teams have suffered numerous injuries, including to their starting quarterbacks. Both teams have had extended losing streaks. At one point this season, the Saints lost seven games in a row and the Raiders had lost 10 consecutive games before their win last week. The Raiders will dodge a meeting against former quarterback Derek Carr, but Raiders defensive coordinator Patrick Graham knows the Saints' offense is still dangerous. \"I mean, they're at home. It's the holidays,\" Graham said. \"I'm sure they have family in town. I mean, they're professionals, but they're going to be hungry. There's a lot of veterans on that team defensively. The interim head coach right now [Darren] Rizzi, he's done such a good job with the special teams over his career. He's doing a good job as an interim head coach. I expect them to be ready to go. And that building is one of the hardest places to play. Keep in mind, they're all on vacation and it's going to be a tough place to play. So, I'm looking forward to the challenge. I'm sure the players are, but it's the NFL. These guys know they're only guaranteed 17 opportunities to play this game. So, they'll be ready to go.” Like the Raiders, the Saints are shorthanded but still formidable. Graham elaborated on one of the Saints' best offensive weapons, wide receiver Chris Olave. \" I mean, I saw the freshmen from Ohio State in the playoff game. I mean, he's pretty good. And then these guys that come to the league, there's just a lot of growth in terms of their skill set. One thing that stands out to me is just how competitive they all are. Again, it's the same thing that I talked about with LSU. So, you see a guy who's explosive, who can make plays, make tough catches. So, we'll see if he's ready to go and we'll have to be prepared for him.\" Be sure to follow along with our live game thread throughout the contest.

They have dominated the time of possession, nearly possesing the ball double the amount of time the Saints have. The Raiders have not turned the ball over, were only penalized twice for five yards and nearly rushed for 100 yards in the first half. The bad news is, for as well as they have played, they are only up three points. The Saints have done a solid job of hanging around, as poor field position on multiple drives kept the Raiders from being able to pull away. This is a very winnable game for the Raiders, but Saints get the ball to start the second half. The Raiders must get a stop on the first drive after halftime. Brock Bowers.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. There was some major shakeup at the top of the 2025 NFL Draft order in Week 17. The New York Giants, who controlled their own destiny to secure the No. 1 pick, put up 45 points to upset the Indianapolis Colts. And if that wasn't enough, the Jacksonville Jaguars took down the Tennessee Titans and the Las Vegas Raiders won their second straight game after winning just two of their first 14 to open the season. That's three teams with three or fewer wins securing victories in the same week -- the first time that's happened in Week 17 or later since 2005, according to CBS Sports research. Those results produced the following: The New England Patriots now hold the top spot, followed by the Titans, Giants, Browns and Jaguars. Of those teams, Cleveland is the only one still left to play. It is currently taking on the Miami Dolphins. With Week 17 nearly complete, CBSSports.com looks at where teams would be picking at this moment in time. Also listed is each club's pending free agents and potential needs based on those players who may be leaving.

                "title": "2025 NFL Draft order: Panthers, Raiders wins shake up top 10 entering Week 17",
                "content": "Draft Analyst This is a look at the first-round order for the 2025 NFL Draft heading into Week 17 of the 2024 NFL season, along with the top five needs for each team. The order is determined by record, using strength of schedule as the first tiebreaker (click here to see a full list of the draft-order tiebreakers). Keep in mind -- teams that would make the playoffs if the season ended today are marked as PL (short for playoffs) in the order below. The draft order for playoff teams is determined by the results of postseason play. Arrows reflect movement from last week's order. Biggest needs: QB, OT, CB, OG, TE Remaining opponents: vs. Colts (7-8), at Eagles (12-3) The Giants' 10th straight loss, in combination with the Raiders' win over the Jags, strengthened New York's hold on the first pick -- in Round 1 and every subsequent round of the 2025 NFL Draft. This means that after the team presumably selects its new franchise QB on April 24, it will be in position to then address issues along its offensive line at the start of Days 2 or 3. Biggest needs: OT, CB, Edge, WR, IOL Remaining opponents: vs. Chargers (9-6), vs. Bills (12-3) The Patriots gave the Bills a good run in Buffalo on Sunday afternoon, but in dropping their fifth consecutive game, they remain in the hunt for the No. 1 overall pick. New England's SOS is well below New York's, meaning if both teams finished with the same record, the Pats would comfortably win the tie-breaker. Whether they are picking first, second or some place else in the top five, though, New England must target an elite OL prospect who can start on Day 1. The unit has been a disaster this season and needs an instant infusion of talent and depth. Biggest needs: CB, S, WR, IOL, QB Remaining opponents: vs. Titans (3-12), at Colts (7-8) Mac Jones will be a free agent this offseason, but even if he weren't, his play in relief of the injured Trevor Lawrence hasn't wowed enough to warrant retaining him as the team's No. 2 signal-caller. Jacksonville could find its new backup in the draft, using some extra Day 3 capital the team has acquired via trades to move up the board (perhaps in Rounds 3 or 4) for a promising prospect. Biggest needs: Edge, OT, WR, QB, RB Remaining opponents: vs. Dolphins (7-8), at Ravens (10-5) Dorian Thompson-Robinson's first start of the season did not go well on Sunday, so I think it’s fair to say the Browns will still be looking for an alternative to Deshaun Watson at quarterback this offseason. Cleveland should be thoroughly evaluating the 2025 QB class. Biggest needs: WR, QB, Edge, OT, S Remaining opponents: at Jaguars (3-12), vs. Texans (9-6) I wouldn't expect Tennessee to spend its first-round pick on a safety, but the back-end of the defense could definitely use an upgrade. Look for the Titans to address the position in free agency and in the middle rounds of April's draft. Biggest needs: QB, WR, CB, DT, RB Remaining opponents: at Saints (5-10), vs. Chargers (9-6) I doubt any of the Raiders players who were involved in Sunday's victory over the Jags were concerned the W cost them several spots in the 2025 draft order. But the win could have significant long-term implications for the franchise. In dropping from No. 2 overall to No. 6, and with an SOS much higher than the other three-win teams, Vegas might have to trade up if it wants to secure one of the top two passers in the 2025 class. While all the attention is justifiably on who will be the Raiders' next QB, the team also has to address its CB room, with multiple veterans entering free agency or contract years. Biggest needs: QB, DT, OT, S, CB Remaining opponents: at Bills (12-3), vs. Dolphins (7-8) First-round pick Olu Fashanu was carted off the field with a foot injury in the Jets' loss to the Rams on Sunday. It's unclear when the promising rookie will next be available, but whenever he's healthy, he's earned the right to bookend the O-line. The answer at the other tackle spot is far less certain, though. With Morgan Moses and Tyron Smith both due to hit free agency this spring, the Jets' new leadership could let former fourth-rounders Carter Warren (2023) and Max Mitchell (2022) compete at right tackle. But I suspect the team will target a starter-quality lineman in the 2025 draft and/or pay an established veteran in free agency. Biggest needs: Edge, WR, C, DT, QB Remaining opponents: at Buccaneers (8-7), at Falcons (8-7) A revitalized Bryce Young looks like the top candidate to lead the team in 2025, but he might need a new center. The Panthers lost starter Austin Corbett to a ruptured biceps tendon in early October, and he and backup Cade Mays both have expiring contracts. Unless both are re-signed, the team must find another pivot in the middle rounds of the draft. Biggest needs: OG, C, OT, Edge, WR Remaining opponents: vs. Seahawks (8-7), at Packers (11-4) The Bears should leave no stone unturned this offseason to bolster the offensive line, but they will also have to invest again in their WR room. DJ Moore and 2024 first-rounder Rome Odunze will be Caleb Williams' main targets in the pass game in 2025, but Keenan Allen is due to hit free agency after the season and 2023 fourth-rounder Tyler Scott has totaled only one catch for five yards this year. Slot receivers should be among the Bears' most sought-after prospects this spring. Biggest needs: Edge, WR, CB, S, TE Remaining opponents: vs. Raiders (3-12), at Buccaneers (8-7) ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Juwan Johnson﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ is an impending free agent, while ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Foster Moreau﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ and Taysom Hill, who suffered a season-ending knee injury on Dec. 1, both only have one year left on their respective deals. Finding a pass-catching tight end must be a priority for the team on Day 3 of the draft -- if not earlier. Biggest needs: CB, OG, DT, LB, OT Remaining opponents: vs. Lions (13-2), at Cardinals (7-8) The 49ers' defense has missed Javon Hargrave since he suffered a triceps injury in September and the team will need to address the defensive tackle spot this offseason. San Francisco traded for impending free agent Khalil Davis in November, which highlighted the squad’s lack of young talent up front, something that should be rectified late on Day 2 or early on Day 3 of the 2025 draft. Biggest needs: S, OG, DT, LB, QB Remaining opponents: at Browns (3-12), at Jets (4-11) The Dolphins should either re-sign or sign at least one veteran linebacker in March, but another LB should be selected in the draft. Anthony Walker, Tyrel Dodson and Duke Riley are ticketed for free agency, and 2022 third-round pick Channing Tindall has just four tackles in nine games this season. Biggest needs: CB, WR, OT, RB, TE Remaining opponents: vs. Broncos (9-6), at Steelers (10-5) Considering Ja'Marr Chase will be entering a contract year in 2025, it might be tough to pay impending free agent Tee Higgins his market value, although Joe Burrow recently said he’s confident the Bengals will bring Higgins back. I wouldn’t be surprised if the team picks a receiver in the first three rounds should Higgins depart. Biggest needs: RB, DT, CB, OG, LB Remaining opponents: at Eagles (12-3), vs. Commanders (10-5) Given that Jourdan Lewis, Israel Mukuamu and Amani Oruwariye could depart in free agency, the Cowboys may need to pick up another nickel or outside corner in April. DaRon Bland will be in the last year of his deal next fall, too. Biggest needs: CB, IOL, TE, LB, S Remaining opponents: at Giants (2-13), vs. Jaguars (3-12) Zaire Franklin is signed long-term, but he needs one or two partners to fill out the depth chart at linebacker for the Colts. Starter E.J. Speed, who missed Week 16 with a knee injury, is due to become a free agent in 2025, as is Grant Stuard. Biggest needs: Edge, WR, OG, DT, OT Remaining opponents: at Rams (9-6), vs. 49ers (6-9) The Arizona defensive front will need reinforcements in the offseason with first-round pick Darius Robinson still acclimating to the pros after missing most of the season due to injury. D-linemen Roy Lopez and L.J. Collier are among the team’s impending free agents. Biggest needs: LB, QB, OG, OT, DT Remaining opponents: at Bears (4-11), at Rams (9-6) The Seahawks will need to address the offensive line in 2025. Starting left guard Laken Tomlinson is due to hit free agency after the season. Recent draft picks Christian Haynes, Sataoa Laumea and Anthony Bradford will likely find another rookie joining the competition for snaps at guard. Biggest needs: WR, OG, LB, Edge, OT Remaining opponents: vs. Panthers (4-11), vs. Saints (5-10) Tampa Bay can build around Calijah Kancey and Vita Vea on the interior, but the team would undoubtedly benefit from adding more explosiveness off the edge. Joe Tryon-Shoyinka and Anthony Nelson are headed to free agency, so 2024 second-round pick Chris Braswell and another middle-round pick could join Yaya Diaby to form a rotation on the outside. Biggest needs: C, S, CB, Edge, WR Remaining opponents: at Commanders (10-5), vs. Panthers (4-11) Biggest needs: LB, TE, WR, S, OT Remaining opponents: at Bengals (7-8), vs. Chiefs (14-1) Biggest needs: OG, DT, CB, WR, OT Remaining opponents: vs. Ravens (10-5), at Titans (3-12) Biggest needs: Edge, DT, C, S, WR Remaining opponents: at Patriots (3-12), at Raiders (3-12) Biggest needs: OT, CB, WR, LB, OG Remaining opponents: vs. Cardinals (7-8), vs. Seahawks (8-7) Biggest needs: Edge, OT, WR, LB, CB Remaining opponents: vs. Falcons (8-7), at Cowboys (7-8) Biggest needs: QB, CB, RB, WR, OT Remaining opponents: vs. Chiefs (14-1), vs. Bengals (7-8) Biggest needs: OT, WR, Edge, OG, CB Remaining opponents: at Texans (9-6), vs. Browns (3-12) Biggest needs: CB, OT, DT, C, Edge Remaining opponents: at Vikings (13-2), vs. Bears (4-11) Biggest needs: WR, Edge, LB, TE, OG Remaining opponents: vs. Cowboys (7-8), vs. Giants (2-13) Biggest needs: Edge, DT, WR, CB, S Remaining opponents: vs. Jets (4-11), at Patriots (3-12) Biggest needs: CB, DT, RB, OG, OT Remaining opponents: vs. Packers (11-4), at Lions (13-2) Biggest needs: Edge, CB, WR, OG, DT Remaining opponents: at 49ers (6-9), vs. Vikings (13-2) Biggest needs: CB, WR, DT, OG, OT Remaining opponents: at Steelers (10-5), at Broncos (9-6) Entering the final weekend of the regular season, Dan Parr dives into the Week 18 scenarios that could affect the Round 1 order of the 2025 NFL Draft.

Entering the Week 17 slate, the Giants were in the driver's seat to land the No. 1 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. New York was the lone team remaining with just two wins after Las Vegas picked up its third victory of the season in Week 16. All the club needed to do was lose its final two games, and the top selection in the draft would be heading to the Big Apple. The Giants faced a Colts team needing to win out in order to stay in the playoff hunt. Indianapolis had everything to play for on Sunday, while New York was competing solely for pride. Yet, when the clock hit zero, it was Big Blue celebrating on the field at MetLife Stadium, not Indianapolis. The Giants picked up their first win at home this season, stunning the Colts 45-33 in Week 17. Lock threw for 309 yards and four touchdowns, as well as adding a rushing score, in what was by far the best performance of the season for the G-Men. \"I'm happy for the players and coaches,\" Giants head coach Brian Daboll said after the game. \"It's a tough season. It's good to see results, it's good to see smiles on their faces.\" The win for New York may have been great for morale, but it came at a cost for the future. The victory had major implications in the draft order for the 2025 NFL Draft, including knocking the Giants out of the No. 1 spot. Here's a look at how the Giants' win over the Colts impacts the NFL Draft order. NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule With New York picking up their third win of the season, it no longer sits in the top spot in the draft order. The club joins a group of three others with three wins on the season, all vying for the No. 1 pick. Following the Giants win, the Patriots now are in line to pick first this spring, according to Tankathon. New England dropped to 3-13 on the season following a blowout loss to the Chargers on Saturday. Based on strength of schedule, the Patriots own the tiebreaker over the Titans, Browns and Giants. NFL DRAFT NEWS: Following the Giants win, the Patriots now are in the top spot, the Titans sit at No. 2 and the Browns are at No. 3, with all three teams owning the tiebreaker over the NFC East member. New York is currently in the fourth spot, dropping a significant amount after entering the week in the top slot. Here is the current order, according to Tankathon.

Epenesa, Von Miller and DT Ed Oliver each had 1.0 sack while DT DaQuan Jones and DE Greg Rousseau each had 0.5 sacks. CB Christian Benford and DT Jordan Phillips both had interceptions and LB Matt Milano had the fumble recovery. Oliver had a forced fumble as well. LB Joe Andreessen led tacklers with eight. Additional notes: After winning the opening toss and electing to receive the football first, the Buffalo Bills offense marched right down the field to score the first points of the day. On the drive, Allen completed four of six passes for 56 yards, including key third down conversions of 12 yards and 23 yards to WR Khalil Shakir and WR Mack Hollins respectively. On their first redzone play, Allen threw a short pass to TE Dalton Kincaid, who picked up 11 yards after spinning out of a tackle from CB D.J. Reed. Following a pass interference flag in the end zone Allen snuck the ball into the end zone to score the touchdown and give the Bills the early 7-0 lead. The Jets took over for their first possession of the game following the Bills touchdown. The Jets utilized their run game to move the ball down the field while QB Aaron Rodgers completed three passes for 24 yards. On fourth-and-one from the Bills 24-yard line, Rodgers handed the ball to RB Breece Hall, but he was stuffed at the line of scrimmage for no gain by DE Greg Rousseau, forcing the turnover-on-downs. On the Jets ensuing drive after the Bills punted the football, they once again were moving the ball down the field. Rodgers completed a 28-yard catch and run to WR Garrett Wilson that set up the Jets in the red zone. Two plays later though, Rodgers dropped back and threw a pass short, that was tipped at the line by Rousseau and intercepted by DT Jordan Phillips who subsequently jumped into the stands with fans. On just their third drive of the game, the Bills were forced to punt once again. P Sam Martin pinned the Jets deep in their own territory at the 5-yard line. After a false start and a rush that went for -1 yard, Rodgers dropped back to pass from his own 2-yard line. DE A.J. Epenesa beat LT Max Mitchell around the edge and found his way to Rodgers, sacking him for the safety. Both teams took turns trading punts to start the second half. On the Jets second drive of the third quarter, the Bills defense took the ball away from the Jets offense again. First Rousseau sacked Rodgers on second-and-15. Then Rodgers dropped back to pass and looked to WR Allen Lazard but instead found the hands of CB Christian Benford who ran the ball back 24 yards. The Bills were given an additional 15 yards because of an unnecessary roughness called on Rodgers who pushed Benford as he was running out of bounds. On the next drive, WR Amari Cooper got involved immediately, catching a nine yard pass before four plays later catching a 30-yard touchdown. Cooper rose up over CB Brandin Echols and hauled in the touchdown pass. The Bills piled on in the third quarter by scoring two touchdowns and forcing another takeaway. RB James Cook punched in a one-yard touchdown at the goal line to bring the score to 26-0. On the Jets first play on their next drive, Wilson caught the ball and broke away from a tackle attempt, but then DT Ed Oliver punched the ball out and LB Matt Milano landed on top of the fumble recovery. With possession at the Jets 14-yard line, Allen scrambled to his right and threw a pass across his body into the back of the endzone to WR Keon Coleman, who caught the ball over Reed and LB Quincy Williams. The Bills ended the third quarter with another sack by Oliver. To start the fourth quarter, QB Mitchell Trubisky stepped in. He and the offense picked up where Allen and the starters left off, throwing a touchdown to WR Tyrell Shavers. Shavers caught the pass from Trubisky and ran 69 yards into the endzone untouched for the first catch and first touchdown of his career. The Jets avoided a shutout when QB Tyrod Taylor checked into the game in the fourth quarter. Taylor led the Jets on a 13-play, 75-yard drive to score the Jets first touchdown of the game that ended in a Wilson touchdown grab. They then completed the two point conversion to TE Tyler Conklin to make the score 40-8. On their next drive, Taylor threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Conklin, but threw an incompletion on the two-point conversion attempt, bringing the score to 40-14. Lineup Notes: CB Rasul Douglas returned to the lineup after missing two games with a knee injury; S Taylor Rapp returned to the lineup after missing two games with a neck injury; LB Matt Milano returned to the lineup after missing one game with a biceps/groin injury; WR Tyrell Shavers was elevated to the game day roster; DT Austin Johnson and CB Kaiir Elam were inactive.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) Josh Allen reflected on Buffalo’s many offseason critics and doubters when asked about the Bills achieving their latest milestones while sewing up the AFC’s No. 2 seed with a 40-14 rout of the unraveling and undisciplined New York Jets on Sunday. It was a the Bills quarterback’s “I told you so moment,” even though Allen elected not to use those exact words. “It speaks to the staff that we’ve got here, the guys that we’ve got in this locker room, how this team is put together and the culture that we have,” Allen said. “We didn’t really pay attention to the preseason notions, but we heard them and we saw them and we knew what people were saying. \"But it had no effect on us.” Well, that might be a stretch when it comes to motivation. What’s unquestioned is how Allen and the Bills (13-3) overcame a young, patchwork roster following the offseason departure of six of eight team captains - including Stefon Diggs being traded to Houston - to run away with their fifth consecutive AFC East title and win a franchise-best 13 games for the fifth time in team history, and third since 2020. Coach Sean McDermott didn’t leave much doubt as to who deserves the most credit for leading the Bills to their sixth consecutive playoff berth, and helping them set the single-season franchise records for points (509) and touchdowns (63). “I think Josh Allen continues to show why he should be the MVP,” McDermott said. “I’ve been around this league long enough to know to see MVP every year for many years. And what he has done on this team and this organization in this community - and no offense to anybody else - but I’ve got a hard time believing that someone’s done more.” Allen threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score to become the NFL’s first player to score 40 touchdowns in five consecutive seasons. He did so in an outing Buffalo blew the game open by capitalizing on two Jets turnovers and scoring three touchdowns over a 5:01 span in the closing minutes of the third quarter. Buffalo’s defense forced three takeaways overall and sacked Aaron Rodgers four times, including a 2-yard loss for a safety in the second quarter. Nothing went right in what became a comedy of errors for Rodgers and the Jets (4-12). New York will finish with five or fewer wins for the seventh time over a 14-season playoff drought - the NFL’s longest active streak. “It’s kind of like the season, it just got away from us. Too many games got away from us,” said Rodgers, who finished 12 of 18 for 112 yards and two interceptions before being pulled in favor of Tyrod Taylor with Buffalo leading 40-0. “We were moving the ball well and then just hit a wall. And that’s kind of been the season.” Rodgers, who entered the game with 499 career TD passes and looking to become just the fifth player to reach 500, was instead shut out and became the NFL’s most sacked quarterback. The 41-year-old has now been sacked 568 times, moving ahead of Tom Brady (565) and into first place on the career list. Taylor accounted for all of New York’s points, with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Garrett Wilson and a 20-yarder to Tyler Conklin. Discipline was an issue for a Jets team that fell to 2-9 since Jeff Ulbrich took over as interim coach. New York finished with 16 accepted penalties for 120 yards. “It’s frustrating, it’s embarrassing, it’s maddening. It’s all of that,” Ulbrich said. Allen had a short and efficient outing, finishing 16 of 27 for 182 yards with a 30-yard TD pass to Amari Cooper and a 14-yarder to Keon Coleman before giving way to backup Mitchell Trubisky with Buffalo leading 33-0 through three quarters. And Trubisky piled on by completing a 69-yard touchdown pass to practice squad call-up Tyrell Shavers 2:23 into the fourth quarter. Shavers became the 13th Bills player to catch a touchdown pass, matching the single-season NFL record, to validate the “everybody eats” mantra Allen and the offense used to approach this season. The Bills defense enjoyed a dominating performance to snap a shaky three-game stretch in which it combined to allow 1,357 yards, 86 first downs and 107 points. “I wouldn’t say need ... and I don’t want to say reassurance, either,” said A.J. Epenesa, who sacked Rodgers for the safety. “But it just shows that this is what we can do and this is the standard that needs to be upheld.” Allen’s 1-yard score was the 65th rushing TD of his career, matching the team record held by Thurman Thomas. ... James Cook scored on a 4-yard run for his 15th TD rushing of the season, one short of the Bills' single-season record set by O.J. Simpson in a 14-game season in 1975. Cook matched Allen, who scored 15 last year. ... Wilson reached 1,000 yards receiving for the third straight year to start his career, the first Jets player to do so and the 10th player in NFL history to accomplish the feat.

                "content": "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Josh Allen threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score, and the Buffalo Bills clinched the AFC's No. 2 seed with a 40-14 rout of the unraveling and undisciplined New York Jets on Sunday. The Bills put the game away by capitalizing on two Jets turnovers and scoring three touchdowns over a 5:01 span in the closing minutes of the third quarter. Buffalo's defense forced three takeaways overall and sacked Aaron Rodgers four times, including a 2-yard loss for a safety in the second quarter. Allen had a short and efficient outing, finishing 16 of 27 for 182 yards with a 30-yard TD pass to Amari Cooper and a 14-yarder to Keon Coleman before giving way to backup Mitchell Trubisky with Buffalo leading 33-0 through three quarters. And Trubisky piled on by completing a 69-yard touchdown pass to practice squad call-up Tyrell Shavers 2:23 into the fourth quarter. Allen's two-TD passing outing was the 64th of his career to match Peyton Manning for the third most in a player's first seven NFL seasons. Patrick Mahomes holds the record with 67 two-TD outings in that span, followed by Dan Marino's 65. Allen also became the NFL's first player with five consecutive 40-TD seasons, while his 1-yard score was the 65th rushing TD of his career, matching the team record held by Thurman Thomas. The five-time defending AFC East champion Bills improved to 13-3 to match a franchise single-season record, and will open the playoffs hosting the conference's seventh-seeded team in two weeks. The outing was a meltdown for Rodgers and the Jets (4-12), who will finish with five or fewer wins for the seventh time over a 14-season playoff drought — the NFL's longest active streak. Rodgers, who entered the game with 499 career TD passes and looking to become just the fifth player to reach 500, instead was shut out and replaced by Tyrod Taylor with 12:37 remaining. Discipline was an issue for a Jets team that fell to 2-9 since Jeff Ulbrich took over as interim coach. New York finished with 16 accepted penalties for 120 yards. Taylor accounted for New York's only points with a 9-yard TD pass to Garrett Wilson and a 20-yarder to Tyler Conklin in a game played in blustery, unseasonably warm conditions, with temperatures in the mid-50s Farenheit (10 Celsius) and winds gusting up to 35 mph (56 kmph). Rodgers finished 12 of 18 for 112 yards with two interceptions after entering the game having thrown only one in his past eight outings. He was also sacked four times, pushing his career total to 568, moving ahead of Tom Brady (565) and into first place on the NFL list. The outing became a comedy of errors for the Jets. Trailing 7-0 after Allen's 1-yard run, New York's three possession of the first half ended with turning the ball over on downs Buffalo's 24; Rodgers being intercepted at his own 17 by defensive tackle Jordan Phillips; and being sacked for a safety by A.J. Epenesa. The bottom fell out to close the third quarter when Rodgers' being intercepted by Christian Benford led to Cooper's leaping TD grab put Buffalo up 19-0. James Cook scored on a 1-yard run on Buffalo's next possession with 1:15 left, and Coleman's touchdown with 12 seconds left in the third was set up after Wilson lost a fumble. Home cooking The Bills finished their third season with a perfect record, and first since 1990, by going 8-0 at home. They've won 11 straight regular-season home games dating to last season since dropping a 24-22 decision to Denver on Nov. 13.

                "content": "Janusz Michallik believes that Manchester City will still play their part in deciding who wins the Premier League title. Manchester City won for the first time in five Premier League games on Sunday after goals from Erling Haaland and Savinho earned a 2-0 victory at Leicester City in manager Pep Guardiola's 500th game in charge. The champions' second win in 14 games across all competitions meant they climbed two spots to fifth place with 31 points, 11 behind leaders Liverpool who have two games in hand. Leicester remain in the relegation zone in 18th. \"We needed it, all of us,\" Guardiola told Sky Sports. \"Just relief, that is the word to express how all of us feel. We have done incredible things and now we struggle to win games so now it's just relief.\" Savinho netted his first goal for City in the 21st minute when he pounced on a rebound from Phil Foden's long shot after Leicester goalkeeper Jakub Stolarczyk pushed the ball into his path. The Brazilian fired into the roof of the net from a tight angle. Haaland, who has two goals in eight league games in the worst stretch of his Premier League career, doubled City's lead in the 74th minute when he headed home a looping cross from Savinho, who latched onto a pass from Kevin de Bruyne. \"Things happen and we have to keep going, we have to stay positive and focus on the right things,\" Haaland said, before pushing Guardiola in the direction of the visiting fans who were chanting his name. \"It's always a relief to score and that was an important goal to go 2-0 up.\" The victory was far from a walkover, however. Leicester fans screamed for a penalty early on when Jamie Vardy found himself one-on-one with goalkeeper Stefan Ortega from a counter-attack. Ortega brought Vardy down in the box but Man City were saved by the offside flag. Josko Gvardiol nearly cost Guardiola's team a first-half goal with a disastrous header back to Ortega that was intercepted. City's disorganised back line saw Facundo Buonanotte clatter a shot off the bar minutes later. Leicester had another glorious chance early in the second half when Vardy headed into the box and James Justin got a touch on it that looked heading for the back of the net before Manuel Akanji cleared it off the line. Vardy missed an absolute sitter when he launched a shot just over the bar from close range. \"It was tight in the second half, they were much better. We don't have energy to sustain 90 minutes. Hopefully the New Year can help us bounce back,\" Guardiola said. \"To get results you have to do something. To do it in the position we have, many good things happened today. It is not enjoyable right now, it is just relief. We have done incredible things for many years. It is not the best.\" Leicester manager Ruud van Nistelrooy, who shared a long hug with Guardiola after the final whistle, told the BBC he has to judge his team's performance as well as the result. \"I wouldn't do the players credit if I didn't. We're professional, we know it's about results but we have to look through that because of the performance today,\" he said. \"We have to be judged on results and translate performances into results.\"",

The frailties that meant Pep Guardiola's reigning Premier League champions headed into this match on a dismal trot of one win in 13 across all competitions were again on display, most notably as Leicester repeatedly cut through a flimsy press and vacant midfield, during the first half. But the lack of cutting edge that has similarly afflicted City over the past couple of months was not a problem in the East Midlands. Savinho scored a long-awaited first goal for the club since his summer move from Troyes in the 21st minute. It was even more of a slog in the second half for English football's dominant force of recent years, who were in the rare position of being restricted to 33% of possession in the period between the restart, and Erling Haaland headed home his 14th goal of the season from Savinho's cross to seal the points.

But a 10th-minute incident seemed to drain City's heavily diluted self-belief. Jamie Vardy sprung into the box and was brought down by Stefan Ortega. An offside flag meant an obvious penalty concession was averted as Guardiola's men struggled to recover their poise. As such, the breakthrough came against the run of play, Phil Foden moved smartly to get off a snap shot from Rico Lewis' pass. Stolarczyk saved, but could only push the ball out to the on-rushing Savinho, who clattered home a high finish from a tight angle.

In contrast to the ice-cool Dutchman, Josko Gvardiol was shockingly accident-prone as half-time approached and his botched aerial clearance led to Facundo Buonanotte heading against the post. City were late out for the second period, but Guardiola's words of wisdom did little to stem the tide. Manuel Akanji cleared off the line to deny James Justin before Vardy wasted a glorious close-range opportunity. The veteran striker would rue that profligacy in the final 20 minutes as Guardiola's side finally strung together a second-half attack with conviction. The criminally under-used England U21 playmaker James McAtee, on for Foden, started it with some wonderfully smart play on the right. De Bruyne worked the ball to Savinho, who crossed for Haaland to thump in a header at the back post. A much-needed 14th Premier League goal of the season for the big Norwegian and a much-needed three points for City. But perhaps it's McAtee, brimming with confidence, and Savinho after a breakthrough afternoon who can give them a route out of the darkness.

Don't expect this to spark one of their patented monster runs. They were pretty awful for large chunks of this game against a Leicester side who, if they avoid relegation, will not do so by very much. Guardiola is in deep conversation with Harry Winks, briefly stroking his face. He's a strange man, all told, but he can enjoy a nice glass of wine tonight. Maybe you will too. Thanks for joining us. 90 mins+5: Leicester keep coming and Patson Daka heads over under pressure from Lewis. It's a corner. Guardiola and Van Nistelrooy are already having a cuddle and a chat on the sidelines. 90 mins: Will Alves replaces Mavididi for Leicester. He'll have five minutes of added time to strut his stuff. 89 mins: That's a clever header from Vardy that glances the top of Ortega's crossbar. If he'd done as well with easier opportunities today the outcome would probably look quite different. 87 mins: Boyhood City fan McAtee is revelling in this cameo in front of an adoring away support. Haaland drives a break and finds the England U21 star, who curls for the top corner from outside the box. It wasn't far away. 81 mins: Buy a ticket, lads! Choudhury, who is on to provide a little extra thrust down the right, fires a fine ball across the Manchester City goalmouth but there's no one there to finish. 74 mins: GOOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!!!! Erling Haaland!!!!!! Smash, meet grab. Finally City string together a nice break, with McAtee the instigator. Play moves to Savinho via De Bruyne and the Brazilian hangs up a delicious cross to the far post for Haaland to head home. The City fans away to my left go potty... then sing McAtee's name.

Meanwhile, Vardy arrows a poor cross over everyone from a good position the right channel. El Khannouss flies into Lewis in over-enthusiastic fashion and the visitors can make their change. Foden, who looks exhausted, makes way. 62 mins: Kristiansen gets forward from full-back, Ajkanji with an important near-post header. Now Lewis fouls the Leicester man and it's a free-kick in a good position. It gets to Vestergaard at the back post, Vardy tries to turn goalwards, James does, Akanji off the line! 59 mins: Now a dangerous free-kick for Leicester, floated to the back post and Haaland is there to clatter away. All hands to the pump for Manchester City. 57 mins: Soumare gives away a pretty needless free-kick on the left. De Bruyne over it but Foden delivers and does so beautifully. Soumare atones by clearing behind. Haaland pops a volley towards goal from the latest short corner routine but Stolarczyk plunges onto it. 55 mins: Crucial clearance behind from Vestergaard. Foden crosses to the back post, Silva nods across and Gvardiol was lurking for the sucker punch, De Bruyne wastes the short corner. 54 mins: El Khannouss lets fly from range. Close enough but not worrying Ortega. The general flow of what's unfolding in front of the Manchester City goalkeeper might be though. 51 mins: Buonanotte goes down under an Ake challenge after being played through by Vardy. This will be checked. Ake is furious. No penalty. And you have to ask, if it's no penalty why isn't it a yellow for diving? City haven't really started at all this half and are inviting those sorts of situations. 48 mins: Kovacic fouls Buonanotte on halfway. He's been the lone combative participant in that City midfield at times but must be closing in on a booking. Back underway. Leicester have been out there waiting for their opponents for a little while, in fairness. And it's not warm. Manchester City get through to halftime. Again they look so vulnerable, their midfield an abomination out of possession. But Savinho's first goal for the club is the difference for now. During their ongoing slump, they also led against Sporting CP, Brighton, Feyenoord, 44 mins: This one is much better but Ake gets up brilliantly at the far post to clear. 43 mins: Corner to Leicester. They're really putting Guardiola's men under the pump. Dreadful delivery from El Khannouss but De Bruyne volleys behind to give him another go. 39 mins: BUONANOTTE AGAINST THE POST! Another perplexing decision from Gvardiol, who gets up at the back post and heads the ball up towards his own penalty spot. Via Mavididi it looks to Buonanotte, who turns a header against Orteta's right upright. Haaland and Foden then launch a blistering City break but can't find the finishing touch. 37 mins: Vardy, surely offside, finds Buonanotte. Great save from Ortega. Now the flag goes up up but the German keeper was not to know. 36 mins: Almost a bundling solo goal from Haaland! Gvardiol gets himself into some strife but Kovacic wins the second ball and City have fashioned a counter-attack. Haaland powers on past a couple of challenges, switches onto his left foot inside the box but drags just wide. 33 mins: Ohhhh, Leciester should be level! An absolute doozy of a ball in from the right by El Khannouss. Vardy leaves it, Buonanotte can't get on the end of it and it goes out for a goal kick. A wonderful cross that deserved a goal. 30 mins: De Bruyne down under a Vestergaard challenge. Some City players appeal for a penalty but the Belgian himself was rightly not especially interested. 28 mins: Haaland flexes the neck muscles on the end of a deflected Silva cross but it's easy enough for Stolarczyk to gather. 27 mins: Some swagger returning to City now, but we've seen already seen how fragile that can be. Time for Leicester to bed in. De Bruyne making a complete nonsense of a short corner helps their cause. 21 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLLL!!!!!!! Savinho!!!! Slightly against the run of play but how they needed that. Foden crafts something from nothing on the end of a Lewis pass and gets a shot away quickly from 25 yards. Stolarczyk parries but the onrushing Savinho cracks into the top corner on the rebound for his first City goal.

Ortega saves smartly and it's a corner. After a decent start, self-belief once again looks to have drained from the champions. Leicester waste the corner but Guardiola looks understandably concerned. 16 mins: More encouragement for Leicester as Vardy nips into the box. Lewis nips in smartly before the flag goes up again. City living dangerously because Vardy will time one of those before long. 12 mins: De Bruyne over the City free-kick. He scored from a similar range to this on this ground a couple of years ago... into the wall. 10 mins: Leicester scythe through the City midfield like everyone does nowadays, Ortega hesitates and brings Vardy down... offside. Good job for the City goalkeeper that it was because that was a definite penalty otherwise. 9 mins: Leicester look to break up the other end but Gvardiol closes the door on James. 7 mins: Fantastic save by Stolarczyk! Lewis floats a ball over the Leicester defence, De Bruyne volleys a first-time cross from near the byline. Haaland is on the end of it right-footed but the Foxes' keep does superbly to keep the strike out with his boot. 6 mins: Leicester's first foray ends with Mavididi sashaying into the box from the left and shooting wide of the far post. 5 mins: Kovacic coughs up possession carelessly but he and Lewis snap in to win it back before De Bruyne lashes over a left-footed sighter from way downtown. 2 mins: City with some patient, tentative possession before Savinho shifts gears past a few challenges into the box. He runs out of pitch before he can get a cross off, though. De Bruyne gets us underway. Foden starting wide right for the visitors. 4 mins before kickoff: Here come the teams, soundtracked by a bugle player. He'll probably get himself a Kasabian b-side at some point. Some flames pumped into the sky too. Appreciated the heat from that in a slightly nippy press box. 7 mins before kickoff: City are in the tunnel waiting for the hosts as the familiar strains of 'Club Foot' by Kasabian pump around the King Power. Jack Grealish, back on the bench today, appears to be in charge of morale as he aimings to lighten the mood with Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne. 25 mins before kickoff: The teams are well underway with their warmups. One of the cameras servicing the stadium feed was trained on Erling Haaland for some time. As you'd expect, given the Norwegian superstar has only three goals in his past 13 Premier League games, an unheard of return for most of his career. Haaland and Phil Foden were passing the ball intently between themselves for a decent period. Guardiola needs overdue big performances from those two today. 45 mins before kickoff: De Bruyne has enjoyed himself a few times on this ground before. In the previous edition of this fixture two seasons ago, the Belgian maestro scored the only goal with this sumptuous free-kick.

Facundo Buonanotte will support the veteran Englishman in attack as he comes in for the suspended Jordan Ayew. Your last XI of 2024 📋#LEIMCI pic.twitter.com/efV9UQfBLi 1 hr 15 mins before kickoff: The teams are in and Kevin De Bruyne makes his first start since City's Manchester derby defeat a fortnight ago. De Bruyne replacing his compatriot Jeremy Doku is the only change to the City XI that drew 1-1 with Everton three days ago, which probably means either Phil Foden or Bernardo Silva being deployed on the right wing. Your City squad! 🩵XI | Ortega Moreno, Lewis, Akanji, Ake, Gvardiol, Kovacic, De Bruyne (C), Bernardo, Savinho, Foden, HaalandSUBS | Carson, Walker, Grealish, Doku, Gundogan, Simpson-Pusey, Mubama, O'Reilly, McAtee#ManCity | @etihad pic.twitter.com/DjMhE7fP1k 1 hr 30 mins before kickoff: Recent history suggests that this might not be a bad fixture for Manchester City to try and get back on the horse. They have won on each of their past four visits to the King Power Stadium without conceding a goal. However, clean sheets are not really part of the equation for Guardiola's team at this juncture and Leicester have also dished out a couple of the most painful beatings of his tenure. A raucous 4-2 win on this ground eight years ago marked a low point of the Catalan's first season in the Premier League as two late goals from the visitors undeservedly softened the scoreline. Then there was the Foxes' 5-2 victory at a behind-closed-doors Etihad Stadium in September 2021. That defeat immediately preceded the arrival of defensive lynchpin Ruben Dias (currently injured, of course) and City look like they need similarly transformative reinforcements next month. 2 hours before kickoff: It can't go on like this for Manchester City, can it? In the immortal words of Mick McCarthy... it can! Leicester are on a bad run of form themselves but being in a relegation dogfight against an opponent they've often enjoyed cutting down to size could be a combination of circumstances too heady for Pep Guardiola's incredibly brittle team. This Premier League match kicks off in Leicester at 2:30 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: Jamie Vardy sat out the 3-1 loss to Liverpool with a knock. The veteran striker is back and will be keen to add to a handsome career record of nine goals against City. Ricardo Pereira (thigh), Mads Hermansen (groin), Wilfred Ndidi (thigh) and Abdul Fatawu (knee) remain sidelined. Wout Faes is also out with an injury sustained in the loss to Wolves. Jordan Ayew, who scored at Anfield, is suspended for this game, with Facundo Buonanotte coming into the forward line. Leicester lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Stolarczyk (GK) — Justin, Coady, Vestergaard, Kristiansen — Winks, Soumare — El Khannouss, Buonanotte, Mavididi — Vardy Injured: Pereira, Hermansen, Ndidi, Fatawu, FaesSuspended: Ayew (yellow-card accumulation) MORE: All the latest Man City news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings Kyle Walker (illness) and Jack Grealish (muscular) sat out the Everton game and will be assessed alongside fellow absentees Matheus Nunes and Ederson. Defensive injuries have arguably been just as big a problem for City as Rodri being out for the season. John Stones and Ruben Dias remain sidelined, although Nathan Ake was only substituted as a precaution against Everton on his return from a hamstring injury and will probably be asked to go back to the well once more. Savinho and Jeremy Doku started as a dual wing threat last time out, although Guardiola might take a more circumspect approach away from home. Kevin De Bruyne was feeling the effects of a virus on Boxing Day but is likely to return to the starting XI. Man City lineup (4-1-4-1, right to left): Ortega (GK) — Lewis, Akanji, Ake, Gvardiol — Kovacic — Foden, De Bruyne, Silva, Savinho — Haaland Injured: Stones, Dias, Nunes, Ederson, Walker (doubt), Grealish (doubt)Suspended: None Here's how to watch this Premier League match across selected areas of the world's major regions: If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.

                "title": "Aaron Rodgers - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Aaron Charles Rodgers (born December 2, 1983) is an American professional football quarterback for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the California Golden Bears (where he set several career passing records, including lowest single-season and career interception rates[1]), before being selected in the first round of the 2005 NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers, spending 18 seasons with the team.[2] He is regarded among the greatest[3] and most talented quarterbacks of all time.[4] After backing up Brett Favre for the first three years of his NFL career, Rodgers became the Packers' starting quarterback in 2008. In the 2010 season, he led them to a victory in Super Bowl XLV, earning the Super Bowl MVP. He was named Associated Press Athlete of the Year in 2011,[5] and was voted league MVP by the Associated Press for the 2011, 2014, 2020, and 2021 NFL seasons. Rodgers is the fifth player to win NFL MVP in consecutive seasons, joining Peyton Manning, Favre, Joe Montana and Jim Brown. Rodgers has led the NFL six times in touchdown-to-interception ratio (2011, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2020, 2021);[6] six times in lowest passing interception percentage (2009, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021);[7] four times in passer rating (2011, 2012, 2020, 2021);[8] and four times in touchdown passing percentage (2011, 2012, 2020, 2021);[9] three times in total touchdowns (2011, 2016, 2020); twice in touchdown passes (2016, 2020)[10] and once in yards per attempt (2011) and completion percentage (2020).[11] Rodgers is first on the NFL's all-time regular-season career passer rating list, with a regular-season career passer rating of over 100 (the first to ever have a career rating over 100) while also having had the highest passer rating, the best touchdown-to-interception ratio and the lowest passing interception percentage in NFL history throughout the entire 2010s decade. In the postseason, he is second in both touchdown passes and touchdown-to-interception ratio, fourth in passing yards, and fifth in all-time passer rating. In the regular season, he has the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in NFL history at 4.53,[12] holds the league's lowest career interception percentage at 1.4 percent[13] and the highest single-season passer rating record of 122.5.[14] Rodgers is also a four-time winner of the Best NFL Player ESPY Award. Rodgers was born on December 2, 1983, in Chico, California,[15] the son of Darla Leigh (née Pittman) and Edward Wesley Rodgers. His father is a Texas-born chiropractor who played football as an offensive lineman for the Chico State Wildcats from 1973 to 1976.[16][17] Rodgers is of English, Irish and German ancestry.[16] The family moved to Ukiah, California, where he attended Oak Manor Elementary School.[18] Edward Rodgers tossed a football with his sons Luke, Aaron and Jordan Rodgers, and told them not to drink and not to party in college or they would limit themselves in sports like he did. Aaron took this advice to heart.[17] At the age of ten, he was featured on the front page of the Ukiah Daily Journal for his top performance at a local basketball free throw competition.[18] Later, the family moved to Beaverton, Oregon, where Rodgers attended Vose Elementary School and Whitford Middle School, and played baseball in the Raleigh Hills Little League at shortstop, center field and pitcher.[19] The Rodgers family returned to Chico in 1997, and Aaron attended Pleasant Valley High School, starting for two years at quarterback and garnering 4,421 passing yards.[20] He set single-game records of six touchdowns and 440 all-purpose yards. Rodgers set a single-season school record with 2,466 total yards in 2001.[21] He graduated from Pleasant Valley High School in spring 2002, after scoring 1310 in the SAT and with an A− average.[22][23][24] Despite his impressive high school record, Rodgers attracted little interest from Division I programs.[25] In a 2011 interview with E:60, he attributed the relative lack of attention in the recruiting process to his unimposing physical stature as a high school player at 5'10\" (1.78 m) and 165 lb (75 kg). Rodgers wanted to attend Florida State and play under head coach Bobby Bowden, but was rejected.[26] He was only offered an opportunity to compete for a scholarship as a walk-on from University of Illinois.[27] He declined the invitation, and considered quitting football to play baseball instead or giving up entirely on the idea of playing in professional sports and attending law school after completing his undergraduate degree.[28] He was then recruited to play football at Butte College in Oroville, a junior college about 15 miles (25 km) southeast of Chico.[29] Rodgers threw 26 touchdowns in his freshman season at Butte,[30][31] leading the school to a 10–1 record, the NorCal Conference championship,[32] and a No. 2 national ranking. While there, he was discovered by the California Golden Bears' head coach Jeff Tedford, who was recruiting Butte tight end Garrett Cross.[33] Tedford was surprised to learn that Rodgers had not been recruited earlier. Because of Rodgers' good high school scholastic record, he was eligible to transfer to the University of California, Berkeley after one year of junior college instead of the typical two.[34] As a junior college transfer, Rodgers had three years of eligibility at Cal. He was named the starting quarterback in the fifth game of the 2003 season, beating the only team that offered him a Division I opportunity out of high school, Illinois.[35] As a sophomore, he helped lead the Golden Bears to a 7–3 record as a starter.[1][36] In his second career start, Rodgers led the team to a 21–7 halftime lead against #3 USC. Due to injury, Rodgers was replaced in the second half by Reggie Robertson.[37][38] The Bears won in triple overtime, 34–31.[37][39] Rodgers passed for 394 yards and was named game MVP in the Insight Bowl against Virginia Tech.[40][41] In 2003, Rodgers tied the school season record for 300-yard games with five and set a school record for the lowest percentage of passes intercepted at 1.43%.[42] As a junior, Rodgers led Cal to a 10–1 record and top-five ranking at the end of the regular season, with their only loss a 23–17 loss at No. 1 USC.[43] In that game, Rodgers set a school record for consecutive completed passes with 26 and tied an NCAA record with 23 consecutive passes completed in one game.[44] He set a Cal single-game record for passing completion percentage of 85.3.[45][46] Rodgers holds the Cal career record for lowest percentage of passes intercepted at 1.95 percent.[42] Rodgers' performance set up the Golden Bears at first and goal with 1:47 remaining and a chance for the game-winning touchdown. On the first play of USC's goal line stand, Rodgers threw an incomplete pass. This was followed by a second-down sack by Manuel Wright.[47] After a timeout and Rodgers' incomplete pass on third down, USC stopped Cal's run play to win the game.[47] Rodgers commented that it was \"frustrating that we couldn't get the job done.\"[47] Overall, he finished the 2004 season with 2,566 passing yards, 24 touchdowns, and eight interceptions. His 66.1% pass completion percentage led the Pac-10.[48][49] He finished ninth in Heisman Trophy voting.[50] After Texas was picked over Cal for a Rose Bowl berth, the fourth-ranked Bears were awarded a spot in the Holiday Bowl, which they lost to Texas Tech, 45–31.[51] After the season, Rodgers decided to forgo his senior season to enter the 2005 NFL draft.[52] Rodgers was expected to be selected early in the 2005 NFL Draft as he had posted impressive numbers as a junior with Cal, throwing for 2,320 yards with a 67.5 completion rate in the regular season. He threw for 24 touchdowns and only eight interceptions in his last college season, impressing many NFL scouts. They commented that he was a \"talented strong-armed junior\"[54] who \"combines arm strength, mechanics and delivery to make all the throws\", but noted that his stats could be inflated due to playing in a quarterback-friendly system and that he would need to adjust to the more elaborate defensive schemes of the NFL.[54] Before the draft, Rodgers was confident that he would be drafted to the team he supported and grew up near,[58] the San Francisco 49ers, who possessed the No. 1 overall pick in the draft.[59] The 49ers, however, drafted quarterback Alex Smith out of Utah instead, and Rodgers slid all the way down to the 24th overall pick by the Green Bay Packers. Rodgers has said that he experienced much angst and restlessness when waiting to be selected several hours into the draft, as he had expected himself to be selected much sooner.[58] Rodgers' slip to the 24th selection and the Packers choosing to pick Brett Favre's future replacement became one of the biggest stories of the draft, though he was still the second quarterback selected. His drop in the draft was later ranked number one on the NFL Network's Top 10 Draft Day Moments.[60] Many teams drafting between the second and 23rd positions had positional needs more pressing than quarterback.[61][62] Rodgers is one of six quarterbacks coached by Jeff Tedford to be drafted in the first round of an NFL draft, joining Trent Dilfer, Akili Smith, David Carr, Joey Harrington and Kyle Boller.[63] In August 2005, Rodgers agreed to a reported five-year, $7.7 million deal that included $5.4 million in guaranteed money and had the potential to pay him as much as $24.5 million if all incentives and escalators were met.[64] Rodgers spent his rookie season as the Packers' backup quarterback behind Brett Favre.[65] The Packers were 4–12 at this point and he received his first extended look in the opening preseason game against the San Diego Chargers after replacing Favre.[66] In his first NFL game, Rodgers completed two out of seven passes and was sacked twice. He continued to struggle through the preseason, before ending the preseason by converting two third downs and throwing a touchdown pass to tight end Ben Steele against the Tennessee Titans.[67] Once the regular season began, Rodgers saw very little action that year. He played against the New Orleans Saints in the fourth quarter of a 52–3 victory, and completed his first career pass to fullback Vonta Leach for 0 yards.[68] On December 19, 2005, Rodgers entered the game against the Baltimore Ravens at the end of the third quarter in a 48–3 loss.[68] He completed eight of 15 passes for 65 yards and an interception.[69] After the Packers' losing season, head coach Mike Sherman was fired and replaced by Mike McCarthy.[70][71] Rodgers was then placed in McCarthy's \"Quarterback school\" for six hours a day several times a week.[72] This focused on working on Rodgers' motor skills such as hand-eye coordination, finger dexterity, and mechanics.[73] McCarthy also worked on Rodgers' release point, moving it from right beside the ear hole of his helmet to further below it, to give him a smoother release.[74] When the 2006 preseason began, Rodgers played as the backup in all four games; he completed 22 out 38 passes for 323 yards and three touchdowns.[68] Rodgers saw very little action during the 2006 season, but did step in briefly on October 2 against the Philadelphia Eagles when Favre left the game due to injury.[68] On November 19, 2006, Rodgers broke his left foot while playing against the New England Patriots in a 35–0 defeat at home, filling in for an injured Favre, and Rodgers missed the remainder of the 2006 season.[72] Following the team's season-ending victory at Chicago, Favre announced that he would stay with the Packers for the 2007 season, again postponing Rodgers' hopes of becoming the Packers' starting quarterback.[75] Prior to the 2007 season, rumors surfaced about a potential trade involving Rodgers in which he would be traded to the Oakland Raiders for wide receiver Randy Moss.[76] However, Moss was traded to the Patriots during the second day of the 2007 NFL draft, and Rodgers stayed in Green Bay.[77] Rodgers stepped in when Favre was injured in the second quarter against the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday Night Football on November 29, 2007.[78] Rodgers completed 18 passes for 201 yards, with no interceptions.[78] He also threw his first touchdown pass but was sacked three times.[78] Rodgers brought the team back from a 17-point deficit to a 3-point deficit, but the Cowboys went on to win 37–27.[78] Favre's retirement announcement on March 4, 2008, opened up the Packers' starting quarterback position to Rodgers for the 2008 season. Although Favre decided to return from retirement, he was traded to the New York Jets, which meant that Rodgers would become the starter.[79] Rodgers quickly proved that he was one of the best quarterbacks in the league by passing for 4,038 yards in his first season as a starter as well as throwing for 28 touchdowns and only 13 interceptions. As of the 2023 season, this still stands as the most interceptions he has thrown in a season.[80] With Rodgers making his debut as a starter, the Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings 24–19 at Lambeau Field. This marked the first time since 1992 that a quarterback other than Favre started a regular season game for the Packers. Rodgers ended the game with 178 yards passing and two touchdowns (one passing and one rushing).[81] In just his second NFL start the following week, Rodgers was voted the FedEx Air award winner after passing for 328 yards and three touchdowns in a win against the Lions.[82] During the fourth week of the season, Rodgers' streak of 157 consecutive pass attempts without an interception ended when he was intercepted by Derrick Brooks of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The streak was the third-longest in franchise history behind Bart Starr (294) and Brett Favre (163).[83] Rodgers suffered a severe shoulder sprain in the game but continued to start and played well in a win against the Seattle Seahawks two weeks later.[84] Despite early successes, Rodgers had been unable to win a close game during the season despite seven opportunities to do so.[84][85] On October 31, 2008, Rodgers signed a six-year, $65 million contract extension through the 2014 season.[86][87] In Rodgers' first full season with the team, the Packers finished with a 6–10 record and missed the playoffs.[88] For the opening game of the 2009 season, Rodgers recorded his first win in a comeback situation. The Packers were trailing at the beginning of the fourth quarter when Rodgers completed a fifty-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings with about a minute remaining in the game to contribute to the 21–15 victory over the Chicago Bears.[89] Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for October 2009, when he passed for 988 yards, completed 74.5 percent of his passes, and recorded a passer rating over 110 for all three games played during the month.[90] After a 4–4 start to the season and a 38–28 loss to the previously winless Buccaneers,[91] the team began to heat up. Rodgers led the Packers to five straight wins, in which he threw for a total of 1,324 yards, nine touchdowns, and two interceptions.[92] Rodgers and the Packers won two of their last three games, finishing the second half of the season with a 7–1 record and an overall 11–5 record; good enough to secure a wild card playoff berth and clinch the fifth seed in the playoffs.[93][94] The Packers set a new franchise record by scoring 461 total points (third in the league), breaking the previous record held by the 1996 Super Bowl team (456).[95][96] Rodgers became the first quarterback in NFL history ever to throw for 4,000 yards in both of his first two years as a starter.[97] He finished the season fourth in passing yards (4,434), touchdown passes (30), passer rating (103.2), and yards per attempt (8.2) as well as eighth in completion percentage (64.7%), while also coming second among quarterbacks in rushing yards (316).[98] His passing yardage made him second all-time in Packers history, behind only Lynn Dickey's all-time single-season record.[99] His passer rating of 103.2 was also third-highest in team history at the time, behind only Bart Starr's 105.0 rating in 1966 and 104.3 rating in 1968 (minimum 150 attempts).[100] In the Wild Card Round, the Packers played the Arizona Cardinals, the same team they had previously beaten the week before, 33–7.[101] Rodgers and Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner put on a show that later ranked second on NFL Network's Top 10 Quarterback Duels.[102] Rodgers' first pass was intercepted by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie.[103] Rodgers settled down after that miscue, however, and finished the game completing 28 of 42 passes for 423 yards, with four touchdown passes all in a second-half comeback. His 423 passing yards are the most by any quarterback in his first playoff game as well as his four touchdown passes and five total touchdowns.[104] Warner shredded the Packers' second-ranked defense, completing 29 of 33 passes for 379 yards, five touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 154.1. Despite Rodgers' offensive efforts, the Packers lost the game when he fumbled on a controversial play in overtime. The ball was returned by Karlos Dansby for the winning touchdown in the 51–45 Cardinals victory.[105] It was the highest scoring playoff game in NFL history.[106] Due to his regular season performance, Rodgers earned a trip to his first Pro Bowl as the NFC's third quarterback, behind Drew Brees and Brett Favre. However, after Favre dropped out due to injury and Brees was replaced due to his participation in Super Bowl XLIV, Rodgers became the NFC's starter.[107] In 2010, Rodgers led the Packers to a 2–0 start, but then lost three of their next four games, including back-to-back overtime losses. The two overtime defeats brought Rodgers' record in overtime games to 0–5.[108] At midseason, Rodgers had already thrown nine interceptions compared to only throwing seven all of the previous season, and was 16th in the league with an 85.3 passer rating.[109] Over the remainder of the regular season, however, his play improved as he threw 16 touchdowns to only two interceptions, completed 71.4% of his passes, and had a passer rating of 122.0.[110] In Week 13, in a 34–16 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, Rodgers had 298 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn his first career NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor.[111][112] In Week 14, he sustained his second concussion of the season. Backup Matt Flynn was put into the game as Rodgers' replacement. The Packers lost the game 7–3 to the Lions.[113] Against the Patriots, Rodgers missed the next week's regular season start, ending his streak of consecutive starts at 45, which is tied for the second longest in team history.[114] After their road loss to the Patriots, the Packers found themselves at 8–6 and had to win their final two regular season games to qualify for the playoffs. Rodgers turned around the team's performance; they won their final two regular season games, one of them against the New York Giants, where Rodgers completed 25 of 37 passes for 404 yards, with four touchdown passes, and with a passer rating of 139.9.[115] It was his first regular season 400-yard passing game. For his effort against the Giants, he earned his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2010 season.[116] In the next game, they defeated the Bears by a score of 10–3 in the regular season finale.[117] Rodgers was named the FedEx Air NFL Player of the Year for his passing performance in the 2010 season.[118] With a 10–6 record, the Packers entered the playoffs as a Wild Card and the No. 6 seed. In the Wild Card Round, they defeated the No. 3 seeded Eagles 21–16.[119] In the Divisional Round, Rodgers completed 31 of 36 pass attempts for 366 yards and four touchdowns in a 48–21 blowout victory over the No. 1 seeded Atlanta Falcons.[120] It was the most points scored in Packers postseason history.[121] During the contest, Rodgers tied an NFL record for consecutive playoff games with at least three touchdown passes (3 games). Rodgers also set an NFL record by becoming the only quarterback to pass for ten touchdowns combined through three consecutive playoff games. On January 23, 2011, Rodgers had a 55.4 passer rating as the Packers beat the No. 2 seed Chicago Bears 21–14 win to capture the NFC Championship.[122] After winning the NFC Championship, the Packers earned a trip to Super Bowl XLV against the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the game, Rodgers completed 24 of 39 pass attempts for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the 31–25 win, and was named Super Bowl MVP for his performance.[123][124] This would ultimately be his only Super Bowl appearance with the Packers. From his playoff performance, Rodgers became only the third player in NFL history to pass for over 1,000 yards in a single postseason and also became one of only four quarterbacks to record over 300 yards passing, with at least three touchdown passes, and no interceptions in a Super Bowl.[125] He finished with 1,094 passing yards, nine touchdown passes, two rushing touchdowns, and two interceptions, while completing 68.2% of his passes for a passer rating of 109.8.[126] From this postseason, Rodgers also became the only player to pass for at least 900 yards and rush for at least two touchdowns in a single postseason.[127] He was ranked 11th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.[128] Because of the 2011 NFL lockout, the Packers and Rodgers did not schedule unofficial off-season workouts, despite many teams doing so.[129] Rodgers and the Packers quickly quelled any concerns over their readiness by defeating the Saints, who had scheduled off-season workouts, 42–34. He had 312 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[130][131] After the game, Rodgers said in the press conference, \"I was going to ask myself, what would have happened if we had offseason workouts? I mean, could we have started any faster and scored more points tonight?\"[132] In Week 4, a 49–23 victory over the Denver Broncos, Rodgers had 408 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception and ran for two touchdowns to earn another NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor.[133][134] In Week 6, a 24–3 victory over the St. Louis Rams, Rodgers converted on a career-high 93-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson.[135] In Week 9, a 45–38 victory over the Chargers, he had 247 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn his third NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2011 season.[136][137] Rodgers and the Packers got off to a 13–0 start in 2011, tying the NFC record for most consecutive wins to start a season, but were upset by the Kansas City Chiefs 19–14 in week 15, ending their winning streak at 19 games, the second-longest winning streak in NFL history.[138][139] Rodgers finished the season with 4,643 passing yards, 45 touchdown passes, and six interceptions, good for a passer rating of 122.5, which as of 2024 is the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history.[140] His passing yards, touchdown passes, and passer rating set single-season franchise records.[141] In addition to passer rating, Rodgers led the league in touchdown to interception ratio (7.5, fourth-best all-time), touchdowns passing % (9.0%, second highest all-time), and yards per attempt (9.2, fourth-highest all-time since becoming an official stat in 1970), while finishing second in both touchdown passes (45, sixth-highest all-time) and completion percentage (68.3%), as well as fifth in passing yards. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month awards for September, October, and November, and FedEx Air Player of the Week six times (Weeks 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 13). In week four, against the Denver Broncos, Rodgers became the only quarterback in NFL history to record over 400 passing yards with four touchdown passes, while also rushing for two touchdowns in the same game.[142] He was the winner of the 2011 Galloping gobbler as MVP of the Thanksgiving game between the Packers and the Lions, a 27–15 Green Bay victory, and tied an NFL record for consecutive games with at least two touchdown passes (13). The Packers became the fifth team in NFL history to finish the regular season with a 15–1 record.[143] Rodgers played in 15 of the 16 games, with the only exception being Week 17 against the Lions, a game in which Rodgers was rested after the club clinched home-field advantage for the playoffs the previous week. In the game, Rodgers assisted backup quarterback Matt Flynn in his stellar 480-yard, six-touchdown performance by helping call some plays.[144] The Packers' offense set franchise record for points scored in a season with 560, which as of 2016 is the third-most ever behind only the 2007 Patriots and 2013 Broncos.[145] Rodgers set numerous NFL records in 2011. He recorded a passer rating of over 100.0 in thirteen games during the season, including twelve games in a row (both records), and a passer rating of 110.0 or higher in twelve games, including eleven in a row (also records). Rodgers also won the league's MVP award, receiving 48 of the 50 votes (the other two going to Drew Brees). He also finished second, behind Brees, for the AP Offensive Player of the Year award.[146] Rodgers' 2011 season was later ranked as the third greatest passing season of all time by ESPN in 2013, and was regarded as the most efficient.[147] The Packers were upset by the eventual Super Bowl champion Giants in the Divisional Round by the score of 37–20. The Packers' receiving corps dropped six passes in the loss and Rodgers finished the game with 264 passing yards, two touchdown passes, and an interception on his last pass attempt.[148] The 2011 Packers became the only team in NFL history to go 15–1 and not win a playoff game, as well as being the fourth consecutive team to win at least 15 games and not win the Super Bowl.[149] Rodgers was named to the Pro Bowl for his 2011 season to go along with a First-team All-Pro honor.[150][151] He was voted by his fellow players as the best player in the league on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.[152] Rodgers and the Packers started off the 2012 season with a 30–22 loss to the 49ers.[153] With the loss, Rodgers lost his bet with the music group Boyz II Men, and had to wear an Alex Smith jersey during the next week of practice.[154] Had the Packers won the game, Boyz II Men would have sung the national anthem during their next home game at Lambeau.[154] In Week 4, a 28–27 victory over the Saints, Rodgers had 319 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[155][156] In Week 6, against the undefeated Houston Texans, he tied the franchise record by throwing six touchdown passes, in a 42–24 victory, to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[157][158] The Texans had allowed only six total touchdowns passes during the season up to that point.[159] This sparked a five-game winning streak which Rodgers completed 65.7% of his passes for 1,320 yards, 17 touchdowns, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 119.1.[160] During that stretch, Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for October.[161] In Week 15, Rodgers threw for 291 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Packers past the Bears, 21–13, making them NFC North champions for the second consecutive year.[162] In the season finale, despite Rodgers going 28 of 40 for 365 yards, four touchdowns, no interceptions and a passer rating of 131.8, the Packers lost 37–34 against the Vikings.[163] This ended the Packers' twelve-game winning streak against NFC North opponents. The Packers finished with an 11–5 record, first in the NFC North, and clinched the #3-seed in the NFC playoffs.[164] Rodgers led the league for the second straight year in passer rating (108.0) touchdowns passing % (7.1%), and touchdown-to-interception ratio (4.875), while finishing second in touchdown passes (39), third in completion percentage (67.2%), fifth in yards per attempt (7.78), and eighth in passing yards (4,295).[165] In the playoffs, the Packers defeated the Minnesota Vikings 24–10 in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers completed 23 of 33 passes to ten different players for 274 yards and a touchdown.[166] They were beaten 45–31 by the 49ers in the Divisional Round.[167] Rodgers completed 26 of 39 passes for 257 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception, while also rushing for 28 yards, in the losing effort. He earned his third career Pro Bowl nomination for his performance in the 2012 season.[168] He was ranked sixth by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.[169] On April 26, 2013, the Packers and Rodgers agreed to a 5-year, $110 million contract extension making him the highest paid player in NFL history.[170] The Packers began their 2013 season against the reigning NFC champions, the 49ers, the team that also ended their playoff run the previous season. Rodgers went 21 for 37 in completions, 333 yards, three touchdowns and an interception in the 34–28 loss.[171] The following week, Rodgers had a career-high 480 passing yards to tie the franchise record in the 38–20 home-opener win against the Washington Redskins. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort against the Redskins.[172][173] His 335 passing yards in the first half set a club record.[174] He also became the first quarterback since Y. A. Tittle in 1962 to throw for at least 480 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions in a game.[175] The following week, Rodgers saw his NFL record of 41 consecutive games without throwing multiple interceptions come to an end in a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals by the score of 34–30.[176][177] After the loss to the Bengals, the Packers started rolling, winning their next four games. Against the Ravens, the Packers lost two receivers: Randall Cobb and James Jones. Cobb was sidelined with a broken leg and Jones with a sprained PCL.[178] Against the Cleveland Browns, tight end Jermichael Finley was carted off the field with a bruised spinal cord, leaving Rodgers without three of his top four offensive weapons.[179] The next week against the Vikings, Rodgers completed 24 of 29 passes in a 44–31 victory.[180] At home against the Bears in Week 9, Rodgers was sacked by Shea McClellin. He fractured his left clavicle in the process, and the speculation for his return ranged from a few weeks to an indefinite timetable that became a weekly spectacle of whether or when he might be cleared to play again.[181][182][183] Before Rodgers had broken his collarbone, the Packers had won four straight games to climb to the top of the NFC North division with a 5–2 record. With Rodgers injured and unable to play, the Packers went winless over the next five weeks to fall to 5–6–1 on the season.[184] After rallying in December behind re-acquired backup quarterback Matt Flynn,[185] the Packers had fought their way back to a 7–7–1 record going into the final week of the season. On December 26, Packers head coach Mike McCarthy announced Rodgers would return and start in the season-finale showdown against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field for the NFC North championship.[186] Returning from the injury, Rodgers threw for 318 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the regular season finale against the Bears.[187] Trailing 27–28 with under a minute to go in the game and facing the third 4th down of the drive, a 4th & 8 from the 48-yard line, Rodgers connected with Cobb, who was also returning for his first game since breaking his leg in Week 6, for a 48-yard game-winning touchdown to clinch the NFC North and earn the right to host a home playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers as the fourth seed.[188] Rodgers won the 2013 GMC Never Say Never Award for the come-from-behind, division-winning touchdown pass. Rodgers finished fifth in the league in passer rating (104.9), completion percentage (66.6%), and yards per game (282) while also finishing second in yards per attempt (8.75).[189] Rodgers led the Packers to the playoffs again, this time with an 8–7–1 record and were up against the team that eliminated them last year in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, the 49ers.[190] The Packers lost to the 49ers for the fourth consecutive time, 23–20 on a last second field goal at Lambeau Field, in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers recorded only 177 yards passing, his lowest in a playoff game, and one touchdown pass.[191] He was ranked No. 11 by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.[192] The Packers' 2014 regular season debut came against the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks—a game in which they would go on to lose 36–16.[193] In Week 2, the team began the game with a 21–3 deficit against the Jets, but came back and won 31–24.[194] The 18-point comeback marked the biggest comeback in Rodgers' career.[195] In the third week of the season, the Packers offense was shut down by the Lions' defense, 19–7.[196] The Packers' 7 points were the fewest points allowed in a game Rodgers finished; the 223 yards of total Packer offense were the lowest since Rodgers took over at quarterback and his 162 passing yards were also a career low. For the third consecutive season, the Packers were off to a 1–2 start. In those three games, Rodgers threw five touchdowns and one interception combined, with a passer rating of 95.1. Amid widespread concern, Rodgers told the fans and the media, \"R-E-L-A-X. Relax. We're going to be OK.\"[197] After their loss to the Lions, the Packers went on a four-game win streak, during which, Rodgers threw 13 touchdowns with no interceptions.[198] In Week 4, a 38–17 victory over the Bears, he had 302 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[199][200] In Week 6, against the Miami Dolphins, Rodgers led the Packers to a game-winning drive with less than two minutes remaining. He completed a 4th & 10 pass to wide receiver Jordy Nelson and mimicked Dan Marino's famous fake spike play by completing a pass to wide receiver Davante Adams to get to within four yards of the endzone later in the drive.[201] Rodgers then completed a touchdown pass to tight end Andrew Quarless to win the game 27–24.[202] This play would later win Rodgers the GMC Never Say Never Moment of the Year Award.[202] In Week 7, a 38–17 victory over the Carolina Panthers, he was 19-of-22 for 255 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[203][204] In a Week 8 loss against the Saints, Rodgers finished 28 of 39 for 418 yards, with one touchdown pass and two interceptions, ending his 212 consecutive attempts without an interception streak[205]—the second longest in team history. In the game, Rodgers injured his hamstring which appeared to have an effect on his play for the remainder of the game.[206] In Week 10, against the Chicago Bears, Rodgers became the second player in NFL history and the first since Daryle Lamonica in 1969 to throw six touchdown passes in the first half.[207] Rodgers finished 18 of 27 for 315 yards and six touchdowns despite only playing one drive in the second half to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[208][209] Rodgers set multiple records during the game: most touchdown passes of 70 or more yards with 16—breaking the record held by Brett Favre and Peyton Manning, most consecutive touchdown passes without an interception at home—breaking the record also held by Favre and Manning, and became the first quarterback to ever have 10 touchdown passes against the same team in a season.[208] The 55–14 victory tied the Packers' 55–7 win vs. the Titans in 2009 for the most points scored by a Rodgers-led offense. In a Week 11 game against the 7–2 Eagles, Rodgers set a record for most consecutive attempts at home without an interception, breaking Tom Brady's record of 288 consecutive attempts.[210] In the 53–20 victory, he finished going 22 of 36, with 341 passing yards, three touchdown passes and no interceptions.[211] The 8–3 Packers met the 9–2 Patriots in Week 13, at Lambeau Field in what was Brady and Rodgers' first time playing against each other as starters.[212] Rodgers finished going 24 of 38, with 368 passing yards and two passing touchdowns in the 26–21 Packers victory.[213] For his efforts in the month of November, he earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month.[214] Rodgers suffered a calf injury in Week 16, against the Buccaneers, due to severe dehydration he endured from flu-like symptoms he suffered during the week.[215] In the Week 17 game against the Lions, Rodgers re-injured his left calf while extending a play and throwing a touchdown pass to Randall Cobb, then was helped off the field, and carted off to the locker room. After missing a series, Rodgers re-entered the game with the score tied 14–14. Despite being less mobile with the injury, Rodgers completed 13 of 15 passes for 129 yards and two scores against the league's second-ranked defense. The Packers won 30–20, winning their fourth straight NFC North title. Rodgers finished 17 of 22 for 226 yards, two touchdown passes, no interceptions, a 139.6 passer rating, and a rushing touchdown to earn his fourth NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2014 season.[216][217] The Packers secured the second seed in the NFC, rewarding them with a playoff bye and a week off which helped Rodgers rest and rehabilitate his injured left calf.[218] In the Divisional Round, the Packers were scheduled to play the 13–4 Cowboys, which marked the first time in NFL playoff history when a team which went undefeated at home (Packers) played against a team which went undefeated away (Cowboys).[219] Rodgers helped secure a 26–21 victory by finishing 24 of 35 for 316 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions, and a 125.4 passer rating.[220] The Packers then traveled to Seattle to face the top-seeded Seahawks in a rematch of the regular season opener.[221] In the NFC Championship Game, the Packers were leading 19–7 with just over five minutes to go, but the home team's offense finally woke up and, with the assistance of a crucial Packers special teams gaffe on an onside kick, the Seahawks led 22–19, with 44 seconds remaining. Rodgers quickly drove downfield to set up a tying field goal, only to watch from the sidelines as the Seahawks won the coin toss in overtime and proceeded to score the game-winning touchdown on their first possession. Rodgers was 19-for-34 for 178 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions in the losing effort.[222] Rodgers finished the regular season first in touchdown-to-interception ratio (7.6), lowest interception percentage (1.0%), second in passer rating (112.2), yards per attempt (8.4), and touchdown passing percentage (7.1%), third in touchdown passes (38), seventh in passing yards (4,381), and ninth in completion percentage (65.6%).[223] He set an NFL record for most consecutive pass attempts (512) at home without an interception, and touchdown passes (41). Rodgers was voted the AP NFL Most Valuable Player for the 2014 season, receiving 31 votes,[224] and was named NFC Offensive Player of the Year by the Kansas City Committee of 101[225] and Fed-Ex Air NFL Player of the Year.[226] He was also named to the AP All-Pro team as the first quarterback, receiving 44 votes while runner-up Tony Romo received three.[227] He was named to the Pro Bowl for the 2014 season.[228] He was ranked as the second best player in the league among his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.[229] In 2015, Rodgers had a down year by his standards. He threw for a career low 3,821 yards in which he played for at least 15 games, although he had 31 touchdowns to just eight interceptions.[230] Rodgers completed only 60.7 of his passes, averaged only 6.7 yards per attempt and finished with a passer rating of 92.7, all career lows. Pro Bowl wide receiver Jordy Nelson's absence due to injury for the season was considered a contributing factor in Rodgers' statistical drop compared to previous seasons.[231][232][233] In Week 3, a 38–28 victory over the Chiefs, Rodgers had 333 passing yards and five touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[234][235] During Week 9 against the Panthers, he finished with 369 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception. The interception came with only 1:47 left in the fourth quarter, and following the interception, Rodgers expressed frustration by throwing down a Microsoft Surface tablet.[236] The Packers ended up losing the game 29–37.[237] On December 3, 2015, in a Week 13 match-up against the Lions, Rodgers threw a Hail Mary pass caught by Richard Rodgers II for 61 yards with 0:00 left to beat the Lions 27–23, after the game was extended due to a facemask penalty called on Detroit.[238] The play was quickly dubbed as \"The Miracle in Motown.\"[239][240] The Packers made the playoffs as the fifth seed in the NFC with a 10–6 record.[241] They defeated the Redskins 35–18 on the road in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs. Rodgers finished the game with 210 yards and two passing touchdowns.[242] In the Divisional Round against the Cardinals, Rodgers threw a 41-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass to Jeff Janis as time expired to send the game into overtime. However, the Packers lost 26–20 in overtime. Rodgers finished the game 24 for 44 for 261 yards with two touchdowns and an interception.[243] He was named to his fifth Pro Bowl and was ranked as the sixth best player by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[244][245] Throughout the first five games of the 2016 season, Rodgers' struggles from the 2015 season appeared to continue.[246] Through those games, he completed 60.2% of his passes, averaged 6.5 yards per attempt, and posted a passer rating of 88.4—all of which were similar to his 2015 numbers.[247] He also fumbled five times, and lost two. His lackluster performance through those games caused much speculation about the causes of his problems.[248][246][249][250] In a Week 7 Thursday Night Football game against the Bears, Rodgers rebounded by recording a franchise record and career-high 39 completions, breaking Brett Favre's previous record of 36 in 1993, also against the Bears.[251] Rodgers recorded 326 passing yards for his first 300-yard passing game since Week 10 of the 2015 season in the 26–10 win.[252] The following week against the Atlanta Falcons, Rodgers recorded a career regular season high of 60 rushing yards,[252] and finished with four touchdown passes and a 125.5 passer rating.[253] After a Week 11 loss to the Redskins—the Packers' fourth in a row, putting them at 4–6—Rodgers was optimistic about the remainder of the season, saying, \"I feel like we can run the table, I really do.\"[254] Despite widespread doubt over the likelihood of such a run,[255][256][257] the Packers would go on to finish the season with six straight wins—as Rodgers said they could. In a Week 12 Monday Night Football game Rodgers appeared to injure his hamstring on a scrambling play against the Eagles.[258] After the play, Rodgers went into an injury tent on the sideline to get his leg taped up.[258] Rodgers, however, did not miss any snaps in the game and finished 30 out of 39 for 313 yards with no sacks or interceptions.[259] His 300-yard performance was his fourth of the season and the first allowed by the Eagles' defense all season.[259] The Packers won, 27–13, snapping their four-game losing streak. In a 38–10 victory over the Seahawks in a Week 14 game, Rodgers and the Packers continued their recent offensive and defensive success.[260][261] Rodgers finished with 246 passing yards, three touchdown passes and a 150.8 passer rating. The 150.8 passer rating was the best recorded against Seattle's defense since head coach Pete Carroll took over in 2010.[260] Rodgers did this despite suffering a calf injury early in the game.[260] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Seahawks.[262] On December 20, 2016, Rodgers was selected to his third consecutive Pro Bowl and his sixth overall in his career.[263] During Week 16, Rodgers and Drew Brees tied the NFL record for most seasons with at least 35 touchdown passes with four—a record shared with Peyton Manning and Tom Brady.[264][265] In the game against the Vikings, Rodgers finished 28 of 38 for 347 yards, four touchdown passes and a rushing touchdown to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[266][267] His 300-yard performance was the first allowed by the Vikings' defense all season.[266] He also set Packer regular season records for most 4,000-yard passing seasons (6), most completions in a season (374), and—with Jordy Nelson—most touchdowns by a quarterback/wide receiver combination with (59).[266] Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.[268] Rodgers helped lead the Packers to a NFC North title and a playoff berth in 2016.[269] The Packers defeated the Giants in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers completed 25 of 40 passes for 364 yards and four touchdowns in the victory. They defeated the #1-seed Cowboys in the Divisional Round. With the game tied at 31 with only 18 seconds remaining with the ball on their own 32-yard line, Rodgers threw a 36-yard completion to tight end Jared Cook to put the Packers in Mason Crosby's field goal range. Crosby converted the 51-yard attempt as time expired to win the game.[270] Overall, Rodgers completed 28 of 43 passes for 355 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in the victory.[271][272] The Packers lost to the Falcons in the NFC Championship in the final game at the Georgia Dome. Rodgers completed 27 of his 45 passing attempts for 287 yards with three touchdowns and an interception in the losing effort.[273] In 2016, Rodgers finished with 401 completions and 610 attempts (both career highs), a 65.7% completion percentage, 4,428 passing yards, 40 touchdown passes, seven interceptions, a passer rating of 104.2, 369 rushing yards (career-high), and four rushing touchdowns.[274] With his 40 touchdown passes, he led the league in the statistic for the first time in his career[275] and became one of only four quarterbacks to pass for at least 40 touchdowns in multiple seasons.[276] Rodgers also finished fourth in passing yards, completions, attempts, and passer rating.[277] Among quarterbacks, he finished third in rushing yards and fifth in rushing touchdowns.[278] He was ranked sixth by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[279] In a Week 1 victory over the Seahawks, Rodgers had his 50th career game with at least 300 passing yards. He finished the game with 311, but his streak of 251 consecutive passes without an interception came to an end when defensive tackle Nazair Jones picked him off in the first quarter.[280] In the next game, a 34–23 loss to the Falcons in Week 2, he had 343 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the first game in the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.[281] In Week 5, down by 28–31 against the Cowboys with less than two minutes on the clock, Rodgers led a nine-play, 75-yard touchdown drive in the 35–31 victory, earning him NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[282] During Week 6 against the Vikings, Rodgers was taken off the field by his coaches and medical personnel after suffering a shoulder injury on a hit from Anthony Barr. Shortly thereafter, it was revealed that Rodgers suffered a fractured right collarbone.[283][284] The next day, on October 16, it was announced that Rodgers would have surgery on his broken collarbone.[285] On October 19, he underwent surgery on his collarbone, and was officially placed on injured reserve the next day.[286][287] A total of 13 screws were inserted to stabilize his collarbone.[288][289] Rodgers returned to practice on December 2, 2017, making him eligible to play in the upcoming Week 15 game.[290] On December 12, 2017, it was announced that Rodgers was medically cleared by doctors and was set to start the next game against the Panthers.[291] He was officially activated on December 16, 2017.[292] Rodgers returned during Week 15 against the Panthers, where he finished with 290 passing yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions as the Packers lost 24–31.[293] However, two days later, on December 19, Rodgers was placed back on injured reserve after the Packers were eliminated from playoff contention.[294][295][296] He was ranked No. 10 by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.[297] On August 29, 2018, Rodgers signed a four-year extension with the Packers worth $134 million featuring a $57.5 million signing bonus.[298][299] During Sunday Night Football against the Bears in Week 1, Rodgers left the game with a knee injury but returned in the third quarter. Down by 20 points, Rodgers finished with 286 passing yards and three touchdowns, leading the Packers rally to a 24–23 win.[300] Despite a nagging knee injury, Rodgers had at least 40 pass attempts in each of the next three games. In the last of these, he threw his first interception in 150 attempts.[301] In Week 5, Rodgers passed for 442 yards (the second-best of his career) and three touchdowns, but also two fumbles, in a 31–23 loss to the Lions.[302] In the following game, a 33–30 victory over the 49ers, he had 425 passing yards and two passing touchdowns.[303] Following the bye-week, despite a continuing knee injury,[304] Rodgers had his third consecutive week with a 100+ quarterback rating,[305] which included 286 yards passing, no interceptions, and a go-ahead 40-yard touchdown pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling in a 29–27 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.[306] In Week 14, against the Falcons, Rodgers set an NFL record by converting his 359th consecutive pass without an interception, breaking Tom Brady's previous record.[307] In Week 15, against the Chicago Bears, Rodgers threw for 274 yards and an interception in a 24–17 loss. Rodgers' record streak without an interception ended with 402 pass attempts after he was intercepted by free safety Eddie Jackson.[308] During Week 16 against the Jets, Rodgers finished with 442 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and two rushing touchdowns. Trailing at one point by 15 points, Rodgers and the Packers won 44–38 in overtime.[309] He matched his own feat of achieving at least 400 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and two rushing touchdowns in a single game. The only other time in NFL history that occurred was when Rodgers accomplished it in 2011 against the Denver Broncos.[310] On December 18, 2018, Rodgers was named to his seventh Pro Bowl.[311] He declined the appearance due to injury and was replaced by Russell Wilson.[312] In the regular season finale against the Detroit Lions, Rodgers suffered a concussion early in the game and would not return.[313] He was then sent to the hospital to test for concussion symptoms.[314] Because the Packers had already been eliminated from playoff contention, Rodgers answered questions about whether he should be playing, for fear of injury, by saying: \"That's just not the way I lead, and I'm super-competitive, and I want to be out there with the guys and I look forward to being out there.\"[314] Rodgers was later spotted at the Packers' facility after the game.[314] Rodgers finished the season with 372 completions, 597 attempts, 4,442 passing yards, 25 passing touchdowns, two interceptions and a passer rating of 97.6.[315] His touchdown to interception ratio of 25:2 (12.5) ranks third best all-time (min. 300 attempts).[316] In addition to setting the record for consecutive passes without an interception during the season, Rodgers set NFL records for interception percentage for a season, with only 0.335% of his passes being intercepted, and for the amount of thrown away passes.[317][318] He was ranked eighth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[319] Rodgers started the 2019 season with a new head coach in Matt LaFleur following the departure of Mike McCarthy.[320] The Packers offense relied less on Rodgers' trademark passes and more on heavy formations and play-action throws to take advantage of running back Aaron Jones.[321] Rodgers helped lead the Packers to a 3–0 start with victories over the Bears, Vikings, and Broncos.[322][323][324] In Week 4, against the Eagles on Thursday Night Football, he had 422 passing yards and two passing touchdowns, but also threw the game-ending interception as the Packers were handed their first loss of the season by a score of 34–27.[325] In Week 7, against the Raiders, Rodgers posted his first-ever game with a perfect passer rating of 158.3, the first quarterback in team history to do so.[326] He completed 25-of-31 passes for 429 yards and five touchdowns in the 42–24 victory.[327] He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[328] In Week 17, against the Lions, Rodgers helped lead the team to a 23–20 comeback win. As a result of the victory, the Packers secured a first round bye in the playoffs.[329] Rodgers finished the 2019 season with 4,002 passing yards, 26 passing touchdowns, and four interceptions.[330] In the Divisional Round of the playoffs against the Seahawks, Rodgers completed 16 passes on 27 attempts and threw for 243 yards and two touchdowns during the 28–23 win.[331] In the NFC Championship Game against the 49ers, Rodgers completed 31 passes on 39 attempts and threw for 326 yards and two touchdowns, but also threw two interceptions, including one to Richard Sherman in the final two minutes of the game as the Packers lost 37–20.[332] The loss marked Rodgers' third consecutive NFC Championship loss (a streak that would extend to four the following season).[333] He was ranked 16th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[334] Prior to a Week 5 bye, Rodgers helped lead the Packers to a four-game winning streak to start the 2020 season.[335] That winning streak would end in Week 6 against the Buccaneers, in which Rodgers threw for 160 yards and two interceptions, including a pick-six (the third of his professional career), during the 38–10 loss.[336] After a 3–2 stretch for the team, Rodgers threw for 211 yards and four touchdowns in a 41–25 victory over the Bears in Week 12. During the game, he became the 11th player in NFL history to eclipse 50,000 career passing yards, achieving the milestone on a 39-yard touchdown pass to tight end Robert Tonyan midway through the third quarter.[337] In Week 13 against the Eagles, Rodgers threw for 295 yards and three touchdowns during the 30–16 win. Rodgers' third touchdown pass of the game was to wide receiver Davante Adams and it was his 400th career touchdown pass.[338] Rodgers was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance in Week 13.[339] On December 21, 2020, he was selected for the 2021 Pro Bowl.[340] Rodgers was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Month for his performance in December after passing for 15 touchdowns and one interception in five victories for the Packers.[341] Overall, Rodgers finished the 2020 regular season with 4,299 passing yards, 48 passing touchdowns, and five interceptions. His passing touchdowns total set a new franchise record.[141] He had seven total games with four passing touchdowns.[342] He led the league in numerous statistical categories, including completion percentage, touchdown passes, and passer rating.[343] On January 8, 2021, he made the 2020 All-Pro Team first-team.[344] The Pro Football Writers of America named him the NFL MVP.[345] The Packers finished with a 13–3 record, won the NFC North, and earned a first-round bye for the NFC playoffs.[346] In the Divisional Round of the playoffs against the Rams, Rodgers threw for 296 yards and two touchdowns and also rushed for another touchdown during the 32–18 win.[347] In the NFC Championship against the Buccaneers, Rodgers threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns, but also threw an interception and was sacked five times while being constantly pressured during the 31–26 loss.[348][349][350] Rodgers fell to 1–4 in conference championship games, becoming the first quarterback in NFL history to lose four in a row.[348][350][351] After the season, he won the AP Most Valuable Player Award[352] as well as the FedEx Air Player of the Year.[353] He was ranked 3rd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.[354] Rodgers' 2021 season had a rough start, as he completed 15 of 28 passes for 133 yards and two interceptions as Green Bay lost 38–3 to the Saints at TIAA Bank Field.[355] He was pulled in the fourth quarter for Jordan Love as his chance of a comeback was all but eliminated.[356] However, Rodgers and the Packers recovered, going on a seven-game winning streak following the loss to New Orleans.[357] Following a positive test for COVID-19, Rodgers was placed on the COVID-19 reserve list on November 3.[358] He missed 10 days per the league's COVID-19 policies for unvaccinated players, including a game against the Chiefs.[359] Despite answering \"Yeah, I'm immunized\" when asked during the preseason if he had been vaccinated against COVID-19, he had not actually received a vaccination. Instead, he had received homeopathic treatment from his personal doctor. While unvaccinated, he committed multiple violations of NFL COVID-19 protocols for unvaccinated players, including attending parties with teammates while not using PPE and appearing unmasked at multiple postgame press conferences.[360][361][362][363][364] After a review, he was fined $14,650 for violations of the agreed protocols and his team was fined $300,000.[365][366] Rodgers was activated off the reserve/COVID-19 list on November 13, and returned to play the next day against the Seahawks, a game the Packers won 17–0.[367] In Week 15, Rodgers threw for 268 yards and three touchdowns in a 31–30 win over the Ravens, which clinched the NFC North title for the Packers for a third consecutive season and earned him NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[368] On December 23, 2021, Rodgers was named to his tenth Pro Bowl.[369] In a Week 16 victory over the Browns, Rodgers threw his 443rd career touchdown pass, passing Brett Favre for the most all-time career touchdown passes in Packers history.[370] For his play in the month of December, Rodgers earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month honors.[371] He finished the 2021 season with 4,115 passing yards, 37 touchdowns, and four interceptions.[372] On January 14, 2022, Rodgers earned his fourth career First-team All-Pro selection.[373] In the Divisional Round against the 49ers, Rodgers threw for 225 yards, but a poor performance by the special teams unit haunted the Packers, losing 13–10. It was Rodgers' fourth loss in as many games to the 49ers in the postseason and Rodgers' second home divisional loss.[59] After the season, Rodgers won the AP NFL Most Valuable Player Award for the second consecutive season and the fourth time overall.[374] Rodgers became the fifth player to win consecutive MVPs and first since Peyton Manning between 2008 and 2009.[375] Rodgers joined Manning as the only players in NFL history to win at least four MVPs.[376] He was ranked third by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[377] On March 8, Rodgers confirmed that he would return and play for the Packers for the 2022 season after speculations that Rodgers could retire or demand a trade to another team.[378] There were reports that Rodgers and the Packers had agreed to terms on a 4-year, $200 million contract extension that would have made him the highest-paid player in NFL history, but Rodgers denied those reports on Twitter, stating that the numbers on the proposed contract were inaccurate, and that he had yet to sign such a contract. He did confirm, however, that he would return to play his 18th NFL season with the Packers.[379][380] On March 16, he officially signed his contract extension. The final terms of the contract was a 3-year contract (which replaced the final year of his existing contract) worth $150.8 million, with $101.5 million guaranteed. The new contract made him the highest paid player in North American sports history on an annual basis, surpassing the NBA's Damian Lillard's $49 million per annum contract.[381] In the season opener against the Vikings, Rodgers threw for 195 yards and an interception in the 23–7 loss.[382][383] In Week 4 against the Patriots, Rodgers threw for 251 yards and two touchdowns, but also threw his fourth career pick-six to Jack Jones in the 27–24 overtime win.[384] In Week 5 at London, Rodgers threw for 222 yards and two touchdowns in an upset loss against the Giants.[385] In Week 8 against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday Night Football, Rodgers threw for 203 yards, two touchdowns and one interception as the Packers lost their fourth consecutive game in the 27–17 defeat.[386] The next week against the Lions, Rodgers threw for 291 yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions in the 15–9 loss. It was the first time since Week 15 of the 2017 season that Rodgers threw three interceptions in a game.[387] Rodgers bounced back the following week against the Cowboys, completing 14-of-20 passes for 224 yards and three touchdowns in 31–28 overtime victory.[388][389] Following a Week 11 loss to the Titans, Rodgers confirmed he has been playing with a broken thumb on his throwing hand he suffered in Week 5.[390][391] A Week 12 loss to the Eagles left the Packers with a 4–8 record, but the team rallied off four consecutive wins to get to 8–8 before the regular season finale.[392] The Packers finished with an 8–9 record and missed the postseason following a Week 18 loss to the Detroit Lions in a win-and-in scenario for Green Bay.[393][394] Rodgers finished the 2022 season with 3,695 passing yards, 26 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, which marked the most for Rodgers in a single season since 2008.[395][396] He was ranked 51st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[397] On April 26, 2023, Rodgers was traded to the Jets, along with the Packers' first and fifth-round selections in the 2023 NFL draft, in exchange for the Jets' first, second (via Cleveland) and sixth-round selections in the 2023 draft and a conditional second-round selection (which would have converted to a first if Rodgers played 65% of the offensive snaps in 2023, but it did not happen) in the 2024 NFL draft.[398] The move echoed the career path of his predecessor Brett Favre, who similarly spent over fifteen years as quarterback of the Packers before being traded to the Jets.[399] Although Joe Namath granted Rodgers permission to wear his retired No. 12 jersey, Rodgers announced that he would return to wearing the No. 8 jersey, which he had worn throughout his college career with the California Golden Bears.[400] On July 26, 2023, Rodgers took a pay cut and agreed to a reworked contract with the Jets.[401] Making his Jets debut in Week 1 on Monday Night Football against the Bills at MetLife Stadium, Rodgers injured his left ankle on just his fourth offensive snap after being sacked by Bills' defensive end Leonard Floyd. Rodgers was helped off the field and later carted to the locker room for further evaluation.[402] Rodgers' backup Zach Wilson went on to lead the Jets to a 22–16 win in overtime.[403] The next day, Rodgers was diagnosed with an Achilles tendon rupture and was later placed on injured reserve.[404][405] Rodgers underwent surgery on September 13, with Dr. Neal ElAttrache placing an internal brace in his left Achilles with the goal of a mid-January return at the earliest.[406] On November 29, the New York Jets opened the 21-day practice window for Rodgers. Limited in practice, Rodgers was cleared for functional activity but not contact.[407] He was activated off injured reserve on December 20, but the Jets announced he would not play again this season after their Week 15 loss to the Dolphins mathematically eliminated them from playoff contention.[408][409] After playing just four offensive snaps in his first season with the Jets due to an Achilles injury, Rodgers made his return on Monday Night Football in Week 1 to kick off the 2024 campaign. In his highly anticipated return, Rodgers completed 13 of 21 passes for 167 yards, one touchdown and one interception in a 32–19 loss to the defending NFC champion San Francisco 49ers.[410] In the Jets' home opener against the New England Patriots, Rodgers completed 27 of 35 passes for 281 yards and two touchdowns as the Jets cruised to a 24–3 victory.[411] In Week 5 in London, Rodgers became the ninth quarterback in NFL history to reach 60,000 passing yards but tied his career-high with three interceptions, including a game-sealing pick with under a minute left as the Jets lost 23–17 to the Vikings.[412] Jets head coach Robert Saleh was unexpectedly fired after the London loss, with some analysts perceiving that he did not get along with Rodgers.[413] When asked about it on The Pat McAfee Show, the quarterback firmly denied accusations that he had a role in Saleh's termination.[414] In Week 6, the Jets' first game after Saleh’s termination, Rodgers threw for 294 yards and two touchdowns, including a 52-yard Hail Mary pass to Allen Lazard to close out the first half, his fourth career such pass completion.[415] However, another interception on the Jets' final drive doomed them as they lost 23–20 to the Buffalo Bills.[416] Following the loss, the Jets traded for Davante Adams, with whom Rodgers had previously combined for over 600 receptions and 68 touchdowns during their eight seasons together in Green Bay.[417] However, the Jets continued to struggle, as Rodgers threw two interceptions and led the offense to zero points in the second half of their Week 7 matchup against the Steelers, losing their fourth consecutive game.[418] After a loss to the Patriots, Rodgers helped the Jets snap their five-game losing streak in Week 9 against the Houston Texans, throwing for 179 yards and three touchdowns in the second half after being shutout in the first half as the Jets won 21–13.[419] In Week 11 against the Colts, Rodgers threw two touchdowns and led the Jets to a season-high in points, but they fell short in a 28–27 loss, dropping to 3–7.[420] During their bye week, it was revealed that Rodgers had been playing through hamstring, knee, and ankle injuries but had refused to get scans done in fear of how severe they would be.[421] Despite this, he remained the starter following the bye week.[422] Entering Week 14, Rodgers held an NFL-record 34-game drought without a 300-yard passing performance, which he broke on December 8 against the Dolphins.[423] Despite recording his first 300-yard game in three years, the Jets fell 32–26 in overtime, eliminating them from playoff contention.[424] Since becoming a starter in 2008, Rodgers has become known for his unique touchdown celebration, which he and his teammates have dubbed the \"Championship Belt.\" After a scoring play, Rodgers celebrates by making a motion as if he is putting an invisible championship belt on around his waist.[425][426] Teammate Greg Jennings said of the celebration: \"It's just something fun that he does. We get excited when we see it cause we know that he's made a play or we've made a play as offense.\"[427] The gesture drew the praise of WWE wrestler Triple H and has become common for Green Bay fans to mimic during games.[428] He has also celebrated by doing the shoryuken, a jumping uppercut move from the Street Fighter series.[429] Rodgers has been vocal about his use of alternative medicine,[464][465] and is a proponent of the legalization of psychedelic drugs.[466] He revealed in 2022 that he had previously made offseason trips to Peru, where he consumed ayahuasca.[467] Rodgers is one of the most prominent American athletes to choose not to get vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus,[468] and was critical of the NFL's health and safety protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic.[469] His stances on the COVID-19 vaccine were criticized by scientists, health officials, and some former players and commentators, due to concerns that Rodgers was spreading vaccine misinformation and potentially was risking the health of his teammates.[470] During the NFL season, Rodgers frequently appears on The Pat McAfee Show.[471] One such interview in 2021 made headlines after Rodgers made several false and misleading statements about COVID-19,[472][473] implying that unvaccinated people were not the group most affected by the pandemic and that ivermectin was beneficial for people with COVID-19.[468][474][475][476] These and similar claims led some reporters to describe Rodgers as a conspiracy theorist.[472][477] Rodgers has voiced support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his presidential campaign of 2024.[478] Kennedy reportedly included Rodgers on his \"short list\" of possible vice presidential running mates, along with others, including Jesse Ventura and Nicole Shanahan.[479][480] On Adam Breneman's podcast in 2022, former Packers backup quarterback DeShone Kizer said that Rodgers had expressed interest in 9/11 conspiracy theories at one of the first meetings between the two quarterbacks. Kizer described their discussion of conspiracy theories as \"a real thought experiment\".[481][482] Rodgers has also promoted the Tartarian architecture conspiracy theory.[483] In a January 2024 appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, Rodgers, without evidence, implied that comedian Jimmy Kimmel was an acquaintance of disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and that Kimmel's name would possibly appear in soon to be released court documents listing Epstein's associates.[484] Kimmel denied the allegations and threatened to sue Rodgers for defamation if he repeated the claim.[485] In a follow-up appearance on McAfee's show the following week, Rodgers stated: \"I'm glad that Jimmy is not on the list. I really am. I don't think he's the P-word [pedophile].\"[486] During a February 2024 appearance on the conspiracy-focused Look Into It podcast hosted by Eddie Bravo, Rodgers espoused numerous conspiracy theories on medicine, immigration, and John F. Kennedy.[487] His claims included that AIDS and COVID were created by the government for the sake of pharmaceutical industry profits (see also discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories and Operation Denver).[488] In 2024, CNN reporter Pamela Brown reported that Rodgers had in 2013 shared false conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook massacre, claiming that the attack was an \"inside job\" perpetrated by the government. CNN simultaneously reported an allegation by an anonymous source that Rodgers had several years prior said \"Sandy Hook never happened....All those children never existed. They were all actors.\"[489] In response, Rodgers said, \"I am not and have never been of the opinion that the events did not take place\" but did not say whether he had ever believed the Sandy Hook massacre was an \"inside job.\"[478] Rodgers has two brothers; the younger, Jordan, played quarterback at Vanderbilt University and had a brief NFL career with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[490][491][492] Although Rodgers and his brothers were raised Christian, in an interview in 2017 he stated that he no longer affiliated himself with any organized religion.[493] Rodgers is the godfather to Cade Cobb, the second son of his long-time NFL teammate, Randall Cobb.[494] Rodgers was in a relationship with actress Olivia Munn from 2014 to 2017 and with former professional racing driver Danica Patrick from 2018 to 2020.[495][496][497] He started dating actress Shailene Woodley in the second half of 2020.[498] In an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2021, Woodley confirmed that she was engaged to Rodgers.[499] On February 16, 2022, Rodgers and Woodley called off their engagement.[500] Rodgers was initiated as an honorary member of Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) on January 5, 2012, at the Sigma-Xi Chapter at St. Norbert College.[501] In April 2018, Rodgers was announced as a limited partner in the Milwaukee Bucks ownership group, making him the first active NFL player with an ownership stake in an NBA franchise.[502] Rodgers was a longtime spokesperson for State Farm Insurance and was frequently featured in their commercials. In the commercials, Rodgers often highlights his \"Championship Belt\" touchdown celebration, which State Farm renamed as the \"Discount Double Check\".[503] Rodgers has also been featured in Pizza Hut advertisements,[504] as well as numerous local Wisconsin-based advertisements.[505] In May 2015, Rodgers appeared as a contestant on Celebrity Jeopardy!; he defeated Shark Tank investor Kevin O'Leary and astronaut and future United States Senator Mark Kelly, winning $50,000 for his charity. In April 2021, Rodgers had a two-week stint as guest host on Jeopardy! from April 5–16.[506][507] Rodgers has also made numerous cameo appearances on television, including in a 2013 episode of The Office, a 2019 episode of Game of Thrones, and a 2015 episode of the sketch comedy television series Key & Peele.[508][509][510] He also taped a cameo as Jeopardy! host for an episode of The Conners.[511] In 2021, Rodgers took part in The Match IV, which was the fourth installment in the exhibition match play golf series. He was paired with professional golfer Bryson DeChambeau. The team went up against Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady.[512] DeChambeau and Rodgers won the match 3 and 2.[513] Rodgers also took part in the sixth edition of The Match, where he teamed up with Brady against fellow quarterbacks Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes.[514] Rodgers and Brady defeated Mahomes and Allen 1 up.[515] Rodgers is the founder, and the co-creator, along with David Gruber, of itsAaron,[516] a charity with a mission of \"creating awareness for organizations and people who are changing the world\".[517][518] He is also a supporter of the MACC Fund,[519][520] Raise Hope for Congo,[521] and other humanitarian and charitable efforts.[522][523] Rodgers' Celebrity Jeopardy! win earned $50,000 for the MACC Fund.[524][525] During his 2021 appearance as Jeopardy! guest host, the show made a charitable donation equal to the cumulative winnings of the contestants (including the runners-up) for those ten shows.[507] Rodgers is a supporter of his alma mater, University of California, Berkeley. He has donated funds to renovate the athletic facilities[526] and also established an endowed scholarship for transfer students at the school. In 2021, he was honored by the school for his charitable work.[527] In 2021, Rodgers donated $1 million to help small businesses in Chico and Butte County, California.[528] In 2024, Rodgers raised $3 million for charities with a flag football tournament.[529]",

However, the numbers could have been slightly better, considering he attempted 530 passes with only 62.8% of them completed. Addressing the team’s offensive struggles and other issues, Rodgers delivered a sharp warning, revealing that a “list” of players who might be on their way out of the franchise is already being discussed. After the Jets‘ 9-19 loss to the Rams, he said: “The last two weeks we can really see who’s on board moving forward and who is ready to get out.” Rodgers also highlighted the need for some teammates to reevaluate what it means to be a professional in the NFL: “You gotta figure out what it means to be a professional.” He suggested this introspection is essential for building the team’s culture and hinted that recent results over the last two weeks could lead to significant roster changes. The Jets have only one win in December, a 32-25 road victory over the Jaguars. They lost their other three games against the Seahawks, Dolphins, and Rams. Out of their four total wins in the 2024 season, two were at home against the Patriots and Texans. GLENDALE, ARIZONA – NOVEMBER 10: Aaron Rodgers #8 of the New York Jets throws a pass in the third quarter against the Arizona Cardinals at State Farm Stadium on November 10, 2024 in Glendale, Arizona. (Photo by Chris Coduto/Getty Images) Despite his tough message about players potentially being cut, Rodgers acknowledged that roster changes are a natural part of the NFL: “It’s part of the game. I’ve been on a couple of teams where it’s about that.” He hinted that the coming weeks will involve some pivotal discussions for the franchise. see also Aaron Rodgers' net worth: How much wealth does the New York Jets quarterback have? In terms of individual performances, running back Breece Hall has been the Jets’ top touchdown producer, with 5 touchdowns and 774 yards in 14 starts. Among the wide receivers, Garrett Wilson leads with 6 touchdowns and 987 yards, closely followed by Davante Adams, who also has 6 touchdowns and 719 yards.

                "title": "Aaron Rodgers admits he has lost friends and family over his controversial views | Marca",
                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/new-york-jets Jets' quarterback was accused of misleading the public about the COVID-19 vaccine Aaron Rodgers admits in his upcoming Netflix sports documentary that he has lost friends and family over his 'controversial' views after the New York Jets quarterback questioned the COVID-19 vaccine and hit out at cancel culture. The 41-year-old is in a very privileged position where he is wealthy enough that he never has to engage with, or think about, politics if he doesn't want to but that's simply not the path the Super Bowl champion has taken. He previously accused the 'woke cancel culture' of trying to stop him from expressing himself as well as later admitting he misled the public when he described himself as 'immunized' against COVID-19, before later contracting the disease in November 2021. Whilst the then-Green Bay Packer claimed the reaction to his lack of clarity about his vaccination status was an \"attempted takedown\" of his integrity and word, he revealed that some of his family and friends have distanced themselves from him. \"Losing friendships, family. It was heartbreaking,\" Rodgers says in a tailer for Aaron Rodgers: Enigma, also adding that he battled between his naturally introverted personality behind closed doors, and his extroverted persona for fans. He has lost connection to his parents and his two brothers for around a decade, although this is thought to be related to non-Christian values, such as sex before marriage, rather than his policy towards viruses and 'cancel culture'. Between Rodgers' confession about his personal life and his ex-fiancee's comments about their relationship, it's not been a great week as far as his public persona goes. Shailene Woodley and the quarterback got engaged in 2021, just days after going public together, but they never made it to the wedding ceremony as they broke up in 2022. The 33-year-old previously hinted that emotional unavailability was the source of the split, but now she's seemed to go one step further by hinting that the damage from their relationship still hurts her to this day and even left her depressed. \"I haven't shared much about my relationship with Aaron because it always makes me cry,\" Woodley told outside magazine. \"It was not right. But it was beautiful. \"I had a really awful, traumatic thing happen in early 2022. I felt like I lost my soul, myself, my happiness, my joy. \"Empathy kind of kept me in this loop of feeling everything for everyone. I knew I was depressed when I looked at a tree and felt nothing.\" © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "content": "Hanukkah[a] (/ˈhænəkə/, /ˈhɑːnəkə/; חֲנֻכָּה‎ Ḥănukkā listenⓘ) is a Jewish festival commemorating the recovery of Jerusalem and subsequent rededication of the Second Temple at the beginning of the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BCE.[3][4] Hanukkah is observed for eight nights and days,[5] starting on the 25th day of Kislev according to the Hebrew calendar, which may occur at any time from November 28 to December 27 in the Gregorian calendar. The festival is observed by lighting the candles of a candelabrum with nine branches, commonly called a menorah or hanukkiah. One branch is placed above or below the others and its candle is used to light the other eight candles. This unique candle is called the shammash (שַׁמָּשׁ‎, \"attendant\"). Each night, one additional candle is lit by the shammash until all eight candles are lit together on the final night of the festival.[6] Other Hanukkah festivities include singing Hanukkah songs, playing the game of dreidel and eating oil-based foods, such as latkes and sufganiyot (similar to jelly donuts), and dairy foods. Since the 1970s, the worldwide Chabad Hasidic movement has initiated public menorah lightings in open public places in many countries.[7] Originally instituted as a feast \"in the manner of Sukkot (Booths)\", it does not come with the corresponding obligations, and is therefore a relatively minor holiday in strictly religious terms. Nevertheless, Hanukkah has attained major cultural significance in North America and elsewhere, especially among secular Jews, due to often occurring around the same time as Christmas during the festive season.[8] The name \"Hanukkah\" derives from the Hebrew verb \"חנך‎\", meaning \"to dedicate\". On Hanukkah, the Maccabean Jews regained control of Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple.[9][10] Many homiletical explanations have been given for the name:[11] In Hebrew, the word Hanukkah is written חֲנֻכָּה‎ or חֲנוּכָּה‎ (Ḥănukā). It is most commonly transliterated to English as Hanukkah or Chanukah. The spelling Hanukkah, which is based on using characters of the English alphabet as symbols to re-create the word's correct spelling in Hebrew,[14] is the most common[15] and the preferred choice of Merriam–Webster,[16] Collins English Dictionary, the Oxford Style Manual, and the style guides of The New York Times and The Guardian.[17] The sound represented by Ch ([χ], similar to the Scottish pronunciation of loch) is not native to the English language.[18] Furthermore, the letter ḥeth (ח‎), which is the first letter in the Hebrew spelling, is pronounced differently in modern Hebrew (voiceless uvular fricative) from in classical Hebrew (voiceless pharyngeal fricative [ħ]), and neither of those sounds is unambiguously representable in English spelling. However, its original sound is closer to the English H than to the Scottish Ch, and Hanukkah more accurately represents the spelling in the Hebrew alphabet.[14] Moreover, the 'kaf' consonant is geminate in classical (but not modern) Hebrew. Adapting the classical Hebrew pronunciation with the geminate and pharyngeal Ḥeth can lead to the spelling Hanukkah, while adapting the modern Hebrew pronunciation with no gemination and uvular Ḥeth leads to the spelling Chanukah.[19][20][21] In Modern Hebrew, Hanukkah may also be called the Festival of Lights (חַג הַאוּרִים‎, Ḥag HaUrim), based on a comment by Josephus in Antiquities of the Jews, καὶ ἐξ ἐκείνου μέχρι τοῦ δεῦρο τὴν ἑορτὴν ἄγομεν καλοῦντες αὐτὴν φῶτα \"And from then on we celebrate this festival, and we call it Lights\". The first Hebrew translation of Antiquities (1864) used (חַג הַמְּאֹרוֹת‎) \"Festival of Lamps\", but the translation \"Festival of Lights\" (חַג הַאוּרִים‎) appeared by the end of the nineteenth century.[22] The story of Hanukkah is told in the books of the First and Second Maccabees, which describe in detail the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the menorah. These books, however, are not a part of the canonized Masoretic Text version of the Tanakh (Hebrew and Aramaic language Jewish Bible) used and accepted by normative Rabbinical Judaism and therefore modern Jews (as copied, edited and distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th centuries of the Common Era). However, the books of Maccabees were included among the deuterocanonical books added to the Septuagint, a Jewish scholarly Greek-language translation of the Hebrew Bible originally compiled in the mid-3rd century BCE. The Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider the books of Maccabees as a canonical part of the Old Testament.[23] The eight-day rededication of the temple is described in 1 Maccabees,[24] though the miracle of the oil does not appear here. A story similar in character, and older in date, is the one alluded to in 2 Maccabees[25] according to which the relighting of the altar fire by Nehemiah was due to a miracle which occurred on the 25th of Kislev, and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by Judah Maccabee.[26] The above account in 1 Maccabees, as well as 2 Maccabees[27] portrays the feast as a delayed observation of the eight-day Feast of Booths (Sukkot); similarly 2 Maccabees explains the length of the feast as \"in the manner of the Feast of Booths\".[28] Megillat Taanit (1st century) contains a list of festive days on which fasting or eulogizing is forbidden. It specifies, \"On the 25th of [Kislev] is Hanukkah of eight days, and one is not to eulogize\" and then references the story of the rededication of the Temple.[29] The Mishna (late 2nd century) mentions Hanukkah in several places,[30] but never describes its laws in detail and never mentions any aspect of the history behind it. To explain the Mishna's lack of a systematic discussion of Hanukkah, Nissim ben Jacob postulated that information on the holiday was so commonplace that the Mishna felt no need to explain it.[31] Modern scholar Reuvein Margolies suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the Bar Kochba revolt, its editors were reluctant to include explicit discussion of a holiday celebrating another relatively recent revolt against a foreign ruler, for fear of antagonizing the Romans.[32] The miracle of the one-day supply of oil miraculously lasting eight days is described in the Talmud, committed to writing about 600 years after the events described in the books of Maccabees.[33] The Talmud says that after the forces of Antiochus IV had been driven from the Temple, the Maccabees discovered that almost all of the ritual olive oil had been profaned. They found only a single container that was still sealed by the High Priest, with enough oil to keep the menorah in the Temple lit for a single day. They used this, yet it burned for eight days (the time it took to have new oil pressed and made ready).[34] The Talmud presents three options:[35] Except in times of danger, the lights were to be placed outside one's door, on the opposite side of the mezuza, or in the window closest to the street. Rashi, in a note to Shabbat 21b, says their purpose is to publicize the miracle. The blessings for Hanukkah lights are discussed in tractate Succah, p. 46a.[36] Megillat Antiochus (probably composed in the 2nd century[37]) concludes with the following words: ...After this, the sons of Israel went up to the Temple and rebuilt its gates and purified the Temple from the dead bodies and from the defilement. And they sought after pure olive oil to light the lamps therewith, but could not find any, except one bowl that was sealed with the signet ring of the High Priest from the days of Samuel the prophet and they knew that it was pure. There was in it [enough oil] to light [the lamps therewith] for one day, but the God of heaven whose name dwells there put therein his blessing and they were able to light from it eight days. Therefore, the sons of Ḥashmonai made this covenant and took upon themselves a solemn vow, they and the sons of Israel, all of them, to publish amongst the sons of Israel, [to the end] that they might observe these eight days of joy and honour, as the days of the feasts written in [the book of] the Law; [even] to light in them so as to make known to those who come after them that their God wrought for them salvation from heaven. In them, it is not permitted to mourn, neither to decree a fast [on those days], and anyone who has a vow to perform, let him perform it.[38] The Al HaNissim prayer is recited on Hanukkah as an addition to the Amidah prayer, which was formalized in the late 1st century.[39] Al HaNissim describes the history of the holiday as follows: The Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus narrates in his book, Jewish Antiquities XII, how the victorious Judas Maccabeus ordered lavish yearly eight-day festivities after rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem that had been profaned by Antiochus IV Epiphanes.[40] Josephus does not say the festival was called Hanukkah but rather the \"Festival of Lights\": In the New Testament, John 10:22–23 says, \"Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon's Colonnade\" (NIV). The Greek noun used appears in the neuter plural as \"the renewals\" or \"the consecrations\" (Ancient Greek: τὰ ἐγκαίνια; ta enkaínia).[42] The same root appears in 2 Esdras 6:16 in the Septuagint to refer specifically to Hanukkah. This Greek word was chosen because the Hebrew word for 'consecration' or 'dedication' is Hanukkah (חנכה). The Aramaic New Testament uses the Aramaic word hawdata (a close synonym), which literally means 'renewal' or 'to make new'.[43] After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, Judea became part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt until 200 BCE, when King Antiochus III the Great of Syria defeated King Ptolemy V Epiphanes of Egypt at the Battle of Panium. Judea then became part of the Seleucid Empire of Syria.[44] King Antiochus III the Great, wanting to conciliate his new Jewish subjects, guaranteed their right to \"live according to their ancestral customs\" and to continue to practice their religion in the Temple of Jerusalem.[45] The Seleucids, like the Ptolemies before them, held a suzerainty over Judea, where they respected Jewish culture and protected Jewish institutions. This policy was drastically reversed by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus III, seemingly after what was either a dispute over leadership of the Temple in Jerusalem and the office of High Priest, or possibly a revolt whose nature was lost to time after being crushed.[46] In 175 BCE, Antiochus IV invaded Judea at the request of the sons of Tobias.[47] The Tobiads, who led the Hellenizing Jewish faction in Jerusalem, were expelled to Syria around 170 BCE when the high priest Onias and his pro-Egyptian faction wrested control from them. The exiled Tobiads lobbied Antiochus IV Epiphanes to recapture Jerusalem. As Flavius Josephus relates: The king being thereto disposed beforehand, complied with them, and came upon the Jews with a great army, and took their city by force, and slew a great multitude of those that favored Ptolemy, and sent out his soldiers to plunder them without mercy. He also spoiled the temple, and put a stop to the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice of expiation for three years and six months. When the Second Temple in Jerusalem was looted and services stopped, Judaism was outlawed. In 167 BCE, Antiochus ordered an altar to Zeus erected in the Temple. He banned brit milah (circumcision) and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple.[49] Antiochus's actions provoked a large-scale revolt. Mattathias (Mattityahu), a Jewish priest, and his five sons Jochanan, Simeon, Eleazar, Jonathan, and Judah led a rebellion against Antiochus. It started with Mattathias killing first a Jew who wanted to comply with Antiochus's order to sacrifice to Zeus, and then a Greek official who was to enforce the government's behest (1 Mac. 2, 24–25[50]). Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi (\"Judah the Hammer\"). By 166 BCE, Mattathias had died, and Judah took his place as leader. By 164 BCE, the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy was successful. The Temple was liberated and rededicated. The festival of Hanukkah was instituted to celebrate this event.[51] Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar to be built in place of the polluted one and new holy vessels to be made.[26] According to the Talmud, \"For when the Greeks entered the Sanctuary, they defiled all the oils therein, and when the Hasmonean dynasty prevailed against and defeated them, they made search and found only one cruse of oil which lay with the seal of the kohen gadol (high priest), but which contained sufficient [oil] for one day's lighting only; yet a miracle was wrought therein, and they lit [the lamp] therewith for eight days. The following year these [days] were appointed a Festival with [the recital of] Hallel and thanksgiving.\" —Shabbat 21b Tertiary sources in the Jewish tradition make reference to this account.[52] Maimonides (12th century) described Hanukkah as follows: When, on the twenty-fifth of Kislev, the Jews had emerged victorious over their foes and destroyed them, they re-entered the Temple where they found only one jar of pure oil, enough to be lit for only a single day; yet they used it for lighting the required set of lamps for eight days, until they managed to press olives and produce pure oil. Because of this, the sages of that generation ruled that the eight days beginning with the twenty-fifth of Kislev should be observed as days of rejoicing and praising the Lord. Lamps are lit in the evening over the doors of the homes, on each of the eight nights, so as to display the miracle. These days are called Hanukkah, when it is forbidden to lament or to fast, just as it is on the days of Purim. Lighting the lamps during the eight days of Hanukkah is a religious duty imposed by the sages.[53] Some modern scholars, following the account in 2 Maccabees, observe that the king was intervening in an internal civil war between the Maccabean Jews and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.[54][55][56][57] These competed violently over who would be the High Priest, with traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like Onias contesting with Hellenizing High Priests with Greek names like Jason and Menelaus.[58] In particular, Jason's Hellenistic reforms would prove to be a decisive factor leading to eventual conflict within the ranks of Judaism.[59] Other authors point to possible socioeconomic reasons in addition to the religious reasons behind the civil war.[60] What began in many respects as a civil war escalated when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the Hellenizing Jews in their conflict with the traditionalists.[61] As the conflict escalated, Antiochus took the side of the Hellenizers by prohibiting the religious practices the traditionalists had rallied around. This may explain why the king, in a total departure from Seleucid practice in all other places and times, banned a traditional religion.[62] The miracle of the oil is widely regarded as a legend and its authenticity has been questioned since the Middle Ages.[63] However, given the famous question Joseph Karo (1488–1575) posed concerning why Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days when the miracle was only for seven days (since there was enough oil for one day),[64] it was clear that writing in the 16th century CE, he believed it to be a historical event. This belief has been adopted by most of Orthodox Judaism, in as much as Karo's Shulchan Aruch is a main code of Jewish Law. Selected battles between the Maccabees and the Seleucid Syrian-Greeks: Hanukkah is celebrated with a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the eight-day holiday, some are family-based and others communal. There are special additions to the daily prayer service, and a section is added to the blessing after meals.[79] Hanukkah is not a \"Sabbath-like\" holiday, and there is no obligation to refrain from activities that are forbidden on the Sabbath, as specified in the Shulkhan Arukh.[80][81] Adherents go to work as usual but may leave early in order to be home to kindle the lights at nightfall. There is no religious reason for schools to be closed, although in Israel schools close from the second day for the whole week of Hanukkah.[82][83] Many families exchange gifts each night, such as books or games, and \"Hanukkah Gelt\" is often given to children. Fried foods—such as latkes (potato pancakes), jelly doughnuts (sufganiyot) and Sephardic bimuelos—are eaten to commemorate the importance of oil during the celebration of Hanukkah. Some also have a custom of eating dairy products to remember Judith and how she overcame Holofernes by feeding him cheese, which made him thirsty, and giving him wine to drink. When Holofernes became very drunk, Judith cut off his head.[84] Each night throughout the eight-day holiday, a candle or oil-based light is lit. As a universally practiced \"beautification\" (hiddur mitzvah) of the mitzvah, the number of lights lit is increased by one each night.[85] An extra light called a shammash, meaning \"attendant\" or \"sexton\",[86] is also lit each night, and is given a distinct location, usually higher, lower, or to the side of the others.[81] Among Ashkenazim the tendency is for every male member of the household (and in many families, girls as well) to light a full set of lights each night,[87][88] while among Sephardim the prevalent custom is to have one set of lights for the entire household.[89] The purpose of the shammash is to adhere to the prohibition, specified in the Talmud,[90] against using the Hanukkah lights for anything other than publicizing and meditating on the Hanukkah miracle. This differs from Sabbath candles which are meant to be used for illumination and lighting. Hence, if one were to need extra illumination on Hanukkah, the shammash candle would be available, and one would avoid using the prohibited lights. Some, especially Ashkenazim, light the shammash candle first and then use it to light the others.[91] So altogether, including the shammash, two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on, ending with nine on the last night, for a total of 44 (36, excluding the shammash). It is Sephardic custom not to light the shammash first and use it to light the rest. Instead, the shammash candle is the last to be lit, and a different candle or a match is used to light all the candles. Some Hasidic Jews follow this Sephardic custom as well.[92] The lights can be candles or oil lamps.[91] Electric lights are sometimes used and are acceptable in places where open flame is not permitted, such as a hospital room, or for the very elderly and infirm; however, those who permit reciting a blessing over electric lamps only allow it if it is incandescent and battery operated (an incandescent flashlight would be acceptable for this purpose), while a blessing may not be recited over a plug-in menorah or lamp. Most Jewish homes have a special candelabrum referred to as either a Hanukkah menorah (the traditional name, menorah being Hebrew for 'lamp') or a Chanukiah (the modern Israeli term). Some families use an oil lamp menorah (traditionally filled with olive oil) for Hanukkah; like the candle version, it has eight wicks to light plus the additional shammash light.[93] In the United States, Hanukkah became a more visible festival in the public sphere from the 1970s when Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson called for public awareness and observance of the festival and encouraged the lighting of public menorahs.[94][95][96][97] The reason for the Hanukkah lights is not for the \"lighting of the house within\", but rather for the \"illumination of the house without\", so that passersby should see it and be reminded of the holiday's miracle (i.e. that the sole cruse of pure oil found which held enough oil to burn for one night actually burned for eight nights). Accordingly, lamps are set up at a prominent window or near the door leading to the street. It is customary amongst some Ashkenazi Jews to have a separate menorah for each family member (customs vary), whereas most Sephardi Jews light one for the whole household. Only when there was danger of antisemitic persecution were lamps supposed to be hidden from public view, as was the case in Persia under the rule of the Zoroastrians,[26] or in parts of Europe before and during World War II. However, most Hasidic groups light lamps near an inside doorway, not necessarily in public view. According to this tradition, the lamps are placed on the opposite side from the mezuzah, so people passing through the door are surrounded by the holiness of mitzvot (the commandments).[98] Generally, women are exempt in Jewish law from time-bound positive commandments, although the Talmud requires that women engage in the mitzvah of lighting Hanukkah candles \"for they too were involved in the miracle.\"[99][100] Some Jews in North America and Israel have taken up environmental concerns in relation to Hanukkah's \"miracle of the oil\", emphasizing reflection on energy conservation and energy independence. An example of this is the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life's renewable energy campaign.[101][102][103] Hanukkah lights should usually burn for at least half an hour after it gets dark.[104] Many light at sundown, while most Hasidim and many other communities light later, generally around nightfall.[105] Many Hasidic Rebbes light much later to fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their Hasidim when they kindle the lights.[106] Inexpensive small wax candles sold for Hanukkah burn for approximately half an hour so should be lit no earlier than nightfall.[104] Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not be lit on Shabbat itself, the candles must be lit before sunset.[104] However, they must remain lit through the lighting of the Shabbat candles. Therefore, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first with larger candles than usual,[104] followed by the Shabbat candles. At the end of the Shabbat, there are those who light the Hanukkah lights before Havdalah and those who make Havdalah before the lighting Hanukkah lights.[107] If for whatever reason one didn't light at sunset or nightfall, the lights should be kindled later, as long as there are people in the streets.[104] Later than that, the lights should still be kindled, but the blessings should be recited only if there is at least somebody else awake in the house and present at the lighting of the Hannukah lights.[108] Typically two blessings (brachot; singular: brachah) are recited during this eight-day festival when lighting the candles. On the first night only, the shehecheyanu blessing is added, making a total of three blessings.[109] The first blessing is recited before the candles are lit, and while most recite the other blessing(s) beforehand as well, some have the custom to recite them after. On the first night of Hanukkah one light (candle or oil) is lit on the right side of the menorah, on the following night a second light is placed to the left of the first but it is lit first, and so on, proceeding from placing candles right to left but lighting them from left to right over the eight nights.[110] Transliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu l'hadlik ner Hanukkah. Translation: \"Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the Hanukkah light[s].\" Transliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, she'asa nisim la'avoteinu ba'yamim ha'heim ba'z'man ha'ze. Translation: \"Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who performed miracles for our ancestors in those days at this time...\" After the lights are kindled the hymn Hanerot Halalu is recited. There are several different versions; the version presented here is recited in many Ashkenazic communities:[112] In the Ashkenazi tradition, each night after the lighting of the candles, the hymn Ma'oz Tzur is sung. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in Jewish history, praising God for survival despite these tragedies (the exodus from Egypt, the Babylonian captivity, the miracle of the holiday of Purim, the Hasmonean victory) and expressing a longing for the days when Judea will finally triumph over Rome.[113] The song was composed in the thirteenth century by a poet only known through the acrostic found in the first letters of the original five stanzas of the song: Mordechai. The familiar tune is most probably a derivation of a German Protestant church hymn or a popular folk song.[114] After lighting the candles and Ma'oz Tzur, singing other Hanukkah songs is customary in many Jewish homes. Some Hasidic and Sephardi Jews recite Psalms, such as Psalm 30, Psalm 67, and Psalm 91. In North America and in Israel it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time. In addition, many families encourage their children to give tzedakah (charity) in lieu of presents for themselves.[115][116] \"We thank You also for the miraculous deeds and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and the saving acts wrought by You, as well as for the wars which You waged for our ancestors in ancient days at this season. In the days of the Hasmonean Mattathias, son of Johanan the high priest, and his sons, when the iniquitous Greco-Syrian kingdom rose up against Your people Israel, to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the ordinances of Your will, then You in your abundant mercy rose up for them in the time of their trouble, pled their cause, executed judgment, avenged their wrong, and delivered the strong into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent ones into the hands of those occupied with Your Torah. Both unto Yourself did you make a great and holy name in Thy world, and unto Your people did You achieve a great deliverance and redemption. Whereupon your children entered the sanctuary of Your house, cleansed Your temple, purified Your sanctuary, kindled lights in Your holy courts, and appointed these eight days of Hanukkah in order to give thanks and praises unto Your holy name.\" An addition is made to the \"hoda'ah\" (thanksgiving) benediction in the Amidah (thrice-daily prayers), called Al HaNissim (\"On/about the Miracles\").[118] This addition refers to the victory achieved over the Syrians by the Hasmonean Mattathias and his sons.[119][120][26] The same prayer is added to the grace after meals. In addition, the Hallel (praise) Psalms[121] are sung during each morning service and the Tachanun penitential prayers are omitted.[119][122] The Torah is read every day in the shacharit morning services in synagogue, on the first day beginning from Numbers 6:22 (according to some customs, Numbers 7:1), and the last day ending with Numbers 8:4. Since Hanukkah lasts eight days it includes at least one, and sometimes two, Jewish Sabbaths (Saturdays). The weekly Torah portion for the first Sabbath is almost always Miketz, telling of Joseph's dream and his enslavement in Egypt. The Haftarah reading for the first Sabbath Hanukkah is Zechariah 2:14 – Zechariah 4:7. When there is a second Sabbath on Hanukkah, the Haftarah reading is from 1 Kings 7:40–50. The Hanukkah menorah is also kindled daily in the synagogue, at night with the blessings and in the morning without the blessings.[123] The menorah is not lit during Shabbat, but rather prior to the beginning of Shabbat as described above and not at all during the day. During the Middle Ages \"Megillat Antiochus\" was read in the Italian synagogues on Hanukkah just as the Book of Esther is read on Purim. It still forms part of the liturgy of the Yemenite Jews.[124] The last day of Hanukkah is known by some as Zot Hanukkah and by others as Chanukat HaMizbeach, from the verse read on this day in the synagogue Numbers 7:84, Zot Hanukkat Hamizbe'ach: \"This was the dedication of the altar\". According to the teachings of Kabbalah and Hasidism, this day is the final \"seal\" of the High Holiday season of Yom Kippur and is considered a time to repent out of love for God. In this spirit, many Hasidic Jews wish each other Gmar chatimah tovah (\"may you be sealed totally for good\"), a traditional greeting for the Yom Kippur season. It is taught in Hasidic and Kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers.[125] It is customary for women not to work for at least the first half-hour of the candles' burning, and some have the custom not to work for the entire time of burning. It is also forbidden to fast or to eulogize during Hanukkah.[81] Some Hasidic scholars teach that the Hanukkah is in fact the final conclusion of God's judgment extending High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana when humanity is judged and Yom Kippur when the judgment is sealed: Hanukkah songs (in Hebrew except where indicated) include \"Ma'oz Tzur\" (Rock of Ages), \"Latke'le Latke'le\" (Yiddish: \"Little Latke, Little Latke\"), \"Hanukkiah Li Yesh\" (\"I Have a Hanukkah Menorah\"), \"Ocho Kandelikas\" (Judeo-Spanish: \"Eight Little Candles\"), \"Kad Katan\" (\"A Small Jug\"), \"S'vivon Sov Sov Sov\" (\"Dreidel, Spin and Spin\"), \"Haneirot Halolu\" (\"These Candles Which We Light\"), \"Mi Yimalel\" (\"Who Can Retell\") and \"Ner Li, Ner Li\" (\"I have a Candle\"). Among the best known songs in English-speaking countries are \"Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel\"[127] and \"Oh Chanukah\".[128] In the Nadvorna Hasidic dynasty, it is customary for the rebbes to play violin after the menorah is lit.[129] Penina Moise's Hannukah Hymn published in the 1842 Hymns Written for the Use of Hebrew Congregations was instrumental in the beginning of Americanization of Hanukkah.[130][131][132] There is a custom of eating foods fried or baked in oil (preferably olive oil) to commemorate the miracle of a small flask of oil keeping the Second Temple's Menorah alight for eight days.[133] Traditional foods include potato pancakes, known as latkes in Yiddish, especially among Ashkenazi families. Sephardi, Polish, and Israeli families eat jam-filled doughnuts (Yiddish: פּאָנטשקעס pontshkes), bimuelos (fritters) and sufganiyot which are deep-fried in oil. Italkim and Hungarian Jews traditionally eat cheese pancakes known as \"cassola\" or \"cheese latkes\".[134] Latkes are not popular in Israel, having been largely replaced by sufganiyot due to local economic factors, convenience and the influence of trade unions.[135] Bakeries in Israel have popularized many new types of fillings for sufganiyot besides the traditional strawberry jelly filling, including chocolate cream, vanilla cream, caramel, cappuccino and others.[136] In recent years, downsized, \"mini\" sufganiyot containing half the calories of the regular, 400-to-600-calorie version, have become popular.[137] Rabbinic literature also records a tradition of eating cheese and other dairy products during Hanukkah.[138] This custom, as mentioned above, commemorates the heroism of Judith during the Babylonian captivity of the Jews and reminds us that women also played an important role in the events of Hanukkah.[139] The deuterocanonical book of Judith (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the Tanakh, records that Holofernes, an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews was cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the beheading of Holofernes by Judith has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.[140] Roast goose has historically been a traditional Hanukkah food among Eastern European and American Jews, although the custom has declined in recent decades.[141] Indian Jews traditionally consume gulab jamun, fried dough balls soaked in a sweet syrup, similar to teiglach or bimuelos, as part of their Hanukkah celebrations. Italian Jews eat fried chicken, cassola (a ricotta cheese latke almost similar to a cheesecake), and fritelle de riso par Hanukkah (a fried sweet rice pancake). Romanian Jews eat pasta latkes as a traditional Hanukkah dish. Syrian Jews consume Kibbet Yatkeen, a dish made with pumpkin and bulgur wheat similar to latkes, as well as their own version of keftes de prasa spiced with allspice and cinnamon.[142] After lighting the candles, it is customary to play (or spin) the dreidel. The dreidel, or sevivon in Hebrew, is a four-sided spinning top that children play with during Hanukkah. Each side is imprinted with a Hebrew letter which is an abbreviation for the Hebrew words נס גדול היה שם (Nes Gadol Haya Sham, \"A great miracle happened there\"), referring to the miracle of the oil that took place in the Beit Hamikdash. The fourth side of some dreidels sold in Israel are inscribed with the letter פ (Pe), rendering the acronym נס גדול היה פה (Nes Gadol Haya Po, \"A great miracle happened here\"), referring to the fact that the miracle occurred in the land of Israel, although this is a relatively recent[when?] innovation. Stores in Haredi neighborhoods sell the traditional Shin dreidels as well, because they understand \"there\" to refer to the Temple and not the entire Land of Israel, and because the Hasidic Masters ascribe significance to the traditional letters.[143][144] Chanukkah gelt (Yiddish for \"Chanukkah money\"), known in Israel by the Hebrew translation Hebrew: דְּמֵי חֲנֻכָּה, romanized: dmei Hanukkah, is often distributed to children during the festival of Hanukkah. The giving of Hanukkah gelt also adds to the holiday excitement. The amount is usually in small coins, although grandparents or relatives may give larger sums. The tradition of giving Chanukah gelt dates back to a long-standing East European custom of children presenting their teachers with a small sum of money at this time of year as a token of gratitude. One minhag favors the fifth night of Hanukkah for giving Hanukkah gelt.[145] Unlike the other nights of Hanukkah, the fifth does not ever fall on the Shabbat, hence never conflicting with the Halachic injunction against handling money on the Shabbat.[146] The earliest Hanukkah link with the White House occurred in 1951 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion presented United States President Harry Truman with a Hanukkah menorah. In 1979 President Jimmy Carter took part in the first public Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony of the National Menorah held across the White House lawn. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush displayed a menorah in the White House. In 1993, President Bill Clinton invited a group of schoolchildren to the Oval Office for a small ceremony.[95] The United States Postal Service has released several Hanukkah-themed postage stamps. In 1996, the United States Postal Service (USPS) issued a 32 cent Hanukkah stamp as a joint issue with Israel.[147] In 2004, after eight years of reissuing the menorah design, the USPS issued a dreidel design for the Hanukkah stamp. The dreidel design was used through 2008. In 2009 a Hanukkah stamp was issued with a design featured a photograph of a menorah with nine lit candles.[148] In 2008, President George W. Bush held an official Hanukkah reception in the White House where he linked the occasion to the 1951 gift by using that menorah for the ceremony, with a grandson of Ben-Gurion and a grandson of Truman lighting the candles.[149] In December 2014, two Hanukkah celebrations were held at the White House. The White House commissioned a menorah made by students at the Max Rayne school in Israel and invited two of its students to join U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as they welcomed over 500 guests to the celebration. The students' school in Israel had been subjected to arson by extremists. President Obama said these \"students teach us an important lesson for this time in our history. The light of hope must outlast the fires of hate. That's what the Hanukkah story teaches us. It's what our young people can teach us – that one act of faith can make a miracle, that love is stronger than hate, that peace can triumph over conflict.\"[150] Rabbi Angela Warnick Buchdahl, in leading prayers at the ceremony commented on the how special the scene was, asking the President if he believed America's founding fathers could possibly have pictured that a female Asian-American rabbi would one day be at the White House leading Jewish prayers in front of the African-American president.[151] The dates of Hanukkah are determined by the Hebrew calendar. Hanukkah begins at the 25th day of Kislev and concludes on the second or third day of Tevet (Kislev can have 29 or 30 days). The Jewish day begins at sunset. Hanukkah dates for recent and upcoming: In 2013, on 28 November, the American holiday of Thanksgiving fell during Hanukkah for only the third time since Thanksgiving was declared a national holiday by President Abraham Lincoln. The last time was 1899, and due to the nature of the Gregorian and Jewish calendars being slightly out of sync with each other, it will not happen again in the foreseeable future.[152] This rare convergence prompted the creation of the neologism Thanksgivukkah.[153][154][155] Major Jewish holidays are those when all forms of work are forbidden, and that feature traditional holiday meals, kiddush, holiday candle-lighting, etc. Only biblical holidays fit these criteria, and Chanukah was instituted some two centuries after the Hebrew Bible was completed. Nevertheless, though Chanukah is of rabbinic origin, it is traditionally celebrated in a major and very public fashion. The requirement to position the menorah, or Chanukiah, at the door or window, symbolizes the desire to give the Chanukah miracle a high-profile.[156] Moreover, Hallel (a set of Psalms expressing praise that is recited on significant Jewish holidays) is recited on all eight days of Hanukkah, which signifies Hanukkah's importance on the Jewish calendar. While not considered the most significant holiday, the recitation of Hallel on Hanukkah highlights its importance in Jewish tradition.[157] Some Jewish historians suggest a different explanation for the rabbinic reluctance to laud the militarism.[clarification needed] First, the rabbis wrote after Hasmonean leaders had led Judea into Rome's grip and so may not have wanted to offer the family much praise. Second, they clearly wanted to promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to look toward the divine for protection. They likely feared inciting Jews to another revolt that might end in disaster, as the Bar Kochba revolt did.[158] \"Hanukkah is an ancient holiday, but a modest one. The holiday of the Hasmoneans is new, yet it is full of spiritual exaltation and national joy. What was Hanukkah forty years ago? 'Al ha-nissim' and Hallel; a short reading in the synagogue; lighting the tiny, slender wax candles or oil lights; at home, levivot [latkes-potato pancakes], cards for the older children, and sevivonim [dreidels-spinning tops] for the little ones. But what is Hanukkah today? The holiday of the Hasmoneans. A holiday of salvation. A great national holiday, celebrated in all the countries of the Diaspora with dances and speeches, melody and song, outings and parades, as if a new soul has been breathed into the ancient holiday, another spirit renewed within it. One thing is clear: if those tiny, modest candles had been extinguished in Diaspora times, if our grandparents had not preserved the traditions of Hanukkah in the synagogue and at home . .., the holiday of the Hasmoneans could never have been created. There would have been nothing to change, nothing to renew. The new soul of our times would not have found a body in which to envelop itself.\" The emergence of Jewish nationalism and the Zionist movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries had a profound impact on the celebration and reinterpretation of Jewish holidays. These developments resulted in increased emphasis on certain Jewish celebrations, of which Hanukkah and Tu BiShvat are prominent examples.[161] Hanukkah took on renewed meaning following the rise of Jewish nationalism as a nationalist holiday, symbolizing the struggle of the Jewish people against foreign oppression and their desire for national re-creation [162] (although the struggle of Jews against foreign oppression has always been a core componant of Hanukkah, as shown by the Al HaNissim, which has been part of Jewish liturgy since at least 700 CE).[163] Hanukkah served as a common ground where both religious and secular Zionists could unite around their nationalist agenda. Rabbi Shmuel Mohilever, an early religious Zionist, proposed making Hanukkah the official holiday of the proto-Zionist organization Hovevei Zion in Russia in 1881. Public celebrations of Hanukkah gained prominence in the early 20th century, with parades and public events becoming common. Schools in Mandate Palestine played an early role in promoting these celebrations.[164] With the advent of Zionism and the state of Israel, the themes of militarism were reconsidered. In modern Israel, the national and military aspects of Hanukkah became, once again, more dominant.[165][166] In North America, Hanukkah in the 21st century has taken a place equal to Passover as a symbol of Jewish identity. Both the Israeli and North American versions of Hanukkah emphasize resistance, focusing on some combination of national liberation and religious freedom as the defining meaning of the holiday.[167][8] Diane Ashton attributed the increased visibility and reinvention of Hanukkah by some of the American Jewish community as a way to adapt to American life, re-inventing the festival in \"the language of individualism and personal conscience derived from both Protestantism and the Enlightenment\".[130] In North America, Hanukkah became increasingly important to many Jewish individuals and families during the latter part of the 20th century, including a large number of secular Jews, who wanted to celebrate a Jewish alternative to the Christmas celebrations which frequently overlap with Hanukkah.[168][169] Diane Ashton argues that Jewish immigrants to America raised the profile of Hanukkah as a kid-centered alternative to Christmas as early as the 1800s.[170] This in parts mirrors the ascendancy of Christmas, which like Hanukkah increased in importance in the 1800s.[171] During this time period, Jewish leaders (especially Reform) such as Max Lilienthal and Isaac Mayer Wise made an effort to rebrand Hanukkah and started creating Hanukkah celebration for kids at their synagogues, which included candy and singing songs.[170][172] By the 1900s, it started to become a commercial holiday like Christmas, with Hanukkah gifts and decorations appearing in stores and Jewish Women's magazines printing articles on holiday decorations, children's celebrations, and gift giving.[170] Ashton says that Jewish families did this in order to maintain a Jewish identity which is distinct from mainline Christian culture, on the other hand, the mirroring of Hanukkah and Christmas made Jewish families and kids feel that they were American.[170] Though it was traditional for Ashkenazi Jews to give \"gelt\" or money to children during Hanukkah, in many families, this tradition has been supplemented with the giving of other gifts so that Jewish children can enjoy receiving gifts just like their Christmas-celebrating peers do.[173] Children play a big role in Hanukkah, and Jewish families with children are more likely to celebrate it than childless Jewish families, and sociologists hypothesize that this is because Jewish parents do not want their kids to be alienated from their non-Jewish peers who celebrate Christmas.[168] Recent celebrations have also seen the presence of the Hanukkah bush, which is considered a Jewish counterpart to the Christmas tree. Today, the presence of Hanukkah bushes is generally discouraged by most rabbis.[174] In December 2022, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Reverends Al Sharpton and Conrad Tillard, businessman Robert F. Smith, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, and Elisha Wiesel joined to celebrate Hanukkah and Kwanzaa together, and combat racism and antisemitism, at Carnegie Hall.[175][176][177][178]",

                "content": "The Jewish Festival of Lights is an eight-day celebration that commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple of Jerusalem. It is one of the most popular holidays in Judaism and is marked by the lighting of the menorah. For many English speakers, the festival is also known for confusion over the spelling of its name: Is it Hanukkah or Chanukah? The answer is that both are considered correct, though Hanukkah is the most widely used spelling, while Chanukah is more traditional. In addition, more than 20 other variations are recorded. Why so many spellings? Transliteration. Hebrew does not use the Latin alphabet, which is the standard script of many languages, including English. Thus, when used in an English context, the sounds of the different Hebrew characters must be converted, or transliterated, into Latin letters. However, the Hebrew word for the holiday uses sounds that aren’t found in the Latin alphabet. The difficulty begins with the very first letter of the word, which is the eighth letter of the Hebrew alphabet—ḥet, or chet. It is pronounced with a guttural sound that is similar to the /ch/ in loch. So, when the Hebrew word was transliterated in the 17th century, the ḥet became ch (Chanukah). However, when the English ch appears at the beginning of a word, it sounds quite different than the Hebrew ḥet (compare loch and chair). Thus, in the 18th century another spelling appeared—Hanukkah—even though the h doesn’t really sound like ḥet either. Transliteration issues also arose over the use of other letters—such as one or two k’s—resulting in many spelling variations.",

                "content": "The Tampa Bay Buccaneers (colloquially known as the Bucs) are a professional American football team based in Tampa, Florida. The Buccaneers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) South division. They joined the NFL in 1976 as an expansion team, along with the Seattle Seahawks, and played its first season in the American Football Conference (AFC) West division. Prior to the 1977 season, Tampa Bay switched conferences and divisions with Seattle, becoming a member of the NFC Central division. The Seahawks eventually rejoined the NFC in 2002, leaving the Buccaneers as the only NFL team not to play in their original conference. As a result of the league's realignment prior to the 2002 season, the Buccaneers joined three former NFC West teams to form the NFC South. The team is owned by the Glazer family and plays its home games at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. The Buccaneers have won two Super Bowl championships and, along with the Baltimore Ravens, are the only two NFL franchises that are undefeated in multiple Super Bowl appearances. They were regarded as a perennial losing franchise for most of their first two decades due to suffering 26 consecutive losses in their first two seasons (including a winless inaugural season) and 14 consecutive losing seasons from 1983 to 1996—the most in NFL history—contributing to their league-worst overall winning percentage of .406. Despite these early struggles, Tampa Bay is the first post-merger expansion team to clinch a division title, win a playoff game, and host a conference championship, all of which they accomplished by their fourth season in 1979. The team's image improved by the time of their first championship in 2002, also the first for any of the six organizations built after the merger,[b] but they would not win another playoff game until their second Super Bowl championship season in 2020. The Buccaneers joined the NFL as members of the AFC West in 1976.[6] The following year, they were moved to the NFC Central, while the other 1976 expansion team, the Seattle Seahawks, switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West.[7] This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons. Instead of a traditional schedule of playing each division opponent twice, the Buccaneers played every conference team once, plus the Seahawks.[8] Tampa Bay went 0–14 in their first season. They were outscored by an average of almost 21 points per game. Only three games ended with the Buccaneers within one possession.[9] Until the Detroit Lions in 2008, the 1976 Bucs were the only Super Bowl-era team to go winless in a whole season. Their losing streak caused them to become the butt of late-night television comedians' jokes.[10] Tampa Bay did not win their first game until the 13th week of their second season, starting with a record of 0–26 (though the Bucs had beaten the Atlanta Falcons, 17–3, in a 1976 pre-season game before their first regular season).[11] The Saints' head coach, Hank Stram, was fired after losing to the Buccaneers.[12] Their first win came on December 11, 1977, on the road against the New Orleans Saints in Week 13. Tampa Bay needed one more week to get their second victory, a home win over the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1977 season finale.[13] The Cardinals also fired their coach, Don Coryell, shortly afterward.[14] The Buccaneers improved to a 5–11 mark in 1978. The team boasted a strong defensive unit that finished seventh in points allowed. The team was competitive in numerous close games.[15] The Bucs' situation improved rapidly in the 1979 season. With the maturation of quarterback Doug Williams and future four-time Pro Bowl tight end Jimmie Giles, the first 1,000-yard rushing season from running back Ricky Bell, and a smothering, league-leading, Star Studded defense led by future NFL Hall of Famer Lee Roy Selmon,[16] the Bucs kicked off the season with five consecutive victories, a performance that landed them on the cover of Sports Illustrated.[17] With four games left in the season, the Bucs needed to win only one of them to make the playoffs. In the first, STP was put all over the goal posts in Tampa to prevent the goalposts from being ripped down in the event of a celebration. Four blocked kicks later, the Bucs wasted the oily substance, falling to the Minnesota Vikings 23–22. STP was wasted again the following week as the Bucs were shut out 14–0 by the Chicago Bears; and in O. J. Simpson's final home game in San Francisco, Tampa Bay lost its third straight attempt to clinch a division title against a 49ers team which came in with a 1–13 record. However, in the season finale at home against the Kansas City Chiefs, which was played in the worst downpour in Bucs history, Tampa Bay pulled out a 3–0 victory. Finishing with a 10–6 record, the Bucs had their first winning season in franchise history, and won the Central Division in a tiebreaker over the Bears.[18] In an upset, the Bucs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 24–17 in the divisional round of the playoffs.[19] Because the Los Angeles Rams defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the other NFC playoff game, the Bucs hosted the NFC Championship Game the following week in Tampa. The Bucs lost to the Rams 9–0.[20] In their fourth season, the Bucs seemed on the verge of fulfilling McKay's five-year plan.[21] The Buccaneers regressed in 1980 and finished with a 5–10–1 mark.[22] The Buccaneers made the playoffs again by winning their division in the 1981 season.[23] It came down to a thrilling final game at Detroit; the winner would take the Central Division crown and the loser would miss the playoffs. The Detroit Lions had not lost at home all season. Although the Bucs trailed early, an 84-yard touchdown bomb from QB Williams to WR Kevin House and a fumble recovery for a touchdown by DT David Logan sealed the win for the Buccaneers.[24] In the playoffs, the Cowboys defeated the Bucs, 38–0, in the divisional round. The loss remains the largest postseason shutout loss in franchise history.[25] The 1982 season started 0–3 for the Bucs, before a player's strike shut down the NFL for seven weeks. When the league resumed play, the Bucs were nicknamed the \"Cardiac Kids\" for winning five of their next six games, all in the final moments, to go 5–4 and qualify for the expanded playoff slate.[26] In the first round, the Bucs once again faced the Cowboys at Dallas, losing 30–17.[27] As it turned out, this would be the last winning regular season under Culverhouse's ownership. Before the 1983 season, Williams bolted to the United States Football League in a salary dispute.[28] The Bucs lost their first nine games of the 1983 season en route to finishing 2–14, the first of 12 consecutive seasons with at least ten losses—an NFL record.[29] Included was the drafting of Heisman Trophy winner Bo Jackson with the first pick in the 1986 draft.[30] Jackson had let it be known that he would never play a down for Hugh Culverhouse at Tampa Bay.[31] Making good on his threat, he opted instead to play baseball for the Kansas City Royals and would later return for parts of football seasons with the Los Angeles Raiders.[32][33] Along with Williams, who later was a Super Bowl champion QB for Washington, two other Bucs quarterbacks during this era led other teams to Super Bowl wins. Steve Young won with the 49ers and Trent Dilfer won with the Baltimore Ravens. In the 1984 season, the team went 6–10 in John McKay's final season.[34][35] Former Atlanta Falcons' coach Leeman Bennett was named head coach prior to the 1985 season.[36] He led the team to consecutive 2–14 finishes in 1985 and 1986.[37][38] Bennett was fired following the end of the 1986 season.[39] Ray Perkins was hired to be the head coach of the Buccaneers prior to the 1987 season.[40] Perkins coached for the team for almost four seasons, getting fired during 1990 season.[41] Under Perkins's tenure, the team won no more than five games in a single season.[42] Under Culverhouse, the Bucs were one of the NFL's more profitable teams during the 1980s; however, this was largely because he kept the payroll among the lowest in the league, hampering their ability to sign quality players. Attendance also sagged; at one point the Buccaneers went parts of three whole seasons without having a home game televised locally, and when they did it was more attributed to a strong visiting team with a large following in the area, such as the Chicago Bears or Green Bay Packers. Hardy Nickerson, a future five-time Pro Bowl linebacker, signed as a free agent from the Pittsburgh Steelers. John Lynch, a future Pro Bowl, and Hall of Fame strong safety, was drafted in 1993. In the 1995 NFL draft the Buccaneers drafted two future Hall of Famers: Warren Sapp and Derrick Brooks. Pro Bowl Fullback, Mike Alstott, was drafted the next year in the 1996 draft. Despite the profitability of the Buccaneers in the 1980s, Culverhouse's death in 1994 revealed a man close to bankruptcy despite having a low payroll for his team.[43] His son, Miami attorney Hugh Culverhouse Jr. soon sued his father's associates (Stephen Story, Jack Donlan, and Fred Cone) who had built the trust account that was meant to manage the elder Culverhouse's business (which involved a $350 million estate) after having his wife sign a post-nuptial agreement. At any rate, a settlement was soon reached that gave control of the trust to Culverhouse Jr., who sold the team for $192 million. Interested parties included New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner[44] and Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, the latter of whom publicly declared he would move the team to Baltimore, as the city did not have an NFL franchise at that time.[45] However, in a last-minute surprise, real estate magnate Malcolm Glazer outbid both of them for $192 million, the highest sale price for a professional sports franchise up to that point.[46] Glazer immediately placed his sons Bryan, Edward, and Joel in charge of the team's financial affairs. He stated that he had every intention of keeping the team in Tampa, but informed area citizens its current stadium deal would not support the record paid amount and that a new stadium would be required. The Glazers convinced Hillsborough County voters to raise sales taxes to fund the construction of what would become Raymond James Stadium. The Glazers' deep pockets and serious commitment to fielding a winning team–in Tampa Bay–finally allowed the Bucs to become competitive. The team's performance dramatically improved when the Glazers hired Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Tony Dungy as head coach.[47] Additionally, the team jettisoned the old uniform designs in favor of a modern look. During Dungy's first season in 1996, the team continued to struggle, starting the season 1–8. But in the second half of the season, they finished 5–2, primarily due to the performance of a defense ranked seventh in the NFL led by Hardy Nickerson and the maturing of Sam Wyche's draftees Brooks, Lynch, and Sapp.[48] Dungy, with his even-tempered personality, quickly brought balance and morale to the team, and his Cover 2 defensive scheme, sharpened to perfection by defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin and linebackers coach Lovie Smith, became the foundation for Tampa Bay's future success.[49] Their version of Cover 2 was so successful that it became known as the Tampa 2.[50] It has been brought to the Chicago Bears by Smith, Detroit Lions by Rod Marinelli, Kansas City Chiefs by Herman Edwards and to the Indianapolis Colts by Dungy himself, and copied by several other teams. The team started the 1997 season 5–0, picking up where they left off the previous year, and this quick start once again landed them on the cover of Sports Illustrated twice.[51][52] The Bucs went 10–6 for their first winning season and playoff appearance since 1982, as a wild-card team.[53] In the Bucs' final home game at Houlihan's Stadium (formerly Tampa Stadium), the team defeated the Lions 20–10. They lost at Lambeau Field to the eventual NFC champion Packers 21–7 in the Divisional Round.[54] Still, there was reason for optimism, and the expectations were high for the following season. The 1998 season, the first to be played in the newly constructed Raymond James Stadium,[55] saw the Bucs lose several close games en route to a disappointing 8–8 record.[56] The Bucs had to play the first six football games of the year (including preseason) on the road, as the new stadium was not quite finished. The 1999 season brought much better fortune. On the strength of the NFL's number 3 overall defense and a performance by rookie quarterback Shaun King, the Bucs finished the season with an 11–5 record and won their third NFC Central Division Championship.[57] They beat the Washington Redskins 14–13 in the Divisional round, before losing to the eventual Super Bowl Champion St. Louis Rams in a low-scoring NFC Championship Game, 11–6.[58][59] The Bucs' loss was controversial, highlighted by the reversal of a pass from King to wide receiver Bert Emanuel, which ended the Bucs' chances at continuing their last-minute drive. In league meetings following the season, the NFL changed the rules regarding what constituted an incomplete pass.[60] While the Bucs played well in 2000 and 2001 and made the playoffs in each season, they were unable to fulfill their primary goal of a Super Bowl victory.[61][62] The wild card spots that Tampa Bay earned forced them to go on the road for their postseason opener in each year, and both road games took them into frigid Philadelphia to play the Eagles. The Buccaneers historically have struggled in games played with a temperature of less than 32 °F (0 °C) (as late as 1999, they had never won a game with a temperature played under 40 degrees[63]) and the latter loss to the Eagles was the sixth time that Tampa Bay had lost a postseason game on the road (out of six played).[64][65][63] Dungy was fired by the Buccaneers following a 31–9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wildcard Round of 2001[66] and soon thereafter hired as the head coach of the Indianapolis Colts,[67] while the Bucs mounted a search for his replacement that would include numerous names and rejections.[68] Several potential candidates were offered the job, including University of Florida head coach (and former Buccaneers quarterback) Steve Spurrier, former New York Giants head coach Bill Parcells, and Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis. Spurrier jumped to the Redskins when he was offered the most lucrative salary package ever offered to an NFL head coach, and Parcells eventually passed on the Bucs' offer—the second time he had done so in the history of the franchise. Bucs' general manager Rich McKay threw his support behind Lewis. The Glazer brothers were so displeased with the selection of yet another defensive-minded coach that they overruled McKay and took control of the candidate search themselves. They made it clear that their top choice was Jon Gruden; however, he was still under contract with the Oakland Raiders. While talks with the Raiders were secretly underway, the Glazers publicly pursued another respected offensive mind, San Francisco 49ers head coach Steve Mariucci. Just when initial reports indicated that Mariucci had agreed to become both the Bucs' head coach and their general manager, Raiders owner Al Davis agreed to release Gruden to Tampa Bay.[69] The Glazers' shrewd move eventually paid off in acquiring Gruden, but it was costly. The team hired Gruden away from the Raiders on February 20, 2002, but the price was four draft picks, including the Bucs' first and second-round picks in 2002, their first-round pick in 2003, and their second-round selection in 2004, along with $8 million in cash.[70] (The league as a result prohibited any further trading of draft picks for coaches.) Gruden was frustrated by the limitation of his coaching authority by Davis and was more than pleased to return to Tampa Bay. His parents lived in Carrollwood, and he had spent part of his childhood in Tampa in the early 1980s when his father was a running backs coach and later a scout for the Bucs.[71] Upon his arrival in Tampa, Gruden immediately went to work, retooling a sluggish offense, changing over 50% of the starting offense. With a new Tailback, Wide Receiver, Two Tight Ends, Left Tackle, and Left Guard, Gruden put his stamp on the teams offense to remove the \"Dungy's Team\" label. The league's sweeping realignment sent the Bucs to the new NFC South Division, along with the Falcons, Carolina Panthers and New Orleans Saints.[72] Led by the league's top defense, the 2002 season was the Buccaneers' most successful to date. Linebacker Derrick Brooks was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year with a tendency to make big plays.[73] They won the NFC South title with the team's best ever record, 12–4, and scored more points in two playoff wins over the 49ers and Eagles than in Bucs playoff history combined. The Philadelphia Eagles were a thorn in Tampa Bay's side, having eliminated the Bucs in each of the last two seasons' wild card games. Tampa Bay entered the game as heavy underdogs and fell behind early. However, the Bucs persevered and took a ten-point lead into the fourth quarter. Ronde Barber sealed the win in dramatic fashion with a late interception return for a touchdown, and a 27–10 victory.[74] The Bucs then went on to rout Gruden's former team, the Raiders, who had the league's number one offense, by a score of 48–21 in Super Bowl XXXVII, nicknamed 'The Pirate Bowl'.[75] Soon after the Super Bowl victory, a growing number of press reports indicated Gruden's lack of patience with general manager McKay, a major architect of the Bucs' rebuilding effort over the previous ten years. McKay, like Gruden, had long-established ties to the Tampa Bay area. However, during the 2003 season, the Gruden-McKay relationship deteriorated as the Bucs struggled on the field. In November, Keyshawn Johnson was deactivated by the team ten games into the season for his conduct, which included sideline arguments with Bucs coaches and players.[76] Johnson was eventually traded to the Dallas Cowboys for wide receiver Joey Galloway, who later in his career played for the New England Patriots, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Washington Redskins.[77] In December, the Glazers allowed McKay to leave the Bucs before the end of the regular season, and he promptly joined the Falcons as president and general manager.[78] Thus, McKay watched his first game as a Falcons executive sitting next to owner Arthur Blank in a Raymond James Stadium skybox. The Falcons defeated the Bucs 30–28. The Bucs suffered a sluggish start and finished the season 7–9. With the Raiders' dismal 4–12 performance, neither Super Bowl team reached the playoffs that year.[79] For 2004, Bruce Allen was hired as general manager.[80] After Allen's arrival, both John Lynch and Warren Sapp were released, stunning many Buccaneer fans.[81] The distracted Buccaneers began the 2004 season with a 1–5 record, their worst start under Gruden. The fading accuracy of kicker Martín Gramática did not help matters, as the team lost many close games en route to a 5–11 record.[82] In the 2005 season, the Buccaneers celebrated their 30th season in the league, and returned to their winning ways. The Bucs selected Carnell \"Cadillac\" Williams in the first round of the 2005 draft, and the rookie would provide a running game the Buccaneers had not possessed since the days of James Wilder Sr. in the 1980s. Williams would later go on to receive the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Award.[83] After starting 5–1, the team entered a midseason slump hampered by a season-ending injury to starting QB Brian Griese. Replacement starter Chris Simms struggled early,[84] but came into his own, leading the team to a last-minute win over the Redskins. The Bucs won the NFC South Division finishing 11–5. The season ended abruptly, however, with a 17–10 loss in the Wild Card round, in a rematch with Washington that saw receiver Edell Shepherd drop the potential game-winning catch in the endzone.[85] After winning the division in 2005, the Bucs suffered through an abysmal 2006 season. The season was plagued by injuries, with starters such as guard Dan Buenning,[86] wide receiver Michael Clayton,[87] running back Cadillac Williams, defensive end Simeon Rice, cornerback Brian Kelly,[88] and quarterback Chris Simms all being placed on injured reserve at some point in the season.[89] The season also saw a lot of rookies starting for the Bucs, such as quarterback Bruce Gradkowski,[90] tackle Jeremy Trueblood,[91] and guard Davin Joseph.[92] The Bucs started off the season 0–3, with Simms throwing one touchdown to 7 interceptions. In the third game of the season, a last-minute loss to the Panthers, Simms's spleen was ruptured, and he was placed on injured reserve for the balance of the season.[89] After their bye week, the Bucs elected to start Gradkowski, a sixth-round pick from Toledo.[90][93] After nearly beating the Saints, Gradkowski led the team to last-minute wins over the Cincinnati Bengals and Philadelphia Eagles. The success was short-lived, however, and the Bucs lost five of the next six games. Tim Rattay replaced Gradkowski as quarterback late in the season, and the team finished 4–12.[94] The aged defense, with 5 starters who had played there for a decade or more, was ranked 17th overall, the first time a Tampa defense was not ranked in the top ten since 1996. After the disappointing 2006 season, the Buccaneers for the first time in several seasons had money to spend in free agency. They brought in quarterback Jeff Garcia,[95] offensive tackle Luke Petitgout,[96] defensive end Kevin Carter,[97] and linebacker Cato June.[98] On April 28, 2007, the Buccaneers drafted Clemson defensive end Gaines Adams with the 4th overall pick in the NFL draft. After the draft the Buccaneers picked up tight end Jerramy Stevens.[99] and defensive tackle Ryan Sims.[100] The off-season changes resulted in the Buccaneers winning the NFC South title in the 2007 season, finishing with a 9–7 record, and the 4th seed in the conference. The division crown was the second one in three seasons under Gruden. In the Wild Card round of the playoffs held on January 6, 2008, the Buccaneers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Giants by a final score of 24–14. During the 2008 offseason, the Bucs re-signed head coach Gruden and general manager Allen through the 2011 season. They also acquired former players Warrick Dunn, who had spent the last 6 seasons with the Falcons, and Brian Griese, who was the starting quarterback for the team in 2005 until a knee injury sidelined him for the remainder of the year. Chris Simms was finally released, having not played in a game since his injury in 2006. The Bucs got off to a great start in 2008, with a 9–3 record going into the final month of the season, tied for first place in the division, with a chance at the top seed in the conference. On December 2, it was announced that defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin would be leaving the team after the season's end, for the same job at the University of Tennessee, serving under his son Lane Kiffin, who had just been named the new head coach at the school. After the announcement, the Buccaneers would lose their final four games of the season to finish 9–7 for the second consecutive season. Unlike 2007, it was not enough to secure the division championship, nor a playoff appearance. Raheem Morris was named the replacement for Monte Kiffin as defensive coordinator in December 2008.[101] A month later, after the huge collapse that ended the 2008 season, the Buccaneers fired Jon Gruden and swiftly elevated Morris to the head coach position.[102] Bruce Allen was also let go, with Mark Dominik named his successor as general manager. Several veterans were released including Derrick Brooks, Joey Galloway, and Jeff Garcia.[103] The new staff traded for tight end Kellen Winslow Jr.,[104] signed quarterback Byron Leftwich,[105] and drafted Josh Freeman with the 17th overall pick.[106] The 2009 squad started out 0–7, behind Leftwich and later Josh Johnson. Following their bye week, the team elevated Freeman to starting quarterback,[107] resulting in the team's first win of the season. The team finished 3–13, the worst record since 1991.[108] The Bucs' 2010 season surprised many, producing the greatest single-season turnaround in franchise history, going 10–6.[109] This was largely behind the stellar performances of Freeman,[110][111] rookie receiver Mike Williams,[112][113] and LeGarrette Blount.[113][114] Despite the effort, the team narrowly missed the playoffs, losing out on the wild card tiebreaker to the eventual Super Bowl XLV champion Green Bay Packers.[115] Tampa Bay began the 2011 season with high hopes, adding several key defensive players through the draft.[116] After a 4–2 start, however, the Buccaneers collapsed, dropping ten consecutive games to finish 4–12.[117] The day after a 45–24 loss to the Falcons in their final game of the season, the team fired Morris, offensive coordinator Greg Olson and the rest of his corresponding staff.[118] During the Morris era, the lack of on-the-field success, along with several contributing factors, including the recession, saw attendance slip, precipitating local television blackouts for the first time since the mid-1990s. All eight regular-season home games were blacked out in 2010, and 5 of 7 were blacked out in 2011 (one \"home\" game was played in London). About three weeks after firing Raheem Morris, the Buccaneers hired Greg Schiano from Rutgers as the new head coach.[119] During his introductory conference he stated \"There will be Buccaneer men, and there will be a Buccaneer Way.\" The phrase \"The Buccaneer Way\" became a slogan among fans and local media, describing the new regime and attitude. The team filled out the coaching staff with new faces, including Mike Sullivan,[120] Bill Sheridan,[121] and Butch Davis.[122] In 2013, Dave Wannstedt was also added as special teams coach.[123] In the first day of free agency, the club signed top prospects Vincent Jackson and Carl Nicks, as well as Eric Wright.[124] The $140 million committed to the team during that 24-hour period is the largest investment the Glazer family has put into the team going back almost a decade. The team finished the 2012 season at 7–9, notably ranking first in rushing defense.[125] Furthermore, the rushing offense was highlighted by the breakout performance of Doug Martin. After two seasons of game-day local television blackouts, the improved team began seeing increased attendance and attention, and some blackouts lifted. 6 games were blacked out in 2012. For the three-year period of 2010–2012, the Bucs led the NFL in local television blackouts with 19 (Cincinnati was second with 11). Schiano's strict and regimented coaching style, however, drew criticism at the end of a game against the Giants, ordering his defense to continue to aggressively tackle the offense as Giants quarterback Eli Manning was taking a knee to end the game. Afterwards, Schiano was met at midfield by an irate Tom Coughlin, who did not appreciate the Bucs' aggressiveness.[126] Coming into the 2013 season, fans and analysts had better than average expectations for Tampa Bay. They were expected to improve their record, and potentially make a playoffs run. The predictions proved unfounded, as numerous issues on and off the field saw the team collapse. The team dealt with several players, including Lawrence Tynes, Carl Nicks,[127] and Johnthan Banks,[128] contracting antibiotic-resistant MRSA infections, which led to a 2015 lawsuit by Tynes that settled in 2017.[129][130][131] During training camp, a reported rift began to divide Schiano and quarterback Josh Freeman. After an 0–3 start, Freeman was benched, and ultimately released. This was after Freeman reportedly missed several team meetings, along with the team's annual photograph.[132] Schiano started rookie Mike Glennon,[133] but the team continued to lose. The fans' confidence of Schiano began to decay rapidly, and after a 0–8 start, the team got its first win of the season on a Monday night against Miami. A brief win streak saw improvements with Glennon at quarterback, and Bobby Rainey took over at running back with stellar numbers after Doug Martin went down with a shoulder injury.[134] There were no blackouts in 2013, as the Glazers bought up the necessary tickets for two of the games to get to the 85% threshold needed to prevent local blackouts. Despite some individual improvements, and some impressive performances by members of the defense, the team dropped the last three games of the season, and finished 4–12. The team ranked last or near the bottom in almost every offensive category. On December 30, 2013, Schiano and general manager Mark Dominik were fired.[135] On January 1, 2014, Lovie Smith was hired as the new head coach of the Buccaneers, replacing Greg Schiano.[136] Smith had previously spent 5 seasons with the Buccaneers from 1996 to 2001 coaching the linebackers under Tony Dungy.[136] During his first news conference with the Bucs, Smith talked about restoring the quality of the team from the late 1990s and early 2000s: \"There was a certain brand of football you expected from us,\" Smith said. \"You know we would be relentless. There was a brand of football that you got from us each week at Raymond James Stadium. It was hard for opponents to come in and win. We have gotten away from that a little bit, and it's time ... for us to become a relevant team again.\"[137] On January 21, 2014, Jason Licht was hired as the new general manager, replacing Mark Dominik.[138] He was officially introduced at One Buc Place on January 23, 2014. In his first news conference, Licht talked about his philosophy: \"Our philosophy is going to be to build through the draft. That's where we find our stars. That's where we find the next generation. But also in the short term and long term we're going to supplement our roster through free agency but we're going to look for value. We're going to spend wisely.\"[139] After signing veteran free agent Josh McCown and many more free agents,[140] many analysts predicted that the Buccaneers could be the surprise team of the year and possibly make a playoff run. Those predictions soon went away after the Bucs began the season 0–3, including a 56–14 blowout against the Falcons on Thursday Night Football. McCown was injured in that game,[141] and second-year quarterback Mike Glennon was named the starter. His first start of the 2014 season ended with the Bucs earning their first victory of the season in Pittsburgh against the Steelers 27–24. The Bucs lost the next 4 games, including two overtime losses against the Saints and the Vikings, one blowout against the Ravens, and a 5-point loss against the Cleveland Browns. Going into week 10 at 1–8, McCown returned as the starter. Mathematically, the Bucs were still in playoff contention only being 3 games out of first place in the division. McCown's first game back ended with a 27–17 loss to the Falcons but won the following week in a 27–7 blowout against struggling Washington.[141] The Bucs would lose the next three games and were officially knocked out of playoff contention in week 14. The Bucs finished 2–14, winning 2 fewer games than the previous season and secured the first-overall draft pick for the 2015 NFL draft.[142] Despite the team's record, first-round draft pick wide receiver Mike Evans[143] had more than 1,000 receiving yards,[144] and he became the youngest NFL player to record more than 200 receiving yards in a single game.[145] Vincent Jackson also had more than 1,000 yards receiving,[146] which represented Tampa Bay's first pair of 1,000 yard receivers in a season.[145] Second-year CB Johnthan Banks led the team with 4 interceptions and has 50 tackles.[147] Danny Lansanah flourished in the Tampa 2 system with 81 tackles, 1.5 QB sacks, and 3 interceptions, with 2 of those interceptions returned for touchdowns for the 2014 season.[148] Jacquies Smith, who was signed from Buffalo after waiving rookie DE Scott Solomon a month into the season, had 17 combined tackles, 13 solo tackles, 6.5 sacks, and 1 forced fumble in only 8 starts for 2014.[149] In December 2014, a report surfaced that the Buccaneers used homeless people to sell beer and did not pay them.[150] After the conclusion of the 2014 season, Tampa Bay hired Ben Steele to become the team's new offensive quality control coach as well as former Falcons offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter to be their new offensive coordinator after parting ways with QB coach and interim offensive coordinator Marcus Arroyo. Having a 2–14 record, tied for the worst record in the NFL in 2014, Tampa Bay gained the first-overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft. They also made some headlines when they released quarterback Josh McCown on February 11, 2015, to save $5.25 million in cap space.[151] With the first overall pick in the NFL draft, the Buccaneers selected Jameis Winston from Florida State.[152] Throughout the off-season, there was much debate whether the Buccaneers should pick Winston or Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota.[152] On January 6, 2016, Smith was fired by the Buccaneers after posting a record of 8–24 in his two seasons, including a 6–10 record in the 2015 season.[153] On January 15, 2016, Dirk Koetter was promoted from offensive coordinator to become the new head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[154][155] The teams' record sat at 3–5 following a blowout loss to the Falcons in a nationally televised Thursday Night Football matchup. Playoff chances grew increasingly more unlikely. However, following the loss, the Buccaneers rattled off five straight victories, the longest winning streak since the 2002 season. During the streak, the Buccaneers earned upset victories over the heavily favored Chiefs and Seahawks. The Buccaneers ended their 2016 season with a 9–7 record, but lost the NFC's sixth seed to the Lions due to tiebreakers.[156][157] On March 9, 2017, the Buccaneers signed former Washington Redskins wide receiver DeSean Jackson,[158] defensive tackle Chris Baker,[159] former Cowboys safety J. J. Wilcox (traded to Pittsburgh Steelers),[160] former New York Jets kicker Nick Folk,[161] and veteran quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick.[162] They were hampered with poor performance and an early kicking situation, as they failed to improve or match their 9–7 record from the previous season. After a loss to the Lions, they were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs with a 4–9 record. The Buccaneers finished the season 5–11.[163] This was their tenth consecutive season without a playoff appearance, with their last being in the 2007 season.[164] Also, the Bucs finished last in the NFC South for the seventh time in nine seasons. The Bucs began the 2018 season 2–0 for the first time since the 2010 season. Journeyman quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick started the first two games after Jameis Winston was suspended during the off-season for the first three games.[165] Fitzpatrick threw for over 400 yards and 4 touchdowns in the two-game winning streak, coming against the Saints (the eventual NFC South winner) and the Eagles (the defending Super Bowl champions).[166] Fitzpatrick would continue the success in week 3's Monday night game against the Steelers, throwing for another 400 yards and becoming the first player in NFL history to throw for 400 or more yards in three consecutive games.[167] After Winston's suspension was up following the Monday Night game, Fitzpatrick remained the starter for week 4's matchup against the Bears. Fitzpatrick struggled and was benched after halftime for Winston.[168] Winston returned as the starter in week 6.[169] Despite the quarterback controversy, the Bucs had a top 3 offense, averaging 27.8 points during the first six games. However, their defense continued to struggle. After week 6's loss to the Falcons, defensive coordinator Mike Smith was fired and linebackers coach Mark Duffner was named the interim defensive coordinator.[170] After a close overtime win against the Browns, Winston threw four interceptions against the Bengals the following week. After returning from suspension, Winston threw at least two interceptions per game, and due to that, Fitzpatrick was once again named the starter in week 9. Fitzpatrick, again, struggled, and Winston was renamed the starter for week 12's game against the 49ers. Winston improved, and the team won two straight. However, they dropped their last four games. After a second consecutive last-place season where the team finished with a 5–11 record, Koetter was fired.[171][172] Following the termination of Dirk Koetter, the Buccaneers named Bruce Arians as the 12th head coach in franchise history on January 8, 2019. Arians had been retired from coaching for a year, having spent the 2018 season in the broadcast booth.[173] Because Arians was still under contract with the Arizona Cardinals through the end of the 2019 season, Tampa Bay agreed to give the Cardinals a sixth-round pick in the 2019 NFL draft for the rights to Arians, as well as receiving Arizona's seventh-round pick in the same draft. On the same day it was reported the Bucs would also bring Byron Leftwich, who had served under Arians in Arizona, as offensive coordinator.[174] The next day the Buccaneers announced the hiring of former Jets head coach Todd Bowles as defensive coordinator.[175] In the 2019 season, the Bucs finished with a 7–9 record.[176] The team finished the season with the best run defense in the league and top 10 in total offense.[177] Jameis Winston set a franchise record with 5,109 passing yards, becoming the eighth player in NFL history to eclipse 5,000 yards.[178][179] He also set a franchise record with 33 touchdown passes, however in throwing 30 interceptions, he became the first quarterback in league history to have at least thirty of each.[180] He would not be re-signed by Tampa Bay with the Saints picking him up prior to the 2020 season.[181] The Buccaneers made arguably the biggest acquisition of the 2020 offseason when they acquired veteran quarterback Tom Brady, widely considered the greatest to ever play the position.[182][183][184][185][186][187] The offensive engine of the New England Patriots' sports dynasty from 2001 to 2019, Brady announced that he would not be re-signing with the Patriots after 20 seasons[188] and joined the Buccaneers for 2020.[189] Later in the offseason, tight end and Brady's New England teammate Rob Gronkowski announced that he was coming out of retirement to return to the NFL. On the same day, the Patriots made an agreement to trade Gronkowski to the Buccaneers, along with a seventh-round pick in exchange for a compensatory fourth-round pick in the 2020 NFL draft. Gronkowski would finish the regular season with 45 receptions, 623 receiving yards, and 7 receiving touchdowns in 16 games.[190] On September 6, 2020, the Buccaneers signed running back Leonard Fournette, who had been waived the week prior by the Jacksonville Jaguars.[191] On October 27, 2020, free agent wide receiver Antonio Brown signed a one-year contract with the Buccaneers. The move reunited Brown with Arians, who was his first offensive coordinator on the Pittsburgh Steelers, and Brady, whom he played one game alongside of for the Patriots. Brown made his first appearance with the Bucs in week 9 and would finish the regular season with 45 receptions, 483 receiving yards, and 4 receiving touchdowns in eight games.[192] In Week 15, the Buccaneers overcame a 17–0 deficit against the Atlanta Falcons, to win 31–27 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.[193] In the 2020 season, Tampa Bay clinched their first playoff berth since 2007 after a 47–7 victory against the Lions in Week 16.[194] By the end of the 2020 regular season, Brady had set the Buccaneers record for passing touchdowns with 40.[195] In the same game, receiver Mike Evans set the NFL record for consecutive 1,000-yard seasons to start a career with 7 straight 1,000 yard seasons.[196] In the playoffs, the Buccaneers defeated the Washington Football Team 31–23 in the wild card round, their first postseason victory since winning Super Bowl XXXVII in 2002. In the divisional round, they defeated the Saints 30–20 to advance to the NFC Championship Game for the fourth time in franchise history, and first since the 2002 season. They then defeated the Packers to advance to Super Bowl LV for the franchise's second appearance in the league championship, facing the defending Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs. The Bucs defeated the Chiefs to win their second Super Bowl title by a score of 31–9. Coincidentally, Raymond James Stadium was named as the host stadium of Super Bowl LV in 2017 when it was determined that SoFi Stadium, which had been awarded the game the year before its construction had begun, would not be completed in time to be eligible under league requirements to host.[197] Thus, the Buccaneers became the first team in NFL history to play in and win a Super Bowl that was held at its home stadium.[198] In the 2021 offseason, the Buccaneers re-signed all 22 of their starters from the 2020 Super Bowl championship season, in addition to re-signing Fournette and former Bengals running back Giovani Bernard. The Buccaneers are the first team in the salary cap era (1994), and fourth team all-time, to re-sign all 22 starters from their Super Bowl team, while every other team's roster changed.[199] After the 2021 regular season, in which they posted a 13–4 record and secured the #2 seed in the NFC playoffs.[200] The team defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 31–15 in the Wild Card Round.[201] The Buccaneers' title defense came to an end with a 30–27 last-second loss to the eventual Super Bowl LVI champion Los Angeles Rams in the Divisional Round.[202] On March 30, 2022, head coach Bruce Arians suddenly resigned, with defensive coordinator Todd Bowles being named the immediate replacement.[203][204] Tom Brady announced his retirement, but later returned citing unfinished business.[205] Despite signing former All-Pro receiver Julio Jones, former Pro-Bowlers Akiem Hicks and Keanu Neal, and Brady's former teammates Shaq Mason and Logan Ryan, the Bucs struggled mightily under Bowles in his first season as head coach. They finished 8–9, becoming the fifth sub .500 team since the merger to make the playoffs, before losing at home to the Cowboys in the Wild Card Round.[206][207] Brady would announce his second retirement shortly thereafter.[208] In the 2023 offseason, the Buccaneers hired Seahawks quarterbacks coach Dave Canales to be their offensive coordinator and signed Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield to a one-year, $8.5 million contract to be the team's next starting quarterback.[209][210] In the 2023 season, the Buccaneers won the NFC South with a 9–8 record.[211] The team defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card Round 32–9.[212] The Buccaneers saw their season end in the Divisional Round with a 31–23 loss to the Detroit Lions.[213] Throughout their history, the Buccaneers have been known for their suffocating defense. It started with the drafting of Hall of Fame defensive end Lee Roy Selmon with their first pick ever in 1976. Three Buccaneer players have been named the AP Defensive Player of the Year, and the team has led the league in total defense on three occasions, including the 2002 championship season. The team's defense was instrumental in their 2020 playoff run which led to their second Super Bowl title. All five of the Buccaneers Hall of Fame inductees are defensive players or coaches. Led by Selmon, Linebackers Dewey Selmon, Richard Wood, Dave Lewis, and Mike Washington, Mark Cotney, and Cedric Brown in the secondary, the early years Buccaneers quickly earned an identity as a defensive team. Their 3–4 defense peaked in 1979 when they led the league in total defense, points allowed, and first downs allowed. Lee Roy Selmon was voted NFL Defensive Player of the Year, but they eventually fell 10 points short of the Super Bowl as the offense held them back in the NFC Championship game in a 9–0 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. Although 1980 was a down year, the unit made pass defense adjustments and returned in 1981 to finish No. 1 in Touchdowns allowed; giving up only 10 touchdowns all season.[214] The team drafted franchise cornerstones John Lynch in 1993, and Warren Sapp and Derrick Brooks in 1995 to go along with All-Pro linebacker Hardy Nickerson. That was followed by the hiring of innovative defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin in 1996. The new-look Buccaneers set the stage for one of the greatest defensive runs in NFL history. From 1997 to 2008, the Buccaneers defense finished in the league's top ten every year but one, including eight top-5 finishes, and two top-ranked efforts. Kiffin along with head coach Tony Dungy created the \"Tampa 2\" defense, a modified version of the established Cover 2 scheme. Kiffin's defenses were known as gang tacklers with tremendous team speed with a front four that could pressure the quarterback consistently, fast sideline-to-sideline linebackers, and a hard-hitting secondary that caused turnovers. Many teams have copied the Tampa 2, but none have come close to the success the Buccaneers experienced led by numerous Pro Bowlers and Hall of Famers. The Tampa Bay defense featured future Hall of Famers: Derrick Brooks, John Lynch, Warren Sapp, Ronde Barber, and Pro Bowlers, Hardy Nickerson, Simeon Rice, Shelton Quarles, Donnie Abraham, and Super Bowl XXXVII MVP Dexter Jackson. Sapp and Nickerson were named to the 1990s All-Decade 2nd Team while the 2000s All-Decade Team featured Sapp and Brooks as 1st Team players and Ronde Barber on the 2nd Team. The 2002 Buccaneers defense is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenses in NFL history, rivaled only by the 1976 Steelers, 1985 Bears, 1986 Giants, 2000 Ravens and 2010's Seattle Seahawks.[215][216] In the regular season, Tampa Bay led the league in total defense (252.8 ypg), points allowed (196), first downs allowed (14.8 pg), passing (155.6 ypg), interceptions (31), interceptions returned for touchdowns (5), opponent passer rating (48.4), and shutouts (2). They also finished third in opponent rushing average (3.8 ypc), and sixth in sacks (43).[217] Derrick Brooks was awarded AP Defensive Player of the Year as the defense led the way to a 12–4 regular season.[218] The team was even better in the postseason allowing only a combined 37 points in three games – all against top ten offenses. In those three playoff games, they intercepted 9 passes – returning 4 for touchdowns – and collected 11 sacks. In Super Bowl XXXVII, the Buccaneers delivered one of the most impressive defensive performances in Super Bowl history. Playing against the #1 offense in the league led by league MVP Rich Gannon, the defense actually outscored the Raiders offense, allowing 2 offensive touchdowns while returning 3 interceptions for touchdowns. The defense set two records in the 48–21 blowout, one for most interceptions in a Super Bowl (5), and one for most interceptions returned for touchdowns in a Super Bowl (3).[219] Defensive back Dwight Smith became the only player in Super Bowl history to record multiple interceptions returned for touchdowns in a Super Bowl, while fellow defensive back Dexter Jackson was awarded Super Bowl MVP for his two interceptions in the game.[220][221] In 19 total games in 2002, the Buccaneers recorded 40 interceptions, 53 sacks, and 9 defensive touchdowns. When Arians was hired by the Bucs, he appointed former New York Jets head coach Todd Bowles to be the team's defensive coordinator. That same offseason, the team drafted linebacker Devin White with the fifth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, after signing outside linebacker Shaquil Barrett to a one-year, $4 million contract, and defensive end Ndamukong Suh for one year, $10 million. With these acquisitions, along with linebackers Lavonte David, Carl Nassib, Jason Pierre-Paul, nose tackles Vita Vea and Beau Allen and defensive end William Gholston, Bowles implemented the 3–4 defensive scheme, with a heavy emphasis on blitzing. David and White were the teams' leaders, Barrett led the team, and the league, in sacks with 19.5, and the 2019 Buccaneers finished No. 1 in the league in run defense. The team's defense improved next season after Suh, Barrett, and Pierre-Paul were re-signed and Antoine Winfield Jr. was drafted in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft. The Buccaneers defense was a massive part of the teams' turn-around in 2020, finishing 1st in run defense, 7th in pass defense and 8th in total defense. The Buccaneers pass defense improved 29th to 7th, thanks in part to their young secondary, led by Carlton Davis, Sean Murphy-Bunting, Jordan Whitehead, Winfield Jr., Ross Cockrell, Herb Miller and Mike Edwards. Nicknamed, the \"Grave Diggers\", they forced two interceptions, including a pick-six by Jamel Dean, four sacks and gave up no touchdowns against 2020 NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers in Week 6, forced three interceptions against future Hall of famer Drew Brees, and five sacks and another interception against Rodgers in the NFC Championship Game. In Super Bowl LV, against the league's No. 1 offense led by 2018 NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes, the Buccaneers held Kansas City to season lows in points and red zone attempts, with 9 points, all from field goals, 22 first downs, and 0–3 red zone attempts. They forced two interceptions, three sacks, 29 pressures, and five quarterback hits, and a 49.9 passer rating during the game. In 19 total games in 2020, the Buccaneers recorded 18 interceptions, 58 sacks, 19 forced fumbles, and 12 fumble recoveries.[222] Since 1998, the Buccaneers have played their home games at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. Prior to that, they had played in Tampa Stadium since their establishment. In 1975, the Buccaneers built a small practice complex with offices near Tampa International Airport called One Buccaneer Place – often shorted to \"One Buc Place\". The team utilized the unspectacular facility through 2005. It sat across the street from International Plaza and Bay Street, and backed up to the runways of the airport. It was located about two miles away from Tampa Stadium. As other NFL clubs began replacing and upgrading their respective facilities, Buccaneers players and coaches stepped up their complaints about the constant aircraft noise, cramped offices, small locker rooms, infestations, and decrepit condition of One Buc Place. Then-head coach Jon Gruden sarcastically referred to the facility as \"The Woodshed\"; some of the coaches' offices were actually converted broom closets.[223] The frequent summertime rain sent the team to practice in a nearby parking garage. Some players and staff even claim to have come down with illnesses from spending too much time in the building. For much of the team's existence, the Buccaneers held training camp on the University of Tampa campus, then at the expansive and better-equipped Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex near Orlando (2002–2008). In August 2006, the Buccaneers unveiled a new $30 million training facility. Conveniently located across the street from Raymond James Stadium (on the former site of Tampa Bay Center), the state-of-the-art 145,000-square-foot (13,500 m2) facility on 33 acres (13 ha) is one of the largest in the NFL. Its features include offices and meeting rooms, three natural grass practice fields, a theater for meetings and press conferences, an expanded weight room, a fully equipped kitchen and dining room, a rehabilitation center with three separate pools and a locker room twice the size of the former location. The building is capped off with a five-story glass and steel football as a key design element. An adjacent climate-controlled indoor practice facility, featuring an artificial turf field, was later completed in 2017. In 2009, the team began holding training camp at this new complex. In the second week of September 2007, statues of important figures from the Buccaneers 2002 championship season were moved into the lobby area in an exhibit called \"Moment of Victory\". The life-size statues included players Mike Alstott, Ronde Barber, Derrick Brooks, Brad Johnson, John Lynch, Shelton Quarles, Simeon Rice, Warren Sapp, and head coach Jon Gruden. The statues are modeled after images from the sideline towards the end of Super Bowl XXXVII.[224] Initially, the facility might have been unnamed, but for over a decade, it simply was referred to as \"One Buc Place\", utilizing the same name as the old building. In 2018, the facility was officially named Advent Health Training Facility, as part of a ten-year naming rights deal with Advent Health.[225] Since their inception in 1976, the Buccaneers have gone through two distinct logo/uniform eras. From 1976 to 1996, the team utilized orange, red, and white uniforms with a \"Bucco Bruce\" logo. Since 1997, the team has utilized red and pewter uniforms, with a \"skull and swords\" logo. The original \"Bucco Bruce\" logo has seen three distinct versions. The original version was the most unique; both in color and design. The logo was refreshed in 1992 with the most obvious differences being the design of the face, specifically the open eye, the design on the dagger, and the usage of white near the neck of the first design. The 2009 throwback uniforms utilized a cleaned up and crisper version of the 1976–1991 logo. From 1997 onwards, the Buccaneers' newer \"skulls and swords\" logo has gone through three iterations. The first was somewhat smaller on the helmet, and featured a more conventionally-shaped skull. The second edition was larger on the helmet, had a different shade of red, and a different design for the shape and face of the skull. The current version is mostly the same as the second, with only minor changes, including a smaller size on the helmet. Shortly after the franchise was awarded, in February 1975 the team name of \"Buccaneers\" was selected, along with proposed team colors of green, orange and white. The name was said to be reminiscent of José Gaspar and the Buccaneers of the Caribbean Sea, and the color orange representing the Florida citrus industry. Almost immediately, the nickname \"Bucs\" became popular, but the alternative \"Bay Bucs\" failed to gain traction.[226] A few months later, however, green was dropped from the color scheme. The artists' renditions were too similar to the aqua used by the Miami Dolphins, as well as the green shades utilized by the Miami Hurricanes and Florida A&M. While they desired to keep the primary color orange, which provided a popular visual link to the Gators, Hurricanes, and Florida A&M, they sought to further distinguish themselves. The color red as an accent color was substituted, as a gesture to the former Tampa Spartans and loosely, to the Florida State Seminoles. The orange/red/white combination was now a composite of all major college teams in the state at the time.[227] Officially speaking, the club's colors during this time period were Florida orange, red, and white.[228] Long-time Tampa Tribune cartoonist and Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla member Lamar Sparkman designed the first team logo.[229][230] Faced with the challenge of designing a logo that did not closely resemble that of the other \"pirates\" in the league, the Raiders, Sparkman came up with a moustached pirate wearing a plumed slouch hat, with a large hoop earring in his left ear and clutching a dagger in his teeth.[227] The pirate appeared to be winking. Sparkman decided to portray the character not as a \"hairy-legged slob\", but more of gallant, swashbuckling, and rakish, \"classy\" type. The eye wink was used rather than an eyepatch, since the Raiders' logo already depicted a patch over one eye.[227] For a very brief time he was referred to as \"Morgan\", and coach John McKay called him \"Errol Flynn\".[230] Local St. Petersburg Times sportswriter Hubert Mizell coined the somewhat belittling nickname \"Bucco Bruce\" in a February 1976 column, noting almost immediately the mascot's unintimidating and \"cavalier\" appearance.[231][232] The nickname stuck,[233] while the logo and the name \"Bucco Bruce\" became symbols and reminders of the club's ongoing futility.[234] Sports writer and commentator Nick Bakay once said that Bucco Bruce was a pirate who \"struck fear in the hearts of no one\". The original home uniforms featured orange jerseys with white numerals outlined in red, white trousers, and striped socks. These are the now-infamous \"Creamsicle uniforms\", so named from the perceived similarity of the uniform's appearance to the ice cream snack.[235] Road white jerseys had orange numerals outlined in red.[228] During their first season in 1976, however, the orange jerseys were only utilized for preseason games. The Buccaneers wore their white jerseys for all 14 regular season games.[227] After the 1976 season, the team would not see striped socks again until they began wearing them as throwback uniforms starting in 2009. After only one season, the original orange numerals (with red outline) for the white \"away\" jerseys were reversed. For 1977 and beyond, the white jerseys were revised to have red numerals with an orange outline. The color swap provided better visibility, especially for television coverage purposes.[236] The striped socks were dropped. During the 1985 season, the team wore a special patch marking their tenth season. In 1989, 1990, and 1991, the Buccaneers elected to wear white at home to accommodate Vinny Testaverde's color blindness. Testaverde had bad performances in the darker (orange) uniforms and persuaded head coach Ray Perkins to change the team's home uniform to white.[237][238] Beloit College, located in Beloit, Wisconsin, received a notice from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the college's illegitimate use of their mascot.[239] Beloit College's buccaneer is the mirror image of the Tampa Bay buccaneer, with the creamsicle colors replaced with Beloit's school colors.[240] Athletic Director Ed DeGeorge said Beloit's Buccaneers have used the logo since the early 1980s, when he chose it from a book while ordering decals for the football team's helmets. The NFL's Buccaneers joined the league in 1976. However, the Buccaneers withdrew their claim against Beloit College because of the independent decision to redesign the logo.[241] In 1992, the Bucco Bruce logo was given a minor facelift, as part of an overall uniform refresh. It resulted in a crisper and larger version, and was used for five seasons.[242] The team introduced orange trousers to be worn with the white jerseys. The white jerseys now had an orange collar, and would no longer be paired with white pants. Most regular season home games during this period (except primetime games and selected late season games) saw white jerseys with orange pants. The white on white combination would be used during preseason only. Prior to the team's season finale in 1995 against the Lions, coach Sam Wyche suggested that the Buccaneers wear the orange pants with their orange jerseys.[243] The idea was vetoed by, among others, Pro Bowl linebacker Hardy Nickerson. For the 1993 season, the Buccaneers added a commemorative patch to the right sleeve of their uniforms, which read \"Mr C\" in cursive script. It was in recognition of owner Hugh Culverhouse, who was battling terminal lung cancer.[244] For 1994, the Buccaneers carried the league-wide NFL 75th anniversary patch, and as part of the \"throwback\" theme of the season, wore white jerseys with white pants on two occasions. Shortly after Malcom Glazer purchased the franchise in January 1995, ownership announced that they were planning to introduce new team colors, logos, and uniforms.[245] Ownership hoped to switch to new uniforms as early as the 1995 season, however the NFL informed them that it was too late to do so at that time.[245] A formal uniform switch request was then submitted to the league and tentatively scheduled to take effect for the 1996 season.[246][247] Team officials and the NFL Properties department began to research a new design. The local newspaper even held an informal design contest to raise awareness and generate publicity.[248] However, in the meantime, the talks for a new stadium had stalled, leaving open the chance that the franchise might relocate. As a result, the uniform change was postponed. In March 1996, it was announced that the orange \"Creamsicle\" uniforms would be utilized for at least another year until the stadium plans were ironed out.[249] A ballot measure to fund the construction of a new stadium passed in September 1996. As a result, the franchise was guaranteed to stay in Tampa, and the plans to design a new uniform were resurrected and reenergized.[250] The Buccaneers worked with the NFL to develop a more marketable and intimidating look in order to improve the team's image. Starting with the 1997 season, the primary team colors were changed to red and pewter, with black and orange as accents. The \"Bucco Bruce\" logo was replaced by a red wind-swept flag displaying a white pirate skull and crossed sabres which is a modified Jolly Roger (similar to the one commonly associated with Calico Jack). The flagpole was another larger sabre. The \"Buccaneers\" team name was written in a new font, Totally Gothic, and was either red with shadows of pewter or red and white. Orange pinstriping, and an orange football, was used to maintain a visual link to the former colors.[251][234] Chris Berman nicknamed them \"the pirates in pewter pants,\" a play on the Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Pirates of Penzance. The nickname \"Pewter Pirates\" also became trendy. The Buccaneers staged a ceremony at The Pier on April 7, 1997, in which Bucco Bruce walked the plank of the pirate ship Bounty docked in Tampa Bay. But not before he was pardoned at the last minute by Governor Lawton Chiles.[230][252] The new uniforms were adopted while Raymond James Stadium was still under construction, and the new colors would be prominent at the new facility. This new color scheme loosely resembled that of the Tampa Bay Bandits, the USFL team that played in the region during their three-season existence from 1983 to 1985. That team had a color scheme of red, silver, black, and white. The new uniforms provided a combination of either red or white jerseys with either pewter or white trousers. The white-on-white combination has been used numerous times during the preseason and for early regular season games. The red-on-white combination has been used sparingly, for some prime time home games or special occasions. Most games, home and away, have utilized pewter trousers. For 2005, the uniform featured a patch commemorating the club's 30th season. In 2014, a circular patch was worn with the initials \"MG\", after the death of owner Malcolm Glazer. For 2015, a patch commemorating the club's 40th season was worn. Like many other NFL teams located in subtropical climates, the Buccaneers customarily wear their white road jerseys at home during the first half of the season – forcing opponents to wear their darker colors during the hot summers and autumns in Tampa. Additionally, the visitors' bench of Raymond James Stadium is located on the east side of the stadium, which is in direct sunlight for games that kick off at 1:00 p.m. Eastern, whereas the west (home) sideline is in the shade. In certain previous years, such as 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1996 – the last year of the original uniforms, the Buccaneers generally wore white at home for the entire season including preseason. Since the new uniforms were adopted, the Buccaneers typically wear their red jerseys for home games during the second half of the season, and for most nighttime home games. They have also worn red jerseys all four times as the home team in International Series games. During the preseason, the Buccaneers usually wear white for their home games. Since the 1997 season, the Buccaneers have worn both their red jerseys (5 times) and white jerseys (4 times) for home postseason games. At Super Bowl XXXVII, in which Tampa Bay was the designated home team, they elected to wear their red home jerseys. This was despite the kickoff temperature of 81 °F (27 °C), one of the hottest Super Bowls on record.[253] The Buccaneers' 1997 uniform change prompted a 2003 lawsuit by the Raiders, who claimed that the NFL and the Buccaneers had infringed upon key trademark elements of the Raiders' brand, including the Raiders' pirate logo. In the same suit, the Raiders challenged the Carolina Panthers' color scheme, which included silver and black. The Raiders wanted the courts to bar the Buccaneers and Panthers from wearing their uniforms while playing in California. However, since the lawsuit was filed in a California state court, the lawsuit was tossed out because only federal courts have jurisdiction on intellectual property issues.[254] The Buccaneers unveiled a revised logo and helmet on February 20, 2014.[255][256] This was followed two weeks later on March 3, with the unveiling of new uniforms to be used starting in the 2014 season. The jersey numbers featured a high-vis reflective outline, the helmet logo was revamped and enlarged, the helmet itself was a darker shade of pewter, and the facemask had a chrome-effect coating. The original Creamsicle shade of orange was reintroduced as accent trim.[257][258][259] The reaction to the newer uniforms was mixed.[260] Of note, the jersey numbers were derisively compared to digital alarm clock numerals.[261] Different color sock combinations were used with white and colored uniforms, almost always being pewter or red; however, there were two occasions in 2014 when orange socks were used for two different weeks. Like the 1997–2013 version, the new 2014 uniforms could be worn as combinations of red or white jerseys paired with either pewter or white trousers. As before, the Buccaneers typically wore their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season, and their red jerseys at home during the second half of the season as well as for night games. In 2015, the Buccaneers debuted a Color Rush uniform featuring red jerseys and red trousers, with pewter numerals.[262] The Buccaneers unveiled three new jersey designs on April 7, 2020. The new uniform designs evoke the club's 1997–2013 design, while incorporating modern design elements from the 2014 uniform refresh, including the enlarged flag-and-crossed-swords logo, as well as the modern ship design logo on the sleeves. While the Buccaneers kept the familiar red and white jerseys with either white or pewter pants, they changed their \"Color Rush\" alternate uniform to an all-pewter combination.[263][264][265] For Super Bowl LV held at Raymond James Stadium, Tampa Bay was the designated home team, the first team in NFL history to play in a Super Bowl in their own stadium. They elected to wear their road white jerseys with pewter trousers, instead of their red jerseys, citing the success they had enjoyed during the season in that combination. Tampa Bay routed Kansas City 31–9, giving them a Super Bowl win in both their red jerseys (XXXVII) and their white jerseys (LV).[266] During the 2020 season, the Buccaneers finished with a 6–0 record wearing their newer white jersey/pewter pants combination, including three postseason victories over New Orleans, Green Bay, and Kansas City, respectively. They were first introduced in their Week 6 game against Green Bay, a 38–10 win at Raymond James Stadium. A renewed interest in wearing white jerseys at home saw Tampa Bay schedule six of eight 2021 home games with white (up from the typical four), plus home playoff games in the Wild Card and Divisional rounds with white/pewter as well. Following their uniform change in 1997, the Buccaneers did not wear the old orange uniforms, even during popular league-sponsored \"throwback\" weekends. The old uniforms were mostly eschewed by the club, and the sale of team merchandise in the old color scheme was embargoed for several years. Fans' opinions of the old uniforms were equally negative. However, after over a decade, there was a renewed interest in the old uniforms, as throwbacks and other alternate uniforms across the league were becoming increasingly popular. In 2008, the team revealed that they would be wearing orange throwback uniforms for one game in the 2009 season.[267] Their use was in conjunction with the creation of a Buccaneers Ring of Honor, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the 1979 division championship team. Throwback merchandise went on sale in the summer of 2009, and referred to the orange color not as \"Florida Orange\", but as \"Orange Glaze\". Considerable research was done using photographs and old uniforms to match the original color schemes. The dagger-biting pirate was given a cleaned-up look, and the orange, red, and white uniforms debuted against the Packers (Tampa Bay's former division rival) on November 8, 2009. Raymond James Stadium was also transformed via orange banners and classic field logos and fonts back to the classic Tampa Stadium look of the late 1970s. The Buccaneers won their first throwback game behind rookie quarterback Josh Freeman's first-career NFL start.[268] The throwback game was to become an annual tradition, but went on hiatus after 2012 due to league-wide safety restrictions requiring players wear the same helmet throughout the season.[269] After changes in league policies, the throwback uniforms returned in 2023.[270] The Buccaneers are 1–5 in throwback games. Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 10 reserve, 15 practice squad (+2 exempt) The Buccaneers have retired three jersey numbers, led by Lee Roy Selmon's number 63. Derrick Brooks (55) and Warren Sapp (99) had their numbers formally retired after they were inducted into the Hall of Fame. Despite not being formally retired, the Buccaneers have not reissued 20 (Ronde Barber), 40 (Mike Alstott), or 47 (John Lynch) since those players retired from playing. As of 2024, neither Lynch nor Barber have had their numbers retired, despite also being inducted into the Hall of Fame. Another number that has seen limited usage is 42, worn by the late Ricky Bell. Since Bell's last season in 1981, 42 has only been worn by two players, the most recent being in 1990. Since Tampa Bay's entrance into the NFL, at least one player has been included on each NFL All-Decade Team, excluding the 1970s which Tampa Bay only had existed for four seasons. Tampa Bay has had players elected to the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s teams. Among the three Anniversary Teams, the franchise did not exist for the 50th Anniversary Team, no players were selected to the 75th Anniversary Team, and five players were selected to the 100th Anniversary Team. Players are only included on lists which they played for the team within the years of the decade; members, such as Tom Brady, did not join the Buccaneers until 2020, despite being a member of the 2000s and 2010s All-Decade Teams. In 1991, the organization initiated the \"Krewe of Honor\" to recognize top players, and featured a mural of the first class of three members.[276] The display was painted in 1992 by Pat Donatelli and located on the east side of the stadium.[277][278] Honorees were presented with a plaque. Quarterback Doug Williams was subsequently inducted September 6, 1992,[279] and owner Hugh Culverhouse on September 5, 1993.[280] No additional members were added before Tampa Stadium was closed and demolished; when the stadium was demolished in 1998, so was the Krewe. On November 8, 2009, the team unveiled a new Ring of Honor at Raymond James Stadium. Hall of Fame defensive tackle, as well as the franchise's first-ever draft pick, Lee Roy Selmon was the first inductee.[282] On October 19, 2008, one year prior to the inception of the Ring of Honor, Mike Alstott was honored by the club following his retirement.[283] He would be formally inducted into the ring in 2015. Former head coach Jon Gruden was inducted in 2017, but due to controversy surrounding emails he sent while working for ESPN, his name was removed in 2021.[284] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the induction ceremony for 2020 inductee Monte Kiffin was postponed until 2021.[285] Inductees John Lynch and Ronde Barber were both honored a second time for having subsequently been named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[286] Criteria for induction is loose, and no formal voting process is conducted. Ownership considers players, coaches, or club executives that have had \"an indelible impact on the franchise\". Maintaining strong ties to the team and the greater Tampa Bay community is an important factor.[287] As of 2023, each of the players that had been named to the defunct \"Krewe of Honor\" have been subsequently inducted into the new Ring of Honor, with the lone exception of Ricky Bell. The ring initially featured the player's number and last name in protruding, illuminated letters, along the frieze of the stadium's upper deck. When the stadium underwent renovations in 2016–2017, the ring was refreshed to flat white letters on a red background, expanded to include both first and last names. Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees are additionally denoted by a hall of fame logo next to their names. In 2021, the ring was further expanded with recognition of Tampa Bay's two Super Bowl victories (2002 and 2020) on the wall below the frieze. Many current and former members of the Buccaneers have been selected to the Associated Press All-Pro first and second teams.[288] While the AP All-Pro teams are generally considered the highest nomination, Pro Football Writers of America, Newspaper Enterprise Association, Pro Football Weekly, Pro Football Focus, and The Sporting News have also nominated Buccaneers players to their All-Pro teams. Notes: Many former and current Tampa Bay Buccaneers players have represented thefranchise in the Pro Bowl: Many members drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have been selected to the Pro Football Writers of America NFL All-Rookie Team: Former Buccaneer players and seasons profiled on A Football Life and The Timeline: The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have had the first overall pick in the NFL Draft on five occasions.[292] → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The Bucs created an official cheerleading squad in their first season, called the \"Swash-Buc-Lers\". In 1999, they were renamed as the \"Tampa Bay Buccaneers Cheerleaders\".[293] A Triumph of the Heart: The Ricky Bell Story is a made-for-television movie that recounts the life of the late Buccaneer running back Ricky Bell.[294] The movie takes place through a dramatic reenactment of the 1981 season, including actual footage of gameplay around the dramatized role by Mario Van Peebles playing Bell himself. Bell finds himself befriending an impaired child who inspire each other to become better in their own ways. It also includes other former Buccaneer players, like Lee Roy Selmon, Charley Hannah, and Doug Williams (only through gameplay footage). The Buccaneers and Falcons met for the first time in the 1977 season, one year after the Buccaneers joined the NFL as the newest expansion team. The rivalry became fiercer after the 2002 season, when the Buccaneers and Falcons were placed in the same division, leading to constant clashes for the divisional title.[295][296][297][298][299] The Falcons lead the overall series, 32–31. The two teams have not met in the playoffs.[300] The Buccaneers and Panthers first meet in 1995, back when the later team joined the NFL as expansion franchise.[301] However, the rivalry would take off during the 2000s with the creation of the NFC South and was described as \"heated\" and \"physical\" due to two main reasons; the first being that both teams fought for dominating control over the NFC South throughout most of the 2000s.[302][303][304][305][306][307] The second reason being that players on both franchises suffered season ending injuries during their annual games. Examples include Chris Simms, Dante Wesley, Clifton Smith, and Kavika Pittman.[301][308] As of the 2023 season, the Panthers lead the rivalry 25–22.[309] The Saints and Buccaneers have one noticeable parallel throughout the two franchises history, they were both regarded as unsuccessful franchises until the 21st century, which was both teams were placed in the NFC South in 2002, as well as when their rivalry would truly begin to take off,[310] when both teams improved their fortunes, though the Buccaneers got over the hump first with by winning Super Bowl XXXVII and the Saints winning their first Super Bowl 7 years later in Super Bowl XLIV. The first meeting between these two franchises first occurred in 1977 when the Buccaneers beat the Saints and ended their 26-game straight losing streak.[311] While it is not the most well known rivalry in the NFL, it's grown into one of the league's fiercest and most physical. The rivalry reached new heights in the 2000s, which was when the Buccaneers had a higher advantage over the Saints in the regular season, when both teams started posting winning seasons in that decade.[312][310][313][314] New Orleans Saints leads the rivalry 39–24 and the two franchises met once in the playoffs in which the Buccaneers defeated the Saints 30 to 20 and eventually won Super Bowl LV.[315][316] From 1977 to 2001; the Buccaneers played in the former NFC Central division, culminating in two former divisional rivalries developing with the Detroit Lions[317][318] and the Green Bay Packers. The Buccaneers and Packers were division rivals from 1977 to 2002 when both were in the NFC Central division. The teams have played several notable games, including a Snow Bowl game in 1985, a playoff game in 1998 and the NFC Championship Game in 2021. As of the 2023 season, the Packers lead the series 34–24–1.[319][320][321][322][323][324] The Buccaneers have grown a fairly recent playoff rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles beginning in the late 1970s, but reached new heights in competition during the new millennium as the two teams have met in the postseason four times since 2000.[325][326][327] The rivalry would return in the early 2020s when the Buccaneers beat the Eagles in the 2021 and 2023 NFC Wild Card games.[328] As of the 2023 season, The Buccaneers lead the all-time series 12–11. The Eagles lead in regular season matchups 8–9, while the Buccaneers leads 4–2 in the postseason.[329] The Buccaneers have also grown a recent rivalry with the Los Angeles Rams as the two teams have faced off numerous times in the postseason;[330][331] first meeting in the 2022 NFC Divisional round,[332] and in the Conference Championship twice, both in 1979 and 2000[333][334] with the Rams winning all 3 matchups. The two teams became the first in league history to win a Super Bowl in their home stadiums as Tampa won Super Bowl LV in 2021, and Los Angeles won Super Bowl LVI a year later.[335] Both teams combine for four Super Bowl championships as they regularly fought for control of the conference in the early 2000s and 2020s respectively.[336] As of the 2023 season, the Rams lead the all-time series 19–10.[337] The Buccaneers developed a minor instate rivalry with fellow Floridian team; the Miami Dolphins. The two teams had their first meeting in Week 7 of the 1976 season, with the Dolphins winning 23–20.[338] The 1976 meeting was the only one where both teams were members of the AFC, with Tampa leaving later to join the NFC. As a result, the two teams can only meet as interconference rivals, which is not guaranteed to be annual. As of the 2023 season, the Buccaneers leads the all-time regular-season series 7–5.[339][340] The Buccaneers' current flagship radio stations are WXTB 97.9 FM and WDAE 620 AM.[342] The play-by-play announcer since 1989 has been Gene Deckerhoff.[343] Former Bucs tight end Dave Moore joined Deckerhoff as analyst for the 2007 season.[344] T. J. Rives works as the sideline reporter.[345] Broadcast legend and former Green Bay Packers' announcer Ray Scott was the play-by-play man for the Bucs' first two seasons in 1976 and 1977. Dick Crippen called the team's games in the first half of the 1978 season, with Jim Gallogly taking over for the second half. From 1979 to 1988 Mark Champion, who became the radio voice of the Detroit Lions (1989–2004) and then the Detroit Pistons (2001–present), held that position with the Bucs. Former Buccaneer Hardy Nickerson served as color commentator for one season in 2006, until he signed with the Bears as a linebackers coach on February 23, 2007. Nickerson had replaced Scot Brantley, who was the commentator from 1999 through 2005. Jesse Ventura, the famous professional wrestler, actor, and former governor of Minnesota, was Deckerhoff's partner on the Bucs radio broadcasts for one year, 1990, and former Buc David Logan held that position after Ventura until his death after the 1998 season. Dave Kocerek and Fran Curci were also color commentators for the Buccaneers during their earlier years. Ronnie Lane previously worked as a sideline reporter.[346] The Bucs have broadcast on FM radio since signing with Top 40 station WRBQ-FM in 1992. The team moved to WQYK-FM in 1994, then to WFUS in 2004, and then to WXTB in 2017. While regular-season and post-season games in the NFL are all broadcast by national television contracts on CBS, Fox, NBC, ESPN and NFL Network, the television broadcasts are for the most part handled by the individual teams. WESH simulcasts the broadcast in the Orlando area. CBS, Fox and NBC games are shown respectively in Tampa Bay on WTSP, WTVT and WFLA-TV, while they are shown respectively in Orlando on WKMG, WOFL and WESH. The great majority of games are aired on Fox owned-and-operated stations WTVT and WOFL, by virtue of Fox owning the rights to NFC games. WTSP and WKMG air any Buccaneers home games against American Football Conference teams. Monday Night Football games on ESPN and Thursday night games on NFL Network are simulcast locally on WMOR-TV, who also previously carried the Bucs' Sunday Night Football games when they were televised on ESPN and TNT; previously, the Bucs' appearances on the cable networks were seen locally on WFLA-TV and WFTS. At WFLA, Chris Myers was the play-by-play announcer with John Lynch as color commentator. Both Myers and Lynch worked nationally with Fox Sports at the time until Lynch became the general manager of the San Francisco 49ers in 2017. Ron Jaworski previously served as color commentator, until he signed with Monday Night Football for 2007. Charles Davis also served as color commentator from 2007 to 2008. WTOG channel 44 also previously broadcast Buccaneers preseason games for many years, ending in 2002. Former CBS play-by-play and ESPN golf broadcaster Jim Kelly was the play-by-play announcer for many of those games in the 1980s, and Joe Namath was a commentator. In the early years of the franchise, WTVT, then a CBS affiliate, broadcast some Buccaneers preseason games. Sports anchor Andy Hardy handled the play-by-play, and for one game in 1978, his broadcast partner was his friend, Florida State alumni, and movie actor Burt Reynolds.[347]",

It is sometimes called the \"stomach flu\" or the \"stomach bug.\" However, norovirus illness is not related to the flu. The flu is caused by the influenza virus. Norovirus causes acute gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach or intestines. Most people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days; but they can still spread the virus for a few days after. You can get norovirus illness many times in your life because there are many different types of noroviruses. Infection with one type of norovirus may not protect you against other types. It is possible to develop protection against specific types. But it is not known exactly how long protection lasts. This may explain why so many people of all ages get infected during norovirus outbreaks. A person usually develops symptoms 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus. If you have norovirus illness, you can feel extremely ill, and vomit or have diarrhea many times a day. This can lead to dehydration (loss of body fluids), especially in young children, older adults, and people with other illnesses. Symptoms of dehydration include: Anyone can get infected and sick with norovirus and people of all ages get infected during norovirus outbreaks. Your likelihood of getting a norovirus infection is also determined in part by your genes. If eaten raw, oysters and other filter-feeding shellfish can contain viruses and bacteria that can cause illness or death. Anyone who consumes raw shellfish is at risk of contracting norovirus. Children younger than 5 years old, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop severe infections. Norovirus spreads very easily and quickly in different ways. You can get norovirus by: You can still spread norovirus for 2 weeks or more after you feel better. Norovirus is very contagious, but you can take steps to protect yourself and others, including: Diagnostic methods for norovirus focus on detecting viral RNA (genetic material) or viral antigen. Diagnostic tests are available at all public health laboratories and many clinical laboratories. Most people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days. There is no specific medicine to treat people with norovirus illness. Antibiotic drugs will not help treat norovirus infections because they fight bacteria, not viruses. Watch for signs of dehydration (loss of body fluids) in children who have norovirus illness. Children who are dehydrated may cry with few or no tears and be unusually sleepy or fussy. If you have norovirus illness, you should drink plenty of liquids to replace fluid lost from vomiting and diarrhea. This will help prevent dehydration. Sports drinks and other drinks without caffeine or alcohol can help with mild dehydration. However, these drinks may not replace important nutrients and minerals. Oral rehydration fluids that you can get over the counter are most helpful for mild dehydration. Dehydration can lead to serious problems. Severe dehydration may require hospitalization for treatment with fluids given through your vein (intravenous or IV fluids). If you think you or someone you are caring for is severely dehydrated, call your doctor. Norovirus is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea, and foodborne illness in the United States. Always wash your hands and handle food well. Languages Language Assistance",

They commonly spread through food or water that is contaminated during preparation or through contaminated surfaces. Noroviruses can also spread through close contact with a person who has norovirus infection. Diarrhea, stomach pain and vomiting typically begin 12 to 48 hours after exposure. Norovirus infection symptoms usually last 1 to 3 days. Most people recover completely without treatment. However, for some people — especially young children, older adults and people with other medical conditions — vomiting and diarrhea can be severely dehydrating and require medical attention. Norovirus infection occurs most frequently in closed and crowded environments. Examples include hospitals, nursing homes, child care centers, schools and cruise ships. Signs and symptoms of norovirus infection may start suddenly and include: Signs and symptoms usually begin 12 to 48 hours after your first exposure to a norovirus and last 1 to 3 days. You can continue to shed virus in your stool for several weeks after recovery. This shedding can last weeks to months if you have another medical condition. Some people with norovirus infection may show no signs or symptoms. However, they're still contagious and can spread the virus to others. Seek medical attention if you develop diarrhea that doesn't go away within several days. Also call your health care provider if you experience severe vomiting, bloody stools, stomach pain or dehydration. Noroviruses are highly contagious. That means the norovirus infection can easily spread to others. The virus is shed in stool and vomit. You can spread the virus from the time you first have symptoms of illness until several days after you recover. Noroviruses can stay on surfaces and objects for days or weeks.

Risk factors for becoming infected with a norovirus include: For most people, norovirus infection usually clears up within a few days and isn't life-threatening. But in some people — especially young children; older adults; and people with weakened immune systems or other medical conditions or who are pregnant — norovirus infection can be severe. Norovirus infection can cause severe dehydration and even death. Warning signs of dehydration include: Children who are dehydrated might cry with few or no tears.

                "content": "Norovirus, also known as Norwalk virus and sometimes referred to as the winter vomiting disease, is the most common cause of gastroenteritis.[1][6] Infection is characterized by non-bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain.[2][3] Fever or headaches may also occur.[2] Symptoms usually develop 12 to 48 hours after being exposed, and recovery typically occurs within one to three days.[2] Complications are uncommon, but may include dehydration, especially in the young, the old, and those with other health problems.[2] The virus is usually spread by the fecal–oral route.[3] This may be through contaminated food or water or person-to-person contact.[3] It may also spread via contaminated surfaces or through air from the vomit of an infected person.[3] Risk factors include unsanitary food preparation and sharing close quarters.[3] Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms.[3] Confirmatory testing is not usually available but may be performed by public health agencies during outbreaks.[3] Prevention involves proper hand washing and disinfection of contaminated surfaces.[4] There is no vaccine or specific treatment for norovirus.[4][5] Management involves supportive care such as drinking sufficient fluids or intravenous fluids.[5] Oral rehydration solutions are the preferred fluids to drink, although other drinks without caffeine or alcohol can help.[5] Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not effective against the norovirus, according to the NHS information page on the subject;[8] this is due to norovirus being a non-enveloped virus. Norovirus results in about 685 million cases of disease and 200,000 deaths globally a year.[6][7] It is common both in the developed and developing world.[3][9] Those under the age of five are most often affected, and in this group it results in about 50,000 deaths in the developing world.[6] Norovirus infections occur more commonly during winter months.[6] It often occurs in outbreaks, especially among those living in close quarters.[3] In the United States, it is the cause of about half of all foodborne disease outbreaks.[3] The virus is named after the city of Norwalk, Ohio, US, where an outbreak occurred in 1968.[10] Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. A person usually develops symptoms of gastroenteritis 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus.[11] General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headaches, and low-grade fevers may occur. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it is not usually dangerous, and most who contract it make a full recovery within two to three days.[1] Norovirus can establish a long-term infection in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with common variable immunodeficiency or with a suppressed immune system after organ transplantation.[12] These infections can be with or without symptoms.[12] In severe cases, persistent infections can lead to norovirus‐associated enteropathy, intestinal villous atrophy, and malabsorption.[12] Noroviruses are transmitted directly from person to person (62–84% of all reported outbreaks)[13] and indirectly via contaminated water and food. Transmission can be aerosolized when those stricken with the illness vomit or by a toilet flush when vomit or diarrhea is present; infection can follow eating food or breathing air near an episode of vomiting, even if cleaned up.[14] The viruses continue to be shed after symptoms have subsided, and shedding can still be detected many weeks after infection.[15] Vomiting, in particular, transmits infection effectively and appears to allow airborne transmission. In one incident, a person who vomited spread the infection across a restaurant, suggesting that many unexplained cases of food poisoning may have their source in vomit.[16] In December 1998, 126 people were dining at six tables; one person vomited onto the floor. Staff quickly cleaned up, and people continued eating. Three days later others started falling ill; 52 people reported a range of symptoms, from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea. The cause was not immediately identified. Researchers plotted the seating arrangement: more than 90% of the people at the same table as the sick person later reported becoming ill. There was a direct correlation between the risk of infection of people at other tables and how close they were to the sick person. More than 70% of the diners at an adjacent table fell ill; at a table on the other side of the restaurant, the infection rate was still 25%. The outbreak was attributed to a Norwalk-like virus (norovirus). Other cases of transmission by vomit were later identified.[17] In one outbreak at an international scout jamboree in the Netherlands, each person with gastroenteritis infected an average of 14 people before increased hygiene measures were put in place. Even after these new measures were enacted, an ill person still infected an average of 2.1 other people.[18] A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study of 11 outbreaks in New York State lists the suspected mode of transmission as person-to-person in seven outbreaks, foodborne in two, waterborne in one, and one unknown. The source of waterborne outbreaks may include water from municipal supplies, wells, recreational lakes, swimming pools, and ice machines.[19] Shellfish and salad ingredients are the foods most often implicated in norovirus outbreaks. Ingestion of shellfish that has not been sufficiently heated – under 75 °C (167 °F) – poses a high risk for norovirus infection.[20][21] Foods other than shellfish may be contaminated by infected food handlers.[22] Many norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by only one infected person.[23] Between March and August 2017, in Quebec, Canada, there was an outbreak of norovirus that sickened more than 700 people. According to an investigation by Canada's CFIA Food Control Agency, the culprit was frozen raspberries imported from Harbin Gaotai Food Co Ltd, a Chinese supplier, and then Canadian authorities issued a recall on raspberries products from Harbin Gaotai.[24] According to the CDC, there was a surge in norovirus cases on thirteen cruise ships in 2023, which marks the highest number of outbreaks since 2012.[25] Noroviruses (NoV) are a genetically diverse group of single-stranded positive-sense RNA, non-enveloped viruses belonging to the family Caliciviridae.[26][27] According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, the genus Norovirus has one species, which is called Norwalk virus.[26] Noroviruses can genetically be classified into at least seven different genogroups (GI, GII, GIII, GIV, GV, GVI, and GVII), which can be further divided into other genetic clusters or genotypes.[28] Noroviruses commonly isolated in cases of acute gastroenteritis belong to two genogroups: genogroup I (GI) includes Norwalk virus, Desert Shield virus, and Southampton virus; and II (GII), which includes Bristol virus, Lordsdale virus, Toronto virus, Mexico virus, Hawaii virus and Snow Mountain virus.[27] Most noroviruses that infect humans belong to genogroups GI and GII.[29] Noroviruses from genogroup II, genotype 4 (abbreviated as GII.4) account for the majority of adult outbreaks of gastroenteritis and often sweep across the globe.[30] Recent examples include US95/96-US strain, associated with global outbreaks in the mid- to late-1990s; Farmington Hills virus associated with outbreaks in Europe and the United States in 2002 and in 2004; and Hunter virus which was associated with outbreaks in Europe, Japan, and Australasia. In 2006, there was another large increase in NoV infection around the globe.[31] Reports have shown a link between the expression of human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) and the susceptibility to norovirus infection. Studies have suggested the capsid of noroviruses may have evolved from selective pressure of human HBGAs.[32] HBGAs are not, however, the receptor or facilitator of norovirus infection. Co-factors such as bile salts may facilitate the infection, making it more intense when introduced during or after the initial infection of the host tissue.[33] Bile salts are produced by the liver in response to eating fatty foods, and they help with the absorption of consumed lipids. It is not yet clear at what specific point in the Norovirus replication cycle bile salts facilitate infection: penetration, uncoating, or maintaining capsid stability.[33] The protein MDA-5 may be the primary immune sensor that detects the presence of noroviruses in the body.[34] Some people have common variations of the MDA-5 gene that could make them more susceptible to norovirus infection.[35] Viruses in Norovirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral geometries. Capsid diameters vary widely, from 23 to 40 nm in diameter. The larger capsids (38–40 nm) exhibit T=3 symmetry and are composed of 180 VP1 proteins. Small capsids (23 nm) show T=1 symmetry, and are composed of 60 VP1 proteins.[36] The virus particles demonstrate an amorphous surface structure when visualized using electron microscopy.[37] Noroviruses contain a linear, non-segmented,[36] positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kilobases, encoding a large polyprotein which is cleaved into six smaller non-structural proteins (NS1/2 to NS7)[38] by the viral 3C-like protease (NS6), a major structural protein (VP1) of about 58~60 kDa and a minor capsid protein (VP2).[39] The most variable region of the viral capsid is the P2 domain, which contains antigen-presenting sites and carbohydrate-receptor binding regions.[40][41][42][43][44] Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 last shared a common ancestor in AD 867.[45] The group 2 and group 4 viruses last shared a common ancestor in approximately AD 1443 (95% highest posterior density AD 1336–1542).[46] Several estimates of the evolution rate have been made varying from 8.98 × 10−3 to 2.03 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year.[citation needed] The estimated mutation rate (1.21×10−2 to 1.41 ×10−2 substitutions per site per year) in this virus is high even compared with other RNA viruses.[47] In addition, a recombination hotspot exists at the ORF1-ORF2 (VP1) junction.[48] Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Positive-stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of replication. Translation takes place by leaky scanning and RNA termination-reinitiation. Humans and other mammals serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are fecal-oral and contamination.[36] When a person becomes infected with norovirus, the virus replicates within the small intestine. The principal symptom is acute gastroenteritis, characterized by nausea, forceful vomiting, watery diarrhea, and abdominal pain, that develops between 12 and 48 hours after exposure and lasts for 24–72 hours.[49] Sometimes there is loss of taste, general lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, cough, and/or low-grade fever. The disease is usually self-limiting.[citation needed] Severe illness is rare; although people are frequently treated at the emergency ward, they are rarely admitted to the hospital. The number of deaths from norovirus in the United States is estimated to be around 570–800[50] each year, with most of these occurring in the very young, the elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems. Symptoms may become life-threatening in these groups if dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is ignored or left untreated.[51] Specific diagnosis of norovirus is routinely made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays or quantitative PCR assays, which give results within a few hours. These assays are very sensitive and can detect as few as 10 virus particles.[52] Tests such as ELISA that use antibodies against a mixture of norovirus strains are available commercially, but lack specificity and sensitivity.[53] After infection, immunity to the same strain of the virus – the genotype – protects against reinfection for between six months to two years.[54] This immunity does not fully protect against infection with the other diverse genotypes of the virus.[54] In Canada, norovirus is a notifiable disease.[55] In both the US and the UK it is not notifiable.[56][57] Hand washing with soap and water is an effective method for reducing the transmission of norovirus pathogens. Alcohol rubs (≥62% isopropyl alcohol) may be used as an adjunct, but are less effective than hand-washing, as norovirus lacks a lipid viral envelope.[58] Surfaces where norovirus particles may be present can be sanitised with a solution of 1.5% to 7.5% of household bleach in water, or other disinfectants effective against norovirus.[49][59][60] In healthcare environments, the prevention of nosocomial infections involves routine and terminal cleaning. Nonflammable alcohol vapor in CO2 systems is used in health care environments where medical electronics would be adversely affected by aerosolized chlorine or other caustic compounds.[61] In 2011, the CDC published a clinical practice guideline addressing strategies for the prevention and control of norovirus gastroenteritis outbreaks in healthcare settings.[62][63] Based on a systematic review of published scientific studies, the guideline presents 51 specific evidence-based recommendations, which were organized into 12 categories: 1) patient cohorting and isolation precautions, 2) hand hygiene, 3) patient transfer and ward closure, 4) food handlers in healthcare, 5) diagnostics, 6) personal protective equipment, 7) environmental cleaning, 8) staff leave and policy, 9) visitors, 10) education, 11) active case-finding, and 12) communication and notification. The guideline also identifies eight high-priority recommendations and suggests several areas in need of future research.[citation needed] LigoCyte announced in 2007 that it was working on a vaccine and had started phase 1 trials.[64] The company has since been taken over by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company.[65] As of 2019[update], a bivalent (NoV GI.1/GII.4) intramuscular vaccine had completed phase 1 trials.[66][67] In 2020 the phase 2b trials were finished.[68][69] The vaccine relies on using a virus-like particle that is made of the norovirus capsid proteins in order to mimic the external structure of the virus. Since there is no RNA in this particle, it is incapable of reproducing and cannot cause an infection.[64] The norovirus can survive for long periods outside a human host depending on the surface and temperature conditions: it can survive for weeks on hard and soft surfaces,[70] and it can survive for months, maybe even years in contaminated still water.[71] A 2006 study found the virus remained on surfaces used for food preparation seven days after contamination.[72] Routine protocols to detect norovirus in clams and oysters by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction are being employed by governmental laboratories such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US.[73] There is no specific medicine to treat people with norovirus illness. Norovirus infection cannot be treated with antibiotics because it is a virus. Treatments aim to avoid complications by measures such as the management of dehydration caused by fluid loss in vomiting and diarrhea,[5] and to mitigate symptoms using antiemetics and antidiarrheals.[74] Norovirus causes about 18% of all cases of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. It is relatively common in developed countries and in low-mortality developing countries (20% and 19% respectively) compared to high-mortality developing countries (14%). Proportionately it causes more illness in people in the community or in hospital outpatients (24% and 20% respectively) as compared with hospital inpatients (17%) in whom other causes are more common.[76] Age and emergence of new norovirus strains do not appear to affect the proportion of gastroenteritis attributable to norovirus.[76] In the United States, the estimated annual number of norovirus cases in 2023[update] was 21 million,[77] representing a rate of 6,270 cases per 100,000 individuals. Norovirus is a common cause of epidemics of gastroenteritis on cruise ships. The CDC, through its Vessel Sanitation Program, records and investigates outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness – mostly caused by norovirus – on cruise ships with both a US and foreign itinerary;[78] there were 12 in 2015, and 10 from 1 January to 9 May 2016. An outbreak may affect over 25% of passengers, and a smaller proportion of crew members.[79] Epidemiological studies have shown that individuals with different ABO(H) (histo-blood group) phenotypes are infected with NoV strains in a genotype-specific manner.[80][81] GII.4 includes global epidemic strains and binds to more histo-blood group antigens than other genogroups.[80] FUT2 fucosyltransferase transfers a fucose sugar to the end of the ABO(H) precursor in gastrointestinal cells and saliva glands. The ABH-antigen produced is thought to act as a receptor for human norovirus: A non-functional fucosyltransferase FUT2 provides high protection from the most common norovirus strain, GII.4.[82] Homozygous carriers of any nonsense mutation in the FUT2 gene are called non-secretors, as no ABH-antigen is produced. Approximately 20% of Caucasians are non-secretors due to G428A and C571T nonsense mutations in FUT2 and therefore have strong – although not absolute – protection from the norovirus GII.4.[83] Non-secretors can still produce ABH antigens in erythrocytes, as the precursor is formed by FUT1.[80] Some norovirus genotypes (GI.3) can infect non-secretors.[84] The norovirus was originally named the \"Norwalk agent\" after Norwalk, Ohio, in the United States, where an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred among children at Bronson Elementary School in November 1968. In 1972, electron microscopy on stored human stool samples identified a virus, which was given the name \"Norwalk virus\". Numerous outbreaks with similar symptoms have been reported since. The cloning and sequencing of the Norwalk virus genome showed that these viruses have a genomic organization consistent with viruses belonging to the family Caliciviridae.[85] The name \"norovirus\" (Norovirus for the genus) was approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) in 2002.[86] In 2011, however, a press release and a newsletter were published by ICTV, which strongly encouraged the media, national health authorities, and the scientific community to use the virus name Norwalk virus, rather than the genus name Norovirus when referring to outbreaks of the disease. This was also a public response by ICTV to the request from an individual in Japan to rename the Norovirus genus because of the possibility of negative associations for people in Japan and elsewhere who have the family name \"Noro\". Before this position of ICTV was made public, ICTV consulted widely with members of the Caliciviridae Study Group and carefully discussed the case.[87] In addition to \"Norwalk agent\" and \"Norwalk virus\", the virus has also been called \"Norwalk-like virus\", \"small, round-structured viruses\" (SRSVs), Spencer flu, and \"Snow Mountain virus\".[88] Common names of the illness caused by noroviruses still in use include \"Roskilde illness\", \"winter vomiting disease\",[89] \"winter vomiting bug\",[90][91] \"viral gastroenteritis\", and \"acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis\".[51]",

He played college football for the Stanford Cardinal and was drafted by the Eagles in the sixth round of the 2023 NFL draft. McKee attended Centennial High School in Corona, California. He played in the 2018 U.S. Army All-American Bowl and 2018 Polynesian Bowl, where he was named MVP.[1][2] McKee committed to Stanford University to play college football.[3] McKee spent two years on a mission in Brazil for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints before playing at Stanford.[4][5][6] His first season with the team was 2020, in which he played in one game, completing three passes for 62 yards against the then 12th-ranked Oregon Ducks. McKee competed with Jack West for the starting job in 2021. Although West started during the season opener against the Kansas State Wildcats, McKee still attempted 18 passes, completing 15 of them for 118 yards and a touchdown.[7] He was named the starter for the following week's game against the USC Trojans.[8][9] In just his 4th collegiate start, McKee led the unranked Cardinal to a miraculous upset victory against the #3 ranked Oregon Ducks, throwing 3 touchdowns and spearheading an 87-yard game-tying drive at the end of the 4th quarter.[10] McKee was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the sixth round, 188th overall, of the 2023 NFL draft.[13] He made his NFL debut in Week 17 of 2024 against the Dallas Cowboys in relief of Kenny Pickett, he threw for 54 yards and 2 touchdowns in the 41–7 win.[14] He connected with AJ Brown and DeVonta Smith for his first and second touchdowns, respectively.",

The one exception comes in their quarterback room, where Philadelphia is dealing with a slew of injuries. In a crucial divisional matchup last week, star quarterback Jalen Hurts was lit up on a scramble and left the game with a concussion. He was unable to clear concussion protocol ahead of Week 17, making him unavailable for the Eagles' game against the Cowboys. Kenny Pickett filled in for Hurts last week and got the call this Sunday, but Pickett's first start of the season didn't last long, as he took a shot to the ribs in the third quarter which forced him to exit the game. With both Hurts and Pickett sidelined, the Eagles turned to second-year quarterback Tanner McKee. This marked McKee's first appearance in a regular season game of his young career. McKee played admirably against the Cowboys and even cemented himself in the NFL \"history book\" of obscure stats.

NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule McKee was the Eagles' 6th-round selection in the 2023 draft out of Stanford University. Before today, McKee had only seen NFL playing time in the preseason, where he went 34-of-56 for 296 passing yards in three games during the 2024 preseason. A native of Irvine, Calif., McKee spent the entirety of his football career in the Sunshine State prior to being drafted by the Eagles. Outside of football, McKee most notably spent two years on mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints before joining the football team at Stanford. Even with two years away from the game, McKee is still just 24 and in the second year of his NFL career. Prior to being drafted by the Eagles, McKee spent his collegiate career with the Stanford Cardinal. He appeared in 23 games for the Cardinal before declaring for the 2023 NFL Draft. MORE NFL WEEK 17: McKee didn't get much of a chance to play in his first collegiate season, but he went on to win the starting job in his sophomore year. He took off from there, throwing for a combined 5,274 yards and 28 touchdowns in his final two seasons. McKee's collegiate career was highlighted by an upset victory over the No. 3 ranked Oregon Ducks in his sophomore season. Unfortunately, he was not able to lead the Cardinal to a bowl game in his two seasons as the primary starter at Stanford.

                "title": "Why Eagles Tanner McKee was a Brazil media star ahead of Packers game",
                "content": "SAO PAULO, Brazil − The Eagles held a press conference for Brazilian media members Thursday, featuring some of their key players like quarterback Jalen Hurts and running back Saquon Barkley. But it was Eagles' third-string quarterback Tanner McKee, who has never played a down in an NFL game, who stole the proverbial show. ON THE SCENE:It's Day 1 in São Paulo, Brazil, for Eagles: Here are writer Martin Frank's observations SUPER BOWL OR SUPER BUST?5 things that can propel Eagles to the Super Bowl this season. This rookie will be key McKee was already well known in Brazil because he spent nearly two years in the South American country, from 2018-20, on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-Day Saints. He became fluent in Portuguese during that time. And it made the media's day when McKee took a question in Portuguese from a reporter, then answered in Portuguese, then translated it into English, even though the NFL had supplied a translator. This is how the exchange went after the question came in: McKee said to the crowd of about 50 media members: \"You want me to do it in Portuguese?\" The translator said the question in English: \"Basically, we wanted (to know what it’s like) to be back in Brazil again and be back here after years of living here.\" McKee responded: \"So you want me to say it in Portuguese and you’ll translate it? I can translate for myself.\" After a long answer in Portuguese, McKee says in English: “It’s great to be back.\" Then there was a long pause for effect, followed by laughter, before McKee continued: \"It’s pretty fun because I always try to keep up with my Portuguese. I try to say things on Whatsapp or Instagram with people that I’ve met and had friendships with down here. \"But it’s different (today) because we can actually talk to someone face to face. I have family that’s here. My wife’s here. My parents are here. And they’re going to Rio and places that I lived and served in … So it’s really fun to just kind of be back in the culture.\" McKee was asked another question in Portuguese about some players' fears about crime in Brazil, which has been reported over the past week. And if McKee has talked to those players to allay their fears. Again, McKee answered in Portuguese, then translated for himself: \"I was just saying, a lot of guys haven’t been here before, so it’s a lot of things they don’t really know. So they’re asking me, 'How’s the crime rate? How’s this?' We have a lot of things that we do whenever we travel to any city: We’re going to have to be safe. We’re not going to walk out on the street, whether we’re in the United States or outside of the United States. \"It’s not necessarily specific to here. It’s just a) people don’t really know the culture, and b) it is a big city … The people are great. The (players) are excited for the game. There’s nothing to be scared of. It’s pretty cool.\" The Brazilian media also asked McKee a football question, about what the offense will look like under new coordinator Kellen Moore. And here, McKee provided some clues for what the offense might look like Friday night. \"A lot of pre-snap motion, a lot of changing things on defense,\" he said. \"I think it is more quarterback friendly of just being able to go through progressions. I think with football, we have a lot of good players, and you don’t want to slow down by having to think too much. \"You just want to go out and play fast, and have a kind of clean edge and go out and play. I think that’s kind of what they’re giving us this year – go out and play football, let’s not over-complicate things ... We’re going to run what we run. I’m just excited to see it, and I’m just as excited for you guys to see AJ (Brown) and (DeVonta Smith) and Jalen and Saquon go do their thing.\" Contact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.

The 32-year-old scored his 20th goal of the campaign in all competitions, becoming the first Reds player to hit that mark in eight consecutive seasons. He also provided two assists, the first an audacious double nutmeg for Cody Gakpo’s goal and a second to tee up Diogo Jota for goal number five, all just three days before he will be free to start negotiating with overseas clubs about a potential move in the summer. Trent Alexander Arnold, another of the three key players out of contract at the end of the season along with captain Virgil van Dijk, chipped in with the fourth, all after Luis Diaz had got the ball rolling for the rampant Reds. Another comprehensive win for Arne Slot’s side, against a predictably outclassed West Ham, left them eight points clear at the top of the Premier League and another step closer to a first title in five years. Record-breaking Mohamed Salah inspires Liverpool with latest five-star display 20:03 , Jamie Braidwood Joe Gomez is set for a spell on the sidelines as Liverpool were hit by an injury blow during the 5-0 win over West Ham. Gomez injured his hamstring and pulled up during a sprint in the first half. He was replaced by Jarell Quansah after signalling to come off. The 27-year-old had been filling in for the injured Ibrahima Konate, who was been out since the win over Real Madrid last month. But Gomez’s hamstring injury means Quansah is likely to be required alongside Virgil van Dijk against Manchester United on Sunday and leaves Liverpool with just two fit centre-backs heading into a busy month. Joe Gomez injury update as Liverpool defender set for spell out 19:51 , Jamie Braidwood Arne Slot is asked whether Mohamed Salah is the best player in the world after reaching 17 goals and 13 assists for the season. “If you look at his numbers, you can’t argue that, but there are different players in different leagues that have a lot of quality,” he told Sky. “But Mo is definitely up there at the moment. He could have scored more today, but I also liked his work rate for the team without the ball. “He’s in a very good place. Let’s hope he can stay like this for a long time.” 19:47 , Jamie Braidwood Mohamed Salah said he and Liverpool remain “far away” from agreeing a contract after inspiring the Reds to a 5-0 win at West Ham and continuing his remarkable season. Salah scored and set up two more goals as Liverpool went eight points clear at the top of the Premier League, in what was his last match before he is able to talk to foreign clubs on January 1. The 32-year-old has scored 17 Premier League goals and has made 13 assists in just 18 games this campaign, and has also now reached 20 goals in all competitions for the eight season in a row for Liverpool. Mohamed Salah reveals Liverpool contract latest after setting Premier League record 19:27 , Jamie Braidwood Mohamed Salah, speaking to Sky Sports: “I’m glad for the result. We scored early and dominated the game, this is good. The first nutmeg I was lucky, the second one I did mean.” On heading towards a Ballon d’Or season? “The only thing in my mind is for Liverpool to win the league and be a part of that. I will do my best for us to win the trophy. We just need to stay focused and humble and go again. “I’m just trying to enjoy the game. I’m disappointed with a few missed chances but we came here to win and that’s the most important thing. I’m always hungry for more. Latest on his contract. Are we close to good news? “We are far away from that but I don’t want to put something in the media. It’s nothing really, move on. I want Liverpool to win the Premier League.” 19:20 , Jamie Braidwood Arsenal and Chelsea still have to play this round, but that means Liverpool have currently played the same number of games as their London rivals. The result is the Reds are nine points clear of Arsenal and 10 ahead of Chelsea. Their closest challengers are Nottingham Forest (eight behind), while Manchester City are 14 back. 19:17 , Jamie Braidwood It feels like Mohamed Salah is setting a new record every week this season. Is he heading for one of the best campaigns in Premier League history? 19:14 , Jamie Braidwood Next up for Liverpool and Mohamed Salah? They host 14th-placed Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday after putting six past Tottenham, three past Leicester and five past West Ham over Christmas. 19:10 , Jamie Braidwood It will be a happy new year for Liverpool as the move EIGHT points clear at the top of the table. Boos from the remaining West Ham fans as they concede five to Liverpool for the second time this season. 19:09 , Jamie Braidwood 90+3 mins: The away end is celebrating Liverpool entering 2025 at the top of the Premier League. Arne Slot’s team are going to take some stopping. In the dying moments, Luis Guilherme’s strikes the post with a curling shot. West Ham have been thoroughly second best, but they have hit the post three times! 19:06 , Jamie Braidwood 90 mins: No prizes for picking the player of the match: it’s Salah. A goal, two assists and three points for Liverpool. We’re into four minutes added on. 19:00 , Jamie Braidwood Another for Liverpool! They put five past West Ham for the second time this season. It’s a goal for Diogo Jota, but it’s incredible from Salah again. He dances through the West Ham defence, who can’t get near him. Salah sets up Jota and the first-time finish flies past Areola. Salah is up to 17 goals and 13 assists in the Premier League this season, and it’s December. 18:56 , Jamie Braidwood 80 mins: West Ham were four unbeaten before today but the pressure will be back on Julen Lopetegui once again at full-time. West Ham have already lost 5-1 to Liverpool this season, as well as 5-2 to Arsenal, 4-1 to Tottenham, 3-1 to Man City and 3-0 to Chelsea. Apart from the Spurs game and previous defeat to Liverpool in the cup, they’ve all been at home, too. 18:53 , Jamie Braidwood 77 mins: Another chance for Salah! Expertly picked out by Alexander-Arnold, Salah smashes the shot over the bar on the half-volley. At the other end, Kudus shoots and his deflected shot misses Wan-Bissaka at the back post and drifts wide. 18:51 , Jamie Braidwood 75mins: A bit better from West Ham, and Kudus hits the woodwork for the second time! His header strikes the crossbar. The flag was up anyway, but it looked close. Liverpool haven’t kept a clean sheet away from home in the Premier League since October so they will want to hold on here. 18:48 , Jamie Braidwood 71 mins: Diogo Jota looks hungry to get in on the action. He is denied by Areola, after a weak punch from the goalkeeper. Tsimikas and Elliott are next on for Liverpool. Off come Robertson and Jones. 18:46 , Jamie Braidwood 70 mins: Salah is now up into the top 10 of all-time Premier League assists, too. He passes David Beckham and is only 11 behind Steven Gerrard. 18:42 , Jamie Braidwood 66 mins: Penalty? There are faint appeals from West Ham as Summerville looks to beat Quansah around the outside and goes down under some pressure. Nothing given. Salah curls one wide at the other end - still plenty of goals in this for Liverpool if they want it. 18:38 , Jamie Braidwood 63 mins: A message from Trent Alexander-Arnold as he celebrated his goal? It’s walking football from Liverpool now. 18:35 , Jamie Braidwood 59 mins: To add to West Ham’s gloom, Jarrod Bowen is forced off following a challenge from Mac Allister. Summerville is on. 18:33 , Jamie Braidwood 58 mins: Changes: Gravenberch and Gakpo were a yellow card away from missing the match against Manchester United on Sunday - so with Liverpool 4-0 up, off they come. Endo and Jota are on for the Reds. 18:29 , Jamie Braidwood And now one for Alexander-Arnold! There’s a huge deflection and Liverpool are running riot now. West Ham back off as Alexander-Arnold lines up the shot from 20 yards out. His strike whacks off Max Kilman’s head and beats Alphonse Areola. Alexander-Arnold’s first of the season. 18:25 , Jamie Braidwood 50 mins: Salah’s eyes light up again as Gakpo brings it down and plays him through. Salah takes it early on his right foot and slices well wide. West Ham have switched to five at the back but they are still so easy to play against. 18:23 , Jamie Braidwood 46 mins: CHANCE! Already an opportunity for Salah, as Mac Allister plays the through pass and Salah is released. He looked offside but Todibo was sleeping and playing him on. It almost looked as if Salah was expecting the flag to come but it didn’t, and his shot is easily saved. 18:20 , Jamie Braidwood Back underway! West Ham make two changes with Coufal and Alvarez hooked and Todibo and Fullkrug brought on. There could be more history for Salah in this season half. He is looking to become the first player to score multiple goals in four consecutive Premier League away appearances. He scored twice at Tottenham, twice at Newcastle and twice at Southampton, and is now one away from another record. 18:14 , Jamie Braidwood Salah’s assist for Gakpo’s goal, and Liverpool’s second, involved a stunning turn in the box and nutmeg on Mavropanos. But did he mean it? 18:11 , Jamie Braidwood Salah is up to 17 Premier League goals and 12 Premeir League assists for the season. Is Thierry Henry’s 20-20 season now in sight? Surely. Good news for FPL managers, too. 18:09 , Jamie Braidwood With another goal and assist today, Salah becomes the first player in Premier League history to both score and assist in eight games in a season. Bruno Fernandes, Harry Kane, Robin Van Persie, Thierry Henry and Alan Shearer previously held the record with seven in a season - Salah has broken it in just 18 games. 18:06 , Jamie Braidwood Liverpool lead at the break thanks to goals from their front three, Diaz, Gakpo and, of course, Mohamed Salah. West Ham had actually come close to equalising when Kudus hit the post, but quickfire goals before half time means the Reds are heading eight points clear at the top. There are boos from the West Ham fans at half time and plenty of empty seats - but the story here is once again Salah after another incredible half. His stunning season continues. 18:04 , Jamie Braidwood 45+1 mins: Liverpool go hunting for another and Salah has the chance to grab his second as he races around the outside of the West Ham defence on the break. Areola stands tall at his front post. 17:59 , Jamie Braidwood INCREDIBLE FROM SALAH! He reaches 20 goals for the season in style, with a third to put Liverpool on their way to extending their lead! It’s an easy goal for Liverpool to score. The Reds win it back and Jones finds Salah in space. The Premeir League’s top scorer stands up Kilman in the box, and finds the reverse finish into the bottom corner. Stunning. 17:56 , Jamie Braidwood Gakpo with the goal, but it’s magic from Salah! Liverpool double their lead! Diaz is released down the right, with Salah staying away despite being offside. When it breaks to Salah in the box, he steps away from Mavropanos with a lovely feint and pokes it through to Gakpo. The Dutchman pokes in to double Liverpool’s lead, moments after Kudus went close! 17:54 , Jamie Braidwood 38 mins; POST! Ooof. Kudus is having a half. Liverpool back off and Kudus tries his luck from 20 yards, but a cracking strike clips the inside of the post and stays out. Alisson was beaten. 17:53 , Jamie Braidwood 36 mins: Joe Gomez is going to be forced off, with Jarell Quansah coming on. A blow for Liverpool, who don’t have too many injuries at the moment but are missing Ibrahima Konate. 17:51 , Jamie Braidwood 34 mins: West Ham look for a quick response. There’s a wonderful touch on the right from Kudus, and he then finds Paqueta with the cross. Paqueta gets his head on it, under pressure from Van Dijk, but Alisson collects. Soler, meanwhile, was appealing for a penalty after going to ground under the challenge of Mac Allister. Nothing given. 17:45 , Jamie Braidwood Oh that is so clinical from Luis Diaz! Liverpool lead and it’s been coming. The Colombian picked up the ball in a dangerous position on the edge of the box. There’s a touch of fortune as he looks for Gakpo and the ball rebounds off Coufal, but Diaz is there to slam the finish past Areola. Another productive trip to London after also opening the scoring at Tottenham. 17:43 , Jamie Braidwood 26 mins: Kudus gets the West Ham fans going with a strong run through midfield. It ends up with West Ham corner, which Joe Gomez disagrees with. Alisson is strong to punch it away. 17:38 , Jamie Braidwood 22 mins: SAVE! More action for Areola. Diaz is sharp and lively as ever as he cuts inside Mavropanos and fires at goal. The keeper is quick to tip the shot over the bar. 17:35 , Jamie Braidwood 19 mins: It’s quiet at the London Stadium - reflecting Liverpool’s control here. Mac Allister almost plays in Salah but Diaz actually breaks it up by trying to control on his head. 17:32 , Jamie Braidwood 15 mins: Chance! Lovely Liverpool move, inspired once again by Salah. It’s his slipped pass that releases Curtis Jones and Areola has to save with his legs as the midfielder looked for the first-time finish back across goal. A good run from Jones. Areola, busy so far, got out well. 17:28 , Jamie Braidwood 12 mins: Liverpool have been on top since those two chances in quick succession. The Reds aren’t afraid to go long under Arne Slot, with Gakpo the target on the left. 17:24 , Jamie Braidwood 8 mins: MISS! How are Liverpool not ahead! It’s a mess from West Ham playing out from the back. Liverpool pinch it and Salah looks for Gakpo at the back post, but the forward misses the cross! 17:22 , Jamie Braidwood 7 mins: SAVE! Right down the other end, Salah is denied by Areola! Stunning move from Liverpool as Gakpo finds a brilliant pass into the box. Salah has the target in sight by Areola saves high to his left, as Salah looked for the near post. 17:21 , Jamie Braidwood 6 mins: CHANCE! An opening for West Ham as Robertson is caught by Kudus. It’s played wide to Bowen who crosses back to Paqueta, but the Brazilian slips at the vital moment and slices wide. 17:20 , Jamie Braidwood 4 mins: A first chance for Salah on the left edge of the box, but Wan-Bissaka shuts down the danger. Alexander-Arnold swings in a cross but West Ham can clear. 17:16 , Jamie Braidwood 1 min: Wan-Bissaka is playing at left back today, with Emerson pushed into left wing. West Ham deploying two full-backs in an attempt to stop leading scorer Mohamed Salah? 17:15 , Jamie Braidwood Underway in London as the bubbles clear from the pitch. 17:13 , Jamie Braidwood Here we go! The players are out at the London Stadium as Liverpool aim to go eight points clear at the top of the table. West Ham beat the league’s bottom side Southampton 1-0 on Boxing Day. They now face the leaders, who have not lost away from home this season under Arne Slot. 17:10 , Jamie Braidwood It was this fixture last season where Mohamed Salah and Jurgen Klopp had their touchline bust-up, as Liverpool’s title challenge faltered. Salah could instead become the first player to score multiple goals in four consecutive Premier League away appearances. He scored twice at Tottenham, twice at Newcastle and twice at Southampton - and is the third player to do so in three in a row, after Dennis Bergkamp in 1997 and Harry Kane in 2017. 17:07 , Jamie Braidwood Nottingham Forest are up to second in the Premier League after a 2-0 win over Everton at Goodison Park. Nuno’s side go ahead of Chelsea and Arsenal, and are currently Liverpool’s closest challengers five points off the summit. Crystal Palace 2-1 Southampton Everton 0-2 Nottingham Forest Fulham 2-2 Bournemouth Leicester 0-2 Manchester City Tottenham 2-2 Wolves 16:06 , Jamie Braidwood Just the one change for Liverpool from the 3-1 win over Boxing Day as Luis Diaz replaces Darwin Nunez. West Ham make four changes and look like they are setting up with a back-five as Vladimir Coufal starts in a defence that includes Max Kilman. Carlos Soler is also fit to start and joins Lucas Pacqueta and Edson Alvarez in midfield, leaving Jarrod Bowen and Mohammed Kudus as the front two. Alphonse Areola replaces the injured Lukasz Fabianski in goal. 16:00 , Jamie Braidwood West Ham XI: Areola; Coufal, Wan-Bissaka, Mavropanos, Kilman, Emerson; Alvarez, Soler, Paqueta; Kudus, Bowen Subs: Foderingham, Cresswell, Summerville, Fullkrug, Guilherme, Ings, Todibo, Irving, Scarles Liverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson; MacAllister, Gravenberch, Jones; Gakpo, Diaz, Salah Subs: Kelleher, Endo, Nunez, Elliott, Jota, Tsimikas, McConnell, Danns, Quansah 15:01 , Jamie Braidwood Viewers in the United Kingdom can watch the match live on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League.

A much-needed win for the Hammers at Southampton on Boxing Day, courtesy of Jarrod Bowen’s goal, moved Julen Lopetegui’s side up to 13th in the table. Liverpool, meanwhile, extended their lead at the top of the table after coming from behind to beat Leicester at Anfield. Mohamed Salah scored his 16th league goal of the season in the win against Leicester, yet this is his last game before he can start talking to foreign clubs about leaving Anfield.",

                "content": "Baker Reagan Mayfield (born April 14, 1995)[1] is an American professional football quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). After beginning his college football career with the Texas Tech Red Raiders, Mayfield played for the Oklahoma Sooners, where he was the first walk-on player to win the Heisman Trophy in 2017.[2][3][4][5] He was selected first overall by the Cleveland Browns in the 2018 NFL draft. Mayfield set the NFL rookie quarterback record for passing touchdowns during his first season, along with ending a 19-game winless streak for the Browns in his debut. His most successful season with the franchise was in 2020 when he led the Browns to their first playoff appearance since 2002 and first playoff victory since 1994. Due to a performance decline and conflict with Browns management, Mayfield was traded from Cleveland in 2022, spending the year with the Carolina Panthers and Los Angeles Rams. Mayfield joined the Buccaneers ahead of the 2023 season, leading the team to a division title and a playoff victory and earning Pro Bowl honors. Baker Reagan Mayfield was born on April 14, 1995, in Austin, Texas, to James and Gina Mayfield as the younger of two sons.[1][6] James, a private equity consultant, encountered financial difficulties during his younger son's senior year in high school. These struggles forced the Mayfields to sell their home and live in rental homes.[6] Mayfield was given his distinctive name, Baker, which was his mother's idea, under the condition by his father that he also be named after the 40th U.S. President Ronald Reagan, which became his middle name.[7] Mayfield grew up as a fan of the University of Oklahoma; he attended a number of their games during his childhood.[4] His father played football for three years for the University of Houston, though he never lettered.[6] Mayfield was the starting quarterback for the Lake Travis High School Cavaliers football team in Austin.[8] He led Lake Travis to a 25–2 record in two seasons and won the 2011 4A State Championship.[8] He finished his high school football career totaling 6,255 passing yards, 67 touchdowns, and eight interceptions.[1] He was offered scholarships by Washington State, Rice, New Mexico and Florida Atlantic.[9] Mayfield said \"I easily could've gone to a place like Florida Atlantic, but my dad pushed me to realize that my dream was to play somewhere big.\" He chose to go to Texas Tech, where he was a walk-on.[10] Sources: Shortly before the start of the 2013 season, Mayfield was named as the starting quarterback following a back injury to projected starter and former Lake Travis quarterback Michael Brewer.[11] Mayfield was the first walk-on true freshman quarterback to start an FBS season opener at the quarterback position.[6] In his first start against SMU, Mayfield passed for 413 yards and four touchdowns. His 43 completions of 60 attempts broke a school record held by Billy Joe Tolliver, and fell only four completions short of the NCAA Division I FBS single-game record for completions by a freshman, held by Luke McCown.[12][13] For his performance, Mayfield was named Big 12 Conference Offensive Player of the Week – the first freshman Texas Tech quarterback to be named so since former Red Raider head coach Kliff Kingsbury in 1999.[14] The game featured the last four former Lake Travis quarterbacks combined on both teams: Garrett Gilbert, Michael Brewer, Collin Lagasse, and Mayfield.[15] Following the Red Raiders' second victory over Stephen F. Austin, Mayfield's 780 season yards and seven touchdowns already exceeded the 755 yards and six touchdowns accrued by Texas Tech's last true freshman quarterback, Aaron Keesee, in 10 games.[16] After being affected by a knee injury and losing the starting job to fellow true freshman Davis Webb, Mayfield finished the season with 2,315 yards on 218-of-340 completions with 12 touchdowns and 9 interceptions.[17] Mayfield was named one of 10 semifinalists for the Burlsworth Trophy in November; the award is given to the best player in Division I football who began his college career as a walk-on.[18] Mayfield earned Big 12 Conference Freshman Offensive Player of the Year for the 2013 season.[19][20] Mayfield announced that he would be leaving the program due to a \"miscommunication\" with the coaching staff.[21][better source needed] After playing for Texas Tech, Mayfield transferred to the University of Oklahoma in January 2014, but had not contacted the Sooners coaching staff. Mayfield further elaborated in an interview with ESPN that he sought to transfer due to scholarship issues and a perception that he had earned the starting position and that further competition was not \"really fair\".[3][21] The alleged scholarship issues were denied by Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury.[22] In February 2014, Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops confirmed that Mayfield would be walking on for the Oklahoma Sooners. Mayfield was not eligible to play until the 2015 season, and he lost a season of eligibility due to Big 12 Conference transfer rules following an unsuccessful appeal of his transfer restrictions.[23] On August 24, 2015, Mayfield was named the starting quarterback for the Sooners after winning an open quarterback competition against Trevor Knight.[24] On September 6, 2015, Mayfield started against Akron. Mayfield totaled 388 passing yards with three passing touchdowns on 23 completions in the 41–3 win.[25] In the second game of the 2015 season, Mayfield started at Tennessee at Neyland Stadium. The Sooners were ranked 19th at the time and the Volunteers were ranked 23rd. Mayfield started off very slow in the game, not even reaching midfield until the 13-minute mark of the fourth quarter. Oklahoma came back from a 17-point deficit to win the game by a score of 31–24 in double overtime. Mayfield threw for 187 yards and three touchdowns on 19 completions while throwing two interceptions early in the game.[26] In the third game of the season, Mayfield started against Tulsa. He had a career day, throwing for 487 yards and four touchdowns, including 316 yards in the first half. Mayfield also ran for 85 yards and two touchdowns in the 52–38 win.[27][28] Mayfield finished the year with 3,700 passing yards, 36 touchdowns, and seven interceptions, a résumé which propelled him to fourth place in voting for the Heisman Trophy.[29] Mayfield helped lead Oklahoma to the 2015 Orange Bowl, which served as the semifinal for the 2015 College Football Playoff. However, Oklahoma lost to Clemson by a score of 37–17.[30] Mayfield started off the 2016 season with 323 passing yards and two touchdowns in a 33–23 loss to #15 Houston.[31] In the rivalry game against Texas on October 8, he had 390 passing yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 45–40 victory.[32] On October 22, in a 66–59 victory over Texas Tech, Mayfield had 545 passing yards and seven touchdowns in a historic matchup against future NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Mahomes tallied 734 passing yards and five touchdowns to go along with Mayfield's numbers in a game that broke various single-game passing records.[33] Over the final five games of the regular season, Mayfield totaled 1,321 passing yards, 15 passing touchdowns, and three interceptions, to go along with three rushing touchdowns. All five games were victories for the Sooners.[34] In December 2016, it was announced that Mayfield and his top receiving target, Dede Westbrook, would be finalists for the 2016 Heisman Trophy. It was also announced that they would play in the 2017 Sugar Bowl.[35] Mayfield ended up finishing third in the Heisman voting.[36] In the 2017 Sugar Bowl, Mayfield helped lead the Sooners to a 35–19 victory over Auburn. He finished the game with 19 completions on 28 attempts for 296 passing yards and two touchdowns, earning him the MVP award.[37] On September 9, 2017, after a win against the Ohio State Buckeyes in Columbus, Mayfield planted the Sooners' flag in the middle of the painted \"O\" at Ohio Stadium, causing a major public backlash.[38][39] Mayfield issued an apology shortly afterwards.[39] On November 4, 2017, Mayfield threw for a school-high 598 yards against in-state rival Oklahoma State.[40] Mayfield finished 24-for-36 with five passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown, and Oklahoma won the game by a score of 62–52.[41][42] Mayfield completed his career 3–0 as the starting Oklahoma quarterback in the Bedlam Series.[41] In November 2017, Mayfield was under fire again after an interaction during the game against Kansas. After Kansas players refused to shake his hand pregame, and following a cheap shot by a Kansas defender, Mayfield was seen grabbing his crotch and mouthing \"Fuck you!\" at the Kansas coach on the sideline, and told the fans to \"Go cheer on basketball.\"[43] In response, Mayfield issued another public apology.[44] Days after the 41–3 victory over Kansas, Sooners head coach Lincoln Riley announced that Mayfield would not start or be the captain during the upcoming game against West Virginia due to his actions against Kansas.[45] On December 2, 2017, with the return of the Big 12 Championship Game after a six-year hiatus,[46] Mayfield led Oklahoma to its third straight Big 12 championship, with Oklahoma beating the TCU Horned Frogs 41–17.[47][48] Mayfield won MVP honors while Oklahoma clinched a second playoff berth in three years.[47] A month later, the Sooners lost to the Georgia Bulldogs 54–48 in the 2018 Rose Bowl, which served as the national semifinal game.[49] On December 9, 2017, Mayfield won the 2017 Heisman Trophy with a sweeping majority.[50] He received 732 first-place votes and a total of 2,398 points.[51] This amount translated to 86% of the possible points and the third highest percentage in Heisman history.[50] In addition, Mayfield became the first and only walk-on player to ever win the Heisman Trophy.[51] When Mayfield transferred from Texas Tech to Oklahoma after his freshman year, he filed an appeal to the NCAA to allow him to be eligible to play immediately at Oklahoma on the basis that he was a walk-on and not a scholarship player at Texas Tech; therefore, the transfer rules that apply to scholarship players should not be applicable to his situation. The NCAA denied his appeal as he did not meet the criteria. Big 12 Conference rules additionally stipulate that intra-conference transfers will lose one year of eligibility over and beyond the one-year sit-out imposed by the NCAA.[52] Mayfield attempted to appeal his initial loss of eligibility to the Big 12 Conference faculty athletics representatives but was denied in September 2014.[53] Officials from Oklahoma asked Texas Tech officials to authorize Mayfield's immediate eligibility, but Texas Tech officials objected and declined the request before granting a release in July 2014.[54] Mayfield was thus forced to sit out the 2014 season, while also losing one year of eligibility, as required by the rules.[55][56] On June 1, 2016, the Big 12 faculty athletic representatives voted against a rule proposal that would have allowed walk-on players to transfer within the conference and not lose a year of eligibility. The next day, the rule proposal was amended to allow walk-on players, without a written scholarship offer from the school they are transferring from, to transfer within the conference without losing a season of eligibility. The faculty athletic representatives approved the amended proposal with a vote of 7–3. The rule change made Mayfield eligible to play for Oklahoma through the 2017 season. Texas Tech voted in favor of the rule.[57][58] The Cleveland Browns selected Mayfield with the first overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft.[61] Mayfield signed a four-year rookie contract with the Browns on July 24, 2018, with the deal worth $32.68 million in guaranteed salary.[62] Mayfield played in his first NFL game in Week 3 against the New York Jets, replacing an injured Tyrod Taylor with the Browns down 14–0. Mayfield went 17 of 23, passing for 201 yards as the Browns came back and prevailed 21–17, ending their winless streak at 19 games.[63] Mayfield became the first player since Fran Tarkenton in 1961 to come off the bench in his debut, throw for more than 200 yards, and lead his team to its first win of the season.[64] Mayfield started for the first time in the Browns' next game, making him the 30th starting quarterback for the Browns since their return to the NFL in 1999,[65] in a 45–42 overtime loss to the Oakland Raiders.[66] In Week 5, Mayfield threw for 342 passing yards and one touchdown as he earned his first victory as a Browns starter, in a 12–9 overtime win over the Baltimore Ravens.[67] In Week 10, Mayfield led the Browns to a 28–16 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. throwing for 216 yards, three touchdowns, and a passer rating of 151.2, with no turnovers.[68] The following week, Mayfield led the Browns to their first away win since 2015, against the Cincinnati Bengals. He completed 19 of 26 passes for 258 yards and four touchdowns.[69] In Week 12, in a 29–13 loss to the Houston Texans, Mayfield passed for 397 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions.[70] Mayfield bounced back in the following game, a 26–20 victory over the Carolina Panthers, going 18 of 22 for 238 passing yards and one touchdown.[71] In Week 16, Mayfield completed 27 of 37 passes for 284 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions in a 26–18 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, earning him American Football Conference (AFC) Offensive Player of the Week.[72] He also won the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week fan vote for the sixth time.[73] On December 29, Mayfield was fined $10,026 for unsportsmanlike conduct during the game. As reported by The Plain Dealer, Mayfield \"pretended to expose his private parts\" to Browns offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens after throwing a touchdown to tight end Darren Fells. Kitchens later defended the gesture as an inside joke between the two. Mayfield's agent Tom Mills said they would appeal the fine.[74] On December 30, in the regular-season finale against the Ravens' league-best defense and fellow rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson, Mayfield threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns, but his three costly interceptions — one of which came at the hands of linebacker C. J. Mosley with 1:02 left in the fourth quarter while attempting to drive the team into range of a game-winning field goal attempt — ultimately contributed to a 26–24 loss. Nonetheless, Mayfield helped lead the Browns to finish the season at 7–8–1, their best record since 2007.[75] He finished with 3,725 passing yards, and surpassed Peyton Manning and Russell Wilson for most touchdowns thrown in a rookie season with 27.[76][77] While Mayfield was considered by many to be the favorite for Offensive Rookie of the Year for 2018, the award was won by Giants running back Saquon Barkley.[78] On the annual Top 100 Players list for 2019, Mayfield's peers named him the 50th best player in the league, one spot behind teammate Myles Garrett.[79] He was named 2018 PFWA All-Rookie, the second Cleveland quarterback to receive this honor since Tim Couch in 1999.[80] In Week 1 against the Tennessee Titans, Mayfield threw for 285 yards and a touchdown. However, he also threw three fourth-quarter interceptions, one of which was returned by Malcolm Butler for a touchdown. The Browns lost 43–13.[81] After the blowout loss, Mayfield said, \"I just think everybody just needs to be more disciplined. I think everybody knows what the problem is. We'll see if it's just bad technique or just see what it is. Dumb penalties hurting ourself and then penalties on my part. Just dumb stuff.\"[82] In Week 2 against the Jets, Mayfield finished with 325 passing yards, including a quick-attack pass to Beckham that went 89 yards for a touchdown, as the Browns won 23–3.[83] In Week 4 against the Ravens, Mayfield threw for 342 yards, one touchdown, and one interception in the 40–25 win.[84] Against the San Francisco 49ers, Mayfield struggled against a stout 49ers defense, completing just 8-of-22 passes for 100 yards with two interceptions as the Browns were routed 31–3.[85] Mayfield threw two touchdown passes in a game for the first time that year in a Week 10 victory against the Buffalo Bills, completing 26 of 38 passes for 238 yards with two TDs, including the game-winner to Rashard Higgins, as the Browns snapped a four-game losing streak with a 19–16 win.[86] Four days later, against the Pittsburgh Steelers and former Big 12 Conference rival Mason Rudolph, Mayfield recorded his first career win against Pittsburgh, accounting for three total touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing), as Cleveland won 21–7.[87] In Week 12 against the Miami Dolphins, Mayfield threw for 327 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in the 41–24 victory.[88] In Week 17 against the Bengals, Mayfield became the first Cleveland Browns QB to start all 16 games in a season since Tim Couch in 2001.[89] In the game, Mayfield threw for 279 yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions as the Browns lost 33–23.[90] Mayfield finished the 2019 season with 3,827 passing yards, 22 touchdowns, and 21 interceptions as the Browns finished with a 6–10 record.[91] In Week 1 against the Ravens, Mayfield threw for 189 passing yards, a touchdown and an interception in a 38–6 loss.

His four touchdown passes all came in the first half, as the Browns defeated the Titans by a score of 41–35.[102] Mayfield's four first-half TDs tied Otto Graham for a franchise record. Mayfield came close to throwing six first-half TDs, as Peoples-Jones dropped a would-be touchdown, leading to a field goal, and running back Nick Chubb wrapped up the scoring with a one-yard run near the end of the first half after Mayfield completed a 17-yard pass play to Rashard Higgins, setting up Chubb for the score. The Browns scored on all six of their first half possessions.[103] The victory gave the Browns a 9–3 record, clinching the Browns' first winning season since 2007.[103] Mayfield was named the FedEx Air player of the week for Week 13.[104][105] In Week 14 against the Ravens, Mayfield threw for 343 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception as well as rushing for 23 yards and a touchdown during the 47–42 loss.[106] In Week 16 against the Jets, Mayfield lost a fumble on fourth down with 1:25 remaining in the game while attempting a quarterback sneak during the 23–16 loss.[107] In Week 17, Mayfield and the Browns defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 24–22 and earned their first playoff berth since 2002, at which time Mayfield was seven years old. The Browns finished the 2020 regular season 11–5.[108] In the Wild Card Round against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Mayfield went 21 of 34 for 263 yards and 3 touchdowns during the 48–37 win, leading the Browns to their first playoff victory since the 1994 season, the year before Mayfield was born. It was also the Browns' first playoff road victory in 51 years, way back in 1969.[109] In the Divisional Round of the playoffs against the Kansas City Chiefs, Mayfield threw for 204 yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 interception during the 22–17 loss.[110] Overall, Mayfield finished the 2020 season with 4,030 passing yards, 30 touchdowns, and nine interceptions through 18 total games.[111] He was ranked 71st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.[112] The Browns exercised Mayfield's fifth-year contract option for the 2022 season on April 23, 2021,[113] worth $18.9 million guaranteed.[114] On October 7, 2021, it was revealed that Mayfield was playing with a partially torn labrum which he suffered during the Browns' Week 2 victory over the Texans.[115] Mayfield continued to play with the injury until reaggravating it in Week 6 against the Arizona Cardinals. Due to the injury, Mayfield was ruled out for the Browns' Week 7 game against the Denver Broncos, missing his first game since taking over as the Browns' starter in 2018.[116] On November 14, 2021, Mayfield suffered a right knee contusion during their crushing Week 10 loss to the New England Patriots. While the injury was not severe, coach Kevin Stefanski decided not to put him in for the rest of the game due to Mayfield absorbing hits and the game being out of reach.[117] After the Browns were eliminated from the postseason following a Week 17 loss to the Steelers, the Browns announced Mayfield would undergo surgery on the torn labrum, ending Mayfield's season.[118] He was placed on injured reserve on January 5, 2022.[119] Mayfield threw for 3,010 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions in 14 games played.[120] In the 2022 offseason, after the Browns traded for quarterback Deshaun Watson and signed him to a contract extension, Mayfield requested that the team trade him.[121] On July 6, 2022, Mayfield was traded to the Panthers for a 2024 conditional fifth-round draft pick. The fifth-round pick would become a fourth-round pick if Mayfield played in 70% of the Panthers' offensive snaps, but it did not happen.[122][123] Mayfield competed against Sam Darnold for the starting position with the team.[124] On August 22, 2022, Mayfield was named the Week 1 starter for the Panthers for their game against the Browns.[125] Against the Browns, Mayfield threw for 235 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in the 26–24 loss despite a late rally.[126] Mayfield suffered a high-ankle sprain in the Panthers Week 5 loss to the 49ers, which made him miss the next week against the Los Angeles Rams.[127] Mayfield returned and backed up P. J. Walker starting in Week 8. In the Week 9 game against the Bengals, the Panthers were trailing 35–0 at halftime behind a disastrous start by QB PJ Walker. Interim Head Coach Steve Wilks inserted Mayfield for the second half, in which he threw for 155 yards and two touchdowns in the 42–21 loss.[128] Coach Wilks announced that he would return to Walker as his starting quarterback for Week 10.[129] With a 1–5 record, Mayfield later requested his release from the Panthers, which was granted on December 5, 2022.[130] On December 6, 2022, Mayfield was claimed off waivers by the Rams after starting quarterback Matthew Stafford sustained a spinal cord injury on December 2.[131] The Rams inherited the remaining $1.35 million on his contract.[132] With only two days for Mayfield to learn the playbook after he was claimed, the Rams started John Wolford at quarterback for their game against the Las Vegas Raiders. Rams' head coach Sean McVay benched Wolford after the first offensive series, though, and inserted Mayfield. The Rams were trailing 16–3 in the fourth quarter, seemingly headed for their seventh consecutive loss, when Mayfield led them on a comeback. With 1:45 remaining in the game, still down by 6 points, and with no timeouts left to use, the Rams' offense took the field at their own two-yard line. Mayfield then led the Rams to a game-winning 98-yard drive, which became the longest touchdown drive of his career.[133][134] Mayfield completed 22 of 35 passes for 230 yards without an interception in the game and was named the National Football Conference Offensive Player of the Week.[135] In a Week 15 Monday Night Football matchup against the Green Bay Packers, Mayfield threw his 100th career passing touchdown.[136] In a Week 16 matchup against the Broncos, Mayfield led the Rams to a dominant 51–14 win while completing 24 of 28 pass attempts for 230 yards and throwing for two touchdowns.[137] Mayfield would later credit his five-game stint with the Rams for rejuvenating his career following the disappointment of his time with Carolina. “It brought the fun back. When I’m having fun, talking trash, and enjoying it, like that’s when I’m my best. Yeah, I needed that,” Mayfield said.[138] On March 15, 2023, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed Mayfield to a one-year, $4.00 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $2.87 million.[139] Mayfield was brought in to compete against Kyle Trask and John Wolford to determine who would be the successor at starting quarterback to Tom Brady after he retired after the 2022 NFL season.[140] In Week 1 against the Minnesota Vikings, Mayfield went 3 for 11 to start the game, but soon thereafter threw a touchdown to end the first half. After that, Mayfield went 18/23 for 110 yards and a touchdown for the rest of the game, including a crucial scramble for a first down to secure a 20–17 victory.[141] In Week 2 against the Chicago Bears, Mayfield went 26 for 34 for 317 yards and one touchdown in a 27–17 win. His 76% completion percentage for this game narrowly marked the best completion rate of his career at that point, in any of 33 games with 33+ pass attempts. Before that, his 75.8% completion rate on December 6, 2020, in a win against the Titans while on the Browns, had been his highest completion rate. This was also the first time in his career that Mayfield had started 2–0.[142] In Week 3 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Mayfield went 15/25 for 146 yards, with one touchdown and one interception, his first turnover of the season. He had one rush for 2 yards and fumbled once, which was recovered by Tampa Bay. Mayfield was also sacked twice.[143] In Week 15 against the Packers, Mayfield posted a perfect passer rating, completing 22 of 28 passes for 381 yards and four touchdowns in a 34–20 win.[144] He was the first opposing quarterback to ever have a perfect passer rating at Lambeau Field.[145] He was named the National Football Conference (NFC) Offensive Player of the Week for this performance.[146] In Week 18 against the Panthers, Mayfield led the Buccaneers to a 9–0 victory, clinching the Buccaneers' third straight NFC South title.[147] Mayfield concluded the season with 28 touchdown passes, 4,044 passing yards and a 64.3% completion rate, all career highs.[148] He earned his first Pro Bowl nomination.[149] In the Wild Card Round game against the Eagles, Mayfield completed 22 of 36 passes, for 337 yards, with three touchdowns and no interceptions. He led the Buccaneers to a 32–9 win over the defending NFC champions.[150] In the Divisional round against the Detroit Lions, Mayfield completed 26 of 41 passes for 349 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. The second interception proved costly as it allowed the Lions to run out the clock as the Buccaneers lost, 31–23.[151] On March 10, 2024, Mayfield signed a three-year contract extension with the Buccaneers, worth up to $100 million, with $50 million guaranteed.[152] In Week 1, Mayfield went 24-of-30 for 289 yards and four touchdowns in a 37–20 win over the Commanders.[153] In a rematch of last season's Divisional round playoff game, Mayfield completed 12 passes for 185 yards and ran for a go-ahead touchdown as the Buccaneers beat the Lions 20–16.[154] After a poor performance against the Denver Broncos, Mayfield rebounded the following week against the Eagles, throwing for 347 yards and accounting for three touchdowns as Tampa improved to 3–1.[155] In Week 5 against the Falcons, Mayfield threw three touchdown passes in the first half, but a lack of efficiency on offense in the second half cost the Buccaneers as they lost in overtime.[156] In Week 6, Mayfield threw for 325 yards, four touchdown passes, and overcame three interceptions in the second quarter to win 51–27 against the Saints, leading the offense to a franchise record 594 yards.[157] In a 41–31 loss to the Baltimore Ravens in Week 7, Mayfield threw for 370 yards and three touchdowns, but he threw a pair of costly interceptions in the first half and lost receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, the latter of whom ruled out for the season.[158] Without his top receivers, Mayfield still completed a career-high 37 passes the following week against the Falcons.[159] He finished with over 300 yards and three touchdowns for the third straight game but threw two interceptions inside the Falcons' 10-yard line as the Buccaneers lost 31–26.[160] Mayfield cut down on his interception miscues and led last-minute game-tying drives against the Chiefs and 49ers, but the Buccaneers lost both games, dropping to 4–6 heading to their bye week.[161] With the return of Mike Evans, Mayfield was efficient against the Giants, completing 24 of 30 passes for 294 yards, no interceptions, and a rushing touchdown as the Bucs won 30–7, snapping their four-game skid.[162] Against the Panthers in Week 13, Mayfield rallied from an Achilles injury and a poor first half to lead Tampa to a game-winning field goal drive in overtime.[163] Mayfield's play continued to improve with three touchdowns in a win over the Las Vegas Raiders, followed by a near-flawless performance against the league's top-ranked Los Angeles Chargers defense, completing 22-of-27 passes for 288 yards and four touchdowns in a 40–17 victory.[164] On February 25, 2017, Mayfield was arrested in Washington County, Arkansas on charges of public intoxication, disorderly conduct, and fleeing and resisting arrest.[174] At 2:29 a.m. that Saturday, a police officer was flagged down on an assault and battery report. The person who flagged the officer was yelling at Mayfield. The preliminary police report described Mayfield as unable to walk straight, having slurred speech and food covering the front of his shirt. When he was asked to stay so the police could get a statement, Mayfield began shouting obscenities and \"causing a scene\". Mayfield was booked at 8:21 a.m. local time on the misdemeanor charges. He had a court date on April 7 for the public intoxication charge, and pleaded not guilty to all charges.[175] On June 15, 2017, the University of Oklahoma ordered Mayfield to undergo 35 hours of community service along with completing an alcohol education program.[176] In July 2019, Mayfield married Emily Wilkinson.[177] In December 2023, the pair announced they were expecting their first child, a girl, who was born in April 2024.[178][179] During his tenure with the Browns, Mayfield starred in a continuing series of ads for Progressive Insurance. The ads showed him living \"at home\" in FirstEnergy Stadium with his wife and performing household chores like mowing the lawn and holding a yard sale.[180]",

Quarterback Baker Mayfield enters the midway point of the 2024 NFL season hoping to improve the Bucs’ present through quality performances. Mayfield has contributed touchdowns in each of the Buccaneers‘ 10 games this season and has been vital to the team. The 29-year-old quarterback seems to have found his place in the world in his second campaign with Tampa Bay. As each game passes, the former Cleveland Browns player is gaining more recognition. The former Super Bowl champion quarterback with the Buccaneers who sent a message to Mayfield is none other than Brad Johnson, who praised the work of the Bucs’ current starting QB: “He’s got all the skills, he was the first pick in the draft and he’s been through adversity. He’s had to go through a couple of different teams and now he’s found his home. He produces and gets the most out of the players around him,” Johnson stated clearly about Mayfield during an interview with WDAE in Tampa Bay. Johnson sees Mayfield as a player who can lead the Buccaneers to another Super Bowl. In recent days, franchise notables such as Tom Brady have talked about the current starting quarterback as someone who can ensure quality performances for Tampa Bay. Baker Mayfield, quarterback of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Johnson played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2001 to 2004. During his time with the Bucs, he was the starting quarterback and a key player in the team’s 48-21 victory over the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003. see also Top 15 NFL quarterbacks with the most Super Bowl rings: The greatest legends Although the Bucs are not on a hot streak, Mayfield’s season so far has been outstanding. In 10 games played, he records 24 touchdowns, just four fewer than in all of last year’s campaign. In addition, the 29-year-old quarterback has completed 243 passes for 2505 yards and nine interceptions. Ignacio Cairola is a bilingual sports journalist and writer fluent in English and Spanish.

                "content": "Pontic Steppe Caucasus East Asia Eastern Europe Northern Europe Pontic Steppe Northern/Eastern Steppe Europe South Asia Steppe Europe Caucasus India Indo-Aryans Iranians East Asia Europe East Asia Europe Indo-Aryan Iranian Indo-Aryan Iranian Others European The Celts (/kɛlts/ KELTS, see pronunciation for different usages) or Celtic peoples (/ˈkɛltɪk/ KEL-tik) were a collection of Indo-European peoples[1] in Europe and Anatolia, identified by their use of Celtic languages and other cultural similarities.[2][3][4][5] Major Celtic groups included the Gauls; the Celtiberians and Gallaeci[6][7] of Iberia; the Britons, Picts, and Gaels of Britain and Ireland; the Boii; and the Galatians. The interrelationships of ethnicity, language and culture in the Celtic world are unclear and debated;[8] for example over the ways in which the Iron Age people of Britain and Ireland should be called Celts.[5][8][9][10] In current scholarship, 'Celt' primarily refers to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single ethnic group.[11] The history of pre-Celtic Europe and Celtic origins is debated. The traditional \"Celtic from the East\" theory, says the proto-Celtic language arose in the late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of central Europe, named after grave sites in southern Germany,[12][13] which flourished from around 1200 BC.[14] This theory links the Celts with the Iron Age Hallstatt culture which followed it (c. 1200–500 BC), named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt, Austria,[14][15] and with the following La Tène culture (c. 450 BC onward), named after the La Tène site in Switzerland. It proposes that Celtic culture spread westward and southward from these areas by diffusion or migration.[16] A newer theory, \"Celtic from the West\", suggests proto-Celtic arose earlier, was a lingua franca in the Atlantic Bronze Age coastal zone, and spread eastward.[17] Another newer theory, \"Celtic from the Centre\", suggests proto-Celtic arose between these two zones, in Bronze Age Gaul, then spread in various directions.[11] After the Celtic settlement of Southeast Europe in the 3rd century BC, Celtic culture reached as far east as central Anatolia, Turkey. The earliest undisputed examples of Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions from the 6th century BC.[18] Continental Celtic languages are attested almost exclusively through inscriptions and place-names. Insular Celtic languages are attested from the 4th century AD in Ogham inscriptions, though they were being spoken much earlier. Celtic literary tradition begins with Old Irish texts around the 8th century AD. Elements of Celtic mythology are recorded in early Irish and early Welsh literature. Most written evidence of the early Celts comes from Greco-Roman writers, who often grouped the Celts as barbarian tribes. They followed an ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. The Celts were often in conflict with the Romans, such as in the Roman–Gallic wars, the Celtiberian Wars, the conquest of Gaul and conquest of Britain. By the 1st century AD, most Celtic territories had become part of the Roman Empire. By c. 500, due to Romanisation and the migration of Germanic tribes, Celtic culture had mostly become restricted to Ireland, western and northern Britain, and Brittany. Between the 5th and 8th centuries, the Celtic-speaking communities in these Atlantic regions emerged as a reasonably cohesive cultural entity. They had a common linguistic, religious and artistic heritage that distinguished them from surrounding cultures.[19] Insular Celtic culture diversified into that of the Gaels (Irish, Scots and Manx) and the Celtic Britons (Welsh, Cornish, and Bretons) of the medieval and modern periods.[2][20][21] A modern Celtic identity[22] was constructed as part of the Romanticist Celtic Revival in Britain, Ireland, and other European territories such as Galicia.[23] Today, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton are still spoken in parts of their former territories, while Cornish and Manx are undergoing a revival. The first recorded use of the name 'Celts' – as Κελτοί (Keltoi) in Ancient Greek – was by Greek geographer Hecataeus of Miletus in 517 BC,[24] when writing about a people living near Massilia (modern Marseille), southern Gaul.[25] In the fifth century BC, Herodotus referred to Keltoi living around the source of the Danube and in the far west of Europe.[26] The etymology of Keltoi is unclear. Possible roots include Indo-European *kʲel 'to hide' (seen also in Old Irish ceilid, and Modern Welsh celu), *kʲel 'to heat' or *kel 'to impel'.[27] It may come from the Celtic language. Linguist Kim McCone supports this view and notes that Celt- is found in the names of several ancient Gauls such as Celtillus, father of Vercingetorix. He suggests it meant the people or descendants of \"the hidden one\", noting the Gauls claimed descent from an underworld god (according to Commentarii de Bello Gallico), and linking it with the Germanic Hel.[28] Others view it as a name coined by Greeks; among them linguist Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel, who suggests it meant \"the tall ones\".[29] In the first century BC, Roman leader Julius Caesar reported that the Gauls called themselves 'Celts', Latin: Celtae, in their own tongue.[30] Thus whether it was given to them by others or not, it was used by the Celts themselves. Greek geographer Strabo, writing about Gaul towards the end of the first century BC, refers to the \"race which is now called both Gallic and Galatic\", though he also uses Celtica as another name for Gaul. He reports Celtic peoples in Iberia too, calling them Celtiberi and Celtici.[31] Pliny the Elder noted the use of Celtici in Lusitania as a tribal surname,[32] which epigraphic findings have confirmed.[33][34] A Latin name for the Gauls, Galli (pl.), may come from a Celtic ethnic name, perhaps borrowed into Latin during the Celtic expansion into Italy from the early fifth century BC. Its root may be Proto-Celtic *galno, meaning \"power, strength\" (whence Old Irish gal \"boldness, ferocity\", Welsh gallu \"to be able, power\"). The Greek name Γαλάται (Galatai, Latinized Galatae) most likely has the same origin, referring to the Gauls who invaded southeast Europe and settled in Galatia.[35] The suffix -atai might be a Greek inflection.[36] Linguist Kim McCone suggests it comes from Proto-Celtic *galatis (\"ferocious, furious\"), and was not originally an ethnic name but a name for young warrior bands. He says \"If the Gauls' initial impact on the Mediterranean world was primarily a military one typically involving fierce young *galatīs, it would have been natural for the Greeks to apply this name for the type of Keltoi that they usually encountered\".[28] Because Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Κελτοί (Keltoi) or Celtae,[5][8][9] some scholars prefer not to use the term for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] However, they spoke Celtic languages, shared other cultural traits, and Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Gauls in customs and religion.[11] For at least 1,000 years the name Celt was not used at all, and nobody called themselves Celts or Celtic, until from about 1700, after the word 'Celtic' was rediscovered in classical texts, it was applied for the first time to the distinctive culture, history, traditions, language of the modern Celtic nations – Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Brittany, and the Isle of Man.[37] 'Celt' is a modern English word, first attested in 1707 in the writing of Edward Lhuyd, whose work, along with that of other late 17th-century scholars, brought academic attention to the languages and history of the early Celtic inhabitants of Great Britain.[38] The English words Gaul, Gauls (pl.) and Gaulish (first recorded in the 16–17th centuries) come from French Gaule and Gaulois, a borrowing from Frankish *Walholant, 'Roman-land' (see Gaul: Name), the root of which is Proto-Germanic *walha-, 'foreigner, Roman, Celt', whence the English word Welsh (Old English wælisċ). Proto-Germanic *walha comes from the name of the Volcae,[39] a Celtic tribe who lived first in southern Germany and central Europe, then migrated to Gaul.[40] This means that English Gaul, despite its superficial similarity, is not actually derived from Latin Gallia (which should have produced *Jaille in French),[citation needed] though it does refer to the same ancient region. Celtic refers to a language family and, more generally, means 'of the Celts' or 'in the style of the Celts'. Several archaeological cultures are considered Celtic, based on unique sets of artefacts. The link between language and artefact is aided by the presence of inscriptions.[41] The modern idea of a Celtic cultural identity or \"Celticity\" focuses on similarities among languages, works of art, and classical texts,[42] and sometimes also among material artefacts, social organisation, homeland and mythology.[43] Earlier theories held that these similarities suggest a common \"racial\" (race is now a contested concept) origin for the various Celtic peoples, but more recent theories hold that they reflect a common cultural and linguistic heritage more than a genetic one. Celtic cultures seem to have been diverse, with the use of a Celtic language being the main thing they had in common.[5] Today, the term 'Celtic' generally refers to the languages and cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, and Brittany; also called the Celtic nations. These are the regions where Celtic languages are still spoken to some extent. The four are Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton; plus two recent revivals, Cornish (a Brittonic language) and Manx (a Goidelic language). There are also attempts to reconstruct Cumbric, a Brittonic language of northern Britain. Celtic regions of mainland Europe are those whose residents claim a Celtic heritage, but where no Celtic language survives; these include western Iberia, i.e. Portugal and north-central Spain (Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Castile and León, Extremadura).[44] Continental Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of mainland Europe and Insular Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of the British and Irish islands, and their descendants. The Celts of Brittany derive their language from migrating Insular Celts from Britain and so are grouped accordingly.[45] The Celtic languages are a branch of the Indo-European languages. By the time Celts are first mentioned in written records around 400 BC, they were already split into several language groups, and spread over much of western mainland Europe, the Iberian Peninsula, Ireland and Britain. The languages developed into Celtiberian, Goidelic and Brittonic branches, among others.[46][47] The mainstream view during most of the twentieth century is that the Celts and the proto-Celtic language arose out of the Urnfield culture of central Europe around 1000 BC, spreading westward and southward over the following few hundred years.[14][48][49][50] The Urnfield culture was preeminent in central Europe during the late Bronze Age, circa 1200 BC to 700 BC. The spread of iron-working led to the Hallstatt culture (c. 800 to 500 BC) developing out of the Urnfield culture in a wide region north of the Alps. The Hallstatt culture developed into the La Tène culture from about 450 BC, which came to be identified with Celtic art.[citation needed] In 1846, Johann Georg Ramsauer unearthed an ancient grave field with distinctive grave goods at Hallstatt, Austria. Because the burials \"dated to roughly the time when Celts are mentioned near the Danube by Herodotus, Ramsauer concluded that the graves were Celtic\".[51] Similar sites and artifacts were found over a wide area, which were named the 'Hallstatt culture'. In 1857, the archaeological site of La Tène was discovered in Switzerland.[51] The huge collection of artifacts had a distinctive style. Artifacts of this 'La Tène style' were found elsewhere in Europe, \"particularly in places where people called Celts were known to have lived and early Celtic languages are attested. As a result, these items quickly became associated with the Celts, so much so that by the 1870s scholars began to regard finds of the La Tène as 'the archaeological expression of the Celts'\".[51] This cultural network was overrun by the Roman Empire, though traces of La Tène style were still seen in Gallo-Roman artifacts. In Britain and Ireland, the La Tène style survived precariously to re-emerge in Insular art.[citation needed] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to be challenged in the latter 20th century, when it was accepted that the oldest known Celtic-language inscriptions were those of Lepontic from the 6th century BC and Celtiberian from the 2nd century BC. These were found in northern Italy and Iberia, neither of which were part of the 'Hallstatt' nor 'La Tène' cultures at the time.[11] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory was partly based on ancient Greco-Roman writings, such as the Histories of Herodotus, which placed the Celts at the source of the Danube. However, Stephen Oppenheimer shows that Herodotus seemed to believe the Danube rose near the Pyrenees, which would place the Ancient Celts in a region which is more in agreement with later classical writers and historians (i.e. in Gaul and Iberia).[52] The theory was also partly based on the abundance of inscriptions bearing Celtic personal names in the Eastern Hallstatt region (Noricum). However, Patrick Sims-Williams notes that these date to the later Roman era, and says they suggest \"relatively late settlement by a Celtic-speaking elite\".[11] In the late 20th century, the Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to fall out of favour with some scholars, which was influenced by new archaeological finds. 'Celtic' began to refer primarily to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single culture or ethnic group.[11] A new theory suggested that Celtic languages arose earlier, along the Atlantic coast (including Britain, Ireland, Armorica and Iberia), long before evidence of 'Celtic' culture is found in archaeology. Myles Dillon and Nora Kershaw Chadwick argued that \"Celtic settlement of the British Isles\" might date to the Bell Beaker culture of the Copper and Bronze Age (from c. 2750 BC).[53][54] Martín Almagro Gorbea (2001) also proposed that Celtic arose in the 3rd millennium BC, suggesting that the spread of the Bell Beaker culture explained the wide dispersion of the Celts throughout western Europe, as well as the variability of the Celtic peoples.[55] Using a multidisciplinary approach, Alberto J. Lorrio and Gonzalo Ruiz Zapatero reviewed and built on Almagro Gorbea's work to present a model for the origin of Celtic archaeological groups in Iberia and proposing a rethinking of the meaning of \"Celtic\".[56] John T. Koch[57] and Barry Cunliffe[58] have developed this 'Celtic from the West' theory. It proposes that the proto-Celtic language arose along the Atlantic coast and was the lingua franca of the Atlantic Bronze Age cultural network, later spreading inland and eastward.[11] More recently, Cunliffe proposes that proto-Celtic had arisen in the Atlantic zone even earlier, by 3000 BC, and spread eastwards with the Bell Beaker culture over the following millennium. His theory is partly based on glottochronology, the spread of ancient Celtic-looking placenames, and thesis that the Tartessian language was Celtic.[11] However, the proposal that Tartessian was Celtic is widely rejected by linguists, many of whom regard it as unclassified.[59][60] Celticist Patrick Sims-Williams (2020) notes that in current scholarship, 'Celt' is primarily a linguistic label. In his 'Celtic from the Centre' theory, he argues that the proto-Celtic language did not originate in central Europe nor the Atlantic, but in-between these two regions. He suggests that it \"emerged as a distinct Indo-European dialect around the second millennium BC, probably somewhere in Gaul [centered in modern France] ... whence it spread in various directions and at various speeds in the first millennium BC\". Sims-Williams says this avoids the problematic idea \"that Celtic was spoken over a vast area for a very long time yet somehow avoided major dialectal splits\", and \"it keeps Celtic fairly close to Italy, which suits the view that Italic and Celtic were in some way linked\".[11] The Proto-Celtic language is usually dated to the Late Bronze Age.[14] The earliest records of a Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions of Cisalpine Gaul (Northern Italy), the oldest of which pre-date the La Tène period. Other early inscriptions, appearing from the early La Tène period in the area of Massilia, are in Gaulish, which was written in the Greek alphabet until the Roman conquest. Celtiberian inscriptions, using their own Iberian script, appear later, after about 200 BC. Evidence of Insular Celtic is available only from about 400 AD, in the form of Primitive Irish Ogham inscriptions.[citation needed] Besides epigraphic evidence, an important source of information on early Celtic is toponymy (place names).[61] Arnaiz-Villena et al. (2017) demonstrated that Celtic-related populations of the European Atlantic (Orkney Islands, Scottish, Irish, British, Bretons, Basques, Galicians) shared a common HLA system.[clarification needed][62] Other genetic research does not support the notion of a significant genetic link between these populations, beyond the fact that they are all West Europeans. Early European Farmers did settle Britain (and all of Northern Europe) in the Neolithic; however, recent genetics research has found that, between 2400 and 2000 BC, over 90% of British DNA was overturned by European Steppe Herders in a migration that brought large amounts of Steppe DNA (including the R1b haplogroup) to western Europe.[63] Modern autosomal genetic clustering is testament to this fact, as both modern and Iron Age British and Irish samples cluster genetically very closely with other North Europeans, and less so with Galicians, Basques or those from the south of France.[64][65] The concept that the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures could be seen not just as chronological periods but as \"Culture Groups\", entities composed of people of the same ethnicity and language, had started to grow by the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century the belief that these \"Culture Groups\" could be thought of in racial or ethnic terms was held by Gordon Childe, whose theory was influenced by the writings of Gustaf Kossinna.[66] As the 20th century progressed, the ethnic interpretation of La Tène culture became more strongly rooted, and any findings of La Tène culture and flat inhumation cemeteries were linked to the Celts and the Celtic language.[67] In various[clarification needed] academic disciplines the Celts were considered a Central European Iron Age phenomenon, through the cultures of Hallstatt and La Tène. However, archaeological finds from the Halstatt and La Tène culture were rare in Iberia, southwestern France, northern and western Britain, southern Ireland and Galatia[68][69] and did not provide enough evidence for a culture like that of Central Europe. It is equally difficult to maintain that the origin of the Iberian Celts can be linked to the preceding Urnfield culture. This has resulted in a newer theory that introduces a 'proto-Celtic' substratum and a process of Celticisation, having its initial roots in the Bronze Age Bell Beaker culture.[70] The La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age (from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC) in eastern France, Switzerland, Austria, southwest Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. It developed out of the Hallstatt culture without any definite cultural break, under the impetus of considerable Mediterranean influence from Greek, and later Etruscan civilisations. A shift of settlement centres took place in the 4th century. The western La Tène culture corresponds to historical Celtic Gaul. Whether this means that the whole of La Tène culture can be attributed to a unified Celtic people is difficult to assess; archaeologists have repeatedly concluded that language and material culture do not necessarily run parallel. Frey notes that in the 5th century, \"burial customs in the Celtic world were not uniform; rather, localised groups had their own beliefs, which, in consequence, also gave rise to distinct artistic expressions\".[71] Thus, while the La Tène culture is certainly associated with the Gauls, the presence of La Tène artefacts may be due to cultural contact and does not imply the permanent presence of Celtic speakers.[citation needed] The Greek historian Ephorus of Cyme in Asia Minor, writing in the 4th century BC, believed the Celts came from the islands off the mouth of the Rhine and were \"driven from their homes by the frequency of wars and the violent rising of the sea\". Polybius published a history of Rome about 150 BC in which he describes the Gauls of Italy and their conflict with Rome. Pausanias in the 2nd century AD says that the Gauls \"originally called Celts\", \"live on the remotest region of Europe on the coast of an enormous tidal sea\". Posidonius described the southern Gauls about 100 BC. Though his original work is lost, later writers such as Strabo used it. The latter, writing in the early 1st century AD, deals with Britain and Gaul as well as Hispania, Italy, and Galatia. Caesar wrote extensively about his Gallic Wars in 58–51 BC. Diodorus Siculus wrote about the Celts of Gaul and Britain in his 1st-century history.[citation needed] Diodorus Siculus and Strabo both suggest that the heartland of the people they call Celts was in southern Gaul. The former says that the Gauls were to the north of the Celts, but that the Romans referred to both as Gauls (linguistically the Gauls were certainly Celts). Before the discoveries at Hallstatt and La Tène, it was generally considered that the Celtic heartland was southern Gaul, see Encyclopædia Britannica for 1813.[citation needed] The Romans knew the Celts then living in present-day France as Gauls. The territory of these peoples probably included the Low Countries, the Alps and present-day northern Italy. Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars described the 1st-century BC descendants of those Gauls.[citation needed] Eastern Gaul became the centre of the western La Tène culture. In later Iron Age Gaul, the social organisation resembled that of the Romans, with large towns. From the 3rd century BC the Gauls adopted coinage. Texts with Greek characters from southern Gaul have survived from the 2nd century BC.[72] Greek traders founded Massalia about 600 BC, with some objects (mostly drinking ceramic vessels) being traded up the Rhône valley. But trade became disrupted soon after 500 BC and re-oriented over the Alps to the Po valley in the Italian peninsula. The Romans arrived in the Rhone valley in the 2nd century BC and encountered a mostly Celtic-speaking Gaul. Rome wanted land communications with its Iberian provinces and fought a major battle with the Saluvii at Entremont in 124–123 BC. Gradually Roman control extended, and the Roman province of Gallia Transalpina developed along the Mediterranean coast.[73][74] The Romans knew the remainder of Gaul as Gallia Comata, 'Long-haired Gaul'.[75] In 58 BC, the Helvetii planned to migrate westward but Julius Caesar forced them back. He then became involved in fighting the various tribes in Gaul, and by 55 BC had overrun most of Gaul. In 52 BC, Vercingetorix led a revolt against Roman occupation but was defeated at the Battle of Alesia and surrendered.[76] Following the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BC, Caesar's Celtica formed the main part of Roman Gaul, becoming the province of Gallia Lugdunensis. This territory of the Celtic tribes was bounded on the south by the Garonne and on the north by the Seine and the Marne.[77] The Romans attached large swathes of this region to neighbouring provinces Belgica and Aquitania, particularly under Augustus.[78] Place- and personal-name analysis and inscriptions suggest that Gaulish was spoken over most of what is now France.[79][80] Until the end of the 19th century, traditional scholarship dealing with the Celts did acknowledge their presence in the Iberian Peninsula[81][82] as a material culture relatable to the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures. However, since according to the definition of the Iron Age in the 19th century Celtic populations were supposedly rare in Iberia and did not provide a cultural scenario that could easily be linked to that of Central Europe, the presence of Celtic culture in that region was generally not fully recognised. Modern scholarship, however, has proven that Celtic presence and influences were most substantial in what is today Spain and Portugal (with perhaps the highest settlement saturation in Western Europe), particularly in the central, western and northern regions.[83][84] In addition to Gauls infiltrating from the north of the Pyrenees, the Roman and Greek sources mention Celtic populations in three parts of the Iberian Peninsula: the eastern part of the Meseta (inhabited by the Celtiberians), the southwest (Celtici, in modern-day Alentejo) and the northwest (Gallaecia and Asturias).[85] A modern scholarly review[86] found several archaeological groups of Celts in Spain: The origins of the Celtiberians might provide a key to understanding the Celticisation process in the rest of the Peninsula. The process of Celticisation of the southwestern area of the peninsula by the Keltoi and of the northwestern area is, however, not a simple Celtiberian question. Recent investigations about the Callaici[91] and Bracari[92] in northwestern Portugal are providing new approaches to understanding Celtic culture (language, art and religion) in western Iberia.[93] John T. Koch of Aberystwyth University suggested that Tartessian inscriptions of the 8th century BC might be classified as Celtic. This would mean that Tartessian is the earliest attested trace of Celtic by a margin of more than a century.[94] In Germany by the late Bronze Age, the Urnfield culture (c. 1300 BC – c. 750 BC) had replaced the Bell Beaker, Unetice and Tumulus cultures in central Europe,[97] whilst the Nordic Bronze Age had developed in Scandinavia and northern Germany. The Hallstatt culture, which had developed from the Urnfield culture, was the predominant Western and Central European culture from the 12th to 8th centuries BC and during the early Iron Age (8th to 6th centuries BC). It was followed by the La Tène culture (5th to 1st centuries BC). The people who had adopted these cultural characteristics in central and southern Germany are regarded as Celts. Celtic cultural centres developed in central Europe during the late Bronze Age (c. 1200 BC until 700 BC). Some, like the Heuneburg, the oldest city north of the Alps,[98] grew to become important cultural centres of the Iron Age in Central Europe, that maintained trade routes to the Mediterranean. In the 5th century BC the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned a Celtic city at the Danube – Pyrene, that historians attribute to the Heuneburg. Beginning around 700 BC (or later), Germanic peoples (Germanic tribes) from southern Scandinavia and northern Germany expanded south and gradually replaced the Celtic peoples in Central Europe.[99][100][101][102][103][104] The Canegrate culture represented the first migratory wave of the proto-Celtic[105][106] population from the northwest part of the Alps that, through the Alpine passes, had already penetrated and settled in the western Po valley between Lake Maggiore and Lake Como (Scamozzina culture). It has also been proposed that a more ancient proto-Celtic presence can be traced back to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, when North Westwern Italy appears closely linked regarding the production of bronze artefacts, including ornaments, to the western groups of the Tumulus culture.[107] La Tène cultural material appeared over a large area of mainland Italy,[108] the southernmost example being the Celtic helmet from Canosa di Puglia.[109] Italy is home to Lepontic, the oldest attested Celtic language (from the 6th century BC).[110] Anciently spoken in Switzerland and in Northern-Central Italy, from the Alps to Umbria.[111][112][113][114] According to the Recueil des Inscriptions Gauloises, more than 760 Gaulish inscriptions have been found throughout present-day France – with the notable exception of Aquitaine – and in Italy,[115][116] which testifies the importance of Celtic heritage in the peninsula.[citation needed] In 391 BC, Celts \"who had their homes beyond the Alps streamed through the passes in great strength and seized the territory that lay between the Apennine Mountains and the Alps\" according to Diodorus Siculus. The Po Valley and the rest of northern Italy (known to the Romans as Cisalpine Gaul) was inhabited by Celtic-speakers who founded cities such as Milan.[117] Later the Roman army was routed at the battle of Allia and Rome was sacked in 390 BC by the Senones.[118] At the battle of Telamon in 225 BC, a large Celtic army was trapped between two Roman forces and crushed.[119] The defeat of the combined Samnite, Celtic and Etruscan alliance by the Romans in the Third Samnite War sounded the beginning of the end of the Celtic domination in mainland Europe, but it was not until 192 BC that the Roman armies conquered the last remaining independent Celtic kingdoms in Italy.[citation needed] The Celts also expanded down the Danube river and its tributaries. One of the most influential tribes, the Scordisci, established their capital at Singidunum (present-day Belgrade, Serbia) in the 3rd century BC. The concentration of hill-forts and cemeteries shows a dense population in the Tisza valley of modern-day Vojvodina, Serbia, Hungary and into Ukraine. Expansion into Romania was however blocked by the Dacians.[citation needed] The Serdi were a Celtic tribe[120] inhabiting Thrace. They were located around and founded Serdika (Bulgarian: Сердика, Latin: Ulpia Serdica, Greek: Σαρδῶν πόλις), now Sofia in Bulgaria,[121] which reflects their ethnonym. They would have established themselves in this area during the Celtic migrations at the end of the 4th century BC, though there is no evidence for their existence before the 1st century BC. Serdi are among traditional tribal names reported into the Roman era.[122] They were gradually Thracianized over the centuries but retained their Celtic character in material culture up to a late date.[when?][citation needed] According to other sources they may have been simply of Thracian origin,[123] according to others they may have become of mixed Thraco-Celtic origin. Further south, Celts settled in Thrace (Bulgaria), which they ruled for over a century, and Anatolia, where they settled as the Galatians (see also: Gallic Invasion of Greece). Despite their geographical isolation from the rest of the Celtic world, the Galatians maintained their Celtic language for at least 700 years. St Jerome, who visited Ancyra (modern-day Ankara) in 373 AD, likened their language to that of the Treveri of northern Gaul.[citation needed] For Venceslas Kruta, Galatia in central Turkey was an area of dense Celtic settlement.[citation needed] The Boii tribe gave their name to Bohemia, Bologna and possibly Bavaria, and Celtic artefacts and cemeteries have been discovered further east in what is now Poland and Slovakia. A Celtic coin (Biatec) from Bratislava's mint was displayed on the old Slovak 5-crown coin.[citation needed] As there is no archaeological evidence for large-scale invasions in some of the other areas, one current school of thought holds that Celtic language and culture spread to those areas by contact rather than invasion.[124] However, the Celtic invasions of Italy and the expedition in Greece and western Anatolia, are well documented in Greek and Latin history.[125][126] There are records of Celtic mercenaries in Egypt serving the Ptolemies. Thousands were employed in 283–246 BC and they were also in service around 186 BC. They attempted to overthrow Ptolemy II.[127] All living Celtic languages today belong to the Insular Celtic languages, derived from the Celtic languages spoken in Iron Age Britain and Ireland.[128] They separated into a Goidelic and a Brittonic branch early on. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, the Insular Celts were made up of the Celtic Britons, the Gaels (or Scoti), and the Picts (or Caledonians).[citation needed] The renown of insular Celts has caused a popular belief that Celtic clans only lived in the British Isles.[129] Linguists have debated whether a Celtic language came to the British Isles and then split, or whether the two branches arrived separately. The older view was that Celtic influence in the Isles was the result of successive migrations or invasions from the European mainland by diverse Celtic-speaking peoples over several centuries, accounting for the P-Celtic vs. Q-Celtic isogloss. This view has been challenged by the hypothesis that the islands' Celtic languages form an Insular Celtic dialect group.[130] In the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars often dated the \"arrival\" of Celtic culture in Britain (via an invasion model) to the 6th century BC, corresponding to archaeological evidence of Hallstatt influence and the appearance of chariot burials in what is now England. Cunliffe and Koch propose in their newer 'Celtic from the West' theory that Celtic languages reached the Isles earlier, with the Bell Beaker culture c.2500 BC, or even before this.[131][132] More recently, a major archaeogenetics study uncovered a migration into southern Britain in the Bronze Age from 1300 to 800 BC.[133] The newcomers were genetically most similar to ancient individuals from Gaul.[133] From 1000 BC, their genetic marker swiftly spread through southern Britain,[134] but not northern Britain.[133] The authors see this as a \"plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain\".[133] There was much less immigration during the Iron Age, so it is likely that Celtic reached Britain before then.[133] Cunliffe suggests that a branch of Celtic was already spoken in Britain, and the Bronze Age migration introduced the Brittonic branch.[135] Like many Celtic peoples on the mainland, the Insular Celts followed an Ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. Some of the southern British tribes had strong links with Gaul and Belgica, and minted their own coins. During the Roman occupation of Britain, a Romano-British culture emerged in the southeast. The Britons and Picts in the north, and the Gaels of Ireland, remained outside the empire. During the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 400s AD, there was significant Anglo-Saxon settlement of eastern and southern Britain, and some Gaelic settlement of its western coast. During this time, some Britons migrated to the Armorican peninsula, where their culture became dominant. Meanwhile, much of northern Britain (Scotland) became Gaelic. By the 10th century AD, the Insular Celtic peoples had diversified into the Brittonic-speaking Welsh (in Wales), Cornish (in Cornwall), Bretons (in Brittany) and Cumbrians (in the Old North); and the Gaelic-speaking Irish (in Ireland), Scots (in Scotland) and Manx (on the Isle of Man).[citation needed] Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Celtae or Κελτοί (Keltoi),[5][8][9] leading some scholars to question the use of the term 'Celt' for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] The first historical account of the islands was by the Greek geographer Pytheas, who sailed around what he called the \"Pretannikai nesoi\" (the \"Pretannic isles\") around 310–306 BC.[136] In general, classical writers referred to the Britons as Pretannoi (in Greek) or Britanni (in Latin).[137] Strabo, writing in Roman times, distinguished between the Celts and Britons.[138] However, Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Celts of Gaul in customs and religion.[11] Under Caesar the Romans conquered Celtic Gaul, and from Claudius onward the Roman empire absorbed parts of Britain. Roman local government of these regions closely mirrored pre-Roman tribal boundaries, and archaeological finds suggest native involvement in local government.[citation needed] The native peoples under Roman rule became Romanised and keen to adopt Roman ways. Celtic art had already incorporated classical influences, and surviving Gallo-Roman pieces interpret classical subjects or keep faith with old traditions despite a Roman overlay.[citation needed] The Roman occupation of Gaul, and to a lesser extent of Britain, led to Roman-Celtic syncretism. In the case of the continental Celts, this eventually resulted in a language shift to Vulgar Latin, while the Insular Celts retained their language.[citation needed] There was also considerable cultural influence exerted by Gaul on Rome, particularly in military matters and horsemanship, as the Gauls often served in the Roman cavalry. The Romans adopted the Celtic cavalry sword, the spatha, and Epona, the Celtic horse goddess.[139][140] To the extent that sources are available, they depict a pre-Christian Iron Age Celtic social structure based formally on class and kingship, although this may only have been a particular late phase of organisation in Celtic societies. Patron-client relationships similar to those of Roman society are also described by Caesar and others in the Gaul of the 1st century BC.[citation needed] In the main, the evidence is of tribes being led by kings, although some argue that there is also evidence of oligarchical republican forms of government eventually emerging in areas which had close contact with Rome. Most descriptions of Celtic societies portray them as being divided into three groups: a warrior aristocracy; an intellectual class including professions such as druid, poet, and jurist; and everyone else. In historical times, the offices of high and low kings in Ireland and Scotland were filled by election under the system of tanistry, which eventually came into conflict with the feudal principle of primogeniture in which succession goes to the first-born son.[citation needed] Little is known of family structure among the Celts. Patterns of settlement varied from decentralised to urban. The popular stereotype of non-urbanised societies settled in hillforts and duns,[141] drawn from Britain and Ireland (there are about 3,000 hill forts known in Britain)[142] contrasts with the urban settlements present in the core Hallstatt and La Tène areas, with the many significant oppida of Gaul late in the first millennium BC, and with the towns of Gallia Cisalpina.[citation needed] Slavery, as practised by the Celts, was very likely similar to the better documented practice in ancient Greece and Rome.[143] Slaves were acquired from war, raids, and penal and debt servitude.[143] Slavery was hereditary,[144] though manumission was possible. The Old Irish and Welsh words for 'slave', cacht and caeth respectively, are cognate with Latin captus 'captive' suggesting that the slave trade was an early means of contact between Latin and Celtic societies.[143] In the Middle Ages, slavery was especially prevalent in the Celtic countries.[145] Manumissions were discouraged by law and the word for 'female slave', cumal, was used as a general unit of value in Ireland.[146] There are only very limited records from pre-Christian times written in Celtic languages. These are mostly inscriptions in the Roman and sometimes Greek alphabets. The ogham script, an Early Medieval alphabet, was mostly used in early Christian times in Ireland and Scotland (but also in Wales and England), and was only used for ceremonial purposes such as inscriptions on gravestones. The available evidence is of a strong oral tradition, such as that preserved by bards in Ireland, and eventually recorded by monasteries. Celtic art also produced a great deal of intricate and beautiful metalwork, examples of which have been preserved by their distinctive burial rites.[147] In some regards the Atlantic Celts were conservative: for example, they still used chariots in combat long after they had been reduced to ceremonial roles by the Greeks and Romans. However, despite being outdated, Celtic chariot tactics were able to repel the invasions of Britain attempted by Julius Caesar.[148] According to Diodorus Siculus: The Gauls are tall of body with rippling muscles and white of skin and their hair is blond, and not only naturally so for they also make it their practice by artificial means to increase the distinguishing colour which nature has given it. For they are always washing their hair in limewater and they pull it back from the forehead to the nape of the neck, with the result that their appearance is like that of Satyrs and Pans since the treatment of their hair makes it so heavy and coarse that it differs in no respect from the mane of horses. Some of them shave the beard but others let it grow a little; and the nobles shave their cheeks but they let the moustache grow until it covers the mouth. During the later Iron Age the Gauls generally wore long-sleeved shirts or tunics and long trousers (called braccae by the Romans).[149] Clothes were made of wool or linen, with some silk being used by the rich. Cloaks were worn in the winter. Brooches[150] and armlets were used, but the most famous item of jewellery was the torc, a neck collar of metal, sometimes gold. The horned Waterloo Helmet in the British Museum, which long set the standard for modern images of Celtic warriors, is in fact a unique survival, and may have been a piece for ceremonial rather than military wear.[151] Archaeological evidence suggests that the pre-Roman Celtic societies were linked to the network of overland trade routes that spanned Eurasia. Archaeologists have discovered large prehistoric trackways crossing bogs in Ireland and Germany. Due to their substantial nature, these are believed to have been created for wheeled transport as part of an extensive roadway system that facilitated trade.[152] The territory held by the Celts contained tin, lead, iron, silver and gold.[153] Celtic smiths and metalworkers created weapons and jewellery for international trade, particularly with the Romans.[154] The myth that the Celtic monetary system consisted of wholly barter is a common one, but is in part false. The monetary system was complex and is still not understood (much like the late Roman coinages), and due to the absence of large numbers of coin items, it is assumed that \"proto-money\" was used. This included bronze items made from the early La Tène period and onwards, which were often in the shape of axeheads, rings, or bells. Due to the large number of these present in some burials, it is thought they had a relatively high monetary value, and could be used for \"day to day\" purchases. Low-value coinages of potin, a bronze alloy with high tin content, were minted in most Celtic areas of the continent and in South-East Britain prior to the Roman conquest of these lands. Higher-value coinages, suitable for use in trade, were minted in gold, silver, and high-quality bronze. Gold coinage was much more common than silver coinage, despite being worth substantially more, as while there were around 100 mines in Southern Britain and Central France, silver was more rarely mined. This was due partly to the relative sparsity of mines and the amount of effort needed for extraction compared to the profit gained. As the Roman civilisation grew in importance and expanded its trade with the Celtic world, silver and bronze coinage became more common. This coincided with a major increase in gold production in Celtic areas to meet the Roman demand, due to the high value Romans put on the metal. The large number of gold mines in France is thought to be a major reason why Caesar invaded.[155] Very few reliable sources exist regarding Celtic views on gender roles, though some archaeological evidence suggests their views may have differed from those of the Greco-Roman world, which tended to be less egalitarian.[156][157] Some Iron Age burials in northeastern Gaul suggest women may have had roles in warfare during the earlier La Tène period, but the evidence is far from conclusive.[158] Celtic individuals buried with both female jewellery and weaponry have been found, such as the Vix Grave in northeastern Gaul, and there are questions about the gender of some individuals buried with weaponry. However, it has been suggested that the weapons indicate high social rank rather than masculinity.[159] Most written accounts of the Ancient Celts are from the Romans and Greeks, though it is not clear how accurate these are. Roman historians Ammianus Marcellinus and Tacitus mentioned Celtic women inciting, participating in, and leading battles.[160] Plutarch reports that Celtic women acted as ambassadors to avoid a war among Celtic chiefdoms in the Po valley during the 4th century BC.[161] Posidonius' anthropological comments on the Celts had common themes, primarily primitivism, extreme ferocity, cruel sacrificial practices, and the strength and courage of their women.[162] Cassius Dio suggests there was great sexual freedom among women in Celtic Britain:[163] ... a very witty remark is reported to have been made by the wife of Argentocoxus, a Caledonian, to Julia Augusta. When the empress was jesting with her, after the treaty, about the free intercourse of her sex with men in Britain, she replied: \"We fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way than do you Roman women; for we consort openly with the best men, whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest\". Such was the retort of the British woman. Barry Cunliffe writes that such references are \"likely to be ill-observed\" and meant to portray the Celts as outlandish \"barbarians\".[164] Historian Lisa Bitel argues the descriptions of Celtic women warriors are not credible. She says some Roman and Greek writers wanted to show that the barbarian Celts lived in \"an upside-down world ... and a standard ingredient in such a world was the manly warrior woman\".[165] The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote in his Politics that the Celts of southeastern Europe approved of male homosexuality. Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote in his Bibliotheca historica that although Gaulish women were beautiful, the men had \"little to do with them\" and it was a custom for men to sleep on animal skins with two younger males. He further claimed that \"the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused\". His claim was later repeated by Greco-Roman writers Athenaeus and Ammianus.[166] H. David Rankin, in Celts and the Classical World, suggests some of these claims refer to bonding rituals in warrior groups, which required abstinence from women at certain times,[167] and says it probably reflects \"the warlike character of early contacts between the Celts and the Greeks\".[168] Under Brehon Law, which was written down in early Medieval Ireland after conversion to Christianity, a woman had the right to divorce her husband and gain his property if he was unable to perform his marital duties due to impotence, obesity, homosexual inclination or preference for other women.[169][170][failed verification] Celtic art is generally used by art historians to refer to art of the La Tène period across Europe, while the Early Medieval art of Britain and Ireland, that is what \"Celtic art\" evokes for much of the general public, is called Insular art in art history. Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence. Energetic circular forms, triskeles and spirals are characteristic. Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from Pictish stones and the Insular high crosses, large monumental sculpture, even with decorative carving, is very rare; possibly it was originally common in wood. Celts were also able to create developed musical instruments such as the carnyces, these famous war trumpets used before the battle to frighten the enemy, as the best preserved found in Tintignac (Gaul) in 2004 and which were decorated with a boar head or a snake head.[171] The interlace patterns that are often regarded as typical of \"Celtic art\" were characteristic of the whole of the British Isles, a style referred to as Insular art, or Hiberno-Saxon art. This artistic style incorporated elements of La Tène, Late Roman, and, most importantly, animal Style II of Germanic Migration Period art. The style was taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and illuminated manuscripts. Equally, the forms used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: Gospel books like the Book of Kells and Book of Lindisfarne, chalices like the Ardagh Chalice and Derrynaflan Chalice, and penannular brooches like the Tara Brooch and Roscrea Brooch. These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the Viking attacks sharply set back cultural life.[citation needed] In contrast the less well known but often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other \"foreign\" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic. After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially Ancient Roman pottery, of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including figurines of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalised styles. Roman Britain also took more interest in enamel than most of the Empire, and its development of champlevé technique was probably important to the later Medieval art of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom of Insular decoration was an important element. Rising nationalism brought Celtic revivals from the 19th century.[citation needed] The Coligny calendar, which was found in 1897 in Coligny, Ain, was engraved on a bronze tablet, preserved in 73 fragments, that originally was 1.48 metres (4 feet 10 inches) wide and 0.9 metres (2 feet 11 inches) high (Lambert p. 111). Based on the style of lettering and the accompanying objects, it probably dates to the end of the 2nd century.[172] It is written in Latin inscriptional capitals, and is in Gaulish. The restored tablet contains 16 vertical columns, with 62 months distributed over 5 years.[citation needed] French archaeologist J. Monard speculated that it was recorded by druids wishing to preserve their tradition of timekeeping in a time when the Julian calendar was imposed throughout the Roman Empire. However, the general form of the calendar suggests the public peg calendars (or parapegmata) found throughout the Greek and Roman world.[173] Tribal warfare appears to have been a regular feature of Celtic societies. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for economic advantage, and in some instances to conquer territory.[citation needed] The Celts were described by classical writers such as Strabo, Livy, Pausanias, and Florus as fighting like \"wild beasts\", and as hordes. Dionysius said that their:[174] [175] manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in military science. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of wild boars, throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target, as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all. Polybius (2.33) indicates that the principal Celtic weapon was a long bladed sword which was used for hacking edgewise rather than stabbing. Celtic warriors are described by Polybius and Plutarch as frequently having to cease fighting in order to straighten their sword blades. This claim has been questioned by some archaeologists, who note that Noric steel, steel produced in Celtic Noricum, was famous in the Roman Empire period and was used to equip the Roman military.[176][177] However, Radomir Pleiner, in The Celtic Sword (1993) argues that \"the metallographic evidence shows that Polybius was right up to a point\", as around one third of surviving swords from the period might well have behaved as he describes.[178] In addition to these long bladed slashing swords, spears and specialized javelins were also used.[179] Polybius also asserts that certain of the Celts fought naked: \"The appearance of these naked warriors was a terrifying spectacle, for they were all men of splendid physique and in the prime of life.\"[180] According to Livy, this was also true of the Celts of Asia Minor.[181] Celts had a reputation as head hunters.[182] Paul Jacobsthal says: \"Amongst the Celts the human head was venerated above all else, since the head was to the Celt the soul, centre of the emotions as well as of life itself, a symbol of divinity and of the powers of the other-world.\"[183] Writing in the first century BC, Greek historians Posidonius and Diodorus Siculus said Celtic warriors cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle, hung them from the necks of their horses, then nailed them up outside their homes.[182] Strabo wrote in the same century that Celts embalmed the heads of their most esteemed enemies in cedar oil and put them on display.[182] Roman historian Livy wrote that the Boii beheaded a defeated Roman general after the Battle of Silva Litana, covered his skull in gold, and used it as a ritual cup.[182] Archaeologists have found evidence that heads were embalmed and displayed by the southern Gauls.[184][185] In another example, at the southern Gaulish site of Entremont, there stood a pillar carved with skulls, within which were niches where human skulls were kept, nailed into position.[186] Roquepertuse nearby has similar carved heads and skull niches. Many lone carved heads have been found in Celtic regions, some with two or three faces.[187] Examples include the Mšecké Žehrovice Head and the Corleck Head. Severed heads are a common motif in Insular Celtic myths, and there are many tales in which 'living heads' preside over feasts or speak prophecies.[182][187] The beheading game is a motif in Irish myth and Arthurian legend, most famously in the tale Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, where the Green Knight picks up his own severed head after Gawain has struck it off. There are also many legends in Celtic regions of saints who carry their own severed heads. In Irish myth, the severed heads of warriors are called the mast or nuts of the goddess Macha.[188] Like other European Iron Age societies, the Celts practised a polytheistic religion and believed in an afterlife.[189][190][unreliable source] Celtic religion varied by region and over time, but had \"broad structural similarities\",[189] and there was \"a basic religious homogeneity\" among the Celtic peoples.[191] Because the ancient Celts did not have writing, evidence about their religion is gleaned from archaeology, Greco-Roman accounts, and literature from the early Christian period.[192] The names of over two hundred Celtic deities have survived (see list of Celtic deities), although it is likely that many of these were alternative names, regional names or titles for the same deity.[189] Some deities were venerated only in one region, but others were more widely known.[189] According to Miranda Aldhouse-Green, the Celts were also animists, believing that every part of the natural world had a spirit.[192] The Celts seem to have had a father god, who was often a god of the tribe and of the dead (Toutatis probably being one name for him); and a mother goddess who was associated with the land, earth and fertility[193] (Dea Matrona probably being one name for her). The mother goddess could also take the form of a war goddess as protectress of her tribe and its land.[193] There also seems to have been a male celestial god—identified with Taranis—associated with thunder, the wheel, and the bull.[193] There were gods of skill and craft, such as the pan-regional god Lugus, and the smith god Gobannos.[193] Celtic healing deities were often associated with sacred springs,[193] such as Sirona and Borvo. Other pan-regional deities include the horned god Cernunnos, the horse and fertility goddess Epona, the divine son Maponos, as well as Belenos, Ogmios, and Sucellos.[189][192] Caesar says the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[189] Triplicity is a common theme in Celtic cosmology, and a number of deities were seen as threefold,[194] for example the Three Mothers.[195] Celtic religious ceremonies were overseen by priests known as druids, who also served as judges, teachers, and lore-keepers. Other classes of druids performed sacrifices for the perceived benefit of the community.[196] There is evidence that ancient Celtic peoples sacrificed animals, almost always livestock or working animals. It appears some were offered wholly to the gods (by burying or burning), while some were shared between gods and humans (part eaten and part offered).[197] There is also some evidence that ancient Celts sacrificed humans, and some Greco-Roman sources claim the Gauls sacrificed criminals by burning them in a wicker man.[198] The Romans said the Celts held ceremonies in sacred groves and other natural shrines, called nemetons.[189] Some Celtic peoples built temples or ritual enclosures of varying shapes (such as the Romano-Celtic temple and viereckschanze), though they also maintained shrines at natural sites.[189] Celtic peoples often made votive offerings: treasured items deposited in water and wetlands, or in ritual shafts and wells, often in the same place over generations.[189] Modern clootie wells might be a continuation of this.[199] Most surviving Celtic mythology belongs to the Insular Celtic peoples: Irish mythology has the largest written body of myths, followed by Welsh mythology. These were written down in the early Middle Ages, mainly by Christian scribes. The supernatural race called the Tuatha Dé Danann are believed to represent the main Celtic gods of Ireland. Their traditional rivals are the Fomóire, whom they defeat in the Battle of Mag Tuired.[200] Barry Cunliffe says the underlying structure in Irish myth was a dualism between the male tribal god and the female goddess of the land.[189] The Dagda seems to have been the chief god and the Morrígan his consort, each of whom had other names.[189] One common motif is the sovereignty goddess, who represents the land and bestows sovereignty on a king by marrying him. The goddess Brigid was linked with nature as well as poetry, healing and smithing.[194] Some figures in medieval Insular Celtic myth have ancient continental parallels: Irish Lugh and Welsh Lleu are cognate with Lugus, Goibniu and Gofannon with Gobannos, Macán and Mabon with Maponos, while Macha and Rhiannon may be counterparts of Epona.[201] In Insular Celtic myth, the Otherworld is a parallel realm where the gods dwell. Some mythical heroes visit it by entering ancient burial mounds or caves, by going under water or across the western sea, or after being offered a silver apple branch by an Otherworld resident.[202] Irish myth says that the spirits of the dead travel to the house of Donn (Tech Duinn), a legendary ancestor; this echoes Caesar's comment that the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[189] Insular Celtic peoples celebrated four seasonal festivals, known to the Gaels as Beltaine (1 May), Lughnasa (1 August), Samhain (1 November) and Imbolc (1 February).[189] The Roman invasion of Gaul brought a great deal of Celtic peoples into the Roman Empire. Roman culture had a profound effect on the Celtic tribes which came under the empire's control. Roman influence led to many changes in Celtic religion, the most noticeable of which was the weakening of the druid class, especially religiously; the druids were to eventually disappear altogether. Romano-Celtic deities also began to appear: these deities often had both Roman and Celtic attributes, combined the names of Roman and Celtic deities, or included couples with one Roman and one Celtic deity. Other changes included the adaptation of the Jupiter Column, a sacred column set up in many Celtic regions of the empire, primarily in northern and eastern Gaul. Another major change in religious practice was the use of stone monuments to represent gods and goddesses. The Celts had probably only created wooden cult images (including monuments carved into trees, which were known as sacred poles) before the Roman conquest.[195] While the regions under Roman rule adopted Christianity along with the rest of the Roman empire, unconquered areas of Ireland and Scotland began to move from Celtic polytheism to Christianity in the 5th century. Ireland was converted by missionaries from Britain, such as Saint Patrick. Later missionaries from Ireland were a major source of missionary work in Scotland, Anglo-Saxon parts of Britain, and central Europe (see Hiberno-Scottish mission). Celtic Christianity, the forms of Christianity that took hold in Britain and Ireland at this time, had for some centuries only limited and intermittent contact with Rome and continental Christianity, as well as some contacts with Coptic Christianity. Some elements of Celtic Christianity developed, or retained, features that made them distinct from the rest of Western Christianity, most famously their conservative method of calculating the date of Easter. In 664, the Synod of Whitby began to resolve these differences, mostly by adopting the current Roman practices, which the Gregorian Mission from Rome had introduced to Anglo-Saxon England.[citation needed] Genetic studies on the limited amount of material available suggest continuity between Iron Age people from areas considered Celtic and the earlier Bell Beaker culture of Bronze Age Western Europe.[206][207][208] Like the Bell Beakers, ancient Celts carried a substantial amount of Western Steppe Herders ancestry, which is derived from Yamnaya pastoralists who expanded westwards from the Pontic–Caspian steppe during the late Neolithic and the early Bronze Age and associated with the initial spread of Indo-European languages.[209] This ancestry was particularly prevalent among Celts of Northwest Europe.[208] Examined individuals overwhelmingly carry types of the paternal haplogroup R-M269,[203][204][205] while the maternal haplogroups H and U are frequent.[210][211] These lineages are associated with steppe ancestry.[203][210] The spread of Celts into Iberia and the emergence of the Celtiberians is associated with an increase in north-central European ancestry in Iberia, and may be connected to the expansion of the Urnfield culture.[212] The paternal haplogroup haplogroup I2a1a1a has been detected among Celtiberians.[213] There appears to have been significant gene flow among Celtic peoples of Western Europe during the Iron Age.[214][208] While the Gauls of southern France display genetic links with the Celtiberians, the Gauls of northern France display links with Great Britain and Sweden.[215] Modern populations of Western Europe, particularly those who still speak Celtic languages, display substantial genetic continuity with the Iron Age populations of the same areas.[216][217][218] Geography Organisations",

                "content": "Celtic refers to Irish culture and heritage, along with the historical people who migrated from the British Isles throughout much of Europe. While the early pronunciation was with an /s/ sound, reflecting its nearest origin in French, the modern standard is a hard \"c\" sound like /k/. This is because language historians desired the word to better reflect its Greek and Classical Latin origins. The soft \"c\" sound is usually reserved for sports teams now, like the Boston Celtics. Be it in the pub or in the halls of academia, whenever the topic of Irish culture, language, music, literature—basically, anything Irish—is brought up, the words Celt and Celtic are bound to be heard. In modern-day English, those words are commonly used in reference to the Irish people and their widely-accepted traditions (of course everybody is Irish on St. Patrick's Day; the Celtic cross or knot is a popular tattoo; the Claddagh ring makes a nice gift). The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The etymology of the noun Celt—from which the adjective Celtic is derived—is straightforward. It's a 16th-century borrowing of the French word Celte, which itself is from Latin Celta, the singular of Celtae, which is the name for a member of an early Indo-European people from antiquity who spread over much of Europe from the British Isles and Spain to Asia Minor. The Latin name is derived from Greek Keltoi, and both the Latin and Greek words referred to the Gauls, the Celtic people who occupied the region that is now France and Belgium. See? Straightforward. With that history laid out, we're wondering how you pronounced all the capital 'c' and 'k' words, especially if you're unfamiliar with French, Latin, Greek, and even English Celt and Celtic, for that matter. The question: is the 'c' sounded \\s\\ or \\k\\? Following its French and Latin predecessors, early pronunciation of Celt was actually \\SELT\\. (In French and Latin, the 'c' is pronounced \\s\\, as in the last name of the French painter Paul Cézanne and in Latin century.) The pronunciation \\KELT\\ started being heard as early as the 18th century, which, in time, ushered in the variant spelling Kelt. The variants were introduced by language and history academics who believed that the pronunciation of Celt should reflect the initial \\k\\ sound in the ancient Greek Keltoi and the Classical Latin Celtae. (It wasn't until the Middle Ages that the letter 'c' in Latin began being pronounced before vowels as the combination \\ts\\—prior, it was pronounced \\k\\; English speakers subsequently reduced the Latin 'c' to a simple \\s\\.) Outside of academia, the variant Kelt never caught on, and it is rarely if ever used today; however, the \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic has since flourished. Another influence on pronouncing Celt and Celtic with a soft 'c' is English's phonetic rule for 'c' when followed by 'e' (or 'i,' as in circus or Cicero), which says that, in such cases, the 'c' is usually pronounced as \\s\\. Think cell, cereal, ceiling, and dance. Nevertheless, English speakers, especially those who wanted to sound knowledgeable about things Celtic, grew to prefer the hard 'c' pronunciation, which harkened back to the words' ancient roots. From the 18th century onward, more and more people began sounding the words with an initial \\k\\. By the mid-20th century, \\k\\ became the norm, which is fitting since the pronunciation is in line with that of the Celtic family of languages that include Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Breton, and the now-extinct (or, depending on who you talk to, nearly extinct) languages Manx and Cornish. Apparently, people appreciated the ethnic pronunciation. This shift in the pronunciation of Celt is fully evinced when comparing H. W. Fowler's 1926 Dictionary of Modern English with Robert Burchfield's 1996 revised edition. Here's what Fowler had to say about Celt(ic): \"The spelling C-, & the pronunciation s-, are the established ones, & no useful purpose seems to be served by the substitution of k-.\" Decades later, Burchfield observes a different trend: \"Except for the football club Celtic (in Glasgow), which is pronounced [SEL-tik], both Celt and Celtic are pronounced with initial \\k\\ in standard English.\" Burchfield is referring to the Scottish Celtic Football Club, founded in 1887. In America, there is basketball's Boston Celtics, founded in 1946, whose name is also pronounced with an initial \\s\\. The European away support that Celtic enjoys is phenomenal. Few clubs have a fanbase that travels in such numbers or makes as much noise, all the more remarkable when you consider the poor record that the club has away from home in recent times.— Liam Kelly, The Celtic Star, 20 Feb. 2020 Aside from this use of the initial soft 'c' in sports teams' names, Celtic with a hard 'c' is the standard; however, you might still sometimes hear the 'c' softly sounded by those who are uninitiated in the history and etymology of Celt and Celtic as well as those who are unfamiliar with the words and resort to the phonetic rules of English. (And, as happens so often in English, those phonetic rules let them down.) See Definitions and Examples » Get Word of the Day daily email! Learn a new word every day.

                "content": "Jaguars Senior Writer JACKSONVILLE – This was sloppy and wet – and a little meaningless in a way. In other very real ways, it was kind of cool. Mac Jones threw two touchdowns and won in front of his hometown fans, and Brian Thomas Jr. continued a standout rookie season – and who cared if it was wet and messy during a 20-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans at EverBank Stadium in front of an announced 61,999 Sunday? The Jaguars won – and swept their AFC South rivals – in the 2024 home finale. \"Just a complete football game,\" Head Coach Doug Pederson called it, with Jaguars defensive end Travon Walker adding: \"It feels good to get a win.\" \"We know that they don't like us and that's in the division, so we always want to come out of that with a dub,\" added Walker, who had one of three Jaguars sacks Sunday. Jones' two-yard second-quarter touchdown pass to wide receiver Parker Washington gave the Jaguars a 10-0 lead and his 11-yard fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Thomas gave the Jaguars a 20-10 lead after the Titans cut into the lead in the second and third quarters. \"I'm just excited to get this W,\" Jaguars running back Travis Etienne Jr. said. \"It just feels so much better coming into work the next day being able to be around my family and be happy. I'm tired of being sad.\" Defensive end Josh Hines-Allen turned in one of his stronger games of the season, and the Jaguars' defense held off a late Titans rally. \"We put the last couple of seconds on our back; it feels great,\" Hines-Allen said after the Jaguars' second victory in nine games. A 28-yard field goal by Titans kicker Matthew Wright cut the Jaguars' lead to 20-13 with 2:02 remaining, with the Titans driving to the Jaguars 26 on their final possession. Jaguars safety Antonio Johnson knocked down Titans quarterback Mason Rudolph's pass to wide receiver Nick Westbrook-Ikhine at the goal line on fourth-and-10 from there with :09 remaining. The Jaguars won giveaway-takeaway 1-0 Sunday, with Jones going a second consecutive game without an interception after throwing seven in the previous three games. \"It has been a minute since we've done that – really in all three phases,\" Pederson said. \"Even down to the two-minute situations at the end of the half and game. Our players did a great job of execution. It's exciting for all those guys.\" The Jaguars are now 3-9 this season in games decided by seven points or less. \"I don't live in the what-ifs,\" Etienne said. \"We didn't make those plays earlier in the year. I'm just happy we're making them now. Hopefully that gives us the confidence to make them next year. We just have to find ways to continue to win games.\" Jones, making his sixth start in the last seven games for injured starting quarterback Trevor Lawrence, completed 15 of 22 passes for 174 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. Jones, who attended the Bolles School locally, won a start for the first time at 'the Bank. Thomas, the Jaguars' standout rookie wide receiver and the No. 23 overall selection in the 2024 NFL Draft, registered his third consecutive 90-plus-yard receiving game with seven receptions for 91 yards and one touchdown. The victory gave the Jaguars (4-12) – who were eliminated from the AFC South chase with five regular-season games remaining this season – a season sweep over the Titans (3-13) for a second time in three seasons. The Jaguars are 5-1 against their AFC South rivals in Head Coach Doug Pederson's three seasons as head coach. \"To sweep a divisional team is huge,\" Hines-Allen said. The Jaguars beat the Titans, 10-6, in Nashville in Week 14. \"We don't like those guys and they don't like us,\" Etienne said of the Titans. \"We just had to go out and handle business.\" Rudolph completed 19 of 31 passes for 193 yards and one touchdown with one interception. The Jaguars registered one takeaway and three sacks Sunday, with linebacker Devin Lloyd registering a second-quarter interception. Defensive end Travon Walker and Hines-Allen each registered sacks, as did rookie defensive tackle Maason Smith. The Jaguars now have (nine) takeaways this season with 31 sacks. They entered Sunday last in the NFL in takeaways and tied for 30th in sacks. Walker has a team-high 9.5 sacks this season and Hines-Allen is second with eight. \"We've got a lot to play for and coach for,\" Pederson said. \"You put your best foot forward and give it everything you have during the week.

                "content": "Manage your account The Tennessee Titans have been swept by the Jacksonville Jaguars. Jacksonville grinded out a 20-13 win over Tennessee at a rainy EverBank Stadium on Sunday to secure a season sweep in the AFC South. Mac Jones threw for 174 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Jags, while Mason Rudolph was 19-of-31 for 193 yards and a touchdown with an interception. Here are four key moments from the Titans' Week 17 game: GENTRY ESTES: Smile, Tennessee Titans fans! That was a valuable loss in Jacksonville The play: Parker Washington's 2-yard touchdown catch was allowed to stand after review After a Mason Rudolph interception, the Jaguars took a 10-0 lead when Parker Washington was ruled to have two feet down on a 2-yard touchdown catch in the back of the end zone early in the second quarter. Washington definitely got his left foot down, but his right foot appeared to slide out once it stepped onto the ground. But as CBS rules analyst Gene Steratore explained, the right foot was judged like a toe-drag where the foot was ruled to be down once any part of it hit the green grass. Explanation or not, the Jaguars led 10-0. The play: Nick Vannett 8-yard touchdown catch capped eight-minute drive to push Titans within three Tennessee opened the second half with a 13-play drive that spanned eight minutes and concluded with a Nick Vannett 8-yard touchdown catch off of a nice play call by Brian Callahan to cut Jacksonville's lead to 13-10. The play: Brian Thomas Jr. 11-yard touchdown catch extends Jaguars lead to 20-10 with 7:05 to play On third and long, Mac Jones throws a 1-on-1 ball for Brian Thomas Jr., who beats fellow rookie Jarvis Brownlee for the touchdown. Thomas finished with 91 receiving yards on seven catches and the score. Tennessee's defense again fell short when the team needed a stop in the second half. The play: Antonio Johnson breaks up Mason Rudolph pass The Titans got a final chance to push for a game-tying touchdown drive, and the Titans moved inside the Jaguars' 30-yard line with less than a minute to play. But Mason Rudolph finished with four straight incompletions, including a late throw to an open Nick Westbrook-Ikhine on fourth down to turn the ball over on downs with nine seconds remaining.

                "title": "Tennessee Titans once again vanquished by lowly Jags, ensure last place in AFC South",
                "content": "Manage your account JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Well, there are only four quarters of Tennessee Titans football left this season. The Titans lost their fifth straight game Sunday, faltering against the lowly Jacksonville Jaguars for the second time in a month, this time 20-13. With one game remaining, the Titans (3-13) have guaranteed themselves a last-place finish in the AFC South for the second consecutive season and remain in contention to earn the No. 1 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. Quarterback Mason Rudolph completed a high volume of his passes but mostly played things safe with short targets and checkdowns. Rudolph was 19-of-31 passing for 193 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Running back Tyjae Spears set a career high with 95 rushing yards in less than three full quarters. But the offense generally struggled to sustain drives and the defense struggled to get off the field on third downs, a bad recipe in a game that was defined by long possessions for both teams. The Titans looked just as dreary as the gray skies in the first half, barely crossing midfield in the first two quarters to go into halftime down 13-3. But Rudolph and Spears came out strong in the third quarter, driving 89 yards to set up a Nick Vannett touchdown reception that cut the deficit to three points. Jacksonville pushed the lead back to 10 midway through the fourth quarter when it capped off a 16-play drive that spanned 9:11 with an 11-yard touchdown pass to rookie receiver Brian Thomas Jr. This left Rudolph and the Titans' offense just 7:05 to score twice to keep the game in reach. Rudolph responded by leading a five-minute scoring drive that resulted in three points, and the Titans saved all three of their timeouts to try to get one last stop and keep the game in reach. The defense came through, giving Rudolph the ball with 1:29 left just across his own 25-yard line. Three long completions and a defensive penalty got the Titans around the Jaguars' 30-yard line, but three incompletions set up a fourth-and-10 from the Jacksonville 26. Rudolph targeted his fourth-down pass to Nick Westbrook-Ikhine in the end zone, but Jaguars defensive back Antonio Johnson broke up the pass to end the game. The Titans played without several of their top contributors Sunday. Running back Tony Pollard, safety Amani Hooker, kicker Nick Folk and guard Dillon Radunz were out. Tackle Jaelyn Duncan, in his first game back after missing two months with a hamstring injury, suffered a shoulder injury in the first half and had to come out as well. Then Spears, who was in the middle of a career-high rushing day, left the game in the third quarter to be evaluated for a concussion. Without Spears, the Titans had to turn to Julius Chestnut as their primary back. The Titans head into Week 18 in the mix for the No. 1 pick. Their chief competition will be the New England Patriots, who hold the tiebreaker having played the weakest overall schedule of the teams in contention. But other teams to watch as the Titans have the chance to pick very early in the draft order include the New York Giants, Cleveland Browns and Las Vegas Raiders. The Titans finish their season next week at Nissan Stadium against the Houston Texans. Game time has not yet been announced. Nick Suss is the Titans beat writer for The Tennessean.

                "title": "Drew Lock - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Paul Andrew Lock (born November 10, 1996) is an American professional football quarterback for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Missouri Tigers and was selected by the Denver Broncos in the second round of the 2019 NFL draft. He has also played for the Seattle Seahawks. Lock attended Lee's Summit High School in Lee's Summit, Missouri.[1] As a junior, he passed for 3,060 yards and 35 touchdowns. As a senior in 2014, he was the Kansas City Star's All-Metro Player of the Year after passing for 2,731 yards and 28 touchdowns.[2] Lock was rated by Rivals as a four-star recruit and was ranked as the sixth-best pro-style quarterback in the 2015 class.[3] He committed to the University of Missouri to play college football.[4] He was considered a two-star basketball prospect as a shooting guard, but he retired from basketball after high school.[5] Lock began his collegiate career by going 6-for-10 for 138 yards and a touchdown in the 2015 season-opener against Southeast Missouri State while coming off the bench for two series.[6] He took over as Mizzou's starting quarterback over the final eight games of 2015.[7] In a 24–10 win over South Carolina, he became the school's first true freshman to start at quarterback since Corby Jones in 1995,[8] going 21-for-28 for 136 yards and a pair of touchdowns.[9] Against BYU at Arrowhead Stadium, Lock was 19-of-28 for a career-best 244 yards and a touchdown while also setting career highs in both passer rating and passing yards while posting his second-best completion percentage of the season.[10] He finished the season 129-of-263 for 1,332 yards, four passing touchdowns, and eight interceptions to go along with a rushing touchdown.[7] In Missouri's second game of the 2016 season, Lock completed 24-for-37 for a career-high 450 yards while tying a school record with five touchdowns against Eastern Michigan in Mizzou's home opener.[11][12] He tossed for three more touchdowns on 23-of-38 passing in Missouri's 28–27 loss to Georgia.[13] His passing total of 1,106 yards was more than any Mizzou quarterback in his first three games ever. He played only the first half against Delaware State, but put up huge numbers in the 79–0 win. In the first half alone, he completed 26 of 36 passes for 402 yards while matching the school record with five touchdowns.[14] He closed his season by sparking a second-half 17-point comeback with a 67-yard touchdown pass to Johnathon Johnson against Arkansas.[15] He finished that game going 16-for-26 with 268 yards and a score.[16] Lock finished the 2016 season with 3,399 passing yards, 23 passing touchdowns, and ten interceptions to go along with a rushing touchdown.[17] Lock finished the 2016 regular season ranked second in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in passing yards (3,399)[18] In the Tigers' 2017 season opener, Lock passed for 521 yards, seven touchdowns, and one interception in a victory over Missouri State.[19] On October 21, against Idaho, he had 467 passing yards, six touchdowns, and one interception to break a five-game losing streak for Missouri.[20] On November 24, on the road against Arkansas, he had 448 yards, five passing touchdowns, and two interceptions.[21] In the 2017 season, Lock led the NCAA (FBS) and set the SEC and Missouri record for passing touchdowns (44) while helping the Tigers reach a bowl game after starting the season 1–5.[22][23][24] He finished the season with 242-of-419 passing (57.8%) for 3,964 yards with 44 touchdowns and 13 interceptions (165.7 rtg.).[25] Lock was selected to the First-team All-SEC.[26] Lock helped lead Missouri to a 3–0 start with 11 passing touchdowns and one interception in the stretch against UT Martin, Wyoming, and Purdue.[27][28][29] On October 20, against Memphis, he passed for 350 yards and four touchdowns in the win.[30] Missouri closed out the regular season with a four-game winning streak against Florida, Vanderbilt, Tennessee, and Arkansas where Lock had nine passing touchdowns to two interceptions while having three rushing touchdowns. In the 2018 season, Lock had 3,498 passing yards, 28 passing touchdowns, and eight interceptions to go along with six rushing touchdowns.[31] He led the SEC in pass attempts and completions in the 2018 season.[32] Lock finished his college football career with a total of 108 (99 passing, 9 rushing) touchdowns.[33] Lock was selected by the Denver Broncos in the second round as the 42nd overall pick in the 2019 NFL draft.[36][37][38] Lock suffered a thumb injury in the preseason and was placed on injured reserve on September 1, 2019.[39] He was designated for return from injured reserve on November 12, 2019, and resumed practicing with the team. On November 30, 2019, the Broncos activated Lock off of injured reserve and named him the starter for their game the next day against the Los Angeles Chargers.[40] He threw for 134 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception, and he moved the Broncos down the field in the last 15 seconds (via a pass interference penalty on the Chargers' Casey Heyward Jr.) to set up a Brandon McManus 53-yard field goal as time expired, quarterbacking the Broncos to a 23–20 win, his first NFL victory.[41] During Week 14 against the Houston Texans, a game in which the Texans were favored by nine points, Lock threw three touchdowns in the first half and led another scoring drive to start the second half, giving his team a 38–3 lead. The Broncos eventually won the game 38–24, and Lock finished with 309 passing yards, three touchdowns, and an interception.[42] Lock started the remainder of the season. In five games, he finished with 1,020 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and three interceptions.[43] He went 4–1 as a starter in 2019 and in the process, tied with legendary Broncos quarterback John Elway for the most franchise wins by a rookie QB with four, only needing five games to accomplish the feat that Elway did not reach until his 10th game.[44] In Week 1 against the Tennessee Titans on Monday Night Football, Lock threw for 216 yards and a touchdown during the 16–14 loss.[45] In Week 2, he left the game early in the first quarter with a shoulder injury against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Without Lock the Broncos lost the game 26–21.[46] In Week 6, Lock returned from his injury against the New England Patriots. He had 189 yards passing and two interceptions, but the Broncos won the game 18–12 thanks to six Brandon McManus field goals.[47] With the win, Lock became the youngest quarterback ever to defeat the Patriots at Gillette Stadium under head coach Bill Belichick, as well as the second quarterback to do so while throwing multiple interceptions (Kurt Warner also accomplished the feat in 2001). In Week 8 against the Chargers, he had 248 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in a 31–30 comeback victory.[48] The third touchdown pass was a game-winning one-yard pass to K. J. Hamler with no time remaining.[49] In Week 9 against the Atlanta Falcons, Lock threw for 313 yards, two touchdown passes, an interception and rushed for 47 yards and another touchdown in the 34–27 loss.[50] In Week 10 against the Las Vegas Raiders, Lock had the worst passing performance of his career, throwing for 257 yards, one touchdown, and 4 interceptions in a 37–12 loss.[51] On November 28, 2020, Lock was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list after coming in close contact with Jeff Driskel, who tested positive for the virus.[52] Lock and the other three quarterbacks on the Broncos roster were fined by the team for violating COVID-19 protocols.[53] He was activated on December 1.[54] In Week 14, against the Carolina Panthers, he had 280 passing yards and four passing touchdowns in a 32–27 victory.[55] In Week 17 against the Raiders, Lock threw for 339 yards and 2 touchdowns in a 32–31 loss.[56] Lock finished the 2020 season with 16 touchdowns and 15 interceptions, tied for the most interceptions in the NFL with Carson Wentz, despite only playing in 13 games. His completion percentage of 57.3% was the lowest among the 35 quarterbacks with at least 150 passing attempts in 2020.[57][58] Lock spent the 2021 preseason in a competition with newly acquired quarterback Teddy Bridgewater. On August 25, Bridgewater was named the starter for week 1[59] ahead of Lock, after a close battle in the first and second preseason games. In Week 4, Lock played against the Baltimore Ravens after Bridgewater suffered a concussion. He completed 12-of-21 (57.1%) passes for a total of 113 yards and an interception, resulting in a 52.3 QB rating in the 23–7 loss.[60][61] In Week 12, Lock entered the game against the Chargers late in the first half after a leg injury temporarily sidelined Bridgewater. Lock completed 4-of-7 (57.1%) for a total of 26 yards and an interception, resulting in a QB rating of 25.6 in the 28–13 win.[62] Bridgewater reentered and finished the game in the second half.[63] In Week 15, Lock came in against the Cincinnati Bengals after Bridgewater left the game with a concussion. He completed 6-of-12 passes (50%) for 88 yards and a touchdown, and lost a fumble in the 15–10 loss.[64] In Week 16, Lock was the starter against the Raiders due to Bridgewater's injury.[65] Lock threw for 153 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions in the 17–13 loss.[66] Lock started for the remainder of the season after Bridgewater was placed on injured reserve.[67] Against the Kansas City Chiefs, Lock completed 12-of-24 passes for 162 yards, rushing for 35 yards and two touchdowns, becoming the first Broncos quarterback to rush for two touchdowns since Tim Tebow in 2011, in the 28–24 loss.[68] On March 16, 2022, Lock was traded to the Seattle Seahawks with two first-round picks, two second-round picks, a fifth-round pick, defensive lineman Shelby Harris, and tight end Noah Fant in exchange for quarterback Russell Wilson.[69] Upon arriving in Seattle, Lock changed his jersey number from #3, which he had worn in Denver and at Missouri, to #2, telling reporters he did so both out of respect for Wilson, who wore #3, and out of a desire to \"write my own story.\"[70] After Lock competed with Geno Smith for three preseason games, Smith was named the starter.[71] Lock never took the field during his first season in Seattle, as Smith took every snap.[72] Lock re-signed with the Seahawks on March 20, 2023.[73] In Week 4, against the New York Giants, Lock came in mid-game for an injured Smith. He led the Seahawks on a 75-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown and was replaced later in the game by Smith.[74] In Week 11, against rival Los Angeles Rams on November 19, 2023, at SoFi Stadium, Lock again came in for Smith who had been momentarily sidelined with an elbow injury following a tackle by Rams’ linebacker Ernest Jones and defensive tackle Aaron Donald.[75][76] Lock played poorly, completing 2-of-6 passes, including a critical interception to Rams' cornerback Derion Kendrick, which ultimately lost the game for the Seahawks.[77][78][79] In Week 14, against the San Francisco 49ers, Lock had his first start since being traded to Seattle, due to Smith suffering a groin injury. He completed 22-of-31 for 269 yards, with two touchdowns and two interceptions, in a 16–28 loss.[80] Although Smith was active for the Week 15 game against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had not recovered enough to start, making Lock the starter again.[80] With the Seahawks down 13–17 and 1:52 left in the game, Lock led a 92-yard touchdown drive, concluding with a 29-yard touchdown throw to Jaxon Smith-Njigba with 0:28 left. The Seahawks won 20–17.[81] Lock finished the season with three touchdowns and three interceptions for a total QBR of 44.9.[82] On 14 March, Lock signed with the New York Giants on a one-year deal worth $5 million.[83] Once thought to be competing with Daniel Jones for the starting quarterback job, Lock asserted that he was brought in to be a backup.[84] Lock was named the starter for the Giants' Week 13 Thanksgiving matchup against the Dallas Cowboys, following the release of Jones and an injury to Tommy DeVito.[85] He threw a career-high equalling four touchdown passes in the Giants' week 17 win over the Indianapolis Colts on 29 December.[86] Lock married model and influencer Natalie Newman in April 2023.[87]",

                "content": "Who said the Giants don’t have a quarterback? Drew Lock delivered the best passing game by a Giants quarterback since the end of the 2019 season Sunday to fuel a stunning offensive outburst from the NFL’s lowest scoring team in a 45-33 upset victory against the Colts. “Almost perfect,” receiver Darius Slayton said of Lock’s performance. “It’s hard to play any better than that.” Of course, one great game by a journeyman backup heading to free agency after the season isn’t going to alter the Giants’ plan to draft a new franchise quarterback — even though that path became a little stickier because the win to snap a 10-game slide bumped them from holding the No. 1 pick in 2025. But there was no ignoring the rarity of Lock’s 309-yard, four-touchdown (and a fifth touchdown on the ground) performance. He joined Tommy DeVito (once) as the only Giants to throw for three or more touchdowns in a game since the start of the 2020 season, and had the first five-touchdown game by a Giants quarterback since Daniel Jones on Dec. 22, 2019. “It means a lot,” Lock said after completing 17-of-23 passes. “I knew it was in me.” Head coach Brian Daboll was admittedly hard on Lock all week after he threw two interceptions returned for touchdowns last week in a loss to the Falcons. The Giants stuck with Lock — who they strangely passed over to go with Tommy DeVito once the Jones Era ended in November — for another start (his fourth in the six games since Jones was released) and he delivered. “That’s how the offense needs to perform. That’s how the quarterback needs to perform,” Daboll said. “I’m happy with Drew and how he played. I’m proud of him. It wasn’t great last week. I was on him pretty good. But he’s a mentally tough guy and had a good week.” Lock responded well to Daboll’s style. “Dabes is fiery,” Lock said. “But at the same time … I’ve been jumped before. I’ve been yelled at. I’m used to that. You can shell up or you can take it like a man. I’ve always been the one that kind of gets me going. I need a little bit of that. He expects a lot from me, as I do myself. I can at least appreciate that.” In the first quarter, Lock completed 7-of-8 passes with three touchdowns — one each to receivers Malik Nabers, Wan’Dale Robinson and Darius Slayton.

Enjoy this Post Sports+ exclusive newsletter! He threw another to Nabers, but clinched the win with his legs on a five-yard touchdown scramble on third-and-goal to extend the lead to 42-33 with 2:57 to go. “He was balling,” right tackle Jermaine Eluemunor said. “He was doing his little [shuffle] thing. That’s a guy who has taken the brunt of it. It’s hard to play quarterback. It’s hard to play quarterback in New York. For him to go out there and do his thing was cool to see.” Advertisement",

So, (running back Tyrone) Tracy (Jr.), he won't practice. Again, it's Tuesday, so it's a little different. (Wide receiver Malik) Nabers, (center) John Michael (Schmitz Jr.), (cornerback Greg) Stroman (Jr.), (safety Raheem) Layne, (defensive tackle Cory) Durden, (inside linebacker Micah) McFadden and (cornerback) Dru Phillips. Q: Dru Phillips, for what it's worth, from Pro Football Focus is ranked one of the top five corners in the NFL this year. Has he had that kind of good year for you guys? BRIAN DABOLL: I think he's done a nice job for us. He's a physical player, I think he's shown that. Where he plays in particular, he's part of a lot of run fits. He's an aggressive tackler and continues to improve. He's young player that definitely has a lot of upside and will continue to develop. Q: What is his next… What's his upside? BRIAN DABOLL: I think he's a good football player. Again, I think a lot of those guys that we drafted this past year have really done a nice job of performing when they've had opportunities to. So, he'll be a good young player to continue to develop. Create turnovers, knock the ball out, intercept the pass, those are all things that you need to do to be an elite defensive back. Q: You went with Tommy (DeVito) out of the bye week. With two weeks here, he's a younger guy, undrafted rookie last year, why not give him an opportunity in the last couple weeks just to see what you have there? BRIAN DABOLL: I'd say it's been one week, next week, based on, I'd say, injury, besides that first week. So, try to get two weeks of the same cadence, same play caller in the huddle and we'll go with Drew (Lock). Q: Recognizing that there were business decisions involved as well, with what's happened at quarterback since then, does any part of you look back and say you wish you had stuck with Daniel (Jones)? BRIAN DABOLL: I just focus on where we're at right now. So, we'll do everything we can do to get all three of those guys ready because, obviously, you never know. That's where our focus is. Q: With this being the last home game, do you kind of preach that message to the guys, 'Hey, it's another week,' but also you guys don't want to be the first team that goes 0-9 at home? BRIAN DABOLL: We'll try to get a win and do everything we can do to get a win. Q: What would it mean to you to get a home win, at this point? BRIAN DABOLL: We're trying to get a win in any way, shape or form. I can understand coming to a game and watching your team not win, that's no fun. It's certainly no fun for anybody involved and we're doing everything we can to try to do that for us but also for the people that come out and support us. Q: I know you probably aren't paying a ton of attention, but the fan base is paying attention to it. Do you notice the other day when the Raiders win and you guys are in position now to get the No. 1 pick? Is there a reaction around here? Do people react to that at all? BRIAN DABOLL: I'd say we are laser focused on what we need to do to get ready to play this week. Q: (Indianapolis Colts running back) Jonathan Taylor. What's the challenge there? He had a pretty embarrassing moment two weeks ago and seemed to come back with quite some vengeance… BRIAN DABOLL: Yeah, I saw that play. He's an explosive player. He's big, he's strong, he's fast. They rushed for over 300 yards last game against Tennessee, but he had two of them that went for 140 (yards). He's a very good player. One of the better (running) backs in the league and we've seen (New Orleans Saints running back Alvin) Kamara and (Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick) Henry and (Atlanta Falcons running back) Bijan (Robinson) last week. The hits keep coming. Q: Then Anthony Richardson, I know that wasn't a draft that you guys were in the quarterback market. But you and I think every coach I've ever talked to, always say you do work on all the quarterbacks. So, what was your pre-draft thoughts on him and where he is now? BRIAN DABOLL: I'd say he's an explosive player, explosive athlete. He has a cannon for an arm, can throw it a far way. They're doing a nice job… Obviously, he runs the ball. But he's plenty talented enough to throw it where he needs to throw it. Anytime you have a young quarterback, you continue to develop him. It's not going to be perfect, for most of the quarterbacks that get drafted right out the gate. I think he's done a nice job. He's got all the skill set in the world. Again, he's a dual threat player and he can affect any part of the field. Whether it's with his legs or throwing it however far he needs to throw it. He's got some pretty good skill players that he uses. (Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Josh) Downs has done a heck of a job. I thought he was really going to be a good player coming out of there. He's continuing to develop and as he continues to develop, his skill set shows. Q: The Colts don't have great defensive numbers, but what do they do that is a concern? BRIAN DABOLL: (Indianapolis Colts Defensive Coordinator) Coach (Gus) Bradley, he's done it for a long time. Gus (Bradley) has been in this league for a long time. They got two really good interior players, and they have a good team defensive scheme. They play their certain style that they'd like to play with. Every team in the league is a good football team. They got a lot of good players. They got good coaches. They did a heck of a job, I know it ended up being 38-30 against Tennessee, but they really started out the game really strong. It was 38-7 with three minutes left in the third quarter going into the fourth. So, I think (Indianapolis Colts Head Coach) Shane (Steichen) has done a nice job. So has Gus (Bradley). Q: Going back to (Jonathan) Taylor. You guys did a good job slowing down (Alvin) Kamara) and (Derrick) Henry. Can you take some encouragement from that? Or does how Bijan (Robinson) played concern you about your front? BRIAN DABOLL: I would say every week is a new week. So, there's certainly different challenges for each week. I'm not saying it's the same, but you have (Derrick) Henry and Lamar (Jackson) and that duo and now you got (Anthony) Richardson (and Jonathan Taylor). Every week is a new challenge. I think we've done a much better job these last few weeks, really with our run defense. Yards per carry, tackling and those things have been a point of emphasis. They've been a point of emphasis all year, but these last few weeks, these young guys have done a nice job. I think the linebackers have really played well, downhill, tackled well and it'll certainly be a challenge this week with… Again, you don't really hear of rushing for 330 plus yards in an NFL game. It'll be a challenge. Q: Obviously it's been a tough year overall for you guys, but do you give a special holiday message to your team when you go through times like this? BRIAN DABOLL: We'll come out here to practice. We'll have tomorrow off to spend some time with their loved ones. We appreciate all their efforts and get ready to go out there and have a good week to play against Colts here. Q: Assuming Micah (McFadden) is healthy. How have you been impressed with (inside linebacker) Darius (Muasau) of his game last week? And, obviously, if he has a bigger role, how confident are you that he can handle that? BRIAN DABOLL: He's another rookie that's done a nice job for us. Smart, tough, instinctive and has been productive since he's been able to play. Him and Micah, they've done a nice job. He's continued to develop. I think (Inside Linebackers Coach) Egs (John Egorugwu) has done a really good job with him. He's got the right traits: cares about football, young professional, got a good skill set and tough. He's a good young player to work with. Quarterback Drew Lock Q: How are you feeling? (Head Coach Brian Daboll) Dabs said you went for an MRI yesterday, how'd everything check out? DREW LOCK: Everything came back good. It's one of those – right hand, right shoulder. If it feels just anything, 'hey, let's go get this looked at just make sure everything's all right.' It came back good, so rocking and rolling. Q: Is that from a hit or from a throw? DREW LOCK: Yeah, it was the third down conversion to (tight end Daniel Bellinger) Belly, just threw it. Arm came across, (Falcons outside linebacker) Matthew (Judon) got me there towards the end. Arm got yanked across, had to go check it out. So, played the rest of the game, it was the second, third down in the game, but just wanted to get it looked at. Q: Do you have a feel for who you're going to be taking snaps from? DREW LOCK: I've gone with just about all of them. (Center) John Michael (Schmitz Jr.), (guard Greg Van Roten) GVR, (guard Austin Schlottmann) Schlotty. Schlotty played center for me in Denver a couple times, played guard for me in Denver a couple times. I'm pretty familiar with all the guys that are rotating in there. Q: When you went back and looked at the game, did you look at the first interception and say, 'what didn't I see'? DREW LOCK: I mean I knew what I didn't see. It was more about the procedure pre-snap. If we're not right, it's a busted play. Like I said after the game, take care of the football. Trying to get everything set, getting back to the center, trying to get the ball off. A pivotal point in the game, take care of the football, just eat it and take a sack. Sacks are way better than seven points to the other team. Q: How much have you guys talked about not wanting to go 0-9 at home this season? Does that come across as motivation or anything? DREW LOCK: No, you don't want to lose anywhere. It's not extra emphasis whether it's at home or away. Q: What would a win at home mean to you guys when you get there? DREW LOCK: Everything. When you're on a losing streak, you want to get that win. Like I said whether it's at home or away, you're fighting every week for a win. And if you do lose, flush it and learn from it and move on. Q: You've got a pair of rookies edging on that 1,000-yard mark. How aware are you of that when you're the quarterback, knowing (wide receiver) Malik (Nabers) and (running back Tyrone) Tracy (Jr.) are right there? DREW LOCK: Yeah, they never say anything to you, of course. But you hear about it, and you want to get that done for them. It'd be cool for them to have that achievement. But, the ultimate goal is to win a football game. So, by the way of the game, if we can get a win and pick that up for them at the same time, that'd be pretty cool. Q: Things have been so disjointed at the quarterback spot this year. One of the things that Dabs said to us today is, 'I want to see him get two back-to-back starts.' That's an important thing. How does that factor into your comfort zone and what you're trying to do by getting back-to-back starts again? DREW LOCK: It definitely adds to it. Being able to have a week of practice, back-to-back weeks of practice. Knowing what we did the week before, take the things we need to get better at into this week and actually be able to go out there and do it is something I'm looking forward to. Similar cadences with the guys, being in the huddle together. I think it can only be a positive for such a roller coaster out of that spot. Q: In the middle of all this, is it good to have Christmas? DREW LOCK: Of course, of course, you hear the locker room. It's a very important day for a lot of us, especially myself, family getting to be in town. It's a good little reset. Q: Any fun plans for tomorrow? DREW LOCK: My son's first Christmas. Don't know if he's really going to be able to open presents or if he's going to tear them up and then look to go tear another one up. Probably play with the wrapping paper more than the things we bought him. But it's the first one, I'm excited, it'll be cool. A day I won't forget. Q: Got him a puppy? DREW LOCK: No, (laughs) I got him a big stuffed elephant. That's about the only animal I'm getting close to, but no puppy, not yet. (Laughs) Q: What did it say about (quarterback) Daniel Jones that he bought all the offensive linemen a Christmas gift, a quarterback tradition, even though he's not here anymore? DREW LOCK: Class act. There's always the (quarterback) 'Tommy (DeVito), are you getting it?' 'Drew, are you getting it?' And then, out of nowhere, DJ comes in, saves me and Tommy once again, and then takes care of the guys. I expected nothing less from the guy. That's just who he is, and cares about these guys still. Texts here and there, he's just a good man. Q: All that disjointed, I think, was the word used, quarterback carousel that you guys have had. Not that you wouldn't appreciate this stat anyway, but especially right now, can you believe (Former Giants quarterback) Eli Manning played 210 consecutive starts here? DREW LOCK: That's pretty good. That's tough to do on any team, any position. That's tough to do, especially the quarterback spot. Q: Just because he's up for the Hall of Fame this year. So, quarterback to quarterback, I imagine that stat blows your mind… DREW LOCK: It's very impressive, especially with the amount – he was playing a couple extra games at the end of the year too, so add those into there. That's impressive. Q: Going back to (Tyrone) Tracy, what makes him such a special running back? Obviously, he had that touchdown pass to him, he can catch up in the backfield really well. What makes him such a great back for you? DREW LOCK: Yeah, he's got great feel, whether that's out in routes, whether that's in between the tackles, whether that's outside zone. Something you can't really coach, it's kind of something he's been born with and can feel. It's been impressive to watch, especially with him playing so little running back in his career. Being able to have that feel and without really having the reps in the position is special. Q: Was it cool that he caught that pass and made you think, 'Oh that's why he was a receiver?' DREW LOCK: Yes, being able to go up, toe tap, hold it on with one hand. I can appreciate that; I needed that one.
