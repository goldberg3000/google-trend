                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Vikings got a big lead on the rival Green Bay Packers back in September, going up 28-0 before nearly coughing up the advantage entirely. Three months later, they offered up a sequel for the U.S. Bank Stadium crowd, nearly surrendering a 27-10 fourth-quarter lead before outlasting their NFC North rivals for a critical 27-25 victory, their ninth straight on the 2024 season. Sam Darnold turned in an MVP-caliber performance to help Minnesota dominate much of the afternoon, while Brian Flores' defense suffocated Jordan Love and Co. until the final quarter, when Green Bay surged back to life thanks to a couple of surgical drives through the air. Vikings kicker Will Reichard also contributed to the game's close finish, missing two of four field goals while also failing to hit the landing zone on a kickoff, granting the Packers favorable field position. Sunday's anticipated showdown started slowly, with both sides trading stingy defensive stands, but Darnold settled in after feeding speedy wide receiver Jalen Nailor, who saw an uptick in opportunities with Green Bay zeroing in on star pass catcher Justin Jefferson. From there, he had little trouble spreading the ball to the array of weapons in Kevin O'Connell's lineup, with Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson all corralling at least five catches against a \"D\" missing star corner Jaire Alexander. Flores' group, meanwhile, all but rendered the Packers' pass game a non-factor early. Missing deep threat Christian Watson, Love managed just 45 yards through the air in the game's first two quarters, and while bruising back Josh Jacobs had a heavy workload up the middle, Green Bay spent most of the rematch playing catch-up. Things finally clicked late, with Love guiding a pair of fourth-quarter touchdown drives while feeding Romeo Doubs, but it was too little, too late. The win bumps the Vikings to 14-2 on the season and sets up a winner-take-all against the Lions in Week 18 for the NFC North title and home-field advantage. It also drops the Packers to 11-5 in the North. Take your pick of Darnold's pretty throws, basically. This one to Addison helped give Minnesota a 20-3 advantage, showcasing the quarterback's steadiness as a pocket-climber and downfield thrower: The Vikings (14-2) will close their 2024 season with a pivotal Week 18 rematch in Detroit, where they'll fight the Lions (13-2) for the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs, plus the NFC North crown. The Packers (11-5), meanwhile, will finish their regular season against the Chicago Bears (4-12), who fell to the Seattle Seahawks in an ugly 6-3 contest in Week 17. It wasn't pretty late, but Minnesota pulls it off, sealing the deal by getting a first down on a Sam Darnold-to-Cam Akers dump-off. Jordan Love's late-game heroics were strong, but it was too little, too late for Green Bay. The Vikings officially improve to 14-2, while the Packers drop to 11-5. What a finish. Wow. Down 20-3 earlier, the Packers are suddenly within two points after Jordan Love orchestrates a beautiful nine-play scoring series. Feeding his entire makeshift receiving corps, including Romeo Doubs, Bo Melton and Dontayvion Wicks, he ultimately hits Malik Heath over the middle for the score. It's now 27-25 Vikings, and Minnesota has a chance to seal it by moving the chains on the ensuing drive. But things suddenly look tight, and the Vikings' errors on the margins could come back to bite them; they had 12 men on the field on the Packers' score, and kicker Will Reichard's two field goal misses look even more glaring now. Don't turn this one off just yet. The Vikings have been dominating, but seemingly out of nowhere Matt LaFleur produces a nine-play, 67-yard scoring series headlined by a couple of long strikes from Jordan Love -- first to Bo Melton, then to Tucker Kraft. Josh Jacobs and Emanuel Wilson then share touches on the ground, with the latter powering forward for the score. It's 27-18 after Love finds Romeo Doubs for the two-point try, meaning Green Bay isn't done yet. Brian Flores' secondary nowhere to be found on this drive. The Vikings have a chance to go up 30-10, but Will Reichard bangs a 43-yard field goal off the uprights. He's now missed two of four field goal tries on the day. Probably the only blemish for Minnesota thus far. Green Bay has nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Down 27-10 with the clock ticking in the fourth, Jordan Love's pocket collapses and Andrew Van Ginkel sandwiches him for the sack to force a punt. That means the Packers went backwards two yards on their six-play series. They have just nine first downs on the day. We can't call this one yet, because the Pack did threaten a comeback against these Vikings despite falling behind 28-0 in their September meeting, but boy does this one look good for Minnesota. Sam Darnold is 21 of 22 on passes between the numbers against the Packers, per ESPN. In other words, the Vikings are absolutely killing it over the middle of the field. Green Bay not having Quay Walker and Jaire Alexander hasn't helped. It's partly why everything's coming up purple in this one. Everybody eats in Minnesota! Sam Darnold slings another beauty to Jordan Addison, who's up to six catches on the day, and after a couple of Aaron Jones tosses, Cam Akers gets the dump-off screen, fighting through a few would-be tacklers to reach the end zone and put the Vikings up 27-10. The Packers have no answers for the wide array of weapons. Minnesota now has 22 first downs to Green Bay's eight, and owns the time-of-possession battle 27:33 to 16:36. It's been a one-sided affair except for the one Darnold pick. Four plays after Carrington Valentine's interception of Sam Darnold, the Packers score their first touchdown of the day, feeding Josh Jacobs at the goal line. It's now 20-10 Vikings, and we've got ourselves a ballgame. Jeff Hafley's \"D\" had struggled to get off the field for a while, so perhaps this will turn the tide. Absolutely desperate for a big play, Green Bay gets one on the defensive side, baiting Sam Darnold into a sideline shot. Aiming for T.J. Hockenson with pressure in his face, Darnold instead zips it to Packers cornerback Carrington Valentine, with star safety Xavier McKinney also in the area. The much-needed takeaway puts Green Bay in scoring range about halfway through the third. Christian Watson's injury-related absence is being felt by the Packers offense. Jordan Love has just a single pass completion over 10 yards in this game. Nobody's really separating downfield, and while Matt LaFleur's focus has been on wearing down Minnesota with Josh Jacobs, that approach isn't necessarily ideal when you're down 20-3. The Packers need a splash play in a hurry. Jordan Love may have the most gifted arm in the NFC North, but it's yet to matter today. After finding Jalen Nailor for another big gain, Sam Darnold stands tall amid pressure off the edge and threads a perfect downfield end-zone shot to Jordan Addison, making up for an earlier deep shot that got broken up. Rookie safety Javon Bullard is on the wrong end of the pass coverage for Green Bay, and all of a sudden Minnesota leads this by three scores. That's passing touchdown No. 34 for Darnold on the year. Will Reichard misses from 55 yards out on a last-second field goal try, but the Packers get flagged for offsides, giving the Vikings a second chance at extra points. Reichard delivers from 50, and we go into the break with Minnesota up 10 points, owning a 13-3 advantage. Credit to Brian Flores' defense for really limiting the Jordan Love-led aerial attack thus far. Sam Darnold also looks especially sharp, even with Justin Jefferson blanketed by the Green Bay secondary, zipping some chain-moving darts into tight windows. Jalen Nailor is up to 59 yards on four catches as Sam Darnold's top target in lieu of Justin Jefferson drawing extra attention from the Packers. His latest reception, a 16-yarder, comes in a tight window and helps set up a 25-yard Will Reichard field goal, and we've got ourselves a 10-3 ballgame in favor of Minnesota. That scoring drive goes 69 yards over 10 plays. Halftime is fast approaching. Josh Jacobs gets a big workload on Green Bay's latest series, and the Packers push the rock to the Vikings 23, but on fourth-and-3, Jordan Love gets jumpy in the pocket and can't quite connect with Jayden Reed over the middle. Reed has yet to secure a catch on the day, and the ball goes back to Minnesota. Love is 7 of 11 for 45 yards so far, and only Dontayvion Wicks has more than one catch. Most of Matt LaFleur's attack has centered on Jacobs' bruising ground game. The Vikings are toughing it out. Injury alert: Vikings edge rusher Pat Jones II walks off after taking a shot to the knee from Packers tight end Tucker Kraft. Required some attention from trainers before limping his way to the sidelines. Justin Jefferson is getting almost no looks as the Packers focus their attention on the Vikings' top pass catcher, but that opens the door for Jalen Nailor, who outraces the entire Green Bay secondary for a 31-yard score. That's Sam Darnold's 33rd touchdown pass of the year, and it puts the Vikes up 7-3 in this one. Josh Jacobs rumbles into Minnesota territory with another strong dose of touches, but the Vikings hold firm inside the 10, with Josh Metellus stuffing Luke Musgrave on third down. So Green Bay goes up first but settles for a 22-yard field goal from Brandon McManus. It's 3-0 Packers at U.S. Bank Stadium. This one's been a gritty defensive affair thus far, with Brian Flores and Jeff Hafley both showcasing strong stuff. Jordan Addison burns Keisean Nixon on the outside for a potential score, but Sam Darnold floats it high rather than with velocity, and Nixon makes a leaping recovery to break up the connection. Then Will Reichard boots a field goal try from 57 yards out, and it bounces off the crossbar. So we're still at 0-0 here. Darnold is facing some heat up the middle from the Packers front. Green Bay takes to the air on its second series, perhaps as a response to Josh Jacobs' early fumble, and Jordan Love tries for three straight downfield shots, nearly connecting with Dontayvion Wicks. But the passes are just off, and the last one is nearly picked by Harrison Smith over the middle. So it's a punt, and the Vikings are back in control. Three drives so far, and three defensive stands. Josh Jacobs' fumble put Minnesota in a great position near midfield, but Jeff Hafley's defense shows up, putting pressure in Sam Darnold's face on back-to-back plays to force a punt. Kenny Clark got the first pressure, and Rashan Gary nearly came up with a sack on third down. Green Bay starts strong with a couple of tough Josh Jacobs carries and a quick first-down catch by Dontayvion Wicks, but then Jacobs coughs up the ball on a hit from Jerry Tillery. Vikings safety Cam Bynum (who else?) jumps on it, and we've got out first turnover already. Former Vikings Pro Bowl defensive lineman Pat Williams shows up at U.S. Bank Stadium to blow the pregame Gjallarhorn ahead of the opening kickoff. A \"Skol\" chant follows, and we're ready to go. The Packers win the coin toss and elect to receive the ball. It's Jordan Love up first in Minnesota. The fake snow is falling inside U.S. Bank Stadium as the Vikings and Packers prepare to take the field. Live from U.S. Bank Stadium, we've got you covered with all the key notes and analysis from today's matchup. First up: The Packers are without some big names in Minnesota, with Jaire Alexander, Christian Watson and Quay Walker among notable inactives. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. PHILADELPHIA -- In a battle of backup quarterbacks, the host Philadelphia Eagles (13-3) had the definitive edge over the Dallas Cowboys (7-9) as they dominated in a decisive 41-7 Week 17 victory. They clinched the 2024 NFC East division title with the win. It's their first division title since 2022, a year that ended with them as the Super Bowl runner up. It's also their 11th NFC East division title since 2001, which is the most in the division in that span. Philadelphia also now has their fourth ever 13-win season, which is key because they have reached the Super Bowl in each of the last three occurrences (2004, 2017, 2022). After two three-and-outs to start the game, the Eagles scored on their next six drives -- four touchdowns and two field goals. Philadelphia also secured its first sweep of the Cowboys since 2011. Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett, the 2022 first-round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers who is filling in for an injured Jalen Hurts (concussion), produced a strong performance. He threw for 143 yards and a touchdown on 10 of 15 passing while adding a 1-yard rushing score via the tush push to end the first half. He threw a 22-yard scoring strike to Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith with 6:38 left in the half after Smith cooked backup Cowboys corner Andrew Booth by multiple steps for the touchdown. Pickett exited the game early in the third quarter after aggravating his ribs injury on a late hit by Dallas defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa, who was penalized for roughing the passer. He clearly hit Pickett late after the football was gone. As a result, Eagles third-string quarterback Tanner McKee, a 2023 sixth-round pick out of Stanford, subbed into the game. McKee's first full drive ended with him throwing his first NFL regular-season touchdown pass to Eagles No. 1 receiver A.J. Brown on a 20-yard scoring strike. Brown got a stop on Cowboys All-Pro corner DaRon Bland, and McKee threw a perfectly placed pass over Brown's outside shoulder for the touchdown. That increased the Eagles' lead to 34-7 over the Cowboys with 2:44 left in the third quarter. He then hit Smith on an underneath throw, and he took the football all the way to the house with ease for a 25-yard receiving touchdown. McKee finished with 54 yards passing and two touchdowns on 3 of 4 passing, and Smith totaled 120 yards receiving and two touchdowns on six catches. Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush, their eight-year veteran backup who is filling in for an injured Dak Prescott (hamstring tear), played slightly better than his first start of the season back in Week 10, a 34-6 home defeat against the Eagles. He threw a 69-yard pick six to Philadelphia safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson on the opening drive of the game, but he bounced back to throw a 4-yard goal-line fade touchdown to Dallas wide receiver Jalen Tolbert on the game's second possession. At the end of the first half, Rush sailed a deep throw intended for wide receiver Brandin Cooks on third-and-5, and Gardner-Johnson picked him off for the second time. He returned the football down to the Eagles' 35-yard line with 36 seconds left in the half. It's Gardner-Johnson's second career game with multiple interceptions, and both have come against the Cowboys. Rush finished the game with 147 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions on 15 of 28 passing. With a massive lead, 2024 NFL rushing yards leader Saquon Barkley was able to take over in the second half. He went off for 167 yards on 31 carries Sunday afternoon to become the ninth player in NFL history to register at least 2,000 rushing yards in a single season. Here are the five main takeaways from the Eagles' Week 17 victory: The Eagles defense took a massive hit once Gardner-Johnson was ejected from last Sunday's loss to the Washington Commanders as a result of two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Gardner-Johnson's ejection certainly affected how the Eagles defense played Jayden Daniels, who was 16 of 24 for 150 yards and three touchdowns to one interception (105.9 passer rating) after the defender's disqualification. The Commanders scored 22 fourth-quarter points in the comeback victory, all with Gardner-Johnson off the field. Gardner-Johnson was back for this game and made an impact on the first series. On third-and-3 from the Eagles' 35-yard line, Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush threw a pass across the middle of the field and Gardner-Johnson read it for the interception. He took the takeaway 69 yards the other way for a touchdown to give the Eagles an early 7-0 lead with 11:55 remaining in the first quarter. Gardner-Johnson later had his second interception that set the Eagles up for a touchdown in the final seconds of the first half. The Eagles had three takeaways in the first half, all of which led to points. Even when Gardner-Johnson is struggling in coverage, he's making turnover-worthy plays for the Eagles to change the course of a game. In 28 games with the Eagles, Gardner-Johnson has 12 interceptions (6+ in each season played). He's a difference maker on this defense. Whatever the scripted game plan was in the first quarter of Pickett's start (filling in for Jalen Hurts as he was ruled out with a concussion), it wasn't what the Eagles were hoping for. A Landon Dickerson false start on the first play based the Eagles up to a first-and-15. Two incomplete passes and a checkdown to Kenneth Gainwell resulted in the first Eagles three-and-out. On the Eagles' second offensive possession, Pickett didn't even throw the football. With DeVonta Smith on the sidelines (wrist injury), the Eagles had Saquon Barkley carry the ball on three consecutive plays -- one via direct snap -- before choosing to punt on fourth-and-1 on their own 46-yard line. The decision to punt showed a lack of trust in Pickett to get the first down, with his arm or legs, or hand the ball off and get the first down. Six plays for 14 yards on the Eagles' first two series, and a lack of trust in Pickett. Different quarterback, same slow start. The Eagles opened things up for Pickett on the third drive, as he went 6 of 6 for 72 yards and a touchdown -- a 22-yard pass to DeVonta Smith. In the second quarter, 8 of 11 for 128 yards with a touchdown for a 141.5 passer rating. This doesn't include the rushing touchdown he had to get the Eagles up 24-7 at halftime. Pickett found an early connection with Smith once the Eagles opened up the passing game, hitting him three times for 74 yards and a score -- including a 49-yard pass to Smith that resulted in the 1-yard touchdown run just before the half. While it took the Eagles three series to get Pickett comfortable, opening things up for the quarterback certainly sparked the offense. Pickett left the game with a rib injury in the third quarter, yet the Eagles offense didn't miss a beat once third-string quarterback Tanner McKee entered the game. McKee, elevated to the No. 2 quarterback with Hurts out, threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to A.J. brown to put the Eagles up 34-7 late in the third quarter. The Eagles had a run-heavy offense once McKee entered the game with a big lead, yet he went 2 of 3 for 29 yards and a touchdown pass to Brown on his first series. He then followed with a 25-yard touchdown pass to DeVonta Smith on his second series, going 3 of 4 for 54 yards and two touchdowns for a 154.2 rating on his first two series. Whether it was Pickett or McKee, the Eagles offense was clicking from the second quarter on. Barkley reached the 2,000-yard rushing plateau on Sunday, becoming the ninth running back to amass 2,000 rushing yards in a season. He's eighth all-time for rushing yards in a season with 2,005. The chase is officially on in regards to Dickerson's record. Barkley finished with 31 carries for 167 yards, averaging 5.4 yards per carry. putting himself in striking distance of the mark. Dickerson rushed for 2,105 yards in 1984 and Barkley is 101 yards away from passing him. Barkley is averaging 125.3 rushing yards per game this season, which would put him on pace to pass Dickerson. Will the Eagles play him in Week 18? The 2,000-yard plateau was a goal of Barkley's and he achieved it. Just 101 yards away from Dickerson is approachable, even if the Eagles do play a meaningless game in Week 18. One of the hardest records in sports is Dickerson's rushing record. This mark can be broken if the Eagles decide to play barkley in Week 18, but it will likely be his call. The Cowboys have inserted 2021 third overall pick quarterback Trey Lance into the game with 2:24 left to play. Cowboys wide receiver Jalen Brooks and Cowboys cornerback Troy Pride, along with Eagles cornerback Sidney Brown, were ejected for fighting. Cowboys All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey drills a 61-yard field goal off the right upright for a missed field goal. The Eagles take over at the Cowboys' 49 up 41-7 with 4:40 left to play. Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith caught an underneath pass from Tanner McKee and left the Dallas defense in the dust for a 25-yard receiving touchdown, his second score of the day. The Eagles lead 41-7 with 10:03 left to play. Utter domination. Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is now up to 2,005 rushing yards, and he is the ninth player in NFL history to run for over 2,000 yards in a single season. Dallas commits their fourth turnover of the day with running back Rico Dowdle fumbling on third-and-5. Philadelphia linebacker Nolan Smith forced the fumble, and Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean recovered the loose ball. Philadelphia takes over at their own 25 up 34-7 with 14:20 left in the game. Tanner McKee threw his first NFL regular season touchdown pass to Eagles No. 1 receiver A.J. Brown for a 20-yard scoring strike. Brown got a step on Cowboys All-Pro corner DaRon Bland, and McKee threw a perfectly placed pass over Brown's outside shoulder for the touchdown. The Eagles lead 34-7 over the Cowboys with 2:44 left in the third quarter. Eagles backup quarterback Kenny Pickett (ribs) is officially questionable to return. He initially suffered a ribs injury a week ago against the Washington Commanders. Third-string quarterback Tanner McKee is primed to lead this drive after the Cowboys went run-run-pass for a three-and-out on their latest drive. The Eagles lead 27-7 with 6:34 left in the third quarter. An A.J. Brown receiving touchdown gets nullified by a holding penalty on Landon Dickerson trying to contain Cowboys All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons. Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett suffered an injury on the play, and Philadelphia subbed in third-stringer Tanner McKee to take the snap on third-and-goal from the Cowboys' 17. He handed off to Barkley for a gain of nine, and the Eagles took three more points on a 26-yard field goal. Philadelphia leads 27-7 with 8:03 left in the third quarter. The Eagles are marching up the field with ease to start the second half. Following a near interception by Pickett, it's been all runs by Saquon Barkley. A disaster for Dallas on their last drive of the half. Quarterback Cooper Rush sailed a deep throw intended for wide receiver Brandin Cooks on third-and-5, and Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson picked off Rush for the second time. He returned the football down to the Eagles' 35 with 36 seconds left in the half. It's Gardner-Johnson's second career game with multiple interceptions, and both have come against the Cowboys. Philly extends their lead to 10, 17-7, following Jake Elliott's 31-yard field. They can double dip with points since they start the second half with the football. Dallas has 1:55 on the clock and one timeout left. The Cowboys commit their second turnover of the half with tight end Jake Ferguson getting stripped by Eagles linebacker Oren Burks. Philadelphia defensive tackle Jordan Davis recovered the loose ball for the takeaway. Philadelphia takes over at the Cowboys' 39 up 14-7 with 6:27 left to play. The Eagles crowd is now chanting \"Dallas sucks.\" Dallas' lack of depth at cornerback because of injuries was just on full display. Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith cooked backup corner Andrew Booth with ease, getting open by multiple steps, which is how Philadelphia fill-in quarterback Kenny Pickett was able to hit him for a 22-yard touchdown. Philadelphia is back in front by seven, 14-7, with 6:38 left in the first half. The Cowboys take a deep shot down the left sideline to wide receiver Jonathan Mingo on third-and-1 instead of running with Dowdle, and it doesn't work. Mingo cooked Eagles first-round rookie corner Quinyon Mitchell, but he couldn't track Rush's throw. That led to the football harmlessly hitting the ground for an incompletion. Dallas punts it away, and Philadelphia fair-caught the football at their own 19. It's seven to seven with 12:49 left in the first half. After NFL rushing yards leader Saquon Barkley didn't touch the football on the Eagles' opening drive, the Eagles gave up three consecutives runs. However, he netted nine yards, and the Eagles punted the football away for a touchback. Philadelphia decided they would take their chances vs. Cooper Rush instead of potentially giving Dallas a short field if they bungled a fourth down attempt with Kenny Pickett at quarterback. It's a 7-7 game with 56 seconds left in the first quarter. Dallas goes three-and-out up against their own goal line, and they punt it away. The Cowboys got good hang time on the punt, so they were able to limit returner Cooper DeJean to just a yard on the return. The Eagles will have their second offensive possession starting at their own 37 in a 7-7 game with 2:48 left in the first quarter. Following a first down false start penalty, Eagle backup quarterback Kenny Pickett threw two consecutive incompletions, and then a short five-yarder to running back Kenneth Gainwell. Philadelphia goes three-and-out to start, and Dallas gets the football back on their own nine after a 52-yard punt by the Eagles. Eagles edge rusher Bryce Huff (shoulder) is questionable to return. Cooper Rush bounced back in a big way from his pick-six by capping the Cowboys' ensuing drive with a four-yard touchdown pass on a goal line fade to wide receiver Jalen Tolbert. Dallas continues to fight for head coach Mike McCarthy. This game is tied at seven with 5:38 left in the first quarter. Kenny Pickett and the Eagles offense will take the field for the first time today up next. With All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb out, Brandin Cooks is the Cowboys' clear cut No. 1 option in the passing game early on. Quarterback Cooper Rush has targeted him five times already, and Cooks has hauled in two of them for 38 yards, including 22 yards on the last play to move the chains on a third-and-9. Cooper Rush had been on a roll with wins in four of the last five games, which included a stretch of nine touchdowns to one interception, but he makes a critical error on the opening drive. He looked to force the football to Brandin Cooks on a third-and-3, but Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson jumped the route and took it all the way back for a 69-yard pick-six. It's Philadelphia's first defensive touchdown of the season, and the Eagles now lead 7-0 with 11:43 left in the first quarter. The Cowboys offense led by quarterback Cooper Rush and running back Rico Dowdle start with the football first. Cowboys three-time All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons has helped power a defensive renaissance in Dallas sparked by his return from his high ankle sprain along with an increased comfort in defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer's scheme in his first season working with the Cowboys defense after playing the last three under Dan Quinn, who is now the Washington Commanders head coach. He leads the NFL in both sacks (8.5) and quarterback pressures (42) since Week 10, and as a result, the Cowboys defense is one of the NFL's most disruptive in that span, ranking top five in the entire NFL in third down conversion rate allowed (35%, fifth-best in the NFL), sacks (28, best in the NFL), sack rate (10.4%, best in the NFL), quarterback pressure rate (39.3%, fifth-best in the NFL) and takeaways (15, tied for the second-most in the NFL). Cowboys All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey has made 36 field goals thus far in 2024. With just one more made field goal on Sunday in Philadelphia, Aubrey will set the franchise single season record for makes in a season, which would break a tie with his own record of 36 that he set in his first year last season in 2023. Cowboys running back Rico Dowdle is 97 rushing yards away from his first 1,000-yard season. If he accomplishes the feat on Sunday in Philadelphia, it would make him the first undrafted player in Cowboys history to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. Since Week 9, Dowdle ranks second in the NFL with 494 rushing yards after contract, trailing only Saquon Barkley's 566 in that span, according to Pro Football Focus. Dallas Cowboys three-time All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons knows he gave the Philadelphia Eagles (12-3), Dallas' Week 17 opponent, bulletin board material last week. \"Nah, at this point, it's f--- Philly, now,\" Parsons said on Dec. 19. \"Even if we got eliminated, like, I got to crush Philly. F--- them. I hate them now. I be seeing them just talking so much on socials. I don't know, my Twitter page got consumed by Philly [fans]. Man, ugh. They say don't look forward to some things, but I'm excited about the matchup [next week in Week 17], too.\" This Thursday, he acknowledged that beating the Eagles on Sunday would \"probably\" make their year. \"That probably makes the year you know what I'm saying? That sets everything off,\" Parsons said when asked how it would feel to beat the Eagles on Sunday. \"Us getting that win, away game in Philly. Knowing how they're trying to get the No. 1 seed. Can set them back a little bit. They're fighting for everything. They're fighting for where they want to be in the playoffs. We're just fighting to whoop them. They got more to lose than we do, so that'll be a great feeling right there.\" Check out his full remarks below. After two consecutive losses in Rush's first two starts this season versus the Eagles (34-6) and versus the Houston Texans (34-10), Dallas has won four of their last five games with Rush under center. His play has definitely picked up in this stretch. Rush has thrown for nine touchdowns and just one interception while averaging 226.2 passing yards per game and 6.9 yards per pass attempt with a 64.4% completion percentage in that stretch. That's good for a 100.5 passer rating since Week 12, 12th in the league in that span. The Dallas Cowboys have won and covered in four of their last five games. Cowboys Last 5 Games Covered? Week 12 +10.5 at Commanders Yes Week 13 -4 vs Giants Yes Week 14 +4.5 vs Bengals No Week 15 +2.5 at Panthers Yes Week 16 +4.5 vs Buccaneers Yes The Dallas Cowboys (7-8), who were eliminated from postseason contention last week, have gotten hot of late with victories in four of their last five games. Despite being eliminated, head coach Mike McCarthy and his staff, who are in the final season of their current coaching contracts, aren't looking to simply play the young guys. Their mindset is still to seek wins first and foremost, which is why McCarthy is still starting a 31-year-old career backup in Cooper Rush over 2021 third overall pick quarterback Trey Lance. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. PHILADELPHIA -- In a battle of backup quarterbacks, the host Philadelphia Eagles (13-3) had the definitive edge over the Dallas Cowboys (7-9) as they dominated in a decisive 41-7 Week 17 victory. They clinched the 2024 NFC East division title with the win. It's their first division title since 2022, a year that ended with them as the Super Bowl runner up. It's also their 11th NFC East division title since 2001, which is the most in the division in that span. Philadelphia also now has their fourth ever 13-win season, which is key because they have reached the Super Bowl in each of the last three occurrences (2004, 2017, 2022). After two three-and-outs to start the game, the Eagles scored on their next six drives -- four touchdowns and two field goals. Philadelphia also secured its first sweep of the Cowboys since 2011. Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett, the 2022 first-round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers who is filling in for an injured Jalen Hurts (concussion), produced a strong performance. He threw for 143 yards and a touchdown on 10 of 15 passing while adding a 1-yard rushing score via the tush push to end the first half. He threw a 22-yard scoring strike to Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith with 6:38 left in the half after Smith cooked backup Cowboys corner Andrew Booth by multiple steps for the touchdown. Pickett exited the game early in the third quarter after aggravating his ribs injury on a late hit by Dallas defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa, who was penalized for roughing the passer. He clearly hit Pickett late after the football was gone. As a result, Eagles third-string quarterback Tanner McKee, a 2023 sixth-round pick out of Stanford, subbed into the game. McKee's first full drive ended with him throwing his first NFL regular-season touchdown pass to Eagles No. 1 receiver A.J. Brown on a 20-yard scoring strike. Brown got a stop on Cowboys All-Pro corner DaRon Bland, and McKee threw a perfectly placed pass over Brown's outside shoulder for the touchdown. That increased the Eagles' lead to 34-7 over the Cowboys with 2:44 left in the third quarter. He then hit Smith on an underneath throw, and he took the football all the way to the house with ease for a 25-yard receiving touchdown. McKee finished with 54 yards passing and two touchdowns on 3 of 4 passing, and Smith totaled 120 yards receiving and two touchdowns on six catches. Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush, their eight-year veteran backup who is filling in for an injured Dak Prescott (hamstring tear), played slightly better than his first start of the season back in Week 10, a 34-6 home defeat against the Eagles. He threw a 69-yard pick six to Philadelphia safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson on the opening drive of the game, but he bounced back to throw a 4-yard goal-line fade touchdown to Dallas wide receiver Jalen Tolbert on the game's second possession. At the end of the first half, Rush sailed a deep throw intended for wide receiver Brandin Cooks on third-and-5, and Gardner-Johnson picked him off for the second time. He returned the football down to the Eagles' 35-yard line with 36 seconds left in the half. It's Gardner-Johnson's second career game with multiple interceptions, and both have come against the Cowboys. Rush finished the game with 147 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions on 15 of 28 passing. With a massive lead, 2024 NFL rushing yards leader Saquon Barkley was able to take over in the second half. He went off for 167 yards on 31 carries Sunday afternoon to become the ninth player in NFL history to register at least 2,000 rushing yards in a single season. Here are the five main takeaways from the Eagles' Week 17 victory: The Eagles defense took a massive hit once Gardner-Johnson was ejected from last Sunday's loss to the Washington Commanders as a result of two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Gardner-Johnson's ejection certainly affected how the Eagles defense played Jayden Daniels, who was 16 of 24 for 150 yards and three touchdowns to one interception (105.9 passer rating) after the defender's disqualification. The Commanders scored 22 fourth-quarter points in the comeback victory, all with Gardner-Johnson off the field. Gardner-Johnson was back for this game and made an impact on the first series. On third-and-3 from the Eagles' 35-yard line, Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush threw a pass across the middle of the field and Gardner-Johnson read it for the interception. He took the takeaway 69 yards the other way for a touchdown to give the Eagles an early 7-0 lead with 11:55 remaining in the first quarter. Gardner-Johnson later had his second interception that set the Eagles up for a touchdown in the final seconds of the first half. The Eagles had three takeaways in the first half, all of which led to points. Even when Gardner-Johnson is struggling in coverage, he's making turnover-worthy plays for the Eagles to change the course of a game. In 28 games with the Eagles, Gardner-Johnson has 12 interceptions (6+ in each season played). He's a difference maker on this defense. Whatever the scripted game plan was in the first quarter of Pickett's start (filling in for Jalen Hurts as he was ruled out with a concussion), it wasn't what the Eagles were hoping for. A Landon Dickerson false start on the first play based the Eagles up to a first-and-15. Two incomplete passes and a checkdown to Kenneth Gainwell resulted in the first Eagles three-and-out. On the Eagles' second offensive possession, Pickett didn't even throw the football. With DeVonta Smith on the sidelines (wrist injury), the Eagles had Saquon Barkley carry the ball on three consecutive plays -- one via direct snap -- before choosing to punt on fourth-and-1 on their own 46-yard line. The decision to punt showed a lack of trust in Pickett to get the first down, with his arm or legs, or hand the ball off and get the first down. Six plays for 14 yards on the Eagles' first two series, and a lack of trust in Pickett. Different quarterback, same slow start. The Eagles opened things up for Pickett on the third drive, as he went 6 of 6 for 72 yards and a touchdown -- a 22-yard pass to DeVonta Smith. In the second quarter, 8 of 11 for 128 yards with a touchdown for a 141.5 passer rating. This doesn't include the rushing touchdown he had to get the Eagles up 24-7 at halftime. Pickett found an early connection with Smith once the Eagles opened up the passing game, hitting him three times for 74 yards and a score -- including a 49-yard pass to Smith that resulted in the 1-yard touchdown run just before the half. While it took the Eagles three series to get Pickett comfortable, opening things up for the quarterback certainly sparked the offense. Pickett left the game with a rib injury in the third quarter, yet the Eagles offense didn't miss a beat once third-string quarterback Tanner McKee entered the game. McKee, elevated to the No. 2 quarterback with Hurts out, threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to A.J. brown to put the Eagles up 34-7 late in the third quarter. The Eagles had a run-heavy offense once McKee entered the game with a big lead, yet he went 2 of 3 for 29 yards and a touchdown pass to Brown on his first series. He then followed with a 25-yard touchdown pass to DeVonta Smith on his second series, going 3 of 4 for 54 yards and two touchdowns for a 154.2 rating on his first two series. Whether it was Pickett or McKee, the Eagles offense was clicking from the second quarter on. Barkley reached the 2,000-yard rushing plateau on Sunday, becoming the ninth running back to amass 2,000 rushing yards in a season. He's eighth all-time for rushing yards in a season with 2,005. The chase is officially on in regards to Dickerson's record. Barkley finished with 31 carries for 167 yards, averaging 5.4 yards per carry. putting himself in striking distance of the mark. Dickerson rushed for 2,105 yards in 1984 and Barkley is 101 yards away from passing him. Barkley is averaging 125.3 rushing yards per game this season, which would put him on pace to pass Dickerson. Will the Eagles play him in Week 18? The 2,000-yard plateau was a goal of Barkley's and he achieved it. Just 101 yards away from Dickerson is approachable, even if the Eagles do play a meaningless game in Week 18. One of the hardest records in sports is Dickerson's rushing record. This mark can be broken if the Eagles decide to play barkley in Week 18, but it will likely be his call. The Cowboys have inserted 2021 third overall pick quarterback Trey Lance into the game with 2:24 left to play. Cowboys wide receiver Jalen Brooks and Cowboys cornerback Troy Pride, along with Eagles cornerback Sidney Brown, were ejected for fighting. Cowboys All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey drills a 61-yard field goal off the right upright for a missed field goal. The Eagles take over at the Cowboys' 49 up 41-7 with 4:40 left to play. Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith caught an underneath pass from Tanner McKee and left the Dallas defense in the dust for a 25-yard receiving touchdown, his second score of the day. The Eagles lead 41-7 with 10:03 left to play. Utter domination. Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is now up to 2,005 rushing yards, and he is the ninth player in NFL history to run for over 2,000 yards in a single season. Dallas commits their fourth turnover of the day with running back Rico Dowdle fumbling on third-and-5. Philadelphia linebacker Nolan Smith forced the fumble, and Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean recovered the loose ball. Philadelphia takes over at their own 25 up 34-7 with 14:20 left in the game. Tanner McKee threw his first NFL regular season touchdown pass to Eagles No. 1 receiver A.J. Brown for a 20-yard scoring strike. Brown got a step on Cowboys All-Pro corner DaRon Bland, and McKee threw a perfectly placed pass over Brown's outside shoulder for the touchdown. The Eagles lead 34-7 over the Cowboys with 2:44 left in the third quarter. Eagles backup quarterback Kenny Pickett (ribs) is officially questionable to return. He initially suffered a ribs injury a week ago against the Washington Commanders. Third-string quarterback Tanner McKee is primed to lead this drive after the Cowboys went run-run-pass for a three-and-out on their latest drive. The Eagles lead 27-7 with 6:34 left in the third quarter. An A.J. Brown receiving touchdown gets nullified by a holding penalty on Landon Dickerson trying to contain Cowboys All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons. Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett suffered an injury on the play, and Philadelphia subbed in third-stringer Tanner McKee to take the snap on third-and-goal from the Cowboys' 17. He handed off to Barkley for a gain of nine, and the Eagles took three more points on a 26-yard field goal. Philadelphia leads 27-7 with 8:03 left in the third quarter. The Eagles are marching up the field with ease to start the second half. Following a near interception by Pickett, it's been all runs by Saquon Barkley. A disaster for Dallas on their last drive of the half. Quarterback Cooper Rush sailed a deep throw intended for wide receiver Brandin Cooks on third-and-5, and Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson picked off Rush for the second time. He returned the football down to the Eagles' 35 with 36 seconds left in the half. It's Gardner-Johnson's second career game with multiple interceptions, and both have come against the Cowboys. Philly extends their lead to 10, 17-7, following Jake Elliott's 31-yard field. They can double dip with points since they start the second half with the football. Dallas has 1:55 on the clock and one timeout left. The Cowboys commit their second turnover of the half with tight end Jake Ferguson getting stripped by Eagles linebacker Oren Burks. Philadelphia defensive tackle Jordan Davis recovered the loose ball for the takeaway. Philadelphia takes over at the Cowboys' 39 up 14-7 with 6:27 left to play. The Eagles crowd is now chanting \"Dallas sucks.\" Dallas' lack of depth at cornerback because of injuries was just on full display. Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith cooked backup corner Andrew Booth with ease, getting open by multiple steps, which is how Philadelphia fill-in quarterback Kenny Pickett was able to hit him for a 22-yard touchdown. Philadelphia is back in front by seven, 14-7, with 6:38 left in the first half. The Cowboys take a deep shot down the left sideline to wide receiver Jonathan Mingo on third-and-1 instead of running with Dowdle, and it doesn't work. Mingo cooked Eagles first-round rookie corner Quinyon Mitchell, but he couldn't track Rush's throw. That led to the football harmlessly hitting the ground for an incompletion. Dallas punts it away, and Philadelphia fair-caught the football at their own 19. It's seven to seven with 12:49 left in the first half. After NFL rushing yards leader Saquon Barkley didn't touch the football on the Eagles' opening drive, the Eagles gave up three consecutives runs. However, he netted nine yards, and the Eagles punted the football away for a touchback. Philadelphia decided they would take their chances vs. Cooper Rush instead of potentially giving Dallas a short field if they bungled a fourth down attempt with Kenny Pickett at quarterback. It's a 7-7 game with 56 seconds left in the first quarter. Dallas goes three-and-out up against their own goal line, and they punt it away. The Cowboys got good hang time on the punt, so they were able to limit returner Cooper DeJean to just a yard on the return. The Eagles will have their second offensive possession starting at their own 37 in a 7-7 game with 2:48 left in the first quarter. Following a first down false start penalty, Eagle backup quarterback Kenny Pickett threw two consecutive incompletions, and then a short five-yarder to running back Kenneth Gainwell. Philadelphia goes three-and-out to start, and Dallas gets the football back on their own nine after a 52-yard punt by the Eagles. Eagles edge rusher Bryce Huff (shoulder) is questionable to return. Cooper Rush bounced back in a big way from his pick-six by capping the Cowboys' ensuing drive with a four-yard touchdown pass on a goal line fade to wide receiver Jalen Tolbert. Dallas continues to fight for head coach Mike McCarthy. This game is tied at seven with 5:38 left in the first quarter. Kenny Pickett and the Eagles offense will take the field for the first time today up next. With All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb out, Brandin Cooks is the Cowboys' clear cut No. 1 option in the passing game early on. Quarterback Cooper Rush has targeted him five times already, and Cooks has hauled in two of them for 38 yards, including 22 yards on the last play to move the chains on a third-and-9. Cooper Rush had been on a roll with wins in four of the last five games, which included a stretch of nine touchdowns to one interception, but he makes a critical error on the opening drive. He looked to force the football to Brandin Cooks on a third-and-3, but Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson jumped the route and took it all the way back for a 69-yard pick-six. It's Philadelphia's first defensive touchdown of the season, and the Eagles now lead 7-0 with 11:43 left in the first quarter. The Cowboys offense led by quarterback Cooper Rush and running back Rico Dowdle start with the football first. Cowboys three-time All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons has helped power a defensive renaissance in Dallas sparked by his return from his high ankle sprain along with an increased comfort in defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer's scheme in his first season working with the Cowboys defense after playing the last three under Dan Quinn, who is now the Washington Commanders head coach. He leads the NFL in both sacks (8.5) and quarterback pressures (42) since Week 10, and as a result, the Cowboys defense is one of the NFL's most disruptive in that span, ranking top five in the entire NFL in third down conversion rate allowed (35%, fifth-best in the NFL), sacks (28, best in the NFL), sack rate (10.4%, best in the NFL), quarterback pressure rate (39.3%, fifth-best in the NFL) and takeaways (15, tied for the second-most in the NFL). Cowboys All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey has made 36 field goals thus far in 2024. With just one more made field goal on Sunday in Philadelphia, Aubrey will set the franchise single season record for makes in a season, which would break a tie with his own record of 36 that he set in his first year last season in 2023. Cowboys running back Rico Dowdle is 97 rushing yards away from his first 1,000-yard season. If he accomplishes the feat on Sunday in Philadelphia, it would make him the first undrafted player in Cowboys history to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. Since Week 9, Dowdle ranks second in the NFL with 494 rushing yards after contract, trailing only Saquon Barkley's 566 in that span, according to Pro Football Focus. Dallas Cowboys three-time All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons knows he gave the Philadelphia Eagles (12-3), Dallas' Week 17 opponent, bulletin board material last week. \"Nah, at this point, it's f--- Philly, now,\" Parsons said on Dec. 19. \"Even if we got eliminated, like, I got to crush Philly. F--- them. I hate them now. I be seeing them just talking so much on socials. I don't know, my Twitter page got consumed by Philly [fans]. Man, ugh.

That sets everything off,\" Parsons said when asked how it would feel to beat the Eagles on Sunday. \"Us getting that win, away game in Philly. Knowing how they're trying to get the No. 1 seed.

                "content": "The Eagles rocked the Kelly Green uniforms at Lincoln Financial Field as they clinched the NFC East with a 41-7 victory over the Cowboys. Saquon Barkley eclipsed the 2,000-yard mark on a 23-yard run in the fourth quarter and the franchise-record (2,146 by LeSean McCoy in 2013) for scrimmage yards in a season early in the game. He needed 33 yards to break the scrimmage record going into today. \"I'm not going to lie, but just being a fan of the game and the running back position, to reach a milestone and put myself up there with eight other backs that I respect, and some of them I grew up watching, definitely means a lot. But at the same time, I wouldn't be able to do that without this team. Like I said, you can't be great without the greatness of others, and I'm just happy I was able to be a part of the team and be able to reach a milestone like that,\" Barkley said after the game. Philadelphia was without star quarterback Jalen Hurts, who suffered a concussion last week against Washington. Linebacker Nakobe Dean was also out with an abdomen injury. Kenny Pickett made his first start as an Eagle and went 10/15 for 143 yards and touchdown before leaving the game with a rib injury. Tanner McKee came in for the second half as the Eagles held a big lead and went 3/4 for 54 yards and two touchdowns.

The Eagles' 41-7 triumph over the rival Cowboys featured everything that has made this a 13-win team with one week remaining in the regular season. Pickett and McKee combined for three touchdowns and a 141.9 passer rating in the 41-7 win. Linebacker Nakobe Dean is out with an abdomen injury. The Eagles (12-3) return to Lincoln Financial Field for the first of two home games to close out the regular season. A win guarantees more company at home into the postseason, while Dallas (7-8) is relishing the role of spoiler. The Eagles can clinch the NFC East with a win or tie on Sunday. This is the second straight year that Allen is among the 15 finalists for induction into Canton. The Eagles also elevated running back Tyrion Davis-Price and linebacker Dallas Gant from the practice squad for Sunday's game. Britain Covey, Jalen Hurts, and Will Shipley are out for Sunday. Nakobe Dean is doubtful with an abdomen injury. Pickett was a full participant in Thursday's practice as Jalen Hurts remains in the concussion protocol. To make room, the Eagles released cornerback Tariq Castro-Fields from the practice squad. Copyright © 2024 Philadelphia Eagles. All rights reserved.",

                "content": "Saquon Rasul Quevis Barkley[1] (/ˈseɪkwɒn/ SAY-kwon; born February 9, 1997) is an American professional football running back for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions, where he set several school records for his offensive production over three seasons, before forgoing his senior year to enter the NFL. In 2017, Barkley finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting with 304 total votes, third in Maxwell Award voting, and received multiple national and Big Ten Conference awards and recognition. During his three-year collegiate career, Barkley set Penn State records for most all-purpose career yards (5,538), most career rushing touchdowns (43), most career receiving yards by a running back (1,157), most rushing yards by a freshman and sophomore, and most total yards in a single game. Barkley was selected second overall by the New York Giants in the 2018 NFL draft, setting several NFL and team records en route to making the 2018 Pro Bowl and being named the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. He confronted injuries in the 2020 season, but was again named to the Pro Bowl in 2022. A free agent following the 2023 season, Barkley signed a three-year deal with the Eagles, setting numerous franchise records and rushing for over 2,000 yards. Barkley was born in Bronx, New York, the son of Alibay Barkley, a boxer, and Tonya Johnson. He has three brothers and two sisters. His brother Alibay Jr. was a baseball player drafted by the Los Angeles Angels, and his great uncle is former WBC middleweight champion Iran Barkley.[2] In 2001, Barkley and his family moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley in search of a safer and more suburban environment.[3] The family later moved to neighboring Allentown and, in 2005, to Coplay, Pennsylvania.[4] Barkley attended Whitehall High School in Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania, which competes in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, an elite division of large high schools in the Lehigh Valley and Poconos known nationally for producing a large number of NFL and other professional athletes.[5] At Whitehall High School, Barkley rushed for 3,646 yards with 63 touchdowns from his sophomore to senior year, including 1,856 yards and 31 touchdowns as a senior.[6] Barkley was rated as a four-star recruit and committed to Penn State to play college football.[7][8] He originally committed to Rutgers before changing to Penn State.[9] In addition to football, Barkley also lettered in basketball and track and field at Whitehall. As a senior in 2015, he won Eastern Pennsylvania Conference gold medals in both the 100-meter dash (11.15 seconds) and in the long jump (22'2.5\" or 6.77m) at the PIAA District 11 meet, where he also earned a second-place finish in the 100-meter dash with a time of 10.90 seconds, which set a Whitehall High School record.[10] Later in the track and field season, Barkley set personal best marks of 46'2.5\" (14.08m) in the shot put and 6'0\" (1.83m) in the high jump.[11] Barkley was considered a top NCAA Division I football prospect and received multiple football scholarship offers, including from Missouri, North Carolina, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Pitt, Rutgers, Syracuse, and Temple. He chose to accept an offer from Penn State.[12] Sources: On September 10, 2021, Whitehall High School retired Barkley's jersey number (#21). Earlier, the school had retired the jersey numbers of two other alumni who went on to have successful NFL careers: Matt Millen, who played from 1980 until 1991 with the Oakland and Los Angeles Raiders, the San Francisco 49ers, and the Washington Redskins; and Dan Koppen, who played from 2003 until 2013 with the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos.[13] At Penn State, Barkley earned immediate playing time as a true freshman in 2015.[14] After rushing for one yard on one carry during his first game, he rushed for 115 yards with a touchdown in his second game against Buffalo.[15] He followed up that performance by rushing for 195 yards and two touchdowns on 21 carries in his third game against Rutgers.[16] In October, he missed two games due to injury.[17] In his first game back against top-ranked Ohio State on October 17, 2015, he rushed for 194 yards on 26 carries.[18][19] During his freshman year at Penn State in 2015, Barkley rushed for 1,076 yards on 182 carries.[20] During the offseason, Barkley received praise for his freshman year performance and was awarded second-team All-Big Ten with some votes for first team status and being named BTN.com Freshman of the Year.[21] In the first game of his sophomore year at Penn State in 2016, Barkley rushed for 105 yards and a touchdown in a 33–13 win over Kent State.[22] In week two, in a renewed rivalry game against Pitt, Penn State trailed in the second quarter 28–7 before Barkley led Penn State back, scoring five touchdowns with his fifth coming with 5:00 left in the fourth quarter, to bring the Nittany Lions within three points. However, quarterback Trace McSorley threw an interception in the Pitt end zone with 1:41 left that denied the Nittany Lions' hopes of completing the comeback.[23] In week five against Minnesota, in what would become a recurring theme for the 2016 Penn State football team, Penn State again was forced to come back from a halftime deficit. In overtime, after being held to only 38 yards on 19 carries during regular playing time, Barkley's first play in overtime, a 25-yard touchdown run, gave Penn State the victory.[24] In week six against Maryland, Barkley had his first ever 200-yard rushing game at Penn State, finishing with 31 carries for 202 yards and one touchdown.[25] In week seven, in a matchup versus Ohio State, Barkley rushed for 99 yards on 12 carries with one 37 yard run in a 24–21 win over the second ranked Buckeyes.[26] In week eight, Barkley and no. 24 Penn State scored a season high 62 points versus Purdue as Barkley rushed for a career-high 207 yards and a career-high long 81 yard run, along with 70 yards in receiving yards and two touchdowns, giving him a total of 277 yards in the game. Penn State defeated Purdue 62–24 and improved to 6–2 and 4–1 in Big Ten play.[27] On November 1, 2016, Barkley was named a semi-finalist for the Maxwell Award, granted to the all-around best collegiate football player of the year.[28] On November 5, Barkley rushed for 167 yards and a touchdown against Iowa. He added 44 yards and another touchdown in receiving for a total of 211 all-purpose yards in Penn State's 41–14 victory.[29] After the regular season, Barkley was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, Ameche–Dayne Running Back of the Year and First Team All-Big Ten.[30] On December 3, 2016, Barkley had 19 carries for 83 yards, rushed for a touchdown, and caught another touchdown on a wheel route. His efforts helped Penn State recover from a 28–7 deficit to stun Wisconsin, 38–31, in the 2016 Big Ten Championship Game.[31] In the 2017 Rose Bowl on January 2, Barkley had 25 carries for 194 yards, averaging 7.8 yards per carry, including a 79-yard rushing touchdown that gave Penn State a 28–27 lead. After trailing 13–0, Penn State scored seven touchdowns on seven consecutive possessions, including four touchdowns on four consecutive offensive plays, including Barkley's 79-yard touchdown. Barkley scored the first, fourth, and seventh touchdowns for Penn State, giving the Nittany Lions a 49–35 lead in the fourth quarter, though USC ultimately went on to win the game, 52–49.[32] At the close of his sophomore year at Penn State, Barkley had set Penn State records for most rushing yards in a season by a freshman (1,076) and by a sophomore (1,496). In the first game of the 2017 season against Akron, Barkley ran 14 times for 172 yards, two rushing touchdowns, and a long run of 80 yards. He also caught two passes for 54 receiving yards. For his efforts, Barkley was named co-Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week.[33] In Penn State's 2017 Big Ten opener, at Iowa, Barkley led Penn State to a 21–19 win, recording 358 all-purpose yards. He also set a school record for most all-purpose yards in a single game, recording 211 rushing yards, a rushing touchdown, 94 receiving yards, and 53 kick return yards.[34] For his efforts, Barkley was again named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week.[35] In the first Big Ten home game of his junior year against the Indiana, Barkley rushed 20 times for just 56 yards, an unusually underwhelming rushing day for him. Despite this, he still had a major impact on the game, returning the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown, catching four passes for 52 yards, and throwing a 16-yard pass to receiver DaeSean Hamilton late in the fourth quarter to cap a 45–14 Penn State win. This made Barkley the first player in Big Ten history to record a return and passing touchdown in the same game.[36] Barkley was named Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week.[36] One month later against Ohio State, Barkley again returned the opening kickoff back 97 yards for a touchdown, but was limited for the rest of the game recording 44 rushing yards on 21 carries, 36 of which came on a touchdown run in the second quarter.[37] In his final collegiate game at Penn State, Barkley rushed for 137 yards and scored two touchdowns, one of them a 92-yard effort to put Penn State up 28–7 over the Washington Huskies in the 2017 Fiesta Bowl, which Penn State went on to win 35–28.[38] On December 31, 2017, following Penn State's Fiesta Bowl victory, Barkley declared his intention to forgo his senior year at Penn State and enter the 2018 NFL draft.[39] Penn State: Entering the 2018 NFL draft, Barkley was widely projected to be a top 10 NFL pick.[39] In the weeks leading up to the NFL Combine, Barkley's stock rose even higher. By late February 2018, some mock drafts projected him as high as the second selection overall,[64] the highest for a running back since Reggie Bush in 2006. ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr., who has history of not supporting the selection of running backs in the NFL draft's first round, said \"Barkley is a once in a lifetime talent; teams that pass on this young man will be sorry.\"[65] At the combine, Barkley had a performance that was widely praised, running a 4.4 second 40-yard dash and doing 29 bench presses of 225 pound weight, tying for the most reps by any running back at this combine.[66] According to NFL analyst Ian Rapoport, the Cleveland Browns were \"strongly considering\" drafting Barkley first overall, which would have made him the first running back since Ki-Jana Carter in 1995 to be selected first overall.[67] Barkley was selected by the New York Giants with the second overall selection in the 2018 draft.[69] On July 22, 2018, Barkley signed a four-year rookie contract, worth $31.2 million fully guaranteed.[70] Barkley scored his first NFL touchdown, a 68-yard rush, in the season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Overall in his first NFL game, he rushed for 106 yards and scored a touchdown in the Giants' 20–15 loss.[71] The following week, in a 20–13 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, Barkley recorded 14 receptions, setting a Giants' all-time franchise record for most catches in a game. He also tied the NFL single game record for most catches in a game by an NFL rookie.[72] In Week 3, in the Giants' 27–22 victory over the Houston Texans, Barkley recorded 82 rushing yards, rushed for a touchdown, and caught five passes for 35 receiving yards.[73] The following week, in the Giants' loss to the New Orleans Saints, Barkley recorded 100 scrimmage yards with 44 rushing yards and 56 receiving yards and a rushing touchdown.[74] In Week 5, against the Carolina Panthers, he recorded four receptions for 81 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns and rushed for 48 yards in the Giants' 33–31 loss.[75] In the Giants' Week 6 Thursday Night Football game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Barkley finished with 130 rushing yards, including a 50-yard touchdown and 99 receiving yards, totaling 229 all-purpose yards in the Giants 34–13 loss to Philadelphia.[76] In Week 11 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Barkley rushed for his NFL career-high to date with 142 yards and three touchdowns as the Giants won 38–35,[77][78] and for his efforts he was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[79] In Week 12's 25–22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Barkley rushed for 101 yards and scored a 51-yard touchdown, becoming the first player since John Fuqua in 1970 to rush for two 50-plus yard touchdowns against the Eagles in a single season.[80][81] In Week 13 against the Chicago Bears, Barkley had 125 rushing yards and three receptions for 21 yards in the 30–27 overtime win.[82][83] During Week 14, in the Giants' 40–16 win over the Redskins, Barkley rushed for 170 yards, including a 78-yard touchdown, becoming the first Giants rookie to surpass 1,000 rushing yards in a season, and setting the franchise's single-season record for rookies with 15 touchdowns scored.[84] In the regular season finale against the Dallas Cowboys, Barkley had 17 carries for 109 yards, his seventh game with over 100 rushing yards on the season, and he scored a touchdown in the Giants' 36–35 loss.[85] In recognition of his rookie season accomplishments, Barkley was elected to the 2019 Pro Bowl, where he helped the NFC win the Skills Showdown.[86] Barkley received numerous awards during and after his rookie season, including Pepsi Rookie of the Year,[87] FedEx Ground NFL Player of the Year,[88] AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year[89] and was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team and AP All-Rookie teams.[90] Entering his second NFL season, Barkley was ranked No. 16 on the NFL's Top 100 players for 2019.[91][92] Barkley was chosen by his teammates as one of seven team captains for the 2019 season, an honor rarely bestowed on players after only one year on the team.[93] In Week 1 against the Cowboys, Barkley rushed 11 times for 120 yards, including a 59-yard run, in the Giants' 35–17 loss.[94] In this game, he fumbled the ball for the first time in his NFL career.

Barkley's 0.4 yards per attempt was a career low.[105] During the following week's 17–13 loss to the Bears, Barkley was carted off the field after suffering a knee injury, which was later diagnosed as a torn anterior cruciate ligament, which ended his 2020 season.[106][107] During the game, Barkley rushed to the right and engaged with Bears safety Eddie Jackson, who wrestled him down to the ground near the sideline at the end of a six-yard run. Barkley immediately grabbed the back of his right knee and removed his helmet.[108] Jackson later voiced his concern on Twitter, sending prayers and support.[109] Barkley was placed on injured reserve on September 22, 2020.[110] On April 28, 2021, the Giants picked up the fifth-year option on Barkley's contract,[111] worth a guaranteed $7.217 million for the 2022 season.[112] In Week 5 against the Dallas Cowboys, Barkley's foot landed on Jourdan Lewis and his ankle rolled.[113] On November 3, 2021, the Giants announced that Barkley was being placed in the NFL's COVID-19 protocol.[114] In the 2021 season, Barkley had 593 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, 41 receptions, 263 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in 13 games.[115] Against the Tennessee Titans in Week 1, Barkley rushed for 164 yards, a touchdown, and caught six passes for 30 yards in the 21–20 comeback win. He converted the go-ahead two point conversion late in the fourth quarter.[116] Barkley's performance on Sunday resulted in him receiving the NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[117] In Week 3, Barkley had 126 scrimmage yards and a rushing touchdown in the 23–16 loss to the Cowboys.[118] In Week 4, Barkley had 146 rushing yards in the 20–12 victory over the Bears.[119] He was named to the Pro Bowl.[120] In Week 10 against the Texans, he had 35 carries for 152 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 24–16 victory.[121] Overall, he finished the 2022 season with 295 carries for 1,312 rushing yards and ten rushing touchdowns to go along with 57 receptions for 338 receiving yards.[122] He finished fourth in the NFL and first in the NFC in rushing yards.[123] In the Wild Card Round of the playoffs, he had 109 scrimmage yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 31–24 victory over the Minnesota Vikings.[124] He was ranked 31st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[125] On March 7, 2023, the Giants placed the non-exclusive franchise tag on Barkley.[126] He signed the franchise tag after it was adjusted to add a $2 million signing bonus and incentives on July 26.[127][128] During Week 8 against the New York Jets, Barkley finished with 128 rushing yards on 36 carries as the Giants lost 10–13 in overtime.[129] In Week 11 against the Commanders, he had 140 scrimmage yards and two receiving touchdowns in the victory.[130] In Week 18 against Philadelphia, he had two rushing touchdowns in the victory.[131] He finished the 2023 season with 247 carries for 962 rushing yards and six rushing touchdowns to go with 41 receptions for 280 receiving yards and four receiving touchdowns in 14 games and starts.[132] On March 13, 2024, Barkley signed a three-year $37.75 million deal with the Philadelphia Eagles, of which $26 million is guaranteed and could increase to $46.75 million with bonuses.[133][134] Prior to signing with the Eagles, Barkley admitted he was \"fed up\" with negotiations with the Giants, calling their approach \"a little disrespectful.\" He felt slighted by the team's insistence that he prove his value on the open market, which he described as a \"slap in the face.\"[135] In his Eagles debut, Barkley rushed for 109 yards with two rushing touchdowns and a receiving touchdown in a 34–29 victory over the Green Bay Packers, becoming the first Eagles player to score three touchdowns in their debut with the team since Terrell Owens in 2004.[136] His performance earned him NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[137] The following week against the Falcons, Barkley rushed for 95 yards and caught four of five passes for 21 yards, but a late fourth-quarter drop that could have sealed the win for the Eagles proved costly as they lost 22–21.[138] Barkley had 17 carries for 147 yards and scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to lead the Eagles to a 15–12 win over the Saints in Week 3.[139] Barkley made his return to MetLife Stadium against the Giants in Week 7, rushing for 176 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries in a 28–3 victory over his former team.

                "content": "The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, an arena they share with the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League.[10] The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA with 17 championships, the second most in the league behind the Boston Celtics.[11] The franchise began in 1946 as the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL).[12] After one season, a new ownership relocated the team to Minneapolis, Minnesota,[13][12] and renamed the team as the Minneapolis Lakers.[14] The Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America, where they won the 1949 BAA championship. Following the merger of the NBL and the BAA into the NBA in 1949, the Lakers won four of the next five NBA championships.[15] After struggling financially in the late 1950s, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season. The Lakers made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost every series to the Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain, and won their sixth NBA title in 1972, led by coach Bill Sharman. After the retirement of Chamberlain, the team traded for superstar Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Two big changes came in 1979, first, Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers, and pioneered a vision of basketball as entertainment as well as sport.[16] Second, the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson first overall in the 1979 NBA draft. The combination of Johnson, a prodigy point guard, and dominant center in Abdul-Jabbar provided the Lakers with superstars to anchor their roster. The promotion of head coach Pat Riley in 1981 and addition of forward James Worthy through the 1982 draft established the Lakers as an NBA powerhouse throughout the 1980s. The franchise won five championships in a nine-year span, including two out of three marquee Finals matchups against the Celtics. The Lakers were defeated by their Boston archrivals in the 1984 Finals, but triumphed over them in 1985 and 1987. After Riley departed and Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, and Worthy retired, the Lakers struggled in the early 1990s. It was not until 1996 when the team traded with the Charlotte Hornets for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant and signed center Shaquille O'Neal that the Lakers returned to dominance during the early 2000s. The superstar duo, along with Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, led the Lakers to three consecutive championships between 2000 and 2002, securing the franchise's second \"three-peat\".[17] The dynamic \"Shaq-and-Kobe\" era ended when the Lakers traded away O'Neal after the team lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 Finals. It was not until the Lakers traded for Pau Gasol that Bryant and Jackson returned to the NBA Finals, losing to the Celtics in 2008 but winning championships in 2009 and 2010. The 2010 Finals marked the latest matchup of the Lakers and Celtics, with Los Angeles winning its 16th title. Jackson retired in 2011, and the Lakers endured their longest playoff drought in franchise history. Gasol departed in 2014, and Bryant retired in 2016. After rebuilding seasons with young, highly rated prospects, the Lakers signed superstar LeBron James in 2018.[18] In 2019, the team traded several of those prospects for star big man Anthony Davis.[19] The Lakers—led by James, Davis, and coach Frank Vogel—won the team's 17th championship in 2020, tying the Celtics for the most titles until 2024.[20] The Lakers hold the record for NBA's longest winning streak, 33 straight games, set in 1971–72.[21] 26 Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles, while four have coached the team. Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, O'Neal, and Bryant won a combined eight NBA MVP awards with the Lakers.[22] The franchise was founded in 1946 as the Detroit Gems and played in the National Basketball League (NBL) during the 1946–47 season where it finished last in the league with only 4 wins in 44 games. Though the team was scheduled to continue in the NBL the following season,[23] its ownership, faced with high losses due to low attendance and lack of homecourt, decided on selling the team to Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota for $15,000[13][24] Minneapolis sportswriter Sid Hartman played a key behind-the-scenes role in helping put together the deal and later the team.[25] Inspired by Minnesota's nickname, \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\", the team rechristened themselves the Lakers.[26][27] Hartman helped them hire John Kundla from College of St. Thomas, to be their first head coach, by meeting with him and selling him on the team.[28][29] As the franchise had the worst record in the NBL the previous season, it got the first pick in the 1947 Professional Basketball League of America dispersal draft, which they used to select George Mikan. Led by Mikan, the Lakers had a solid roster, which also featured forward Jim Pollard and playmaker Herm Schaefer.[30] In their first season, they led the league with a 43–17 record, later winning the NBL championship that season.[31] In 1948, the Lakers moved from the NBL to the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and Mikan's 28.3 point per game (ppg) scoring average set a BAA record. In the 1949 BAA Finals they won the championship, beating the Washington Capitols four games to two.[32] Following the season, the BAA and the NBL merged to form the National Basketball Association (NBA).[33] In the newly formed league, the Lakers improved to 51–17 record and won their third straight professional championship.[34] In the 1950–51 season, Mikan won his third straight scoring title at 28.4 ppg and the Lakers went 44–24 to win their second straight division title.[35] One of those games, a 19–18 loss against the Fort Wayne Pistons, became infamous as the lowest scoring game in NBA history.[36] In the playoffs, they defeated the Indianapolis Olympians in three games but lost to the Rochester Royals in the next round.[30] During the 1951–52 season, the Lakers won 40 games, finishing second in their division.[37] They faced the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals, which they won in seven games.[38] In the 1952–53 season, Mikan led the NBA in rebounding, averaging 14.4 rebounds per game (rpg), and was named MVP of the 1953 NBA All-Star Game.[35] After a 48–22 regular season, the Lakers defeated the Fort Wayne Pistons in the Western playoffs to advance to the NBA Finals.[38] They then defeated the New York Knicks to win their second straight championship.[39] Though Lakers star George Mikan suffered from knee problems throughout the 1953–54 season, he was still able to average 18 ppg.[40] Clyde Lovellette, who was drafted in 1952, helped the team win the Western Division.[40] The team won its third straight championship in the 1950s and sixth in seven seasons when it defeated the Syracuse Nationals in seven games.[39] Following Mikan's retirement in the 1954 off-season, the Lakers struggled but still managed to win 40 games. Although they defeated the Rochester Royals in the first round of the playoffs, they were defeated by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the semifinals.[41] Although they had losing records the next two seasons, they made the playoffs each year.[37] Mikan came back for the last half of the 1955–56 season, but struggled and retired for good after the season.[42] Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956–57. The Lakers had one of the worst seasons in team history in 1957–58 when they won a league-low 19 games.[43] They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace Kundla. Mikan was fired in January when the team was 9–30, and Kundla was rehired.[37][44] The Lakers earned the top pick in the 1958 NBA draft and used it to select Elgin Baylor. Baylor, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year and co-MVP of the 1959 NBA All-Star Game, averaged 24.9 ppg and 15.0 rpg helping the Lakers improve to second in their division despite a 33–39 record.[45] After upsetting the Hawks in six games in the division finals, they returned to the NBA Finals, but were swept by the Celtics, beginning their long rivalry.[46] In their last year in Minneapolis, the Lakers went 25–50. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and traveling to St. Louis when their plane crash-landed.[49] Snow storms had driven the pilot 150 miles off course when he was forced to land in a cornfield. No one was hurt.[50] Their record earned them the number two pick in the 1960 NBA draft. The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia University.[51] During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles.[52] Led by Baylor's 34.8 ppg and 19.8 rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the year before in West's first season.[53] On November 15 that season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks while grabbing 25 rebounds.[54] In doing so, Baylor broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers made the playoffs.[37] They came within two points of the NBA Finals when they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.[55] Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8 ppg respectively,[56] the Lakers improved to 54–26 in 1961–62, and made the finals. In a game five victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61,[57] despite fouling out of the game.[58] The Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven.[56] Frank Selvy, after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game,[59][60] missed a potential game-winning 18 foot jump shot in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later.[60] Los Angeles won 53 games in 1962–63, behind Baylor's 34.0 ppg and West's 27.1 ppg[61] but lost in the NBA Finals in six games to the Celtics.[61] After falling to 42–38 and losing in the first round of the 1964 NBA playoffs to the Hawks, the team won 49 games in 1964–65. The Lakers surged past the Baltimore Bullets in the division finals, behind West's record-setting 46.3 ppg in the series.[62] They lost again to the Celtics in the Finals however, this time in five games.[63] Los Angeles lost in the finals to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points.[64] Down by 16 entering the fourth quarter, and 10 with a minute and a half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments, which fell just short.[65] After dropping to 36 wins and losing in the first round of the 1967 NBA playoffs, they lost in the finals to the Celtics again in 1968.[37] Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. On July 9, 1968, the team acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers.[67] In his first season as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league-leading 21.1 rpg.[68] West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, and Los Angeles won their division.[69] The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston for the first time in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry West's 53 points,[70] and had a 3–2 lead after five.[71] Boston won the series in seven games however,[72] and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons.[73] West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award.[74] In 1970, West won his first scoring title at 31.2 ppg, the team returned to the finals, and for the first time in 16 years, they did not have to face the Celtics; instead playing the New York Knicks, who defeated them 4–3.[75][76] The next season the Lakers were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks, led by future Laker Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in the Western Conference Finals.[77] The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner Jack Kent Cooke brought in Bill Sharman as head coach,[78] and Elgin Baylor announced his retirement early in the season after realizing that his legs were not healthy enough.[78] Sharman increased the team's discipline.[79] He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots.[80] They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December.[78] They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104.[81] By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in major American professional team sports.[82][83] The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96.[84] Chamberlain averaged a low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game.[85] West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game.[85] The team failed to score 100 points just once all year,[86] and at the end of the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year.[87] The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.[88][89] The Lakers won 60 games in the 1972–73 season, and took another Pacific Division title.[90] Wilt Chamberlain, playing in his final season, again led the league in rebounding and set the NBA record for field-goal percentage at 72.7% which stood for several decades.[90] The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven games in the conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals.[90] They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.[91] During the 1973–74 season, the team was hampered by the loss of West, who played only 31 games before his legs gave out.[92] Goodrich, averaging 25.3 points, helped the team to a late-season surge.[92] Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division.[92] They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.[93] After missing the playoffs in the 1974–75 season, the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVPs by that time.[94] Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade to either New York or Los Angeles.[95] He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played.[96] The Lakers struggled in January, going 3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.[96] West and Cooke settled their differences—and the former Laker's lawsuit—and Cooke hired him to replace Sharman as the team's coach.[97] West became upset, however, when Cooke refused to spend the money necessary to acquire forward Julius Erving, who the Nets were selling.[98] Behind another MVP season from Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles won the Pacific Division, finishing the 1976–77 season a league-best 53–29.[99] They defeated the Warriors in a seven-game series to open the postseason before being swept by Portland in the Western Conference Finals.[96] During the off-season, Los Angeles picked up Jamaal Wilkes from Golden State and signed first-round draft pick Norm Nixon. In the first two minutes of the first game of the 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar punched Bucks center Kent Benson for an overly aggressive elbow and broke his hand.[100] Two months later, a healthy Abdul-Jabbar got into an altercation with Houston Rockets center Kevin Kunnert after a rebound. The team's starting power forward, Kermit Washington, who was averaging 11.5 points and 11.2 rebounds,[101] entered the fight, and when Rudy Tomjanovich ran in from the bench to break up the action, Washington punched him in the face.[102] Tomjanovich nearly died from the punch, suffering a fractured skull and other facial injuries, which prematurely ended his playing career.[103] Washington, who stated that he assumed Tomjanovich was a combatant, was suspended for two months by the NBA, and released by the Lakers.[104] The team won 45 games despite being down a starter in Washington and not having Abdul-Jabbar for nearly two months, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to Seattle.[105] During the 1978–79 season, the team posted a 47–35 record but lost to the SuperSonics in the semifinal round of the playoffs.[96] In the 1979 NBA draft, Los Angeles selected 6-foot, 9-inch point guard Magic Johnson from Michigan State with the first overall pick.[106] It took Johnson's teammates time to acclimate themselves to his passing ability, as his \"no-look\" passes often caught them unaware. Once they adjusted, his passing became a key part of Los Angeles' offense.[107] The Lakers won 60 games in Johnson's rookie year, and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals. Johnson won the Finals MVP award, after starting at center for the injured Abdul-Jabbar in game six, and tallying 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists.[108] The team fell off in the 1980–81 season, though, as the Lakers lost Johnson for most of the season to a knee injury.[109] The team turned in a 54–28 record and finished second behind the Phoenix Suns in the Pacific Division.[109] The Rockets, led by Moses Malone, defeated Los Angeles in the first round of the playoffs.[109] Early in the 1981–82 season, Johnson complained to the media about head coach Paul Westhead and demanded a trade.[110] Westhead was fired shortly after Johnson's criticisms, and although Lakers' owner Jerry Buss stated that Johnson's comments did not factor into the decision, Johnson was vilified by the national media and booed both on the road and at home.[111][112][113] Buss promoted assistant coach Pat Riley to \"co-head coach\" with Jerry West (although West considered himself Riley's assistant) on November 19 and the team won 17 of its next 20 games.[109][114][115] Nicknamed \"Showtime\" due to the team's new Johnson-led fast break-offense, the Lakers won the Pacific Division title and swept both the Suns and Spurs in the 1982 playoffs.[116] Los Angeles stretched its postseason winning streak to nine games by taking the first contest of the NBA Finals from the 76ers.[109][117] The team won the Finals 4–2 to finish a 12–2 playoff run.[109] On draft night in 1982, the Lakers had the first overall pick (the result of a trade with Cleveland midway through the 1979–80 season, when the Lakers had sent Don Ford and a 1980 first-round pick to the Cavaliers for Butch Lee and their 1982 selection) and selected James Worthy from North Carolina.[118] The Lakers won the Pacific Division at 58–24, but Worthy suffered a leg injury in the last week of the season and missed the rest of the season.[119] Nevertheless, they advanced to play Philadelphia in the 1983 NBA Finals after defeating Portland and San Antonio.[119] The Sixers, however, won the series and the championship in four games.[118] After the season West replaced Sharman as the team's GM.[120] In the 1983–84 season, Los Angeles went 54–28, and played Boston in the Finals for the first time since 1969.[121] The Lakers won two of the first three games. However, Kevin McHale's hard clothesline foul of Lakers forward Kurt Rambis on a fast break is credited as a turning point of the series.[122] Boston won three of the next four to win the title and send Los Angeles's record to 0–8 in Finals series against the Celtics.[121] Using the past year's Finals defeat as motivation, the team won the Pacific Division for the fourth straight year and lost just two games in the Western Conference playoffs. In the NBA Finals, the Celtics were again the Lakers' final hurdle. Los Angeles lost game one of the NBA Finals by a score of 148–114, in what is remembered as the \"Memorial Day Massacre\".[123] The Lakers, behind 38-year-old Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar, recovered to defeat the Celtics in six games.[124] The team won the title in the Boston Garden and became the first visiting team to ever win an NBA championship in Boston, as the Golden State Warriors later achieved this feat in 2022.[123] In the 1985–86 season, the Lakers started 24–3 and went on to win 62 games and their fifth straight division title.[126] The Rockets, however, defeated the Lakers in five games in the Western Conference Finals. Houston won the series when Ralph Sampson hit a 20-foot jumper as time expired in game five at The Forum.[126] Prior to the 1986–87 season, the Lakers moved A.C. Green into the starting lineup, and acquired Mychal Thompson from the Spurs.[127] Johnson won his first career MVP Award while leading the Lakers to a 65–17 record,[127] and Michael Cooper was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year.[127] Before the season, Riley had made the decision to shift the focus of the offense to Johnson over the 40-year-old Abdul-Jabbar.[128] The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals by sweeping the Nuggets, defeating the Warriors in five games, and sweeping the SuperSonics in the Western Conference Finals.[129] The Lakers defeated Boston in the first two games of the Finals, and the teams split the next four games, giving Los Angeles their second championship in three seasons.[127] The series was highlighted by Johnson's running \"baby hook\" shot to win game four at Boston Garden with two seconds remaining.[130] Johnson was named the NBA Finals MVP, in addition to regular season MVP.[131] At the Lakers' championship celebration in Los Angeles, coach Riley brashly declared that Los Angeles would repeat as NBA champions,[127] which no team had done since the 1968–69 Boston Celtics. Looking to make good on Riley's promise in the 1987–88 season, the Lakers took their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title with a 62–20 record. They swept the Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Finals before pulling out a tough seven-game series win over the Utah Jazz led by youngsters Karl Malone and John Stockton. A seven-game Western Conference finals win over the Dallas Mavericks propelled the Lakers to the NBA Finals once again. In their seventh trip to the Finals in nine years, they met the Detroit Pistons. Los Angeles would take the series in seven games, and James Worthy's game seven triple-double earned him a Finals MVP award.[132] The win marked their fifth title in nine years, but would also mark their last title until 2000. In the 1988–89 season, Los Angeles won 57 games and their eighth consecutive Pacific Division crown. They swept through the playoffs defeating Portland, Seattle, and Phoenix. In an eighth trip to the NBA Finals in 10 years, they once again faced the Detroit Pistons.[133] Hampered by injuries to Byron Scott and Johnson, the Lakers were swept by Detroit.[134] Following the 1989 Finals, on June 28, 1989, after 20 professional seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar announced his retirement. The Lakers still cruised through the Pacific Division, winning their ninth consecutive division crown with a 63–19 record. However, after beating the Rockets in the first round, they lost four games to one in the second round of the playoffs to the Suns.[135] Riley announced he was stepping down after the season citing burnout,[136] and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy.[137] Riley's departure received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had grown tired of his intense practices and felt he tried to take too much credit for the team's successes.[138] Following the season, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request.[139] The 1990–91 Lakers failed to win the Pacific Division for the first time in 10 years, but still finished with a 58–24 record. After cruising through the Western Conference playoffs, the Lakers found themselves in the NBA Finals once again, their ninth trip to the Finals in 12 years. The 1991 Finals represented a changing of the guard as the Lakers were defeated in five games by the Chicago Bulls, led by superstar Michael Jordan.[140] On November 7, 1991, Magic Johnson announced he had tested positive for HIV and would retire immediately.[141] In their first season without Johnson, the team won 43 games to earn the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoffs.[37] The Lakers were defeated in the first round by Portland. Following the season, head coach Mike Dunleavy was fired. The Lakers would lose 43 games in 1992–93 under Randy Pfund, their first losing season since 1976. The Lakers would still make the playoffs, and would become the first eighth seed to win the opening two games on the road against a number one seed when they took a 2–0 lead against Phoenix.[142] They lost the next two games at home however, then game five in Phoenix in overtime.[142] During the 1993–94 season, Pfund was fired during the season that would result in the Lakers failing to make the playoffs for the first time since 1976. Magic Johnson, would coach the final 16 games of the season with former teammate Michael Cooper as his lead assistant.[143] Johnson decided not to take the job permanently due to what he felt was a lack of commitment from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing streak to finish 33–49.[144][145] Under new coach Del Harris, Los Angeles made the playoffs each of the next two seasons but was eliminated in the second and first rounds respectively.[146][147] The team was led by young guards Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones.[148] Johnson came out of retirement to return as a player in the 1995–96 season to lead the then 24–18 Lakers to a 29–11 finish.[149] After some run-ins with Van Exel, displeasure with Harris's strategies, and a first-round loss to the Rockets, Johnson decided to retire for the final time after the season.[150] During the 1996 off-season, the Lakers acquired 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th overall out of Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in that year's draft, by Charlotte. Los Angeles also signed free-agent Shaquille O'Neal.[151] Trading for Bryant was West's idea, and he was influential in the team's signing of the all-star center.[152] \"Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers\", O'Neal later said.[153] They used their 24th pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher.[154] During the season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos to Phoenix for Robert Horry.[155] O'Neal led the team to a 56–26 record, their best effort since 1990–91, despite missing 31 games due to a knee injury.[156] O'Neal averaged 26.2 ppg and 12.5 rpg and finished third in the league in blocked shots (2.88 bpg) in 51 games.[156][157] The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs as O'Neal scored 46 points in Game 1 against the Trail Blazers, marking the highest single-game playoff scoring output by a Laker since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics in 1969.[156] In the next round, the Lakers lost in five games to the Utah Jazz.[156] In the 1997–98 season, O'Neal and the Lakers had the best start in franchise history, 11–0.[158] O'Neal would miss 20 games on the season due to an abdominal injury.[158] Los Angeles battled Seattle for the Pacific Division title most of the season. In the final two months, the Lakers won 22 of their final 25 games,[158] finishing 61–21, but still finished second to Seattle in the standings.[158] The Lakers defeated Portland three games to one in the first round to advance to face Seattle. Although the Sonics won the first game, the Lakers responded with four straight wins, taking the series,[158] but were swept by the Jazz in the Western Conference Finals.[158] During the 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell were traded to the Charlotte Hornets.[159] The team also acquired J. R. Reid, B. J. Armstrong, and Glen Rice.[160] Head coach Del Harris was fired in February after a three-game losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former Laker Kurt Rambis.[161] The team finished 31–19 in the strike-shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference.[162] The Lakers defeated Houston in the first round of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round. Game four of the series would be the last game ever played at the Great Western Forum.[163] Before the 1999–2000 season, West was prepared to hire Rambis as the team's full-time coach before an outcry from fans and members of the organization caused him to seek out a bigger name.[164] Los Angeles hired former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who had coached that team to six championships, and gave him a lucrative $6 million a year contract.[165] He brought along assistant Tex Winter and they installed Winter's version of the triangle offense.[166] The Lakers signed veterans Brian Shaw, John Salley, Ron Harper, and A.C. Green, who was a Laker during the \"Showtime\" era.[155] The team also moved to a new arena, the Staples Center.[167] Led by league MVP O'Neal, the Lakers won 31 of their first 36 games.[168] They finished 67–15, the highest win total since they won 65 in the 1986–87 season.[168] Then eliminated Sacramento and Phoenix in the first two rounds of the playoffs.[169] After the Lakers took a three games to one lead in the Western Conference Finals against Portland, the Trail Blazers won the next two games to force a game seven.[170] The Lakers, who trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter, would go on 19–4 run to tie the game and eventually win 89–84 to advance to the NBA Finals.[170] In their first trip to the Finals since 1991, the Lakers defeated Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers four games to two win their first title since 1988.[171] West retired from his spot in the team's front office after the season after a power struggle between him and Jackson over control of the team's operations.[172] After the season, starters Rice and Green left the team,[173] and Los Angeles signed Horace Grant.[174] The following season, the Lakers won 11 fewer regular season games than the prior year,[175] but swept the first three rounds of the playoffs, defeating the Portland, Sacramento, and San Antonio.[176] They met Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals. Although the Sixers took game one in overtime,[177] the Lakers won the next four games to win their second straight title. Their 15–1 postseason record was the best in NBA history.[178] The Lakers won 58 games in 2001–02. In the playoffs, they swept Portland and defeated San Antonio four games to one to advance to the Western Conference Finals to face Sacramento.[181] The series would go on to be known as one of the greatest playoff matchups in NBA history. The series extended to all seven games and ended in a Lakers victory.[182] In game one, Bryant scored 30 points as the Lakers won, 106–99. The series would then shift in Sacramento's favor, with the Kings winning the next two games. Facing a deficit in game 4, the Lakers had the ball with under 20 seconds to play. After misses by both Bryant and O'Neal, Kings center Vlade Divac tapped the ball away from the rim in an attempt to wind down the clock. It went straight into Robert Horry's hands, who drained a game-winning three with under three seconds to play. After the Kings won game five on a buzzer-beater by Mike Bibby, the Lakers were faced with a must-win game six. In one of the most controversial playoff games in league history (Tim Donaghy's betting scandal), the Lakers would win by four points.[183] The Lakers went on to win game seven in overtime, with the Kings missing numerous potentially game-saving shots and free throws. The Lakers then achieved a three-peat by sweeping Jason Kidd and the New Jersey Nets in the NBA Finals.[184] O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP awards, making him the only player besides Michael Jordan to win three consecutive Finals MVPs.[185] The Lakers would attempt a four-peat the following year, but started the 2002–03 season 11–19.[186] However, they finished the season 39–13 to finish 50–32.[187] They defeated Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, but the four-peat attempt ended as they were eliminated by San Antonio in six games in the second round.[188] During the 2003–04 season, the team was the subject of intense media coverage generated by the teaming of four stars and the sexual-assault case involving Kobe Bryant.[189][190] Before the season, the Lakers signed two-time MVP Karl Malone formerly of the Jazz, and former Seattle Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton to join O'Neal and Bryant,[191] forming the first \"superteam\" of the 21st century.[192][193] Three of the \"big four\", however, struggled with injuries: O'Neal suffered from a strained calf, Malone an injured knee, and Bryant an injured shoulder.[194][195] The Lakers started 18–3 and finished 56–26 and won the Pacific Division title, entering the playoffs as the No. 2 seed. They defeated Houston, San Antonio, and Minnesota to advance to the NBA Finals.[196] In the Finals, they would lose to Detroit in five games. During the 2004 off-season, the team entered a rebuilding phase when O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, Caron Butler, and a first-round draft pick.[197] Bryant and O'Neal had clashed in the past,[198] and the media credited their feud as one of the motivating factors for the trade.[199] Jackson did not return as head coach, and wrote a book about the team's 2003–04 season, in which he heavily criticized Bryant and called him \"uncoachable\".[200][201][202] The Lakers front office said that the book contained \"several inaccuracies\".[203] The Lakers also traded Rick Fox and Gary Payton to Boston, for Chris Mihm, Marcus Banks, and Chucky Atkins before the 2004–05 season.[204] Derek Fisher, frustrated with losing playing time, opted out of his contract and signed with the Warriors.[204] The team hired Rudy Tomjanovich to replace Jackson.[204] After sitting out the first half of the 2004–05 season, Malone announced his retirement on February 13, 2005.[205] Tomjanovich coached the team to a 22–19 record before resigning due to health problems.[206] Assistant Frank Hamblen was named interim head coach to replace Tomjanovich for the remainder of the season.[207] Bryant (ankle) and Odom (shoulder) suffered injuries, and the Lakers finished 34–48, missing the playoffs for only the fifth time in franchise history and the first time since 1994.[37] With the tenth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft, the Lakers selected Andrew Bynum, a center from St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey.[208] The team also traded Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins to Washington for Kwame Brown and Laron Profit.[209] Jackson returned to coach the team after Rudy Tomjanovich resigned midway through the previous season.[210] On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points against Toronto, the second-highest total in NBA history.[211] Ending the season 45–37, the team made the playoffs after a one-season absence.[212] After taking a three games to one lead in the first round, Phoenix came back to take the series in seven games.[213] In the following season, the Lakers won 26 of their first 39 games,[214] but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40.[214] They were eliminated in the first round by Phoenix again.[214] Frustrated by the team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the off-season.[215] Buss initially agreed to seek a trade,[216] but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.[217] After re-acquiring Derek Fisher, the Lakers started the 2007–08 season with a 25–11 record, before Andrew Bynum, their center who was leading the league in field-goal percentage, went out for the year due to a knee injury in mid-January.[218] In what would become a crucial transfer for the franchise's return to championship form, they acquired the six-time all-star power forward Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade in early February and went 22–5 to finish the season.[219] The Lakers' 57–25 record earned them the first seed in the Western Conference.[220] Bryant was awarded the league's MVP award, becoming the first Laker to win the award since O'Neal in 2000.[221][222] In the playoffs, they defeated the Nuggets in four games, the Jazz in six, and the defending champion Spurs in five, but lost to the Celtics in six games in the NBA Finals.[223] In the 2008–09 season, the Lakers finished 65–17; the best record in the Western Conference.[224] They defeated the Jazz in five games, the Rockets in seven and the Nuggets in six, to win the Western Conference title. They then won their 15th NBA championship by defeating the Orlando Magic in five games in the NBA finals.[225] Bryant was named the NBA Finals MVP for the first time in his career.[226] The Lakers, who had added Ron Artest (Metta World Peace)[227] in place of Trevor Ariza in their starting lineup, finished the 2009–10 season with the best record in the Western Conference for the third straight time. On January 13, 2010, the Lakers became the first team in NBA history to win 3,000 regular-season games by defeating the Dallas Mavericks 100–95.[228] They defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Utah Jazz, and the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference playoffs. In the finals, the Lakers played the Boston Celtics for the 12th time. They rallied back from a 3–2 disadvantage in the series and erased a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter of the seventh game to defeat the Celtics. This series win gave them their 16th NBA title overall and 11th since they moved to Los Angeles.[229] Bryant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, despite a 6–24 shooting performance in game seven.[230] After much speculation, head coach Phil Jackson returned for the 2010–11 season.[231] In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the New Orleans Hornets in the first round.[232] But their opportunity for a three-peat was denied by the Dallas Mavericks in a four-game sweep of the second round. After the season, it was announced that Jackson will not be returning to coach the Lakers.[233] After Jackson's retirement, former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown was hired as head coach on May 25, 2011.[234] Before the start of the shortened 2011–12 season, the Lakers traded Lamar Odom to the Dallas Mavericks after Odom requested to be traded.[235] On the trade deadline long time Laker Derek Fisher along with a first round draft pick were traded to the Houston Rockets for Jordan Hill.[236] With a 41–25 regular season record the Lakers entered the playoffs as the third seed, the team defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round in seven games but were eliminated by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round in five games.[237][238] On July 4, 2012, Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns agreed to a sign-and-trade deal that would send him to the Lakers in exchange for the Lakers' 2013 and 2015 first round draft picks, 2013 and 2014 second round draft picks, and $3 million. The trade was made official on July 11, 2012, the first day the trade moratorium was lifted.[239] On August 10, 2012, in a four-team trade the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum and acquired Dwight Howard.[240] The combination of these players with Bryant and Gasol led media outlets to refer to them as a \"superteam\" comparable to the 2003-04 Lakers.[241][242] On November 9, 2012, Mike Brown was relieved of coaching duties after a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season.[243] Assistant Coach Bernie Bickerstaff took over as interim head coach, leading the Lakers to a 5–5 record. On November 12, 2012, the Lakers hired Mike D'Antoni as head coach.[244] On February 18, 2013, Lakers owner Jerry Buss died from cancer at age 80.[245] On the court, D'Antoni coached the Lakers to a 40–32 record the rest of the way to finish 45–37, their worst record since 2007. The Lakers clinched a playoff berth on the final game of the season and finished seventh in the Western Conference after beating the Houston Rockets on April 16, 2013.[246][247] The Lakers battled injuries all season, the most prominent of which is the Achilles tendon rupture to Kobe Bryant that ended his season after 78 games. The absence of Bryant was sorely felt as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs.[248] Nevertheless, Bryant passed Lakers legend Wilt Chamberlain to become the fourth all-time leading scorer in NBA history on March 30, 2013, against the Sacramento Kings.[249] On December 8, 2013, Bryant played in his first game since tearing his Achilles tendon on April 12, 2013.[250] However, on December 17, 2013, he suffered a broken bone in his knee, and did not return for the remainder of the season.[251][252] On March 25, 2014, the Lakers scored 51 points in the third quarter against the New York Knicks, the most points scored in a quarter in the history of the franchise.[253] The Lakers went on to miss the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2005, for just the second time in the last two decades and for just the sixth time in franchise history. On April 30, 2014, Mike D'Antoni resigned from his position as head coach after a 27–55 season.[254] After spending the majority of the off-season without a head coach, the Lakers named former player Byron Scott as the new head coach.[255] After the season, he was the frontrunner to become the new Lakers head coach. Scott interviewed three times for the position, which had become vacant after Mike D'Antoni's resignation.[256] On July 28, 2014, he signed a multi-year contract to coach the Lakers.[257] During the first game of the 2014–15 season, the seventh overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, Julius Randle went down with a broken leg, which ended his rookie season. The Lakers began their season losing 10 of their first 16 games. After playing only 35 games, Kobe Bryant tore a rotator cuff in his shoulder ending his season. Nick Young was also forced to end his season with a fractured kneecap, leaving the team with a record of 14–41.[258] With 27 games left in the regular season, Byron Scott gave rookie Jordan Clarkson more playing time. Clarkson, the 46th overall pick in the 2014 draft, finished his rookie season with game stats of 11.9 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 3.5 apg, and shooting 44.8% from the field.[259] The Lakers' season ended with a record of 21–61, the fourth worst record in the league and at the time the worst record in franchise history. The next season, the Lakers had the second overall pick of the 2015 NBA draft, which they used to select Ohio State freshman point guard D'Angelo Russell. The team also selected Larry Nance Jr. with the 27th overall pick.[260] On November 30, 2015, Bryant announced he would retire at the end of the season after 20 seasons with the team.[261] In Bryant's last season the team missed the playoffs for the third straight year with a 17–65 record, the worst in franchise history.[262] On April 24, 2016, the Lakers announced that they would not exercise their option on Byron Scott's contract for the following season.[263] On April 29, the team announced another former Laker, Luke Walton, as their new head coach. At the time of his hiring, Walton was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, who were in the playoffs, so he could not officially begin his duties as head coach until the Warriors' playoff run was over.[264] The Lakers earned the second overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft,[265] and selected Brandon Ingram from Duke University.[266] The team also selected Ivica Zubac with the 32nd overall pick.[267] On February 21, 2017, the Lakers fired general manager Mitch Kupchak, while Magic Johnson was named as the president of basketball operations. The team's governor Jeanie Buss, also announced the removal of her brother, Jim Buss, from his position as executive vice president of basketball operations.[268][269] On March 7, 2017, the Lakers hired Rob Pelinka as the general manager, signing him to a five-year deal.[270] The Lakers again earned the second overall pick, this time, in the 2017 NBA draft,[271] and selected Lonzo Ball from UCLA.[272] The Lakers also acquired Kyle Kuzma from the University of Utah with the 27th overall pick from a draft-day trade, along with Brook Lopez in exchange for D'Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov.[273] The Lakers also traded their 28th overall pick, Tony Bradley, in exchange for the 30th overall pick, Josh Hart, from Villanova University and the 42nd overall pick, Thomas Bryant, from Indiana University.[274] In February 2018, Nance Jr. and Clarkson were traded away to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye, and a 2018 first-round draft pick.[275] On July 2, 2018, Randle was renounced by the Lakers.[276] On July 9, 2018, the Lakers signed LeBron James to a four-year, $154 million contract.[277][278] By the Christmas Day game, the Lakers were six games over .500 before James sustained a groin injury leading to several weeks of missed games. Ball and Ingram also ended their seasons early due to injuries. On February 7, 2019, Zubac was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers along with Michael Beasley in exchange for Mike Muscala.[279] On April 9, 2019, Johnson stepped down as the team's president of basketball operations,[280] and two days later, the Lakers parted ways with head coach Walton after the team failed to reach the playoffs for the sixth straight year.[281] On May 13, Frank Vogel was named the Lakers' head coach.[282] The Lakers received the fourth overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft lottery.[283] On July 6, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans for Ball, Ingram, Hart, and three first-round picks, including the number four overall in the 2019 draft.[284] This trade officially ended the young core era of the Lakers; only Kuzma remained out of the group of players. Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Lakers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season.[285] The Lakers finished the regular season with a 52–19 record, entering the playoffs for the first time since 2013,[286] and as the top seed for the first time since 2010.[287] They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010.[288] They defeated the Miami Heat 4–2 to win the 2020 NBA Finals,[289] and James was named the Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career.[290] The win gave Los Angeles their 17th championship in franchise history, tying the Boston Celtics for the most all-time.[291] Primary Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, who took over the team in 2017, would also become the first female controlling owner of an NBA team to win the NBA Finals.[292] During the 2021 off-season, the Lakers picked up many NBA veterans, the most notable of which was Russell Westbrook, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade with the Washington Wizards. Kyle Kuzma, the last player left from the Lakers' young core era, was traded away, along with others. Other veterans picked up during the off-season included Carmelo Anthony, DeAndre Jordan, and returning players Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo.[293] Alex Caruso left the Lakers and signed with the Chicago Bulls, and veteran locker-room voice Jared Dudley retired.[294][295] The Lakers made a surprising run in the 2023 Playoffs, making the Western Conference Finals, but were defeated by the eventual champion Denver Nuggets. On December 9, 2023, the Lakers won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament after defeating the Indiana Pacers in the championship game. James was named the inaugural tournament MVP.[296] They finished the 2023–24 season 47–35 and beat the New Orleans Pelicans in the Play-In to make the playoffs as the seventh seed. On June 27, 2024, the Lakers selected Bronny James, the son of LeBron, at 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, forming the first father-son duo in NBA history.[297] JJ Redick was hired as head coach of the Lakers.[298] On October 23, 2024, the team made NBA history as being the first one to have father and son (LeBron James & Bronny James) play together as they beat Minnesota Timberwolves on their season opening game.[299] The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the Lakers involves the two most storied basketball franchises in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. It has been called the best rivalry in the NBA.[300] The two teams have met a record 12 times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s and three times in the 1980s. The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4–2. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games. The two teams were tied for the highest number of championships, with 17 titles apiece, until the Celtics surpassed this record in the 2024 NBA Finals; together, the 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history. The all-time series record for the Lakers vs Celtics is 209–165 with the Celtics being the forerunners. Boston is the only NBA team with an overall winning record against the Lakers.[301] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Detroit Pistons developed in the late 1980s.[302]: 228 Both teams faced each other in back-to-back finals appearances in the 1988 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games and the 1989 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in 4 games. The rivalry reemerged in the early 2000s as both teams squared off against one another in the 2004 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in five games. The Lakers have a lengthy history with the Golden State Warriors as both franchises relocated to California during the early 1960s. Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike, unlike the Dodgers–Giants rivalry of MLB, or the 49ers–Rams rivalry of the NFL in which both teams express fierce animosity against one another.[303][304] The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991. Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers. Both teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams relocated to California in the early 1960s.[305][306] The Lakers lead the all time regular season series 262–173, and the postseason series 25–11.[307][308] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers is unique because they were the only two NBA teams to share an arena, the Crypto.com Arena. It is also one of only two intra-city rivalries in the NBA, the other being the new crosstown rivalry between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets. Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers.[309][310] Some contend that the term rivalry was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful.[311] The Lakers and the Phoenix Suns rivalry didn't develop until the 2000s where the teams were led by Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash, respectively. The San Antonio Spurs and the Lakers, developed what some would classify as a rivalry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 1999, the teams have met in the NBA Playoffs five times, with the clubs combining to appear in seven consecutive NBA Finals (from 1999 to 2005). Additionally, the teams combined to win five NBA championships from 1999 to 2003; the Spurs won the NBA championship in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014 while the Lakers won the championship in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010. From 1999 to 2004 the clubs' rivalry was often considered the premier rivalry in the NBA,[312] and each time the clubs faced each other in the playoffs the winner advanced to the NBA Finals. In 2008, the teams met again in the Western Conference Finals where the Spurs were handily defeated only to beat the Lakers when they met again in 2013. The Kings and the Lakers have faced each other in the playoffs nine times between 1949 and 2002, and since the Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985, both have been based in California. The 2002 Western Conference Finals was one of the most bitterly contested in NBA history, with many controversial calls in game 6.[313] The Lakers would win the series in game 7. Berger and Chalfen purchased the NBL's disbanded Detroit Gems for $15,000 in 1947, changed their name to the Lakers, and relocated them to Minnesota. Max Winter bought a third of the club in their early years and sold his share to Mikan in 1954. Berger bought Mikan's share in 1956 giving him a controlling (⅔) interest.[314] After Mikan retired, attendance plummeted and the team lost money for several seasons, leading the ownership group to put the team up for sale in 1957.[315] Marty Marion, a retired baseball player and manager, and his business partner Milton Fischman attempted to purchase the team with the intention of moving the club to Kansas City, Missouri.[315][316] Mikan offered to mortgage his home in an attempt to buy the team and keep the club in Minnesota.[317] The Lakers were sold to a group of investors led by Bob Short, however.[314] The team was sold to Short's group with the agreement that it would not be relocated to Kansas City but kept in Minnesota.[318] Short's ownership group consisted of 117 Minnesota businesses and private citizens, who amassed a total of $200,000 for the purchase; $150,000 to buy the team and $50,000 to run it.[314] By 1958 Short had become 80% owner of the team by buying out his partners,[314] but the team was floundering. Attendance remained poor, and the NBA had put the Lakers on \"financial probation\", notifying them that if they did not meet certain ticket sales numbers they could be bought out by the league and relocated. Short was forced to move the team to Los Angeles in 1960; the club had lost $60,000 in the first half of the 1959–60 season alone.[319] The NBA's owners originally voted 7–1 against the move.[320] When Short indicated that he might take the team to a new rival league that was developing, however, the owners held another vote that same day and allowed the relocation (8–0).[321] Aided by Baylor's drawing power,[322][323] and the new locale, the team's finances improved when they arrived in LA.[324][325] Short sold the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for a then league record amount of $5.175 million.[326] Short insisted the deal be conducted in cash as he was wary of Cooke, so guards transported the money in a cart from one New York bank to another.[327] Cooke was a more hands-on owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations.[328] He personally financed construction of the Forum in 1967 at a cost of $16.5 million.[329][330] He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67 million.[331] Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce.[332][333] Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate.[330][334] Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998,[335] and until October 2010 Magic Johnson was a minority owner as well.[336] Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988.[337] In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league.[335] In 2013, Buss died at the age of 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer.[338][339][340] His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote.[341][342] Buss' succession plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.[342][343] Given the team's proximity to Hollywood, the Lakers fanbase includes numerous celebrities, many of whom can be seen at the Staples Center during home games.[344] Jack Nicholson, for example, has held season tickets since the 1970s, and directors reportedly need to work their shooting schedules around Lakers home games.[345] From 2002 and 2007 the team averaged just over 18,900 fans, which placed them in the top ten in the NBA in attendance. Red Hot Chili Peppers' song \"Magic Johnson\", from their 1989 album Mother's Milk, is a tribute to the former point guard, and frontman Anthony Kiedis and bassist Michael \"Flea\" Balzary are frequently seen attending home games.[346] In 2008, the team sold out every home game,[347] and in 2010, the Lakers had the most popular team merchandise among all NBA teams, and Bryant the most popular jersey.[348] The Laker nickname came from the state of Minnesota being the Land of 10,000 Lakes.[14][349] The team's colors are purple, gold and white.[350][6][351] The Lakers logo consists of the team name, \"Los Angeles Lakers\" written in purple on top of a gold basketball. The team usually wears white jerseys for Sunday and holiday home games.[350][352] List of the last five seasons completed by the Lakers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Los Angeles Lakers seasons. The Lakers have won 17 NBA titles and have appeared in the NBA Finals 15 other times.[37] These appearances include eight NBA Finals appearances in the 1980s. The best record posted by the team was 69–13, in 1972; the worst record was 17–65, in 2016.[37] Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage Bryant holds most individual team records for longevity including most games played (1,333), and most minutes logged (48,298). Johnson holds all significant assist records for the club including career assists (10,141), assists in a game (24), and highest assist average for a season (13.1). Johnson also has the most triple doubles, with his 138 over 100 more than the next closest player (Bryant; 17). Elmore Smith holds team records for blocks in a game (17), blocks per game for a season (4.85), and career blocks per game (3.93). The scoring records are mostly shared by Elgin Baylor and Bryant, with Baylor having the highest average for a career (27.4) while Bryant has the highest points scored in a single game (81). Baylor, Bryant and West hold the top five single-season scoring averages, with Bryant occupying the first (35.4) and fourth (31.6) spots, while Baylor has the second (34.8), and third (34.0), and West the fifth (31.3).[353][354] The Lakers hold several NBA records as a team including most consecutive games won overall (33) and most consecutive road games won (16), both of which came during the 1971–72 season,[355] highest field-goal percentage for a season at 54.5% (1984–85),[356] and highest road winning percentage at 0.816 (1971–72).[66] They also hold records for having (into the 2009–10 season) the most wins (3,027), the highest winning percentage (61.9%), and the most NBA Finals appearances (31).[37][357] The 2000–01 team set the NBA record for best playoff record at 15–1, which was later broken by the Golden State Warriors in 2017.[358] The 1971–72 team holds franchise records in wins (69), most points scored, and largest margin of victory; both of the latter came in the team's 63 point win versus Golden State (162–99).[359] They also held the record for most wins at home in the regular season (going 36–5 in 1971–72, then 37–4 in both 1976–77 and 1979–80) unil the Boston Celtics set the current record of 40–1 in the 1985–86 season. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, located at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles. The arena opened in fall 1999 and seats up to 18,997 for Lakers games.[360] Owned and operated by AEG and L.A. Arena Company, the arena is also home to the Los Angeles Clippers, the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings.[360] Before moving to Staples Center, for 32 seasons (1967–1999), the Lakers played their home games at The Forum in Inglewood, California, located approximately 10 miles southwest of the team's current home.[167] During the 1999 preseason, the Lakers played their home games at the Forum before officially moving into Crypto.com Arena, and once again hosted a preseason game versus the Golden State Warriors on October 9, 2009, this time to commemorate the team's 50th-anniversary season in Los Angeles.[361] In the first seven years in Los Angeles, the team played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, south of downtown Los Angeles.[362] While the team played in Minneapolis, the team played their home games at the Minneapolis Auditorium and the Minneapolis Armory from 1947 to 1960.[363] Roster Last transaction: December 29, 2024 The Lakers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA.[364] A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[365] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. The Lakers have had three first overall picks in their history: Elgin Baylor (selected in 1958), Magic Johnson (selected in 1979) and James Worthy (selected in 1982).[368] The Lakers have also had six lottery picks in their history: Eddie Jones (selected tenth overall in 1994), Andrew Bynum (selected tenth overall in 2005), Julius Randle (selected seventh overall in 2014), D'Angelo Russell (selected second overall in 2015), Brandon Ingram (selected second overall in 2016) and Lonzo Ball (selected second overall in 2017).[368] Other draft picks include Jerry West and Gail Goodrich in the 1960s, Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon in the 1970s, A.C. Green and Vlade Divac in the 1980s, Elden Campbell, Nick Van Exel, Derek Fisher and Devean George in the 1990s, and Luke Walton, Sasha Vujačić, and Ronny Turiaf in the 2000s.[368] There have been 29 head coaches for the Lakers franchise. John Kundla coached the team in Minneapolis when they won their first five BAA/NBA championships from 1949 to 1954.[52] Pat Riley is second in franchise history in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins.[369] Phil Jackson broke Riley's regular-season wins record in 2009, and he passed Riley's playoff wins and games coached records in 2010.[369] Jackson, Riley, Kundla, and Bill Sharman have all been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for their coaching careers. George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Jerry West, Pat Riley, Magic Johnson, Kurt Rambis, Byron Scott and Luke Walton have all played and head-coached for the Lakers. Jackson, who had two stints as head coach, was coach from 2005 to 2011. In May 2011, Mike Brown was named his replacement for the 2011–12 season.[370] Brown was fired[371] on November 9, 2012, after a 1–4 start. Assistant coach Bernie Bickerstaff served as interim head coach for five games before the Lakers selected Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. D'Antoni resigned at the end of the 2013–14 season. In July 2014, Byron Scott was hired as head coach.[372] After the 2015–16 season ended, Scott was fired. On April 29, 2016, former Lakers player Luke Walton was named as Scott's replacement,[373] and served as head coach until the end of the 2018–19 season.[374] Frank Vogel was named his successor on a multiyear deal announced on May 13, 2019.[375] Vogel was fired following the conclusion of the 2021–22 season.[376] On June 6, 2022, Darvin Ham was named as Vogel's successor as head coach.[377] However, Ham was fired by the Lakers on May 3, 2024, after the Lakers were eliminated in Game 5 of the first round by the Denver Nuggets. Among his accomplishments was leading the Lakers to their first In-Season Tournament championship.[378] On June 24, 2024, former NBA player JJ Redick was hired as the 29th coach in team history.[379] The Lakers have 41 Hall of Famers (31 players, 5 head coaches, 1 assistant coach, and 4 contributors) who contributed to the organization.[380][381][382] Notes: The Lakers have retired thirteen jersey numbers and an honorary microphone in honor of their players and broadcaster:[392][393][394][395][396] On January 13, 2025, Michael Cooper will have his #21 jersey retired.[397] In addition, several other players and coaches who were instrumental to the franchise's success during its days in Minneapolis have a banner commemorating them as Hall of Fame members of the Minneapolis Lakers, although jersey numbers for these players are not retired by the franchise:[400] For 41 years, Chick Hearn was the team's broadcaster until his death in 2002. He broadcast 3,338 consecutive games between November 21, 1965, and December 16, 2001.[401] Hearn came up with West's \"Mr. Clutch\" nickname.[402] He was a part of the team's \"inner sanctum\" when Cooke was owner, and was consulted on basketball decisions.[403] Paul Sunderland, who had filled in for a couple of games while Hearn recuperated in the 2001–02 season, was named the permanent play-by-play announcer. Stu Lantz was retained as the color commentator.[404] When Sunderland's contract expired in the summer of 2005, the team chose not to renew it.[405] Then, Joel Meyers moved in alongside Lantz as the television announcer, with Spero Dedes and former Laker player Mychal Thompson on the radio.[406] For the 2011–12 season, Bill Macdonald became the new television play-by-play announcer, joining Lantz who remained as the color analyst. Meanwhile, John Ireland joined Mychal Thompson to call the games on radio.[407] Beginning in the 2009–10 season, Lakers radio broadcasts were heard on KSPN (Los Angeles ESPN Radio affiliate) in English and KWKW in Spanish.[406][408] KLAC had the team's radio broadcast rights from the 1976–77 season until the 2008–09 season.[408][409] Until 2011, telecasts had been split between KCAL-TV (road games) and Fox Sports West (home games), unless they are chosen for national broadcasts on ABC.[410] KCAL had been the Lakers' over-the-air television broadcaster since 1977, dating back to when the station was the RKO General-owned KHJ-TV, the longest relationship between an NBA team and a television station. Prior to KHJ, Laker games were televised on KTLA. The Lakers had been on Fox Sports West since 1985, dating to when it was the original Prime Ticket and owned by Buss.[411] On February 14, 2011, Time Warner Cable and the Lakers announced the formation of two new regional sports networks (one in English, one in Spanish) that would exclusively televise the team's games and related programming for 20 years starting with the 2012–13 season.[412] The said networks were originally known as Time Warner Cable SportsNet, before it was renamed Spectrum SportsNet in 2016 upon Charter Communications' purchase of Time Warner Cable.[413]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. NEW ORLEANS (AP) Aidan O'Connell and the Las Vegas Raiders played with a lot of energy - and looked pretty sharp - for a last-place team that had every excuse to be sluggish and sleep-deprived. O'Connell passed for two touchdowns, tight end Brock Bowers broke two rookie NFL records, and the Raiders won for just the fourth time this season, 25-10 over the struggling New Orleans Saints on Sunday. The convincing victory came after flight delays so long on Saturday that players didn't get into their New Orleans hotel until after midnight - less than 12 hours before kickoff. “These guys didn’t blink, flinch,\" Raiders coach Antonio Pierce said with a satisfied grin. \"We got in at 1 o'clock in the morning, got up this morning and rolled.” Bowers' seven catches for 77 yards gave him 108 receptions for 1,144 yards this season, eclipsing Mike Ditka's 1961 rookie tight end mark of 1,067 yards receiving and Puka Nacua's 2023 mark of 105 catches by a rookie at any position. Bowers also surpassed Darren Waller's franchise mark of 107 receptions in a season, which had stood since 2020. “It's pretty shocking to me,” Bowers said of his records, saying he had “no clue what to expect, coming from college to the NFL.” Ameer Abdullah rushed for 115 yards for the Raiders (4-12) - the journeyman running back's first 100-yard game in his 10 NFL seasons. “I'm not surprised by it,” Abdullah said. “I put a lot of work in. I'm very consistent. ... I'm happy for it, but I still think there's a lot more out there for me.” O'Connell finished with 242 yards passing, including a 3-yard TD pass to Jakobi Meyers and an 18-yarder to Tre Tucker as the Raiders won their second straight on the heels of a 10-game skid. “Better late than never,” O'Connell said. “We have a resilient bunch of guys and I'm sure it was probably harder for people to believe that when we were losing a lot of games.” Daniel Carlson kicked four field goals - his longest from 54 yards - for Las Vegas. With former Raiders QB Derek Carr unable to suit up for the Saints (5-11) because of his injured left, non-throwing hand, rookie Spencer Rattler received his fifth career start. He remained winless as a starter after completing 20 of 36 passes for 218 yards and one TD with two interceptions. Saints interim coach Darren Rizzi cited dropped passes, untimely penalties and breakdowns in pass blocking as the leading causes of his team's offensive anemia. “I felt like Spencer really never got settled in there, and he was moving around,” Rizzi said. “And he made some plays moving around, to his credit.” Rattler also rushed for 46 yards to finish as New Orleans' leading rusher for a second straight week. “It’s no secret our team is in a dark time right now,” Saints linebacker Demario Davis said. The Saints used trickery to take an early 7-3 lead. Running back Kendre Miller took what looked like a toss sweep to the right before throwing a lateral back to his left, where Rattler caught it and threw 30 yards downfield to wide-open tight end Foster Moreau in the end zone. Las Vegas moved in front for good on O'Connell's short scoring pass to Meyers with a minute left in the second quarter. After congregating for their flight on Saturday, only to learn of mechanical issues with their plane, Raiders players were sent home for several hours. “It was pretty weird,” O’Connell said. “I kind of got back home and my wife and my dog both looked at me like, ‘What are you doing here?’ It was fun to be home for an extra couple hours but last night was a late night.” The Raiders returned to team headquarters for meetings that normally would have been held in their New Orleans hotel before finally flying two times zones east. “It was kind of funny when we came in this morning,\" O'Connell said. “It was really a lot of juice from a lot of guys that I think kind of saw it as a challenge and tried to just enjoy it.” Saints: Miller left the game with concussion symptoms in the second quarter. LB Jaylan Ford appeared to seriously injure his lower right leg on punt coverage in the fourth quarter. DE Payton Turner left with an ankle injury. WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling briefly went down, but walked off on his own, after a hard collision over the middle. Raiders: Host the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.

                "content": "NEW ORLEANS, Louis.-- The Las Vegas Raiders are set to face the New Orleans Saints on the road today. After winning for the first time in months last week against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Raiders are looking to win consecutive games for the first time this season. However, a win in New Orleans would likely be detrimental to the team's draft position this offseason. Still, the Raiders are facing a Saints team that has lost three of its last four and 10 of its last 13 games, meaning the Raiders have a legitimate shot of winning. The Saints and Raiders are alike in many ways. Both teams have suffered numerous injuries, including to their starting quarterbacks. Both teams have had extended losing streaks. At one point this season, the Saints lost seven games in a row and the Raiders had lost 10 consecutive games before their win last week. The Raiders will dodge a meeting against former quarterback Derek Carr, but Raiders defensive coordinator Patrick Graham knows the Saints' offense is still dangerous. \"I mean, they're at home. It's the holidays,\" Graham said. \"I'm sure they have family in town. I mean, they're professionals, but they're going to be hungry. There's a lot of veterans on that team defensively. The interim head coach right now [Darren] Rizzi, he's done such a good job with the special teams over his career. He's doing a good job as an interim head coach. I expect them to be ready to go. And that building is one of the hardest places to play. Keep in mind, they're all on vacation and it's going to be a tough place to play. So, I'm looking forward to the challenge. I'm sure the players are, but it's the NFL. These guys know they're only guaranteed 17 opportunities to play this game. So, they'll be ready to go.” Like the Raiders, the Saints are shorthanded but still formidable. Graham elaborated on one of the Saints' best offensive weapons, wide receiver Chris Olave. \" I mean, I saw the freshmen from Ohio State in the playoff game. I mean, he's pretty good. And then these guys that come to the league, there's just a lot of growth in terms of their skill set. One thing that stands out to me is just how competitive they all are. Again, it's the same thing that I talked about with LSU. So, you see a guy who's explosive, who can make plays, make tough catches. So, we'll see if he's ready to go and we'll have to be prepared for him.\" Be sure to follow along with our live game thread throughout the contest.

They have dominated the time of possession, nearly possesing the ball double the amount of time the Saints have. The Raiders have not turned the ball over, were only penalized twice for five yards and nearly rushed for 100 yards in the first half. The bad news is, for as well as they have played, they are only up three points. The Saints have done a solid job of hanging around, as poor field position on multiple drives kept the Raiders from being able to pull away. This is a very winnable game for the Raiders, but Saints get the ball to start the second half. The Raiders must get a stop on the first drive after halftime. Brock Bowers.

WR Tyrell Shavers led all receivers in yards with 69 and a touchdown. The defense forced three takeaways and had 4.0 total sacks. DE A.J. Epenesa, Von Miller and DT Ed Oliver each had 1.0 sack while DT DaQuan Jones and DE Greg Rousseau each had 0.5 sacks. CB Christian Benford and DT Jordan Phillips both had interceptions and LB Matt Milano had the fumble recovery. Oliver had a forced fumble as well. LB Joe Andreessen led tacklers with eight. Additional notes: After winning the opening toss and electing to receive the football first, the Buffalo Bills offense marched right down the field to score the first points of the day. On the drive, Allen completed four of six passes for 56 yards, including key third down conversions of 12 yards and 23 yards to WR Khalil Shakir and WR Mack Hollins respectively. On their first redzone play, Allen threw a short pass to TE Dalton Kincaid, who picked up 11 yards after spinning out of a tackle from CB D.J. Reed. Following a pass interference flag in the end zone Allen snuck the ball into the end zone to score the touchdown and give the Bills the early 7-0 lead. The Jets took over for their first possession of the game following the Bills touchdown. The Jets utilized their run game to move the ball down the field while QB Aaron Rodgers completed three passes for 24 yards. On fourth-and-one from the Bills 24-yard line, Rodgers handed the ball to RB Breece Hall, but he was stuffed at the line of scrimmage for no gain by DE Greg Rousseau, forcing the turnover-on-downs. On the Jets ensuing drive after the Bills punted the football, they once again were moving the ball down the field. Rodgers completed a 28-yard catch and run to WR Garrett Wilson that set up the Jets in the red zone. Two plays later though, Rodgers dropped back and threw a pass short, that was tipped at the line by Rousseau and intercepted by DT Jordan Phillips who subsequently jumped into the stands with fans. On just their third drive of the game, the Bills were forced to punt once again. P Sam Martin pinned the Jets deep in their own territory at the 5-yard line. After a false start and a rush that went for -1 yard, Rodgers dropped back to pass from his own 2-yard line. DE A.J. Epenesa beat LT Max Mitchell around the edge and found his way to Rodgers, sacking him for the safety. Both teams took turns trading punts to start the second half. On the Jets second drive of the third quarter, the Bills defense took the ball away from the Jets offense again. First Rousseau sacked Rodgers on second-and-15. Then Rodgers dropped back to pass and looked to WR Allen Lazard but instead found the hands of CB Christian Benford who ran the ball back 24 yards. The Bills were given an additional 15 yards because of an unnecessary roughness called on Rodgers who pushed Benford as he was running out of bounds. On the next drive, WR Amari Cooper got involved immediately, catching a nine yard pass before four plays later catching a 30-yard touchdown. Cooper rose up over CB Brandin Echols and hauled in the touchdown pass. The Bills piled on in the third quarter by scoring two touchdowns and forcing another takeaway. RB James Cook punched in a one-yard touchdown at the goal line to bring the score to 26-0. On the Jets first play on their next drive, Wilson caught the ball and broke away from a tackle attempt, but then DT Ed Oliver punched the ball out and LB Matt Milano landed on top of the fumble recovery. With possession at the Jets 14-yard line, Allen scrambled to his right and threw a pass across his body into the back of the endzone to WR Keon Coleman, who caught the ball over Reed and LB Quincy Williams. The Bills ended the third quarter with another sack by Oliver. To start the fourth quarter, QB Mitchell Trubisky stepped in. He and the offense picked up where Allen and the starters left off, throwing a touchdown to WR Tyrell Shavers. Shavers caught the pass from Trubisky and ran 69 yards into the endzone untouched for the first catch and first touchdown of his career. The Jets avoided a shutout when QB Tyrod Taylor checked into the game in the fourth quarter. Taylor led the Jets on a 13-play, 75-yard drive to score the Jets first touchdown of the game that ended in a Wilson touchdown grab. They then completed the two point conversion to TE Tyler Conklin to make the score 40-8. On their next drive, Taylor threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Conklin, but threw an incompletion on the two-point conversion attempt, bringing the score to 40-14. Lineup Notes: CB Rasul Douglas returned to the lineup after missing two games with a knee injury; S Taylor Rapp returned to the lineup after missing two games with a neck injury; LB Matt Milano returned to the lineup after missing one game with a biceps/groin injury; WR Tyrell Shavers was elevated to the game day roster; DT Austin Johnson and CB Kaiir Elam were inactive.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) Josh Allen reflected on Buffalo’s many offseason critics and doubters when asked about the Bills achieving their latest milestones while sewing up the AFC’s No. 2 seed with a 40-14 rout of the unraveling and undisciplined New York Jets on Sunday. It was a the Bills quarterback’s “I told you so moment,” even though Allen elected not to use those exact words. “It speaks to the staff that we’ve got here, the guys that we’ve got in this locker room, how this team is put together and the culture that we have,” Allen said. “We didn’t really pay attention to the preseason notions, but we heard them and we saw them and we knew what people were saying. \"But it had no effect on us.” Well, that might be a stretch when it comes to motivation. What’s unquestioned is how Allen and the Bills (13-3) overcame a young, patchwork roster following the offseason departure of six of eight team captains - including Stefon Diggs being traded to Houston - to run away with their fifth consecutive AFC East title and win a franchise-best 13 games for the fifth time in team history, and third since 2020. Coach Sean McDermott didn’t leave much doubt as to who deserves the most credit for leading the Bills to their sixth consecutive playoff berth, and helping them set the single-season franchise records for points (509) and touchdowns (63). “I think Josh Allen continues to show why he should be the MVP,” McDermott said. “I’ve been around this league long enough to know to see MVP every year for many years. And what he has done on this team and this organization in this community - and no offense to anybody else - but I’ve got a hard time believing that someone’s done more.” Allen threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score to become the NFL’s first player to score 40 touchdowns in five consecutive seasons. He did so in an outing Buffalo blew the game open by capitalizing on two Jets turnovers and scoring three touchdowns over a 5:01 span in the closing minutes of the third quarter. Buffalo’s defense forced three takeaways overall and sacked Aaron Rodgers four times, including a 2-yard loss for a safety in the second quarter. Nothing went right in what became a comedy of errors for Rodgers and the Jets (4-12). New York will finish with five or fewer wins for the seventh time over a 14-season playoff drought - the NFL’s longest active streak. “It’s kind of like the season, it just got away from us. Too many games got away from us,” said Rodgers, who finished 12 of 18 for 112 yards and two interceptions before being pulled in favor of Tyrod Taylor with Buffalo leading 40-0. “We were moving the ball well and then just hit a wall. And that’s kind of been the season.” Rodgers, who entered the game with 499 career TD passes and looking to become just the fifth player to reach 500, was instead shut out and became the NFL’s most sacked quarterback. The 41-year-old has now been sacked 568 times, moving ahead of Tom Brady (565) and into first place on the career list. Taylor accounted for all of New York’s points, with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Garrett Wilson and a 20-yarder to Tyler Conklin. Discipline was an issue for a Jets team that fell to 2-9 since Jeff Ulbrich took over as interim coach. New York finished with 16 accepted penalties for 120 yards. “It’s frustrating, it’s embarrassing, it’s maddening. It’s all of that,” Ulbrich said. Allen had a short and efficient outing, finishing 16 of 27 for 182 yards with a 30-yard TD pass to Amari Cooper and a 14-yarder to Keon Coleman before giving way to backup Mitchell Trubisky with Buffalo leading 33-0 through three quarters. And Trubisky piled on by completing a 69-yard touchdown pass to practice squad call-up Tyrell Shavers 2:23 into the fourth quarter. Shavers became the 13th Bills player to catch a touchdown pass, matching the single-season NFL record, to validate the “everybody eats” mantra Allen and the offense used to approach this season. The Bills defense enjoyed a dominating performance to snap a shaky three-game stretch in which it combined to allow 1,357 yards, 86 first downs and 107 points. “I wouldn’t say need ... and I don’t want to say reassurance, either,” said A.J. Epenesa, who sacked Rodgers for the safety. “But it just shows that this is what we can do and this is the standard that needs to be upheld.” Allen’s 1-yard score was the 65th rushing TD of his career, matching the team record held by Thurman Thomas. ... James Cook scored on a 4-yard run for his 15th TD rushing of the season, one short of the Bills' single-season record set by O.J. Simpson in a 14-game season in 1975. Cook matched Allen, who scored 15 last year. ... Wilson reached 1,000 yards receiving for the third straight year to start his career, the first Jets player to do so and the 10th player in NFL history to accomplish the feat.

                "content": "The Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets met in Week 17 of the NFL season, in a game with almost no meaning for playoff concerns. The Jets entered the game with a 4-11 record, having been eliminated many weeks before, while the Bills had all but locked the second seed in the AFC. As expected, there wasn't much competitiveness in the game. Buffalo jumped to a two-possession lead at halftime, including a bizarre safety from quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The Jets scored no points in the first half. In the second half, it never looked like the visitors would be able to recover at any point. After a slow start to the third quarter, Buffalo took flight and scored 28 straight points, with the blowout reaching 40-0. At least the Jets had two touchdowns to take some of the embarrassment away. Looking to predict NFL playoff Scenarios? Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game! The veteran quarterback had yet another bad performance, missing open receivers constantly while throwing multiple picks. He was pulled from the game late, when Buffalo already had a huge advantage on the score board. There aren't many things that went right for the Jets in this game, but Garrett Wilson, who could be looking for a trade according to Ian Rapoport, at least had a good performance. The offense stalled for almost the entire game. Allowing 40 points is always a bad thing, but it also comes to mind that the unity registered no sacks or interceptions throughout the game. Luckily for them, there's only one game left in the season. Allen solidified his MVP campaign with another solid performance, including a fantastic throw to Amari Cooper to score a touchdown. With one week to go, he remains the favorite to win the award in Vegas. One thing that could become a concern for Buffalo in January is their running game, with Cook amassing under 3.0 yards per carry on Sunday. Running the ball efficiently is one of the biggest keys to win playoff games. Buffalo Bills Nation!

                "title": "2025 NFL Draft order: Major shakeup at the top after Giants, Raiders and Jaguars all win in Week 17 - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. There was some major shakeup at the top of the 2025 NFL Draft order in Week 17. The New York Giants, who controlled their own destiny to secure the No. 1 pick, put up 45 points to upset the Indianapolis Colts. And if that wasn't enough, the Jacksonville Jaguars took down the Tennessee Titans and the Las Vegas Raiders won their second straight game after winning just two of their first 14 to open the season. That's three teams with three or fewer wins securing victories in the same week -- the first time that's happened in Week 17 or later since 2005, according to CBS Sports research. Those results produced the following: The New England Patriots now hold the top spot, followed by the Titans, Giants, Browns and Jaguars. Of those teams, Cleveland is the only one still left to play. It is currently taking on the Miami Dolphins. With Week 17 nearly complete, CBSSports.com looks at where teams would be picking at this moment in time. Also listed is each club's pending free agents and potential needs based on those players who may be leaving. The draft order, via Tankathon.com, is ordered by win-loss record and ties are broken by strength of schedule. Team needs are a combination of current needs and looking ahead to pending free agents.

                "content": "2025 NFL Draft order: Where Pats stand in first round after Week 17 loss originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston The No. 1 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft is very much in play for the New England Patriots. Saturday's 40-7 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers brought the Patriots' 2024 record to 3-13. They owned the No. 2 pick heading into Sunday's slate of games, but vaulted up to No. 1 after the New York Giants beat the Indianapolis Colts to improve to 3-13. The Jacksonville Jaguars and Las Vegas Raiders both moved to 4-12 with wins Sunday, meaning there are only four three-win teams -- the Patriots, Tennessee Titans, Giants and Cleveland Browns, who are each 3-13 after losing in Week 17. The Patriots own the strength of schedule tiebreaker over all three of those teams thanks to a weaker strength of schedule. Here's the updated order for the top 10 picks in the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft. This chart will be updated throughout Week 17: !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}(); The Patriots wrap up their 2024 campaign next Sunday at home against the Buffalo Bills.

                "content": "Janusz Michallik believes that Manchester City will still play their part in deciding who wins the Premier League title. Manchester City won for the first time in five Premier League games on Sunday after goals from Erling Haaland and Savinho earned a 2-0 victory at Leicester City in manager Pep Guardiola's 500th game in charge. The champions' second win in 14 games across all competitions meant they climbed two spots to fifth place with 31 points, 11 behind leaders Liverpool who have two games in hand. Leicester remain in the relegation zone in 18th. \"We needed it, all of us,\" Guardiola told Sky Sports. \"Just relief, that is the word to express how all of us feel. We have done incredible things and now we struggle to win games so now it's just relief.\" Savinho netted his first goal for City in the 21st minute when he pounced on a rebound from Phil Foden's long shot after Leicester goalkeeper Jakub Stolarczyk pushed the ball into his path. The Brazilian fired into the roof of the net from a tight angle. Haaland, who has two goals in eight league games in the worst stretch of his Premier League career, doubled City's lead in the 74th minute when he headed home a looping cross from Savinho, who latched onto a pass from Kevin de Bruyne. \"Things happen and we have to keep going, we have to stay positive and focus on the right things,\" Haaland said, before pushing Guardiola in the direction of the visiting fans who were chanting his name. \"It's always a relief to score and that was an important goal to go 2-0 up.\" The victory was far from a walkover, however. Leicester fans screamed for a penalty early on when Jamie Vardy found himself one-on-one with goalkeeper Stefan Ortega from a counter-attack. Ortega brought Vardy down in the box but Man City were saved by the offside flag. Josko Gvardiol nearly cost Guardiola's team a first-half goal with a disastrous header back to Ortega that was intercepted. City's disorganised back line saw Facundo Buonanotte clatter a shot off the bar minutes later. Leicester had another glorious chance early in the second half when Vardy headed into the box and James Justin got a touch on it that looked heading for the back of the net before Manuel Akanji cleared it off the line. Vardy missed an absolute sitter when he launched a shot just over the bar from close range. \"It was tight in the second half, they were much better. We don't have energy to sustain 90 minutes. Hopefully the New Year can help us bounce back,\" Guardiola said. \"To get results you have to do something. To do it in the position we have, many good things happened today. It is not enjoyable right now, it is just relief. We have done incredible things for many years. It is not the best.\" Leicester manager Ruud van Nistelrooy, who shared a long hug with Guardiola after the final whistle, told the BBC he has to judge his team's performance as well as the result. \"I wouldn't do the players credit if I didn't. We're professional, we know it's about results but we have to look through that because of the performance today,\" he said. \"We have to be judged on results and translate performances into results.\"",

The frailties that meant Pep Guardiola's reigning Premier League champions headed into this match on a dismal trot of one win in 13 across all competitions were again on display, most notably as Leicester repeatedly cut through a flimsy press and vacant midfield, during the first half. But the lack of cutting edge that has similarly afflicted City over the past couple of months was not a problem in the East Midlands. Savinho scored a long-awaited first goal for the club since his summer move from Troyes in the 21st minute. It was even more of a slog in the second half for English football's dominant force of recent years, who were in the rare position of being restricted to 33% of possession in the period between the restart, and Erling Haaland headed home his 14th goal of the season from Savinho's cross to seal the points.

But a 10th-minute incident seemed to drain City's heavily diluted self-belief. Jamie Vardy sprung into the box and was brought down by Stefan Ortega. An offside flag meant an obvious penalty concession was averted as Guardiola's men struggled to recover their poise. As such, the breakthrough came against the run of play, Phil Foden moved smartly to get off a snap shot from Rico Lewis' pass. Stolarczyk saved, but could only push the ball out to the on-rushing Savinho, who clattered home a high finish from a tight angle.

In contrast to the ice-cool Dutchman, Josko Gvardiol was shockingly accident-prone as half-time approached and his botched aerial clearance led to Facundo Buonanotte heading against the post. City were late out for the second period, but Guardiola's words of wisdom did little to stem the tide. Manuel Akanji cleared off the line to deny James Justin before Vardy wasted a glorious close-range opportunity. The veteran striker would rue that profligacy in the final 20 minutes as Guardiola's side finally strung together a second-half attack with conviction. The criminally under-used England U21 playmaker James McAtee, on for Foden, started it with some wonderfully smart play on the right. De Bruyne worked the ball to Savinho, who crossed for Haaland to thump in a header at the back post. A much-needed 14th Premier League goal of the season for the big Norwegian and a much-needed three points for City. But perhaps it's McAtee, brimming with confidence, and Savinho after a breakthrough afternoon who can give them a route out of the darkness.

Don't expect this to spark one of their patented monster runs. They were pretty awful for large chunks of this game against a Leicester side who, if they avoid relegation, will not do so by very much. Guardiola is in deep conversation with Harry Winks, briefly stroking his face. He's a strange man, all told, but he can enjoy a nice glass of wine tonight. Maybe you will too. Thanks for joining us. 90 mins+5: Leicester keep coming and Patson Daka heads over under pressure from Lewis. It's a corner. Guardiola and Van Nistelrooy are already having a cuddle and a chat on the sidelines. 90 mins: Will Alves replaces Mavididi for Leicester. He'll have five minutes of added time to strut his stuff. 89 mins: That's a clever header from Vardy that glances the top of Ortega's crossbar. If he'd done as well with easier opportunities today the outcome would probably look quite different. 87 mins: Boyhood City fan McAtee is revelling in this cameo in front of an adoring away support. Haaland drives a break and finds the England U21 star, who curls for the top corner from outside the box. It wasn't far away. 81 mins: Buy a ticket, lads! Choudhury, who is on to provide a little extra thrust down the right, fires a fine ball across the Manchester City goalmouth but there's no one there to finish. 74 mins: GOOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!!!! Erling Haaland!!!!!! Smash, meet grab. Finally City string together a nice break, with McAtee the instigator. Play moves to Savinho via De Bruyne and the Brazilian hangs up a delicious cross to the far post for Haaland to head home. The City fans away to my left go potty... then sing McAtee's name.

Hamza Choudhury replaces Justin for Leicester. Which might mean a change of shape. Doesn't look like it just yet. 68 mins: Oh Jamie Vardy, what have you done? Mavididi finds the Leicester captain in the middle of the six yard box. He volleys over and slaps the crossbar in frustration. 65 mins: In a move some fans have been calling for all season, James McAtee is coming on for Manchester City. Meanwhile, Vardy arrows a poor cross over everyone from a good position the right channel. El Khannouss flies into Lewis in over-enthusiastic fashion and the visitors can make their change. Foden, who looks exhausted, makes way. 62 mins: Kristiansen gets forward from full-back, Ajkanji with an important near-post header. Now Lewis fouls the Leicester man and it's a free-kick in a good position. It gets to Vestergaard at the back post, Vardy tries to turn goalwards, James does, Akanji off the line! 59 mins: Now a dangerous free-kick for Leicester, floated to the back post and Haaland is there to clatter away. All hands to the pump for Manchester City. 57 mins: Soumare gives away a pretty needless free-kick on the left. De Bruyne over it but Foden delivers and does so beautifully. Soumare atones by clearing behind. Haaland pops a volley towards goal from the latest short corner routine but Stolarczyk plunges onto it. 55 mins: Crucial clearance behind from Vestergaard. Foden crosses to the back post, Silva nods across and Gvardiol was lurking for the sucker punch, De Bruyne wastes the short corner. 54 mins: El Khannouss lets fly from range. Close enough but not worrying Ortega. The general flow of what's unfolding in front of the Manchester City goalkeeper might be though. 51 mins: Buonanotte goes down under an Ake challenge after being played through by Vardy. This will be checked. Ake is furious. No penalty. And you have to ask, if it's no penalty why isn't it a yellow for diving? City haven't really started at all this half and are inviting those sorts of situations. 48 mins: Kovacic fouls Buonanotte on halfway. He's been the lone combative participant in that City midfield at times but must be closing in on a booking. Back underway. Leicester have been out there waiting for their opponents for a little while, in fairness. And it's not warm. Manchester City get through to halftime. Again they look so vulnerable, their midfield an abomination out of possession. But Savinho's first goal for the club is the difference for now. During their ongoing slump, they also led against Sporting CP, Brighton, Feyenoord, 44 mins: This one is much better but Ake gets up brilliantly at the far post to clear. 43 mins: Corner to Leicester. They're really putting Guardiola's men under the pump. Dreadful delivery from El Khannouss but De Bruyne volleys behind to give him another go. 39 mins: BUONANOTTE AGAINST THE POST! Another perplexing decision from Gvardiol, who gets up at the back post and heads the ball up towards his own penalty spot. Via Mavididi it looks to Buonanotte, who turns a header against Orteta's right upright. Haaland and Foden then launch a blistering City break but can't find the finishing touch. 37 mins: Vardy, surely offside, finds Buonanotte. Great save from Ortega. Now the flag goes up up but the German keeper was not to know. 36 mins: Almost a bundling solo goal from Haaland! Gvardiol gets himself into some strife but Kovacic wins the second ball and City have fashioned a counter-attack. Haaland powers on past a couple of challenges, switches onto his left foot inside the box but drags just wide. 33 mins: Ohhhh, Leciester should be level! An absolute doozy of a ball in from the right by El Khannouss. Vardy leaves it, Buonanotte can't get on the end of it and it goes out for a goal kick. A wonderful cross that deserved a goal. 30 mins: De Bruyne down under a Vestergaard challenge. Some City players appeal for a penalty but the Belgian himself was rightly not especially interested. 28 mins: Haaland flexes the neck muscles on the end of a deflected Silva cross but it's easy enough for Stolarczyk to gather. 27 mins: Some swagger returning to City now, but we've seen already seen how fragile that can be. Time for Leicester to bed in. De Bruyne making a complete nonsense of a short corner helps their cause. 21 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLLL!!!!!!! Savinho!!!! Slightly against the run of play but how they needed that. Foden crafts something from nothing on the end of a Lewis pass and gets a shot away quickly from 25 yards. Stolarczyk parries but the onrushing Savinho cracks into the top corner on the rebound for his first City goal.

Ortega saves smartly and it's a corner. After a decent start, self-belief once again looks to have drained from the champions. Leicester waste the corner but Guardiola looks understandably concerned. 16 mins: More encouragement for Leicester as Vardy nips into the box. Lewis nips in smartly before the flag goes up again. City living dangerously because Vardy will time one of those before long. 12 mins: De Bruyne over the City free-kick. He scored from a similar range to this on this ground a couple of years ago... into the wall. 10 mins: Leicester scythe through the City midfield like everyone does nowadays, Ortega hesitates and brings Vardy down... offside. Good job for the City goalkeeper that it was because that was a definite penalty otherwise. 9 mins: Leicester look to break up the other end but Gvardiol closes the door on James. 7 mins: Fantastic save by Stolarczyk! Lewis floats a ball over the Leicester defence, De Bruyne volleys a first-time cross from near the byline. Haaland is on the end of it right-footed but the Foxes' keep does superbly to keep the strike out with his boot. 6 mins: Leicester's first foray ends with Mavididi sashaying into the box from the left and shooting wide of the far post. 5 mins: Kovacic coughs up possession carelessly but he and Lewis snap in to win it back before De Bruyne lashes over a left-footed sighter from way downtown. 2 mins: City with some patient, tentative possession before Savinho shifts gears past a few challenges into the box. He runs out of pitch before he can get a cross off, though. De Bruyne gets us underway. Foden starting wide right for the visitors. 4 mins before kickoff: Here come the teams, soundtracked by a bugle player. He'll probably get himself a Kasabian b-side at some point. Some flames pumped into the sky too. Appreciated the heat from that in a slightly nippy press box. 7 mins before kickoff: City are in the tunnel waiting for the hosts as the familiar strains of 'Club Foot' by Kasabian pump around the King Power. Jack Grealish, back on the bench today, appears to be in charge of morale as he aimings to lighten the mood with Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne. 25 mins before kickoff: The teams are well underway with their warmups. One of the cameras servicing the stadium feed was trained on Erling Haaland for some time. As you'd expect, given the Norwegian superstar has only three goals in his past 13 Premier League games, an unheard of return for most of his career. Haaland and Phil Foden were passing the ball intently between themselves for a decent period. Guardiola needs overdue big performances from those two today. 45 mins before kickoff: De Bruyne has enjoyed himself a few times on this ground before. In the previous edition of this fixture two seasons ago, the Belgian maestro scored the only goal with this sumptuous free-kick.

They have won on each of their past four visits to the King Power Stadium without conceding a goal. However, clean sheets are not really part of the equation for Guardiola's team at this juncture and Leicester have also dished out a couple of the most painful beatings of his tenure. A raucous 4-2 win on this ground eight years ago marked a low point of the Catalan's first season in the Premier League as two late goals from the visitors undeservedly softened the scoreline. Then there was the Foxes' 5-2 victory at a behind-closed-doors Etihad Stadium in September 2021. That defeat immediately preceded the arrival of defensive lynchpin Ruben Dias (currently injured, of course) and City look like they need similarly transformative reinforcements next month. 2 hours before kickoff: It can't go on like this for Manchester City, can it? In the immortal words of Mick McCarthy... it can! Leicester are on a bad run of form themselves but being in a relegation dogfight against an opponent they've often enjoyed cutting down to size could be a combination of circumstances too heady for Pep Guardiola's incredibly brittle team. This Premier League match kicks off in Leicester at 2:30 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: Jamie Vardy sat out the 3-1 loss to Liverpool with a knock. The veteran striker is back and will be keen to add to a handsome career record of nine goals against City. Ricardo Pereira (thigh), Mads Hermansen (groin), Wilfred Ndidi (thigh) and Abdul Fatawu (knee) remain sidelined. Wout Faes is also out with an injury sustained in the loss to Wolves. Jordan Ayew, who scored at Anfield, is suspended for this game, with Facundo Buonanotte coming into the forward line. Leicester lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Stolarczyk (GK) — Justin, Coady, Vestergaard, Kristiansen — Winks, Soumare — El Khannouss, Buonanotte, Mavididi — Vardy Injured: Pereira, Hermansen, Ndidi, Fatawu, FaesSuspended: Ayew (yellow-card accumulation) MORE: All the latest Man City news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings Kyle Walker (illness) and Jack Grealish (muscular) sat out the Everton game and will be assessed alongside fellow absentees Matheus Nunes and Ederson. Defensive injuries have arguably been just as big a problem for City as Rodri being out for the season. John Stones and Ruben Dias remain sidelined, although Nathan Ake was only substituted as a precaution against Everton on his return from a hamstring injury and will probably be asked to go back to the well once more. Savinho and Jeremy Doku started as a dual wing threat last time out, although Guardiola might take a more circumspect approach away from home. Kevin De Bruyne was feeling the effects of a virus on Boxing Day but is likely to return to the starting XI. Man City lineup (4-1-4-1, right to left): Ortega (GK) — Lewis, Akanji, Ake, Gvardiol — Kovacic — Foden, De Bruyne, Silva, Savinho — Haaland Injured: Stones, Dias, Nunes, Ederson, Walker (doubt), Grealish (doubt)Suspended: None Here's how to watch this Premier League match across selected areas of the world's major regions: If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.

It is sometimes called the \"stomach flu\" or the \"stomach bug.\" However, norovirus illness is not related to the flu. The flu is caused by the influenza virus. Norovirus causes acute gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach or intestines. Most people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days; but they can still spread the virus for a few days after. You can get norovirus illness many times in your life because there are many different types of noroviruses. Infection with one type of norovirus may not protect you against other types. It is possible to develop protection against specific types. But it is not known exactly how long protection lasts. This may explain why so many people of all ages get infected during norovirus outbreaks. A person usually develops symptoms 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus. If you have norovirus illness, you can feel extremely ill, and vomit or have diarrhea many times a day. This can lead to dehydration (loss of body fluids), especially in young children, older adults, and people with other illnesses. Symptoms of dehydration include: Anyone can get infected and sick with norovirus and people of all ages get infected during norovirus outbreaks. Your likelihood of getting a norovirus infection is also determined in part by your genes. If eaten raw, oysters and other filter-feeding shellfish can contain viruses and bacteria that can cause illness or death. Anyone who consumes raw shellfish is at risk of contracting norovirus. Children younger than 5 years old, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop severe infections. Norovirus spreads very easily and quickly in different ways. You can get norovirus by: You can still spread norovirus for 2 weeks or more after you feel better. Norovirus is very contagious, but you can take steps to protect yourself and others, including: Diagnostic methods for norovirus focus on detecting viral RNA (genetic material) or viral antigen. Diagnostic tests are available at all public health laboratories and many clinical laboratories. Most people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days. There is no specific medicine to treat people with norovirus illness. Antibiotic drugs will not help treat norovirus infections because they fight bacteria, not viruses. Watch for signs of dehydration (loss of body fluids) in children who have norovirus illness. Children who are dehydrated may cry with few or no tears and be unusually sleepy or fussy. If you have norovirus illness, you should drink plenty of liquids to replace fluid lost from vomiting and diarrhea. This will help prevent dehydration. Sports drinks and other drinks without caffeine or alcohol can help with mild dehydration. However, these drinks may not replace important nutrients and minerals. Oral rehydration fluids that you can get over the counter are most helpful for mild dehydration. Dehydration can lead to serious problems. Severe dehydration may require hospitalization for treatment with fluids given through your vein (intravenous or IV fluids). If you think you or someone you are caring for is severely dehydrated, call your doctor. Norovirus is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea, and foodborne illness in the United States. Always wash your hands and handle food well. Languages Language Assistance",

They commonly spread through food or water that is contaminated during preparation or through contaminated surfaces. Noroviruses can also spread through close contact with a person who has norovirus infection. Diarrhea, stomach pain and vomiting typically begin 12 to 48 hours after exposure. Norovirus infection symptoms usually last 1 to 3 days. Most people recover completely without treatment. However, for some people — especially young children, older adults and people with other medical conditions — vomiting and diarrhea can be severely dehydrating and require medical attention. Norovirus infection occurs most frequently in closed and crowded environments. Examples include hospitals, nursing homes, child care centers, schools and cruise ships. Signs and symptoms of norovirus infection may start suddenly and include: Signs and symptoms usually begin 12 to 48 hours after your first exposure to a norovirus and last 1 to 3 days. You can continue to shed virus in your stool for several weeks after recovery. This shedding can last weeks to months if you have another medical condition. Some people with norovirus infection may show no signs or symptoms. However, they're still contagious and can spread the virus to others. Seek medical attention if you develop diarrhea that doesn't go away within several days. Also call your health care provider if you experience severe vomiting, bloody stools, stomach pain or dehydration. Noroviruses are highly contagious. That means the norovirus infection can easily spread to others. The virus is shed in stool and vomit. You can spread the virus from the time you first have symptoms of illness until several days after you recover. Noroviruses can stay on surfaces and objects for days or weeks. You can get norovirus infection by: Noroviruses are difficult to kill because they can withstand hot and cold temperatures and many disinfectants. Risk factors for becoming infected with a norovirus include: For most people, norovirus infection usually clears up within a few days and isn't life-threatening. But in some people — especially young children; older adults; and people with weakened immune systems or other medical conditions or who are pregnant — norovirus infection can be severe. Norovirus infection can cause severe dehydration and even death. Warning signs of dehydration include: Children who are dehydrated might cry with few or no tears. They might be unusually sleepy or fussy. Norovirus infection is highly contagious. There are many types of noroviruses. Anyone can get norovirus infection more than once.

                "content": "Norovirus, also known as Norwalk virus and sometimes referred to as the winter vomiting disease, is the most common cause of gastroenteritis.[1][6] Infection is characterized by non-bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain.[2][3] Fever or headaches may also occur.[2] Symptoms usually develop 12 to 48 hours after being exposed, and recovery typically occurs within one to three days.[2] Complications are uncommon, but may include dehydration, especially in the young, the old, and those with other health problems.[2] The virus is usually spread by the fecal–oral route.[3] This may be through contaminated food or water or person-to-person contact.[3] It may also spread via contaminated surfaces or through air from the vomit of an infected person.[3] Risk factors include unsanitary food preparation and sharing close quarters.[3] Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms.[3] Confirmatory testing is not usually available but may be performed by public health agencies during outbreaks.[3] Prevention involves proper hand washing and disinfection of contaminated surfaces.[4] There is no vaccine or specific treatment for norovirus.[4][5] Management involves supportive care such as drinking sufficient fluids or intravenous fluids.[5] Oral rehydration solutions are the preferred fluids to drink, although other drinks without caffeine or alcohol can help.[5] Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not effective against the norovirus, according to the NHS information page on the subject;[8] this is due to norovirus being a non-enveloped virus. Norovirus results in about 685 million cases of disease and 200,000 deaths globally a year.[6][7] It is common both in the developed and developing world.[3][9] Those under the age of five are most often affected, and in this group it results in about 50,000 deaths in the developing world.[6] Norovirus infections occur more commonly during winter months.[6] It often occurs in outbreaks, especially among those living in close quarters.[3] In the United States, it is the cause of about half of all foodborne disease outbreaks.[3] The virus is named after the city of Norwalk, Ohio, US, where an outbreak occurred in 1968.[10] Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. A person usually develops symptoms of gastroenteritis 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus.[11] General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headaches, and low-grade fevers may occur. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it is not usually dangerous, and most who contract it make a full recovery within two to three days.[1] Norovirus can establish a long-term infection in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with common variable immunodeficiency or with a suppressed immune system after organ transplantation.[12] These infections can be with or without symptoms.[12] In severe cases, persistent infections can lead to norovirus‐associated enteropathy, intestinal villous atrophy, and malabsorption.[12] Noroviruses are transmitted directly from person to person (62–84% of all reported outbreaks)[13] and indirectly via contaminated water and food. Transmission can be aerosolized when those stricken with the illness vomit or by a toilet flush when vomit or diarrhea is present; infection can follow eating food or breathing air near an episode of vomiting, even if cleaned up.[14] The viruses continue to be shed after symptoms have subsided, and shedding can still be detected many weeks after infection.[15] Vomiting, in particular, transmits infection effectively and appears to allow airborne transmission. In one incident, a person who vomited spread the infection across a restaurant, suggesting that many unexplained cases of food poisoning may have their source in vomit.[16] In December 1998, 126 people were dining at six tables; one person vomited onto the floor. Staff quickly cleaned up, and people continued eating. Three days later others started falling ill; 52 people reported a range of symptoms, from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea. The cause was not immediately identified. Researchers plotted the seating arrangement: more than 90% of the people at the same table as the sick person later reported becoming ill. There was a direct correlation between the risk of infection of people at other tables and how close they were to the sick person. More than 70% of the diners at an adjacent table fell ill; at a table on the other side of the restaurant, the infection rate was still 25%. The outbreak was attributed to a Norwalk-like virus (norovirus). Other cases of transmission by vomit were later identified.[17] In one outbreak at an international scout jamboree in the Netherlands, each person with gastroenteritis infected an average of 14 people before increased hygiene measures were put in place. Even after these new measures were enacted, an ill person still infected an average of 2.1 other people.[18] A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study of 11 outbreaks in New York State lists the suspected mode of transmission as person-to-person in seven outbreaks, foodborne in two, waterborne in one, and one unknown. The source of waterborne outbreaks may include water from municipal supplies, wells, recreational lakes, swimming pools, and ice machines.[19] Shellfish and salad ingredients are the foods most often implicated in norovirus outbreaks. Ingestion of shellfish that has not been sufficiently heated – under 75 °C (167 °F) – poses a high risk for norovirus infection.[20][21] Foods other than shellfish may be contaminated by infected food handlers.[22] Many norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by only one infected person.[23] Between March and August 2017, in Quebec, Canada, there was an outbreak of norovirus that sickened more than 700 people. According to an investigation by Canada's CFIA Food Control Agency, the culprit was frozen raspberries imported from Harbin Gaotai Food Co Ltd, a Chinese supplier, and then Canadian authorities issued a recall on raspberries products from Harbin Gaotai.[24] According to the CDC, there was a surge in norovirus cases on thirteen cruise ships in 2023, which marks the highest number of outbreaks since 2012.[25] Noroviruses (NoV) are a genetically diverse group of single-stranded positive-sense RNA, non-enveloped viruses belonging to the family Caliciviridae.[26][27] According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, the genus Norovirus has one species, which is called Norwalk virus.[26] Noroviruses can genetically be classified into at least seven different genogroups (GI, GII, GIII, GIV, GV, GVI, and GVII), which can be further divided into other genetic clusters or genotypes.[28] Noroviruses commonly isolated in cases of acute gastroenteritis belong to two genogroups: genogroup I (GI) includes Norwalk virus, Desert Shield virus, and Southampton virus; and II (GII), which includes Bristol virus, Lordsdale virus, Toronto virus, Mexico virus, Hawaii virus and Snow Mountain virus.[27] Most noroviruses that infect humans belong to genogroups GI and GII.[29] Noroviruses from genogroup II, genotype 4 (abbreviated as GII.4) account for the majority of adult outbreaks of gastroenteritis and often sweep across the globe.[30] Recent examples include US95/96-US strain, associated with global outbreaks in the mid- to late-1990s; Farmington Hills virus associated with outbreaks in Europe and the United States in 2002 and in 2004; and Hunter virus which was associated with outbreaks in Europe, Japan, and Australasia. In 2006, there was another large increase in NoV infection around the globe.[31] Reports have shown a link between the expression of human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) and the susceptibility to norovirus infection. Studies have suggested the capsid of noroviruses may have evolved from selective pressure of human HBGAs.[32] HBGAs are not, however, the receptor or facilitator of norovirus infection. Co-factors such as bile salts may facilitate the infection, making it more intense when introduced during or after the initial infection of the host tissue.[33] Bile salts are produced by the liver in response to eating fatty foods, and they help with the absorption of consumed lipids. It is not yet clear at what specific point in the Norovirus replication cycle bile salts facilitate infection: penetration, uncoating, or maintaining capsid stability.[33] The protein MDA-5 may be the primary immune sensor that detects the presence of noroviruses in the body.[34] Some people have common variations of the MDA-5 gene that could make them more susceptible to norovirus infection.[35] Viruses in Norovirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral geometries. Capsid diameters vary widely, from 23 to 40 nm in diameter. The larger capsids (38–40 nm) exhibit T=3 symmetry and are composed of 180 VP1 proteins. Small capsids (23 nm) show T=1 symmetry, and are composed of 60 VP1 proteins.[36] The virus particles demonstrate an amorphous surface structure when visualized using electron microscopy.[37] Noroviruses contain a linear, non-segmented,[36] positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kilobases, encoding a large polyprotein which is cleaved into six smaller non-structural proteins (NS1/2 to NS7)[38] by the viral 3C-like protease (NS6), a major structural protein (VP1) of about 58~60 kDa and a minor capsid protein (VP2).[39] The most variable region of the viral capsid is the P2 domain, which contains antigen-presenting sites and carbohydrate-receptor binding regions.[40][41][42][43][44] Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 last shared a common ancestor in AD 867.[45] The group 2 and group 4 viruses last shared a common ancestor in approximately AD 1443 (95% highest posterior density AD 1336–1542).[46] Several estimates of the evolution rate have been made varying from 8.98 × 10−3 to 2.03 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year.[citation needed] The estimated mutation rate (1.21×10−2 to 1.41 ×10−2 substitutions per site per year) in this virus is high even compared with other RNA viruses.[47] In addition, a recombination hotspot exists at the ORF1-ORF2 (VP1) junction.[48] Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Positive-stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of replication. Translation takes place by leaky scanning and RNA termination-reinitiation. Humans and other mammals serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are fecal-oral and contamination.[36] When a person becomes infected with norovirus, the virus replicates within the small intestine. The principal symptom is acute gastroenteritis, characterized by nausea, forceful vomiting, watery diarrhea, and abdominal pain, that develops between 12 and 48 hours after exposure and lasts for 24–72 hours.[49] Sometimes there is loss of taste, general lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, cough, and/or low-grade fever. The disease is usually self-limiting.[citation needed] Severe illness is rare; although people are frequently treated at the emergency ward, they are rarely admitted to the hospital. The number of deaths from norovirus in the United States is estimated to be around 570–800[50] each year, with most of these occurring in the very young, the elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems. Symptoms may become life-threatening in these groups if dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is ignored or left untreated.[51] Specific diagnosis of norovirus is routinely made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays or quantitative PCR assays, which give results within a few hours. These assays are very sensitive and can detect as few as 10 virus particles.[52] Tests such as ELISA that use antibodies against a mixture of norovirus strains are available commercially, but lack specificity and sensitivity.[53] After infection, immunity to the same strain of the virus – the genotype – protects against reinfection for between six months to two years.[54] This immunity does not fully protect against infection with the other diverse genotypes of the virus.[54] In Canada, norovirus is a notifiable disease.[55] In both the US and the UK it is not notifiable.[56][57] Hand washing with soap and water is an effective method for reducing the transmission of norovirus pathogens. Alcohol rubs (≥62% isopropyl alcohol) may be used as an adjunct, but are less effective than hand-washing, as norovirus lacks a lipid viral envelope.[58] Surfaces where norovirus particles may be present can be sanitised with a solution of 1.5% to 7.5% of household bleach in water, or other disinfectants effective against norovirus.[49][59][60] In healthcare environments, the prevention of nosocomial infections involves routine and terminal cleaning. Nonflammable alcohol vapor in CO2 systems is used in health care environments where medical electronics would be adversely affected by aerosolized chlorine or other caustic compounds.[61] In 2011, the CDC published a clinical practice guideline addressing strategies for the prevention and control of norovirus gastroenteritis outbreaks in healthcare settings.[62][63] Based on a systematic review of published scientific studies, the guideline presents 51 specific evidence-based recommendations, which were organized into 12 categories: 1) patient cohorting and isolation precautions, 2) hand hygiene, 3) patient transfer and ward closure, 4) food handlers in healthcare, 5) diagnostics, 6) personal protective equipment, 7) environmental cleaning, 8) staff leave and policy, 9) visitors, 10) education, 11) active case-finding, and 12) communication and notification. The guideline also identifies eight high-priority recommendations and suggests several areas in need of future research.[citation needed] LigoCyte announced in 2007 that it was working on a vaccine and had started phase 1 trials.[64] The company has since been taken over by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company.[65] As of 2019[update], a bivalent (NoV GI.1/GII.4) intramuscular vaccine had completed phase 1 trials.[66][67] In 2020 the phase 2b trials were finished.[68][69] The vaccine relies on using a virus-like particle that is made of the norovirus capsid proteins in order to mimic the external structure of the virus. Since there is no RNA in this particle, it is incapable of reproducing and cannot cause an infection.[64] The norovirus can survive for long periods outside a human host depending on the surface and temperature conditions: it can survive for weeks on hard and soft surfaces,[70] and it can survive for months, maybe even years in contaminated still water.[71] A 2006 study found the virus remained on surfaces used for food preparation seven days after contamination.[72] Routine protocols to detect norovirus in clams and oysters by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction are being employed by governmental laboratories such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US.[73] There is no specific medicine to treat people with norovirus illness. Norovirus infection cannot be treated with antibiotics because it is a virus. Treatments aim to avoid complications by measures such as the management of dehydration caused by fluid loss in vomiting and diarrhea,[5] and to mitigate symptoms using antiemetics and antidiarrheals.[74] Norovirus causes about 18% of all cases of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. It is relatively common in developed countries and in low-mortality developing countries (20% and 19% respectively) compared to high-mortality developing countries (14%). Proportionately it causes more illness in people in the community or in hospital outpatients (24% and 20% respectively) as compared with hospital inpatients (17%) in whom other causes are more common.[76] Age and emergence of new norovirus strains do not appear to affect the proportion of gastroenteritis attributable to norovirus.[76] In the United States, the estimated annual number of norovirus cases in 2023[update] was 21 million,[77] representing a rate of 6,270 cases per 100,000 individuals. Norovirus is a common cause of epidemics of gastroenteritis on cruise ships. The CDC, through its Vessel Sanitation Program, records and investigates outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness – mostly caused by norovirus – on cruise ships with both a US and foreign itinerary;[78] there were 12 in 2015, and 10 from 1 January to 9 May 2016. An outbreak may affect over 25% of passengers, and a smaller proportion of crew members.[79] Epidemiological studies have shown that individuals with different ABO(H) (histo-blood group) phenotypes are infected with NoV strains in a genotype-specific manner.[80][81] GII.4 includes global epidemic strains and binds to more histo-blood group antigens than other genogroups.[80] FUT2 fucosyltransferase transfers a fucose sugar to the end of the ABO(H) precursor in gastrointestinal cells and saliva glands. The ABH-antigen produced is thought to act as a receptor for human norovirus: A non-functional fucosyltransferase FUT2 provides high protection from the most common norovirus strain, GII.4.[82] Homozygous carriers of any nonsense mutation in the FUT2 gene are called non-secretors, as no ABH-antigen is produced. Approximately 20% of Caucasians are non-secretors due to G428A and C571T nonsense mutations in FUT2 and therefore have strong – although not absolute – protection from the norovirus GII.4.[83] Non-secretors can still produce ABH antigens in erythrocytes, as the precursor is formed by FUT1.[80] Some norovirus genotypes (GI.3) can infect non-secretors.[84] The norovirus was originally named the \"Norwalk agent\" after Norwalk, Ohio, in the United States, where an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred among children at Bronson Elementary School in November 1968. In 1972, electron microscopy on stored human stool samples identified a virus, which was given the name \"Norwalk virus\". Numerous outbreaks with similar symptoms have been reported since. The cloning and sequencing of the Norwalk virus genome showed that these viruses have a genomic organization consistent with viruses belonging to the family Caliciviridae.[85] The name \"norovirus\" (Norovirus for the genus) was approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) in 2002.[86] In 2011, however, a press release and a newsletter were published by ICTV, which strongly encouraged the media, national health authorities, and the scientific community to use the virus name Norwalk virus, rather than the genus name Norovirus when referring to outbreaks of the disease. This was also a public response by ICTV to the request from an individual in Japan to rename the Norovirus genus because of the possibility of negative associations for people in Japan and elsewhere who have the family name \"Noro\". Before this position of ICTV was made public, ICTV consulted widely with members of the Caliciviridae Study Group and carefully discussed the case.[87] In addition to \"Norwalk agent\" and \"Norwalk virus\", the virus has also been called \"Norwalk-like virus\", \"small, round-structured viruses\" (SRSVs), Spencer flu, and \"Snow Mountain virus\".[88] Common names of the illness caused by noroviruses still in use include \"Roskilde illness\", \"winter vomiting disease\",[89] \"winter vomiting bug\",[90][91] \"viral gastroenteritis\", and \"acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis\".[51]",

The festival is observed by lighting the candles of a candelabrum with nine branches, commonly called a menorah or hanukkiah. One branch is placed above or below the others and its candle is used to light the other eight candles. This unique candle is called the shammash (שַׁמָּשׁ‎, \"attendant\"). Each night, one additional candle is lit by the shammash until all eight candles are lit together on the final night of the festival.[6] Other Hanukkah festivities include singing Hanukkah songs, playing the game of dreidel and eating oil-based foods, such as latkes and sufganiyot (similar to jelly donuts), and dairy foods. Since the 1970s, the worldwide Chabad Hasidic movement has initiated public menorah lightings in open public places in many countries.[7] Originally instituted as a feast \"in the manner of Sukkot (Booths)\", it does not come with the corresponding obligations, and is therefore a relatively minor holiday in strictly religious terms. Nevertheless, Hanukkah has attained major cultural significance in North America and elsewhere, especially among secular Jews, due to often occurring around the same time as Christmas during the festive season.[8] The name \"Hanukkah\" derives from the Hebrew verb \"חנך‎\", meaning \"to dedicate\". On Hanukkah, the Maccabean Jews regained control of Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple.[9][10] Many homiletical explanations have been given for the name:[11] In Hebrew, the word Hanukkah is written חֲנֻכָּה‎ or חֲנוּכָּה‎ (Ḥănukā). It is most commonly transliterated to English as Hanukkah or Chanukah. The spelling Hanukkah, which is based on using characters of the English alphabet as symbols to re-create the word's correct spelling in Hebrew,[14] is the most common[15] and the preferred choice of Merriam–Webster,[16] Collins English Dictionary, the Oxford Style Manual, and the style guides of The New York Times and The Guardian.[17] The sound represented by Ch ([χ], similar to the Scottish pronunciation of loch) is not native to the English language.[18] Furthermore, the letter ḥeth (ח‎), which is the first letter in the Hebrew spelling, is pronounced differently in modern Hebrew (voiceless uvular fricative) from in classical Hebrew (voiceless pharyngeal fricative [ħ]), and neither of those sounds is unambiguously representable in English spelling. However, its original sound is closer to the English H than to the Scottish Ch, and Hanukkah more accurately represents the spelling in the Hebrew alphabet.[14] Moreover, the 'kaf' consonant is geminate in classical (but not modern) Hebrew. Adapting the classical Hebrew pronunciation with the geminate and pharyngeal Ḥeth can lead to the spelling Hanukkah, while adapting the modern Hebrew pronunciation with no gemination and uvular Ḥeth leads to the spelling Chanukah.[19][20][21] In Modern Hebrew, Hanukkah may also be called the Festival of Lights (חַג הַאוּרִים‎, Ḥag HaUrim), based on a comment by Josephus in Antiquities of the Jews, καὶ ἐξ ἐκείνου μέχρι τοῦ δεῦρο τὴν ἑορτὴν ἄγομεν καλοῦντες αὐτὴν φῶτα \"And from then on we celebrate this festival, and we call it Lights\". The first Hebrew translation of Antiquities (1864) used (חַג הַמְּאֹרוֹת‎) \"Festival of Lamps\", but the translation \"Festival of Lights\" (חַג הַאוּרִים‎) appeared by the end of the nineteenth century.[22] The story of Hanukkah is told in the books of the First and Second Maccabees, which describe in detail the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the menorah. These books, however, are not a part of the canonized Masoretic Text version of the Tanakh (Hebrew and Aramaic language Jewish Bible) used and accepted by normative Rabbinical Judaism and therefore modern Jews (as copied, edited and distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th centuries of the Common Era). However, the books of Maccabees were included among the deuterocanonical books added to the Septuagint, a Jewish scholarly Greek-language translation of the Hebrew Bible originally compiled in the mid-3rd century BCE. The Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider the books of Maccabees as a canonical part of the Old Testament.[23] The eight-day rededication of the temple is described in 1 Maccabees,[24] though the miracle of the oil does not appear here. A story similar in character, and older in date, is the one alluded to in 2 Maccabees[25] according to which the relighting of the altar fire by Nehemiah was due to a miracle which occurred on the 25th of Kislev, and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by Judah Maccabee.[26] The above account in 1 Maccabees, as well as 2 Maccabees[27] portrays the feast as a delayed observation of the eight-day Feast of Booths (Sukkot); similarly 2 Maccabees explains the length of the feast as \"in the manner of the Feast of Booths\".[28] Megillat Taanit (1st century) contains a list of festive days on which fasting or eulogizing is forbidden. It specifies, \"On the 25th of [Kislev] is Hanukkah of eight days, and one is not to eulogize\" and then references the story of the rededication of the Temple.[29] The Mishna (late 2nd century) mentions Hanukkah in several places,[30] but never describes its laws in detail and never mentions any aspect of the history behind it. To explain the Mishna's lack of a systematic discussion of Hanukkah, Nissim ben Jacob postulated that information on the holiday was so commonplace that the Mishna felt no need to explain it.[31] Modern scholar Reuvein Margolies suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the Bar Kochba revolt, its editors were reluctant to include explicit discussion of a holiday celebrating another relatively recent revolt against a foreign ruler, for fear of antagonizing the Romans.[32] The miracle of the one-day supply of oil miraculously lasting eight days is described in the Talmud, committed to writing about 600 years after the events described in the books of Maccabees.[33] The Talmud says that after the forces of Antiochus IV had been driven from the Temple, the Maccabees discovered that almost all of the ritual olive oil had been profaned. They found only a single container that was still sealed by the High Priest, with enough oil to keep the menorah in the Temple lit for a single day. They used this, yet it burned for eight days (the time it took to have new oil pressed and made ready).[34] The Talmud presents three options:[35] Except in times of danger, the lights were to be placed outside one's door, on the opposite side of the mezuza, or in the window closest to the street. Rashi, in a note to Shabbat 21b, says their purpose is to publicize the miracle. The blessings for Hanukkah lights are discussed in tractate Succah, p. 46a.[36] Megillat Antiochus (probably composed in the 2nd century[37]) concludes with the following words: ...After this, the sons of Israel went up to the Temple and rebuilt its gates and purified the Temple from the dead bodies and from the defilement. And they sought after pure olive oil to light the lamps therewith, but could not find any, except one bowl that was sealed with the signet ring of the High Priest from the days of Samuel the prophet and they knew that it was pure. There was in it [enough oil] to light [the lamps therewith] for one day, but the God of heaven whose name dwells there put therein his blessing and they were able to light from it eight days. Therefore, the sons of Ḥashmonai made this covenant and took upon themselves a solemn vow, they and the sons of Israel, all of them, to publish amongst the sons of Israel, [to the end] that they might observe these eight days of joy and honour, as the days of the feasts written in [the book of] the Law; [even] to light in them so as to make known to those who come after them that their God wrought for them salvation from heaven. In them, it is not permitted to mourn, neither to decree a fast [on those days], and anyone who has a vow to perform, let him perform it.[38] The Al HaNissim prayer is recited on Hanukkah as an addition to the Amidah prayer, which was formalized in the late 1st century.[39] Al HaNissim describes the history of the holiday as follows: The Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus narrates in his book, Jewish Antiquities XII, how the victorious Judas Maccabeus ordered lavish yearly eight-day festivities after rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem that had been profaned by Antiochus IV Epiphanes.[40] Josephus does not say the festival was called Hanukkah but rather the \"Festival of Lights\": In the New Testament, John 10:22–23 says, \"Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon's Colonnade\" (NIV). The Greek noun used appears in the neuter plural as \"the renewals\" or \"the consecrations\" (Ancient Greek: τὰ ἐγκαίνια; ta enkaínia).[42] The same root appears in 2 Esdras 6:16 in the Septuagint to refer specifically to Hanukkah. This Greek word was chosen because the Hebrew word for 'consecration' or 'dedication' is Hanukkah (חנכה). The Aramaic New Testament uses the Aramaic word hawdata (a close synonym), which literally means 'renewal' or 'to make new'.[43] After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, Judea became part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt until 200 BCE, when King Antiochus III the Great of Syria defeated King Ptolemy V Epiphanes of Egypt at the Battle of Panium. Judea then became part of the Seleucid Empire of Syria.[44] King Antiochus III the Great, wanting to conciliate his new Jewish subjects, guaranteed their right to \"live according to their ancestral customs\" and to continue to practice their religion in the Temple of Jerusalem.[45] The Seleucids, like the Ptolemies before them, held a suzerainty over Judea, where they respected Jewish culture and protected Jewish institutions. This policy was drastically reversed by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus III, seemingly after what was either a dispute over leadership of the Temple in Jerusalem and the office of High Priest, or possibly a revolt whose nature was lost to time after being crushed.[46] In 175 BCE, Antiochus IV invaded Judea at the request of the sons of Tobias.[47] The Tobiads, who led the Hellenizing Jewish faction in Jerusalem, were expelled to Syria around 170 BCE when the high priest Onias and his pro-Egyptian faction wrested control from them. The exiled Tobiads lobbied Antiochus IV Epiphanes to recapture Jerusalem. As Flavius Josephus relates: The king being thereto disposed beforehand, complied with them, and came upon the Jews with a great army, and took their city by force, and slew a great multitude of those that favored Ptolemy, and sent out his soldiers to plunder them without mercy. He also spoiled the temple, and put a stop to the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice of expiation for three years and six months. When the Second Temple in Jerusalem was looted and services stopped, Judaism was outlawed. In 167 BCE, Antiochus ordered an altar to Zeus erected in the Temple. He banned brit milah (circumcision) and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple.[49] Antiochus's actions provoked a large-scale revolt. Mattathias (Mattityahu), a Jewish priest, and his five sons Jochanan, Simeon, Eleazar, Jonathan, and Judah led a rebellion against Antiochus. It started with Mattathias killing first a Jew who wanted to comply with Antiochus's order to sacrifice to Zeus, and then a Greek official who was to enforce the government's behest (1 Mac. 2, 24–25[50]). Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi (\"Judah the Hammer\"). By 166 BCE, Mattathias had died, and Judah took his place as leader. By 164 BCE, the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy was successful. The Temple was liberated and rededicated. The festival of Hanukkah was instituted to celebrate this event.[51] Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar to be built in place of the polluted one and new holy vessels to be made.[26] According to the Talmud, \"For when the Greeks entered the Sanctuary, they defiled all the oils therein, and when the Hasmonean dynasty prevailed against and defeated them, they made search and found only one cruse of oil which lay with the seal of the kohen gadol (high priest), but which contained sufficient [oil] for one day's lighting only; yet a miracle was wrought therein, and they lit [the lamp] therewith for eight days. The following year these [days] were appointed a Festival with [the recital of] Hallel and thanksgiving.\" —Shabbat 21b Tertiary sources in the Jewish tradition make reference to this account.[52] Maimonides (12th century) described Hanukkah as follows: When, on the twenty-fifth of Kislev, the Jews had emerged victorious over their foes and destroyed them, they re-entered the Temple where they found only one jar of pure oil, enough to be lit for only a single day; yet they used it for lighting the required set of lamps for eight days, until they managed to press olives and produce pure oil. Because of this, the sages of that generation ruled that the eight days beginning with the twenty-fifth of Kislev should be observed as days of rejoicing and praising the Lord. Lamps are lit in the evening over the doors of the homes, on each of the eight nights, so as to display the miracle. These days are called Hanukkah, when it is forbidden to lament or to fast, just as it is on the days of Purim. Lighting the lamps during the eight days of Hanukkah is a religious duty imposed by the sages.[53] Some modern scholars, following the account in 2 Maccabees, observe that the king was intervening in an internal civil war between the Maccabean Jews and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.[54][55][56][57] These competed violently over who would be the High Priest, with traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like Onias contesting with Hellenizing High Priests with Greek names like Jason and Menelaus.[58] In particular, Jason's Hellenistic reforms would prove to be a decisive factor leading to eventual conflict within the ranks of Judaism.[59] Other authors point to possible socioeconomic reasons in addition to the religious reasons behind the civil war.[60] What began in many respects as a civil war escalated when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the Hellenizing Jews in their conflict with the traditionalists.[61] As the conflict escalated, Antiochus took the side of the Hellenizers by prohibiting the religious practices the traditionalists had rallied around. This may explain why the king, in a total departure from Seleucid practice in all other places and times, banned a traditional religion.[62] The miracle of the oil is widely regarded as a legend and its authenticity has been questioned since the Middle Ages.[63] However, given the famous question Joseph Karo (1488–1575) posed concerning why Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days when the miracle was only for seven days (since there was enough oil for one day),[64] it was clear that writing in the 16th century CE, he believed it to be a historical event. This belief has been adopted by most of Orthodox Judaism, in as much as Karo's Shulchan Aruch is a main code of Jewish Law. Selected battles between the Maccabees and the Seleucid Syrian-Greeks: Hanukkah is celebrated with a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the eight-day holiday, some are family-based and others communal. There are special additions to the daily prayer service, and a section is added to the blessing after meals.[79] Hanukkah is not a \"Sabbath-like\" holiday, and there is no obligation to refrain from activities that are forbidden on the Sabbath, as specified in the Shulkhan Arukh.[80][81] Adherents go to work as usual but may leave early in order to be home to kindle the lights at nightfall. There is no religious reason for schools to be closed, although in Israel schools close from the second day for the whole week of Hanukkah.[82][83] Many families exchange gifts each night, such as books or games, and \"Hanukkah Gelt\" is often given to children. Fried foods—such as latkes (potato pancakes), jelly doughnuts (sufganiyot) and Sephardic bimuelos—are eaten to commemorate the importance of oil during the celebration of Hanukkah. Some also have a custom of eating dairy products to remember Judith and how she overcame Holofernes by feeding him cheese, which made him thirsty, and giving him wine to drink. When Holofernes became very drunk, Judith cut off his head.[84] Each night throughout the eight-day holiday, a candle or oil-based light is lit. As a universally practiced \"beautification\" (hiddur mitzvah) of the mitzvah, the number of lights lit is increased by one each night.[85] An extra light called a shammash, meaning \"attendant\" or \"sexton\",[86] is also lit each night, and is given a distinct location, usually higher, lower, or to the side of the others.[81] Among Ashkenazim the tendency is for every male member of the household (and in many families, girls as well) to light a full set of lights each night,[87][88] while among Sephardim the prevalent custom is to have one set of lights for the entire household.[89] The purpose of the shammash is to adhere to the prohibition, specified in the Talmud,[90] against using the Hanukkah lights for anything other than publicizing and meditating on the Hanukkah miracle. This differs from Sabbath candles which are meant to be used for illumination and lighting. Hence, if one were to need extra illumination on Hanukkah, the shammash candle would be available, and one would avoid using the prohibited lights. Some, especially Ashkenazim, light the shammash candle first and then use it to light the others.[91] So altogether, including the shammash, two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on, ending with nine on the last night, for a total of 44 (36, excluding the shammash). It is Sephardic custom not to light the shammash first and use it to light the rest. Instead, the shammash candle is the last to be lit, and a different candle or a match is used to light all the candles. Some Hasidic Jews follow this Sephardic custom as well.[92] The lights can be candles or oil lamps.[91] Electric lights are sometimes used and are acceptable in places where open flame is not permitted, such as a hospital room, or for the very elderly and infirm; however, those who permit reciting a blessing over electric lamps only allow it if it is incandescent and battery operated (an incandescent flashlight would be acceptable for this purpose), while a blessing may not be recited over a plug-in menorah or lamp. Most Jewish homes have a special candelabrum referred to as either a Hanukkah menorah (the traditional name, menorah being Hebrew for 'lamp') or a Chanukiah (the modern Israeli term). Some families use an oil lamp menorah (traditionally filled with olive oil) for Hanukkah; like the candle version, it has eight wicks to light plus the additional shammash light.[93] In the United States, Hanukkah became a more visible festival in the public sphere from the 1970s when Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson called for public awareness and observance of the festival and encouraged the lighting of public menorahs.[94][95][96][97] The reason for the Hanukkah lights is not for the \"lighting of the house within\", but rather for the \"illumination of the house without\", so that passersby should see it and be reminded of the holiday's miracle (i.e. that the sole cruse of pure oil found which held enough oil to burn for one night actually burned for eight nights). Accordingly, lamps are set up at a prominent window or near the door leading to the street. It is customary amongst some Ashkenazi Jews to have a separate menorah for each family member (customs vary), whereas most Sephardi Jews light one for the whole household. Only when there was danger of antisemitic persecution were lamps supposed to be hidden from public view, as was the case in Persia under the rule of the Zoroastrians,[26] or in parts of Europe before and during World War II. However, most Hasidic groups light lamps near an inside doorway, not necessarily in public view. According to this tradition, the lamps are placed on the opposite side from the mezuzah, so people passing through the door are surrounded by the holiness of mitzvot (the commandments).[98] Generally, women are exempt in Jewish law from time-bound positive commandments, although the Talmud requires that women engage in the mitzvah of lighting Hanukkah candles \"for they too were involved in the miracle.\"[99][100] Some Jews in North America and Israel have taken up environmental concerns in relation to Hanukkah's \"miracle of the oil\", emphasizing reflection on energy conservation and energy independence. An example of this is the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life's renewable energy campaign.[101][102][103] Hanukkah lights should usually burn for at least half an hour after it gets dark.[104] Many light at sundown, while most Hasidim and many other communities light later, generally around nightfall.[105] Many Hasidic Rebbes light much later to fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their Hasidim when they kindle the lights.[106] Inexpensive small wax candles sold for Hanukkah burn for approximately half an hour so should be lit no earlier than nightfall.[104] Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not be lit on Shabbat itself, the candles must be lit before sunset.[104] However, they must remain lit through the lighting of the Shabbat candles. Therefore, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first with larger candles than usual,[104] followed by the Shabbat candles. At the end of the Shabbat, there are those who light the Hanukkah lights before Havdalah and those who make Havdalah before the lighting Hanukkah lights.[107] If for whatever reason one didn't light at sunset or nightfall, the lights should be kindled later, as long as there are people in the streets.[104] Later than that, the lights should still be kindled, but the blessings should be recited only if there is at least somebody else awake in the house and present at the lighting of the Hannukah lights.[108] Typically two blessings (brachot; singular: brachah) are recited during this eight-day festival when lighting the candles. On the first night only, the shehecheyanu blessing is added, making a total of three blessings.[109] The first blessing is recited before the candles are lit, and while most recite the other blessing(s) beforehand as well, some have the custom to recite them after. On the first night of Hanukkah one light (candle or oil) is lit on the right side of the menorah, on the following night a second light is placed to the left of the first but it is lit first, and so on, proceeding from placing candles right to left but lighting them from left to right over the eight nights.[110] Transliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu l'hadlik ner Hanukkah. Translation: \"Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the Hanukkah light[s].\" Transliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, she'asa nisim la'avoteinu ba'yamim ha'heim ba'z'man ha'ze. Translation: \"Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who performed miracles for our ancestors in those days at this time...\" After the lights are kindled the hymn Hanerot Halalu is recited. There are several different versions; the version presented here is recited in many Ashkenazic communities:[112] In the Ashkenazi tradition, each night after the lighting of the candles, the hymn Ma'oz Tzur is sung. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in Jewish history, praising God for survival despite these tragedies (the exodus from Egypt, the Babylonian captivity, the miracle of the holiday of Purim, the Hasmonean victory) and expressing a longing for the days when Judea will finally triumph over Rome.[113] The song was composed in the thirteenth century by a poet only known through the acrostic found in the first letters of the original five stanzas of the song: Mordechai. The familiar tune is most probably a derivation of a German Protestant church hymn or a popular folk song.[114] After lighting the candles and Ma'oz Tzur, singing other Hanukkah songs is customary in many Jewish homes. Some Hasidic and Sephardi Jews recite Psalms, such as Psalm 30, Psalm 67, and Psalm 91. In North America and in Israel it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time. In addition, many families encourage their children to give tzedakah (charity) in lieu of presents for themselves.[115][116] \"We thank You also for the miraculous deeds and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and the saving acts wrought by You, as well as for the wars which You waged for our ancestors in ancient days at this season. In the days of the Hasmonean Mattathias, son of Johanan the high priest, and his sons, when the iniquitous Greco-Syrian kingdom rose up against Your people Israel, to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the ordinances of Your will, then You in your abundant mercy rose up for them in the time of their trouble, pled their cause, executed judgment, avenged their wrong, and delivered the strong into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent ones into the hands of those occupied with Your Torah. Both unto Yourself did you make a great and holy name in Thy world, and unto Your people did You achieve a great deliverance and redemption. Whereupon your children entered the sanctuary of Your house, cleansed Your temple, purified Your sanctuary, kindled lights in Your holy courts, and appointed these eight days of Hanukkah in order to give thanks and praises unto Your holy name.\" An addition is made to the \"hoda'ah\" (thanksgiving) benediction in the Amidah (thrice-daily prayers), called Al HaNissim (\"On/about the Miracles\").[118] This addition refers to the victory achieved over the Syrians by the Hasmonean Mattathias and his sons.[119][120][26] The same prayer is added to the grace after meals. In addition, the Hallel (praise) Psalms[121] are sung during each morning service and the Tachanun penitential prayers are omitted.[119][122] The Torah is read every day in the shacharit morning services in synagogue, on the first day beginning from Numbers 6:22 (according to some customs, Numbers 7:1), and the last day ending with Numbers 8:4. Since Hanukkah lasts eight days it includes at least one, and sometimes two, Jewish Sabbaths (Saturdays). The weekly Torah portion for the first Sabbath is almost always Miketz, telling of Joseph's dream and his enslavement in Egypt. The Haftarah reading for the first Sabbath Hanukkah is Zechariah 2:14 – Zechariah 4:7. When there is a second Sabbath on Hanukkah, the Haftarah reading is from 1 Kings 7:40–50. The Hanukkah menorah is also kindled daily in the synagogue, at night with the blessings and in the morning without the blessings.[123] The menorah is not lit during Shabbat, but rather prior to the beginning of Shabbat as described above and not at all during the day. During the Middle Ages \"Megillat Antiochus\" was read in the Italian synagogues on Hanukkah just as the Book of Esther is read on Purim. It still forms part of the liturgy of the Yemenite Jews.[124] The last day of Hanukkah is known by some as Zot Hanukkah and by others as Chanukat HaMizbeach, from the verse read on this day in the synagogue Numbers 7:84, Zot Hanukkat Hamizbe'ach: \"This was the dedication of the altar\". According to the teachings of Kabbalah and Hasidism, this day is the final \"seal\" of the High Holiday season of Yom Kippur and is considered a time to repent out of love for God. In this spirit, many Hasidic Jews wish each other Gmar chatimah tovah (\"may you be sealed totally for good\"), a traditional greeting for the Yom Kippur season. It is taught in Hasidic and Kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers.[125] It is customary for women not to work for at least the first half-hour of the candles' burning, and some have the custom not to work for the entire time of burning. It is also forbidden to fast or to eulogize during Hanukkah.[81] Some Hasidic scholars teach that the Hanukkah is in fact the final conclusion of God's judgment extending High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana when humanity is judged and Yom Kippur when the judgment is sealed: Hanukkah songs (in Hebrew except where indicated) include \"Ma'oz Tzur\" (Rock of Ages), \"Latke'le Latke'le\" (Yiddish: \"Little Latke, Little Latke\"), \"Hanukkiah Li Yesh\" (\"I Have a Hanukkah Menorah\"), \"Ocho Kandelikas\" (Judeo-Spanish: \"Eight Little Candles\"), \"Kad Katan\" (\"A Small Jug\"), \"S'vivon Sov Sov Sov\" (\"Dreidel, Spin and Spin\"), \"Haneirot Halolu\" (\"These Candles Which We Light\"), \"Mi Yimalel\" (\"Who Can Retell\") and \"Ner Li, Ner Li\" (\"I have a Candle\"). Among the best known songs in English-speaking countries are \"Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel\"[127] and \"Oh Chanukah\".[128] In the Nadvorna Hasidic dynasty, it is customary for the rebbes to play violin after the menorah is lit.[129] Penina Moise's Hannukah Hymn published in the 1842 Hymns Written for the Use of Hebrew Congregations was instrumental in the beginning of Americanization of Hanukkah.[130][131][132] There is a custom of eating foods fried or baked in oil (preferably olive oil) to commemorate the miracle of a small flask of oil keeping the Second Temple's Menorah alight for eight days.[133] Traditional foods include potato pancakes, known as latkes in Yiddish, especially among Ashkenazi families. Sephardi, Polish, and Israeli families eat jam-filled doughnuts (Yiddish: פּאָנטשקעס pontshkes), bimuelos (fritters) and sufganiyot which are deep-fried in oil. Italkim and Hungarian Jews traditionally eat cheese pancakes known as \"cassola\" or \"cheese latkes\".[134] Latkes are not popular in Israel, having been largely replaced by sufganiyot due to local economic factors, convenience and the influence of trade unions.[135] Bakeries in Israel have popularized many new types of fillings for sufganiyot besides the traditional strawberry jelly filling, including chocolate cream, vanilla cream, caramel, cappuccino and others.[136] In recent years, downsized, \"mini\" sufganiyot containing half the calories of the regular, 400-to-600-calorie version, have become popular.[137] Rabbinic literature also records a tradition of eating cheese and other dairy products during Hanukkah.[138] This custom, as mentioned above, commemorates the heroism of Judith during the Babylonian captivity of the Jews and reminds us that women also played an important role in the events of Hanukkah.[139] The deuterocanonical book of Judith (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the Tanakh, records that Holofernes, an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews was cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the beheading of Holofernes by Judith has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.[140] Roast goose has historically been a traditional Hanukkah food among Eastern European and American Jews, although the custom has declined in recent decades.[141] Indian Jews traditionally consume gulab jamun, fried dough balls soaked in a sweet syrup, similar to teiglach or bimuelos, as part of their Hanukkah celebrations. Italian Jews eat fried chicken, cassola (a ricotta cheese latke almost similar to a cheesecake), and fritelle de riso par Hanukkah (a fried sweet rice pancake). Romanian Jews eat pasta latkes as a traditional Hanukkah dish. Syrian Jews consume Kibbet Yatkeen, a dish made with pumpkin and bulgur wheat similar to latkes, as well as their own version of keftes de prasa spiced with allspice and cinnamon.[142] After lighting the candles, it is customary to play (or spin) the dreidel. The dreidel, or sevivon in Hebrew, is a four-sided spinning top that children play with during Hanukkah. Each side is imprinted with a Hebrew letter which is an abbreviation for the Hebrew words נס גדול היה שם (Nes Gadol Haya Sham, \"A great miracle happened there\"), referring to the miracle of the oil that took place in the Beit Hamikdash. The fourth side of some dreidels sold in Israel are inscribed with the letter פ (Pe), rendering the acronym נס גדול היה פה (Nes Gadol Haya Po, \"A great miracle happened here\"), referring to the fact that the miracle occurred in the land of Israel, although this is a relatively recent[when?] innovation. Stores in Haredi neighborhoods sell the traditional Shin dreidels as well, because they understand \"there\" to refer to the Temple and not the entire Land of Israel, and because the Hasidic Masters ascribe significance to the traditional letters.[143][144] Chanukkah gelt (Yiddish for \"Chanukkah money\"), known in Israel by the Hebrew translation Hebrew: דְּמֵי חֲנֻכָּה, romanized: dmei Hanukkah, is often distributed to children during the festival of Hanukkah. The giving of Hanukkah gelt also adds to the holiday excitement. The amount is usually in small coins, although grandparents or relatives may give larger sums. The tradition of giving Chanukah gelt dates back to a long-standing East European custom of children presenting their teachers with a small sum of money at this time of year as a token of gratitude. One minhag favors the fifth night of Hanukkah for giving Hanukkah gelt.[145] Unlike the other nights of Hanukkah, the fifth does not ever fall on the Shabbat, hence never conflicting with the Halachic injunction against handling money on the Shabbat.[146] The earliest Hanukkah link with the White House occurred in 1951 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion presented United States President Harry Truman with a Hanukkah menorah. In 1979 President Jimmy Carter took part in the first public Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony of the National Menorah held across the White House lawn. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush displayed a menorah in the White House. In 1993, President Bill Clinton invited a group of schoolchildren to the Oval Office for a small ceremony.[95] The United States Postal Service has released several Hanukkah-themed postage stamps. In 1996, the United States Postal Service (USPS) issued a 32 cent Hanukkah stamp as a joint issue with Israel.[147] In 2004, after eight years of reissuing the menorah design, the USPS issued a dreidel design for the Hanukkah stamp. The dreidel design was used through 2008. In 2009 a Hanukkah stamp was issued with a design featured a photograph of a menorah with nine lit candles.[148] In 2008, President George W. Bush held an official Hanukkah reception in the White House where he linked the occasion to the 1951 gift by using that menorah for the ceremony, with a grandson of Ben-Gurion and a grandson of Truman lighting the candles.[149] In December 2014, two Hanukkah celebrations were held at the White House. The White House commissioned a menorah made by students at the Max Rayne school in Israel and invited two of its students to join U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as they welcomed over 500 guests to the celebration. The students' school in Israel had been subjected to arson by extremists. President Obama said these \"students teach us an important lesson for this time in our history. The light of hope must outlast the fires of hate. That's what the Hanukkah story teaches us. It's what our young people can teach us – that one act of faith can make a miracle, that love is stronger than hate, that peace can triumph over conflict.\"[150] Rabbi Angela Warnick Buchdahl, in leading prayers at the ceremony commented on the how special the scene was, asking the President if he believed America's founding fathers could possibly have pictured that a female Asian-American rabbi would one day be at the White House leading Jewish prayers in front of the African-American president.[151] The dates of Hanukkah are determined by the Hebrew calendar. Hanukkah begins at the 25th day of Kislev and concludes on the second or third day of Tevet (Kislev can have 29 or 30 days). The Jewish day begins at sunset. Hanukkah dates for recent and upcoming: In 2013, on 28 November, the American holiday of Thanksgiving fell during Hanukkah for only the third time since Thanksgiving was declared a national holiday by President Abraham Lincoln. The last time was 1899, and due to the nature of the Gregorian and Jewish calendars being slightly out of sync with each other, it will not happen again in the foreseeable future.[152] This rare convergence prompted the creation of the neologism Thanksgivukkah.[153][154][155] Major Jewish holidays are those when all forms of work are forbidden, and that feature traditional holiday meals, kiddush, holiday candle-lighting, etc. Only biblical holidays fit these criteria, and Chanukah was instituted some two centuries after the Hebrew Bible was completed. Nevertheless, though Chanukah is of rabbinic origin, it is traditionally celebrated in a major and very public fashion. The requirement to position the menorah, or Chanukiah, at the door or window, symbolizes the desire to give the Chanukah miracle a high-profile.[156] Moreover, Hallel (a set of Psalms expressing praise that is recited on significant Jewish holidays) is recited on all eight days of Hanukkah, which signifies Hanukkah's importance on the Jewish calendar. While not considered the most significant holiday, the recitation of Hallel on Hanukkah highlights its importance in Jewish tradition.[157] Some Jewish historians suggest a different explanation for the rabbinic reluctance to laud the militarism.[clarification needed] First, the rabbis wrote after Hasmonean leaders had led Judea into Rome's grip and so may not have wanted to offer the family much praise. Second, they clearly wanted to promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to look toward the divine for protection. They likely feared inciting Jews to another revolt that might end in disaster, as the Bar Kochba revolt did.[158] \"Hanukkah is an ancient holiday, but a modest one. The holiday of the Hasmoneans is new, yet it is full of spiritual exaltation and national joy. What was Hanukkah forty years ago? 'Al ha-nissim' and Hallel; a short reading in the synagogue; lighting the tiny, slender wax candles or oil lights; at home, levivot [latkes-potato pancakes], cards for the older children, and sevivonim [dreidels-spinning tops] for the little ones. But what is Hanukkah today? The holiday of the Hasmoneans. A holiday of salvation. A great national holiday, celebrated in all the countries of the Diaspora with dances and speeches, melody and song, outings and parades, as if a new soul has been breathed into the ancient holiday, another spirit renewed within it. One thing is clear: if those tiny, modest candles had been extinguished in Diaspora times, if our grandparents had not preserved the traditions of Hanukkah in the synagogue and at home . .., the holiday of the Hasmoneans could never have been created. There would have been nothing to change, nothing to renew. The new soul of our times would not have found a body in which to envelop itself.\" The emergence of Jewish nationalism and the Zionist movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries had a profound impact on the celebration and reinterpretation of Jewish holidays. These developments resulted in increased emphasis on certain Jewish celebrations, of which Hanukkah and Tu BiShvat are prominent examples.[161] Hanukkah took on renewed meaning following the rise of Jewish nationalism as a nationalist holiday, symbolizing the struggle of the Jewish people against foreign oppression and their desire for national re-creation [162] (although the struggle of Jews against foreign oppression has always been a core componant of Hanukkah, as shown by the Al HaNissim, which has been part of Jewish liturgy since at least 700 CE).[163] Hanukkah served as a common ground where both religious and secular Zionists could unite around their nationalist agenda. Rabbi Shmuel Mohilever, an early religious Zionist, proposed making Hanukkah the official holiday of the proto-Zionist organization Hovevei Zion in Russia in 1881. Public celebrations of Hanukkah gained prominence in the early 20th century, with parades and public events becoming common. Schools in Mandate Palestine played an early role in promoting these celebrations.[164] With the advent of Zionism and the state of Israel, the themes of militarism were reconsidered. In modern Israel, the national and military aspects of Hanukkah became, once again, more dominant.[165][166] In North America, Hanukkah in the 21st century has taken a place equal to Passover as a symbol of Jewish identity. Both the Israeli and North American versions of Hanukkah emphasize resistance, focusing on some combination of national liberation and religious freedom as the defining meaning of the holiday.[167][8] Diane Ashton attributed the increased visibility and reinvention of Hanukkah by some of the American Jewish community as a way to adapt to American life, re-inventing the festival in \"the language of individualism and personal conscience derived from both Protestantism and the Enlightenment\".[130] In North America, Hanukkah became increasingly important to many Jewish individuals and families during the latter part of the 20th century, including a large number of secular Jews, who wanted to celebrate a Jewish alternative to the Christmas celebrations which frequently overlap with Hanukkah.[168][169] Diane Ashton argues that Jewish immigrants to America raised the profile of Hanukkah as a kid-centered alternative to Christmas as early as the 1800s.[170] This in parts mirrors the ascendancy of Christmas, which like Hanukkah increased in importance in the 1800s.[171] During this time period, Jewish leaders (especially Reform) such as Max Lilienthal and Isaac Mayer Wise made an effort to rebrand Hanukkah and started creating Hanukkah celebration for kids at their synagogues, which included candy and singing songs.[170][172] By the 1900s, it started to become a commercial holiday like Christmas, with Hanukkah gifts and decorations appearing in stores and Jewish Women's magazines printing articles on holiday decorations, children's celebrations, and gift giving.[170] Ashton says that Jewish families did this in order to maintain a Jewish identity which is distinct from mainline Christian culture, on the other hand, the mirroring of Hanukkah and Christmas made Jewish families and kids feel that they were American.[170] Though it was traditional for Ashkenazi Jews to give \"gelt\" or money to children during Hanukkah, in many families, this tradition has been supplemented with the giving of other gifts so that Jewish children can enjoy receiving gifts just like their Christmas-celebrating peers do.[173] Children play a big role in Hanukkah, and Jewish families with children are more likely to celebrate it than childless Jewish families, and sociologists hypothesize that this is because Jewish parents do not want their kids to be alienated from their non-Jewish peers who celebrate Christmas.[168] Recent celebrations have also seen the presence of the Hanukkah bush, which is considered a Jewish counterpart to the Christmas tree. Today, the presence of Hanukkah bushes is generally discouraged by most rabbis.[174] In December 2022, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Reverends Al Sharpton and Conrad Tillard, businessman Robert F. Smith, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, and Elisha Wiesel joined to celebrate Hanukkah and Kwanzaa together, and combat racism and antisemitism, at Carnegie Hall.[175][176][177][178]",

                "content": "The Jewish Festival of Lights is an eight-day celebration that commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple of Jerusalem. It is one of the most popular holidays in Judaism and is marked by the lighting of the menorah. For many English speakers, the festival is also known for confusion over the spelling of its name: Is it Hanukkah or Chanukah? The answer is that both are considered correct, though Hanukkah is the most widely used spelling, while Chanukah is more traditional. In addition, more than 20 other variations are recorded. Why so many spellings? Transliteration. Hebrew does not use the Latin alphabet, which is the standard script of many languages, including English. Thus, when used in an English context, the sounds of the different Hebrew characters must be converted, or transliterated, into Latin letters. However, the Hebrew word for the holiday uses sounds that aren’t found in the Latin alphabet. The difficulty begins with the very first letter of the word, which is the eighth letter of the Hebrew alphabet—ḥet, or chet. It is pronounced with a guttural sound that is similar to the /ch/ in loch. So, when the Hebrew word was transliterated in the 17th century, the ḥet became ch (Chanukah). However, when the English ch appears at the beginning of a word, it sounds quite different than the Hebrew ḥet (compare loch and chair). Thus, in the 18th century another spelling appeared—Hanukkah—even though the h doesn’t really sound like ḥet either. Transliteration issues also arose over the use of other letters—such as one or two k’s—resulting in many spelling variations.",

                "title": "5 Traditional Hanukkah Foods to Complete Your Hanukkah Meal",
                "content": "Hanukkah is an eight-day holiday that celebrates the endurance of the Jewish religion and culture in the second century BCE. It can fall anytime between late November and late December, marking the 25th day of the month of Kislev in the Hebrew calendar. Known as the Festival of Lights, Hanukkah is a time when friends and family gather to rejoice, exchange gifts, and enjoy an assortment of traditional Hanukkah foods. From hearty potato latkes to sweet, crispy kugel, read below to learn more about traditional Hanukkah recipes. This year, Hanukkah starts on Wednesday, December 25th and ends on Thursday, January 2nd. Traditional Hanukkah food is composed of fried foods, savory meats, and sweet desserts. Below we go through five essential Hanukkah foods that are rooted in tradition, making them a meaningful part of your celebration. Brisket is enjoyed during many Jewish holidays besides Hanukkah, such as Rosh Hashanah and Passover. As you prepare this meal in a dutch oven or roasting pan, be sure to include a combination of flavor-enhancing seasonings. Below are some Hanukkah brisket recipe ideas: When done right, brisket is irresistibly juicy and flavorful. Since this cut of meat is served very tender, it takes a few hours to cook. Brisket became a Jewish food tradition because Kosher practices make it easier to slice brisket meat cuts, and it was historically one of the more affordable meat cuts. Latkes, also known as potato pancakes, are made from shallow-fried shredded or mashed potatoes. While latkes are a quintessential Hanukkah food, there is still plenty of room for creativity. Here are a few ways to add a twist to this classic recipe. Traditionally, Latkes are served with applesauce and sour cream. For a creative twist that remains traditional, serve your potato latkes with popular Israeli spreads such as charoset, tahini, or hummus. You can even turn your latkes into a meal by serving them with hearty toppings such as smoked salmon or baharat-spiced tofu for a vegan Hanukkah menu option. Kugel is a traditional Jewish egg noodle casserole and is commonly served as a side dish. Kugel can be transformed from sweet to savory by swapping out sugar and specialty cinnamon for vegetables and spices. Consider adding a unique and tasty touch to your Kugel with the following spices, dried fruit, nuts, and other ingredients. Kugel is a traditional Ashkenazi Jewish dish. Some interpretations credit kugel with mystical, spiritual qualities. Sufganiyot are round, deep-fried yeast dough filled with jam and sprinkled with powdered sugar, similar to paczki. The Hebrew word sufganiyot is pronounced \"soof-gah-nee\" and is derived from the Greek word sufan, which means \"spongy\" or \"fried\". To Western guests, this type of donut can be understood as a cross between a beignet and a jelly doughnut. Sufganiyot are an essential Hanukkah food. Below are suggestions for serving unique sufganiyot recipes this year. Fried foods are an important part of the traditional Hanukkah dinner because they represent the small amount of oil that miraculously burned for 8 days instead of just one when the Jews rededicated the Temple after overcoming oppression. As guests enjoy their meal, the oil used to fry the foods reminds them of the miracle their ancestors experienced centuries ago. Traditionally, Hanukkah gelt was money given as a present during the Jewish festival of Hanukkah. In most modern celebrations, Hanukkah gelt takes the form of a chocolate coin covered in gold foil. Whether scattered on kitchen and dining room tables during your Hanukkah celebration, reserved for prizes during games, or given as a token or gift, chocolate Hanukkah gelt is a part of many Hanukkah celebrations today. Since the 17th century, giving money (gelt) on Hanukkah has been a tradition. It began with parents giving gelt to teachers and eventually expanded to families giving gelt to their children as gifts or rewards for Torah study. Over time, chocolate manufacturers used the concept to make chocolate gelt wrapped in gold or silver foil in small pouches that look like money bags. This act of gratitude is also recognized as a commemoration and celebration of the miracle of the oil. Other than these customary Hanukkah foods, it's typical to include a range of other sides, like challah, large salads, Brussels sprouts, or seasonal recipes, such as fried okra and late-harvest zucchini. These dishes represent the long history of Jewish families and friends coming together and celebrating the holiday season through food.

Full course meals are celebrated in various cultures, each with a distinct array of food and traditions. These meals have a fascinating history, shaped by the ever-changing trends in cuisine across different regions. In the Western world, a full course meal often invokes images of extravagant dinner parties or indulgent dining experiences at upscale restaurants. However, serving full course meals requires understanding the number of courses included in a traditional full course meal and the composition of each course. This resource provides essential information about full course meals in Western culture and explains the typical sequence of meal courses. Click below to learn more about full course meals: What Is a Full Course Meal? What Is a Meal Course? Sample Sequences for Up to 12 Meal Courses 12 Course Meal Menu How to Create a Full Course Meal Menu Serving a Full Course Meal Tips What Is a Full Course Meal? A full course dinner is a meal featuring multiple courses. The basic full course meal consists of three or four courses. They begin with precursors to a main dish, such as an amuse-bouche, followed by the main course(s), and conclude with sweets, coffee, and tea. Full course meals frequently occur at someone’s home, a venue, or a restaurant. They take place in the afternoon or evening for a special occasion. In both upscale restaurants and casual eateries, guests can opt for a full course meal by ordering multiple dishes to come out at separate times. While a traditional full course meal may be more complex than quick service, it is still commonly enjoyed by groups of friends at celebratory events. The more ambitious tasting menu includes up to 20 courses and extends over a long period. What Is a Meal Course? A meal course is a single or set of food items served at a specific point in a meal sequence for culinary and digestion reasons. Common courses are an appetizer, main course, and dessert. Some cultures a grains or pasta course, followed by a meat course, then a seafood course. An average meal consists of one or more meal courses. How Many Courses Are in a Meal? Many meals only contain one course. The most basic full course meal consists of 2 or 3 of the following courses: an appetizer, a main dish, and a dessert. However, meals can feature up to 12 or more courses. Sample Sequences for Up to 12 Meal Courses A common and logical sequence for your full course meal is to start with light plates, continue with richer dishes, and conclude with small and delicate items. Below are sample full course meal sequences, but you can choose which meal courses you plan to include on your menu. 12 course meal: A 12 course dinner menu includes an hors d'oeuvre, amuse-bouche, soup, appetizer, salad, fish, first main course, palate cleanser, second main course, cheese course, dessert, and mignardise. 10 course meal: A 10 course dinner menu includes an hors d'oeuvre, soup, appetizer, salad, fish, main course, palate cleanser, second main course, dessert, and mignardise. 9 course meal: A 9 course dinner menu includes an hors d'oeuvre, soup, appetizer, salad, fish, main course, palate cleanser, dessert, and mignardise. 8 course meal: An 8 course dinner menu includes an hors d'oeuvre, soup, appetizer, salad, main course, palate cleanser, dessert, and mignardise. 7 course meal: A 7 course dinner menu includes an hors d'oeuvre, soup, appetizer, salad, main course, dessert, and mignardise. 6 course meal: A 6 course dinner menu includes an hors d'oeuvre, soup, appetizer, salad, main course, and dessert. 5 course meal: A 5 course dinner menu includes an hors d'oeuvre, appetizer, salad, main course, and dessert. 4 course meal: A 4 course dinner menu includes an hors d'oeuvre, appetizer, main course, and dessert. 3 course meal: A 3 course dinner menu includes an appetizer, main course, and dessert. Back to Top 12 Course Meal Menu Below are explanations of the courses in a 12 course meal and dish suggestions for each stage. Course One - Hors D'Oeuvres: Since this course is typically served during cocktail hour or as guests arrive, hors d’oeuvres are hand-held finger foods that are easy to eat. Goat cheese crostini with fig-olive tapenade Zucchini fritters Shallot and pancetta tortilla crisps Course Two - Amuse-Bouche: This can be translated from French to mean “amuse the mouth” or to generally please guests’ palates with a small, flavorful taste. Frequently, this might stimulate the appetite or hint at upcoming flavors in the next meal course(s). Restaurants use this as a complementary item chosen by the chef. Sweet potato chips with goat cheese and caviar Caprese bites with basil vinaigrette Pea soup served in a shot glass or espresso cup Course Three - Soup: As with all your courses, one classic idea is to relate your soup course to the season. Avoid soups that are too hearty so guests don’t fill up for the rest of the meal. Melon and basil gazpacho Pumpkin sage bisque Tuscan white bean and roasted garlic soup Course Four - Appetizer: In many parts of Europe, this course is called the \"entree\" because it introduces the main stages of the meal. It is usually served on serving trays or small appetizer plates and features small cuts of meat, seasonal vegetables, starches, and sauces. Charred broccoli with shishito peppers and pickled onions Mushrooms stuffed with Pecorino Romano, garlic, and bread crumbs Candied carrots with honey, cumin, and paprika Course Five - Salad: This course is usually an assortment of raw vegetables with a flavorful dressing. Some restaurants in parts of Europe serve salad after the main course, but it is also common to serve salad before it. Garden salad with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and tart vinaigrette Chopped Thai salad with peanut dressing Greek salad with olives, lettuce, red onions, and feta cheese Course Six - Fish: This dish is a flavorful light protein before the main courses. Grilled salmon with a soy sauce marinade Lemon garlic tilapia Crispy trout with a parsley-caper vinaigrette Course Seven - First Main Course: The first main dish is often white meat, such as chicken, duck, or turkey. Spicy Thai basil chicken Roasted duck with an orange-ginger glaze Deep-fried turkey with a honey bourbon glaze Course Eight - Palate Cleanser: This is like a reset for your taste buds. Palate cleansers remove residual flavors from the mouth before the next course. Sorbet (lemon, melon, or mint) Prosecco Water with lemon Course Nine - Second Main Course: Typically, the second main course is red meat, such as premium beef and lamb, or game meat such as venison. Stuffed lamb breast with lemon, ricotta, and oregano Grilled flatiron steak with rosemary potatoes Herb-crusted venison medallions Course Ten - Cheese Course: Create a platter of different cheeses and items to accompany them. Include a variety of cheese textures and flavors, such as aged, soft, firm, and blue cheeses Choose a selection of breads and crackers Provide companion items, such as jams, chutneys, spicy mustards, caramelized onions, candied nuts, and pistachios Course Eleven - Dessert: Usually accompanied by an after-dinner drink such as a glass of dessert wine, coffee, or tea, this is a sweet and decadent course. Rich flourless chocolate cake with a glass of sweet port wine Lemon creme brulee with dry white wine Fruit tarts and berries with champagne Course Twelve - Mignardise: Many restaurants offer mignardise to conclude the meal on a sweet note. This tiny, bite-sized dessert pairs with tea, coffee, port, brandy, or scotch. Miniature butter madeleine biscuits Small pieces of chocolate Bite-sized macarons Back to Top How to Create a Full Course Meal Menu Preparing a full course meal can seem daunting, especially for a large crowd. However, if you follow a central theme or cuisine when deciding what will be on your menu, it is much easier to come up with your dishes. Below are some tips for creating your menu. Choose a theme: Before creating a full course menu, decide on a theme, cuisine, or set of flavors to base your meal around. This preparation makes it easier to decide on a menu and ensures continuity throughout the courses. Decide on a season or region: Consider basing your full course meal on the season, or feature cuisines from one or several regions. Build around the main course: Whatever theme you choose for your meal, ensure it can provide a solid main course, and work the rest of the courses and theme elements around it. Tips for Serving a Full Course Meal How you serve or enjoy a full course meal is up to your discretion and can be as casual or formal as you prefer. Below are some tips to curate a full course meal and information on traditional etiquette. Provide water and wine: As you begin serving your full course meal, provide a goblet of water and a glass of wine for each guest. Pay attention to table setting: Each course requires distinct dinnerware and silverware, so set your table based on the number of courses in your meal. Remember utensil etiquette: Guests will use the outermost utensils first and work toward the plate as the courses progress. Remove plates: Before moving on to the next course, remember to remove the dishes from the previous course. Be prompt: Don’t wait too long between serving each course. Know when to clear plates: According to traditional etiquette, staff should clear each plate from the right side of each guest before serving another to the left side of each guest. Ask guests to pass their dishes: If you do not have servers at your dinner party, have guests pass the dishes from the left so they can serve themselves with their right hand. Choose a charger plate: Many table settings will have a charger plate that acts as a base setting for dinnerware. The dish is only cleared when dessert is served. Back to Top When serving a meal, the options for potential courses are endless. Whether you prefer to get creative or stick to tradition, you can showcase as little as one course or go all out with as many courses as you want. Full course meals are perfect for hosts, chefs, and restaurants to showcase their skills and flavors, providing a delightful and indulgent dining experience that guests will remember. National Food Holidays are a fun and creative way to celebrate and promote various types of food throughout the year. From International Hot and Spicy Food Day to National Ice Cream Month, these designated food holidays provide an opportunity for businesses in the food industry to engage with their customers and showcase their products. These holidays not only generate excitement and buzz, but they also offer a chance for businesses to offer special holiday promotions, create themed menus, and attract new customers. Whether you run a restaurant, bakery, or food truck, participating in National Food Holidays can be a valuable marketing tool to increase sales and build brand awareness. Click below to skip to the food holiday season that most interests you: Winter Food Holidays Spring Food Holidays Summer Food Holidays Fall Food Holidays Food Holiday Calendar Winter Food Holidays Though the winter months can be cold, they offer plenty of reasons to celebrate with food. From high-stakes sporting events to popular holidays, people across the country have plenty of reasons to get out of the house despite the winter weather. If you’re looking for winter promotions for your bar, restaurant, or pub, consider the following holidays: International Hot and Spicy Food Day - Jan 16 Observed on January 16th, International Hot and Spicy Food Day is a day for celebrating all types of spicy foods. Whether you serve wings, hot sauce, or any other type of food that appears on the Scoville scale, this day is the perfect opportunity to highlight your spicier foods. If you operate a restaurant or bar, you can add new wing sauces to your menu for guests to try. You can also offer discounts on wings or even host a wing eating challenge. National “Drink Wine” Day - Feb 18 Celebrated on February 18th, National “Drink Wine” Day offers a chance for you and your guests to enjoy your favorite glass of wine. Whether it’s being enjoyed on its own or as part of a meal, wine is one of the most popular alcoholic beverages across the globe. Since wine comes in several different varieties, every person may have a different preference. If you have the supplies to do it, hosting a wine tasting is an excellent way to celebrate the holiday and introduce your guests to new types of wine. You can also feature select bottles on your menu or even offer specials on certain brands. Fastnacht Day and Paczki Day - Fat Tuesday Fastnacht Day and Paczki Day coincide with Fat Tuesday and Mardi Gras. Marking the Tuesday before the beginning of Lent, the date of the holiday can fluctuate to allow for 47 days of fasting and reflection before Easter Sunday. Doughy pastries are made to use up the fat and sugar in the house. Each pastry has a distinct style and taste, with fastnachts originating from German cuisine while paczkis originate from Polish cuisine. If you own a bakery and don’t currently serve the pastries, you can add them to your menu for the day to celebrate. National Irish Food Day - March 17 Celebrated on March 17th, National Irish Food Day falls on the same date as St. Patrick’s Day. If you’re looking to host a St. Patrick’s Day celebration at your restaurant, bar, or pub, try adding traditional Irish foods like shepherd’s pie or corned beef and cabbage to your menu for the day. Offering discounts or special offers on select types of whiskey is another effective promotion to consider. To take your celebration a step further, you can even make an effort to buy green products and display Irish decorations for the day. Spring Food Holidays As the snow melts and the days get warmer, many people across the country will find themselves looking for something to do. To capitalize on this, there are a variety of different promotional options available to restaurant owners. Consider celebrating one or more of the following food holidays to create interest in your business this spring: New Beer’s Eve and National Beer Day - April 6 and 7 New Beer’s Eve falls on April 6th, with National Beer Day directly following it on April 7th. The holiday was established to celebrate the end of Prohibition, which was put into effect with the 18th Amendment and banned all alcohol sales in the United States. When the 21st Amendment put an end to prohibition, people across the country celebrated. To commemorate the day, offer happy hour specials on select beers for your guests. If you own or operate a brewery, you can provide brewery tours to teach curious customers about the brewing process. National Hoagie Day - May 5 Celebrated on May 5th, National Hoagie Day gives you and your customers an excuse to enjoy the hoagie of your choice. Also referred to as submarine sandwiches, or “subs”, hoagies are one of the most popular types of sandwiches in the country. To celebrate National Hoagie Day and attract customers, some delis choose to offer discounts on select sizes or types of hoagies. Others go as far as handing out free hoagies to lucky customers. National Mint Julep Day - May 30 On May 30th, people across the country gather to celebrate National Mint Julep Day. A mint julep is an alcoholic cocktail that is made with bourbon and fresh mint, as well as other varying ingredients. Although their official holiday is observed on May 30th, many people also enjoy this drink during the Kentucky Derby. If your bar staff knows how to prepare a mint julep, you can highlight it on your menu. You can also optimize your outdoor dining space for serving drinks and create a refreshing way to celebrate as summer draws near. International Picnic Day- June 18 This food holiday is celebrated on June 18th, just days before the start of summer. Celebrate the fact that summer is closing in by hosting a picnic-themed celebration at your restaurant. If you have an outdoor dining space, you can decorate the tables with picnic-themed products. You can also showcase picnic-themed foods on your menu or create a buffet-style layout where guests can choose the foods that best fit their ideal picnic celebration. Summer Food Holidays The beginning of summer brings excitement and opportunity for many people. Families go on vacation, children get a break from school, and businesses across the country prepare for an influx of customers. Below, we’ve listed several different summer food holidays that you can use to attract guests and generate interest in your business: National Ice Cream Day - Third Sunday of July Commemorate the start of summer with National Ice Cream Day, observed every year on the third Sunday in July. The dessert regularly ranks among the most popular desserts in the United States and can be found in many different flavors, meaning that each customer may have a unique preference for how their ice cream is served. If you own an ice cream shop, you can invest in a self-serve station for your guests, allowing them to celebrate the day with their ideal frozen treat. Another way to celebrate National Ice Cream Day is to add new flavors to your menu for a limited time, allowing guests to try their favorites. If one sells particularly well, you could even add it to your menu permanently. National Tequila Day - July 24 July 24th marks National Tequila Day, an opportunity for tequila enjoyers across the country to enjoy. Tequila can be enjoyed both on its own and as part of a cocktail, with many mixed drink recipes calling for the popular liquor. Consider hosting a tequila tasting and offering specials on drinks like margaritas, tequila sours, and Mexican mules at your bar to celebrate the holiday. National Potato Day - Aug 19 There are many different types of potatoes, and each year on August 19th businesses have an opportunity to celebrate them. Chances are you offer them in a variety of different forms on your menu. If you have access to buffet equipment or food warmers, creating a baked potato bar is an excellent way to celebrate National Potato Day. By providing your customers with a variety of toppings and mix-ins you can allow them to create the baked potato meal that best fits their preferences. International Bacon Day - First Saturday of Sept International Bacon Day is typically celebrated on the first Saturday of September, just before Labor Day. Whether it’s being enjoyed as a side at breakfast, as a topping on a burger, or just on its own, bacon comes in many forms and is one of the most popular foods across the globe. To celebrate the day and draw customers to your business, work with your staff to find ways to incorporate bacon into the recipes on your menu. This can be achieved by adding bacon to your burgers, breakfast sandwiches, and a variety of other common dishes. Fall Food Holidays The arrival of fall brings with it one of the busiest times of the year. From back-to-school time to the anticipation of Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, there are plenty of things to look forward to. Fall also brings with it the anticipation of fall flavors and trends, as well as the opportunity to create a variety of different promotions for your restaurant. By celebrating the food holidays below, you can create a unique fall atmosphere in your business: International Coffee Day - Oct 1 October 1st marks International Coffee Day, a holiday that is used to promote and celebrate the caffeinated beverage. Originally established in 2015, the holiday is also used to promote fair trade coffee and raise awareness for the issues faced by coffee growers. Every morning, people across the globe buy or prepare a cup of coffee as part of their daily routine. If your coffee shop offers a customer loyalty program, you can offer a free cup of coffee to anyone with a loyalty card. It's also important to consider offering discounts on takeout coffee containers, allowing large groups to enjoy coffee together. World Vegetarian Day - Oct 1 World Vegetarian Day is celebrated every year on October 1st. It was established by the World Vegetarian Society in 1977 to promote the joy, compassion, and life-enhancing possibilities of adopting a vegetarian diet. The holiday allows organizations across the globe to raise awareness of the ethical and environmental benefits of vegetarianism. To celebrate World Vegetarian Day, experiment with meatless food options on your menu. Foods like tofu, tempeh, and soy are just a few examples of plant-based protein sources. By ordering plant-based meat products for your kitchen, you can put a vegetarian spin on your most popular dishes. National Pumpkin Day - Oct 26 Celebrated on October 26th, National Pumpkin Day is the perfect opportunity to celebrate the arrival of fall. As one of the main symbols of Halloween, there are many different types of pumpkins and recipes that you can choose from. Pumpkin pie, pumpkin bread, and pumpkin puree are just a few of the foods you can add to your menu for the day. However, to truly celebrate the holiday, you must put all parts of your pumpkin to use. Hosting a pumpkin carving or decorating contest gives guests a chance to show off their decorating skills. If you own a bar, consider making a pumpkin keg and filling it with your favorite fall beer. National Apple Cider Day - Nov 18 National Apple Cider Day falls on November 18th. Although its classification can vary depending on where you live, nothing should stop you from celebrating the versatile drink. As one of the most popular fall beverages, it can be prepared and served in several different ways. To celebrate the holiday, you can attempt to make your own apple cider or find an apple cider brand that best fits your preferences. You can also serve hard cider at your bar or add it to your selection of drinks.

The oil used to fry them is a commemoration of the oil in the temple lamps. Made of shredded potatoes and onions much like hash browns, they’re traditionally topped with applesauce and served as a side dish. Kugel is a sweet casserole that originated in Central Europe, made using egg noodles baked with sugar, eggs and sour cream. Raisins can be added, as well as spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg. It’s a rich dessert that tops many people’s lists of favorite Hanukkah foods and provides the flavor of many beloved holiday memories. Jewish Hanukkah food frequently includes this delicious beef roast as the main dish, adopted by tradition due to its affordable cost. A perfectly prepared brisket is seasoned with savory spices like thyme and sage and simmered in a wine stock. When done well, it’s a tender, juicy entrée that everyone will savor. Sweets are a must-have Hanukkah food, and this version of traditional European pastries is a treasure. Originating in Poland, rugelach is a bakery staple. These flaky crescent pastries are filled with nuts, dried fruits or chocolate, and the dough includes sour cream and cream cheese to impart an undeniably rich flavor.

Book Now This quintessential Jewish bread, representative of manna sent by God to sustain the Jews as they wandered the desert in Biblical times, is easily recognized on a standard Hanukkah table. Made crisp and brown with an egg wash on top and shaped in a thick braid, it’s both crusty and fluffy and makes a perfect side for soaking up delicious brisket juices. A simple but undeniable pleasure, roasted chicken is served for Shabbat dinner but also makes its way into many Jewish celebrations, including Hanukkah. Any preferred cut prepared with creative savory seasonings is ideal. You can even include potatoes, carrots and other root vegetables in the roasting pan to cook up some ready side dishes. These traditional jelly-filled donuts are plump and pillowy, topped with a dusting of powdered sugar and served as a dessert treat. They’re another fried Hanukkah food that commemorates the importance of oil in the Hanukkah celebration. The filling can be flavored in a number of ways; though fruit jelly is standard, sweet custard can be substituted if preferred. Matzo is unleavened bread, reflective of the same bread taken by the Jews as they fled Egypt. Though this Jewish comfort food is usually served at Passover, many families celebrate the Festival of Lights with matzo ball soup among their Hanukkah foods as well. Traditional recipes include a salty broth and matzo meal formed into balls, but a heartier version with chicken and vegetables included could be served as a main dish at any Hanukkah table. This loaf-style sliced cookie is a close cousin of Italian biscotti, created without butter or milk to keep them pareve by kosher food law. Though the ingredients vary slightly, the result is strikingly similar: a long, crisp cookie filled with almonds, chocolate chips or dried fruits, baked twice to give that trademark crunchy crust. These are a great Hanukkah food to serve as an after-dinner treat with coffee or tea. Book a World-Class Private Chef Now Five-star fine dining from the comfort of home.

                "title": "15 Traditional Hanukkah Food Recipes",
                "content": "By Risa Lichtman Taste of Home's Editorial Process Updated on Oct. 31, 2024 Celebrate the miracle of Hanukkah with eight nights of traditional Hanukkah food! Make crispy potato latkes, wine-braised brisket, sufganiyot and more. Throughout the eight days of Hanukkah, Jewish families like mine celebrate by eating latkes (fried potato pancakes) and sufganiyot (fried jelly doughnuts). Notice a theme? Often, traditional Hanukkah food is fried as a reminder of the oil in the story of the miracle of Hanukkah. We eat these symbolic foods not just on the first night of Hanukkah, but throughout all eight nights to celebrate the oil lasting for that long. Here are our favorite crispy bites and other Hanukkah favorites, as well as their significance for the holiday. On This Page Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, is a Jewish holiday that celebrates the ancient Jewish peoples’ reclamation of their temple in Jerusalem after occupation by the Syrian-Greek empire. As the story goes, the Jewish Maccabees reentered the temple and found only a tiny bit of oil—barely enough to burn their lamps for one day. Instead, the oil burned for eight days—a Hanukkah miracle. Since Hanukkah typically falls in December, it’s often considered the Jewish version of Christmas. But Hanukkah is a minor Jewish festival—far less significant than the Jewish High Holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Still, Hanukkah is a fun winter celebration—and it doesn’t hurt that it comes with lots of good food. There are dozens of Hanukkah recipes to make during the eight-day celebration, but here are some of the most traditional and beloved Hanukkah foods. Latkes are traditional fried potato pancakes that are eaten on Hanukkah to remember the miracle of the oil in the Hanukkah story. They’re probably the most well-known Hanukkah food, and for good reason. No matter how they’re made—from thinly or thickly shredded potatoes to almost mashed—they’re bound to be delicious. There are many latke variations, including sweet potato, zucchini and cheese and red pepper. Editor’s Tip: Homemade latkes are a time-consuming process, but they’re always worth it! Plus they freeze well, so you can make them ahead of time or make a big batch and freeze half of them. Applesauce and sour cream are the most popular latke toppings. They can be playfully divisive—ask any Jewish person in your life which they prefer, and they’ll likely have strong opinions. (So if you’re hosting a Hanukkah latke party, make sure you have both!) Whether you personally opt for applesauce or sour cream (or, like me, both!), these cool, smooth toppings provide the perfect contrast to piping hot, crispy latkes. Editor’s Tip: Store-bought sour cream and applesauce work just fine, but you can take your latkes up a notch with homemade applesauce. Fried jelly doughnuts are another reminder of the Hanukkah oil miracle. In Israel and many Jewish communities in the U.S., they’re called sufganiot, which is the Hebrew word for donuts. They’re related to sfinge, which are Moroccan doughnuts that are also associated with Hanukkah. Serve your sufganiyot on their own or in a spread of your favorite Hanukkah desserts! No Hanukkah food traditions are complete without gelt, the gold wrapped chocolate coins that are used to barter with during the traditional game of dreidel. A dreidel is a top with four sides, each with a different letter representing a word in a Hebrew saying that means “a great miracle happened there” (referring to Israel, where the Hanukkah story took place). To play dreidel, players each start with several pieces of gelt and take turns spinning the top. Depending on which letter the dreidel lands on, players have to give or take gelt from the center “pot.” The game ends when one player wins all of the gelt. Most people use store-bought gelt—it’s readily available at many retailers in December or online any time of year. You can also use pennies, M&M’s or make homemade gelt. Hanukkah cookies may not be as traditional as latkes or sufganiyot, but they’re a popular way to celebrate the holiday. Common cookie shapes for Hanukkah include dreidels, menorahs (the nine-pronged Hanukkah candle holder) and stars of David. To mix up your sweets spread, include some other sweets like chocolate-stuffed dreidel cookies, rugelach, mandelbrot or slices of chocolate babka. TASTE OF HOME Some common Hanukkah foods like brisket are also popular at other Jewish holidays, like Passover and Rosh Hashanah. Different from Texas-style barbecue brisket, Jewish brisket is braised with liquid like red wine or even Coca Cola, as well as vegetables like carrots, onions and potatoes. Editor’s Tip: When you’re buying brisket meat, look for a piece with lots of marbling—it’ll make for a more flavorful dish. Kugel is an easy-to-make and easy-to-personalize casserole dish that can be served sweet or savory. Sweet versions use an egg noodle base and usually include cottage cheese, eggs, sugar, cinnamon and raisins. Savory versions use a shredded potato base—which makes it great for Passover—and may include garlic, onions and other vegetables. Rugelach is a popular Jewish dessert that’s enjoyed at different holidays and celebrations, including Hanukkah. These little rolled cookies are made using a cream cheese dough, which cooks up as a light, flaky pastry. There are endless fillings for rugelach recipes—from fruity raspberry and apricot to sweet chocolate—and they often include chopped nuts, like walnuts. Mandel bread, technically known as Mandelbrot, is a favorite Jewish cookie that is similar to biscotti. Translating to “almond bread,” these long and crispy double-baked cookies are perfect for dipping in coffee or tea, but they can be enjoyed on their own as well. Serve it as a Hanukkah dessert studded with chocolate chips, nuts or dried fruit. Sarah Tramonte For Taste of Home Challah is a braided, egg-based bread that’s served on Shabbat and at nearly every Jewish holiday meal. Usually, you’ll find it topped with sesame seeds or poppy seeds or just a nice egg wash, except for on Rosh Hashanah when it will be filled with raisins and rolled into a circle. Challah is easy to make with the whole family, and kids love rolling out the strands and braiding it. Roasted chicken is a beloved dish for Jewish holidays, and Hanukkah is no exception. Make one of our whole roast chicken recipes during any night of Hanukkah, then be sure to save all the bones for homemade chicken stock. Editor’s Tip: To get the skin extra crispy, salt your chicken up to 24 hours ahead of time, stored uncovered in the fridge so the skin dries out. It’s not a Jewish holiday without matzo ball soup, aka everyone’s favorite Jewish penicillin. You can make homemade matzo balls or save time and use the box mix, which is still delicious. I like to add chopped herbs like dill, parsley and cilantro to my matzo balls. Editor’s Tip: For fluffy matzo balls, make sure not to overmix the batter so the balls stay light and float to the top of the soup. Roasted carrots are a staple on Jewish holidays, but they’re especially nice on Hanukkah to balance out all the fried foods. They’re often drizzled in something sweet like pomegranate molasses, honey or maple syrup, which helps them caramelize while they’re roasting. Serve roasted carrots alongside your brisket or roasted chicken. The main ingredient in olive oil cake is—you guessed it—olive oil. This is the perfect food to eat on Hanukkah to celebrate the miracle of the oil, and it doesn’t hurt that it’s so delicious. Olive oil cake is moist and fluffy, and can easily be personalized to your taste with different flavors or glazes. Lemon olive oil cake and chocolate olive oil cake are just two examples! Even though they’re not fried, pan-seared Brussels sprouts can get nice and crispy. They’re also a great way to get some greens on your Hanukkah plate. Try one of our favorite Brussels sprouts recipes, and make sure to use fresh sprouts versus frozen for the best flavor.

                "content": "From shallow-fried potato latkes to deep-fried jelly doughnuts, traditional Hanukkah foods hinge on oil. Typically falling in December, the Jewish holiday, also called the Festival of Lights, celebrates the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem. As the story goes, the Maccabees had enough oil to last just one night, but somehow, someway, it lasted for eight. Today’s tradition of lighting the menorah for eight consecutive evenings and, yes, eating lots of crispy fried foods, pays homage to that magical flame. But there’s much more to Hanukkah than potato pancakes and sufganiyot. Below we’re sharing 31 all-star Hanukkah recipes, like juicy brisket, noodle kugel, pillowy challah, and more. Just make sure you save room for dessert. Hanukkah foods don’t get more iconic than latkes. This bite-size iteration of the crispy potato pancakes makes a great holiday appetizer, and you can top them however you want (say, with sour cream and applesauce, or cream cheese and smoked fish). This streamlined recipe produces fork-tender brisket and a rich red wine jus with glossy crisp-tender veg on the side. Though traditionally made on Passover, lots of families love matzo ball soup on Hanukkah too. This comforting recipe serves a crowd. With a cream cheese and butter dough, these rugelach are tender-meets-flaky. Freeze-dried fruit adds gorgeous color to this classic Hanukkah recipe. This reliable roast chicken needs only a handful of ingredients: your pick of olive oil or butter, lemon, garlic, and of course, salt and pepper. That’s it. A beloved Hanukkah food in Israel, jelly doughnuts (sufganiyot in Hebrew) are pure comfort. Since you’re making the doughnuts from scratch, give yourself a break and buy the jam. Not mashed potatoes, but smashed potatoes. Boiled Yukon Golds get flattened and dressed with a garlicky walnut and golden raisin dressing. This is not your grandmother’s brisket. The sometimes-tough cut of meat becomes extra tender when braised in the style of classic French beef bourguignon, and you can make this impressive holiday main ahead of time. Whatever ingredient you want to fry, this all-purpose batter made with rice flour and fizzy seltzer is ready to rumble. We’d trade all our chocolate gelt for this intensely chocolaty, fudge-draped skillet cake, which also happens to be gluten- and dairy-free. A Hanukkah menu staple for Ashkenazi Jews, latkes can go lots of ways. This riff from chef and author Missy Robbins is cheesy and lemony. Want to serve your latkes with applesauce? Try this rosy recipe. Its natural blush comes from the apple skins. Take a break from traditional latkes with these sweet potato fritters interlaced with chopped kimchi and served with gochujang yogurt. Potatoes and beets join forces in this colorful fritter recipe, which includes a sidecar of magenta-hued dip. Bouncy egg noodles, cheesy-sugary custard, and a whisper of vanilla. Is kugel a side dish or dessert? Your call. If spiced isn’t your scene, skip the cinnamon. Sour cream, but not for latke-dunking. Here, it becomes a creamy dressing for a leafy radicchio salad. Instead of egg noodles, this lovely kugel from author Michael W. Twitty features chewy, long-grain rice. This beloved challah recipe has been in editor Julia Kramer’s family for decades. Eggs add richness and a golden hue, while sesame seeds yield a delightfully crackly crust. This silky parsnip mash from Ina Garten’s latest cookbook couldn’t be easier (or tastier) if it tried. Serve alongside brisket for a stellar Hanukkah dinner menu. Yet another spin on latkes—this time vegan, with lots of leeks. Instead of egg, almond flour acts as a binder. Chef Einat Admony grew up eating this Yemeni chicken soup every Friday with her family. Feel free to keep or skip the matzo balls for your Hanukkah celebration. With over a cup of olive oil, this lemony cake is super moist and tender. Dust with powdered sugar for an effortlessly pretty presentation. For a vegetarian main, blanket cabbage wedges in a luscious cheese sauce, then roast until charred and tender. This Hanukkah recipe would also be welcome on your Shabbat table year-round. The oven takes care of the hard work here. Simply combine carrots with butter, brown sugar, maple syrup, and red pepper flakes, then roast. Hasselback potatoes go miniature in this utterly charming recipe, which channels the flavor of sour cream and onion soup packets into your new favorite side dish. If you’ve got a box of matzo that’s still hanging around from Passover (no shame), turn the brittle planks into a creamy, lasagna-adjacent casserole, packed with mushrooms and greens. A well-wrapped chocolate babka will last for days, making it a prime Hanukkah dessert and breakfast the next morning. When it does eventually go stale, cut it into cubes to make babka cereal. Olive oil and earthy tahini give these cookies an ideal sweet-savory balance. If you don’t have a chocolate bar on hand, chop up those chocolate coins you won playing dreidel. Crispy chicken cutlets, garlicky tahini, and a pickle-y cabbage salad: As one reader put it, “This was DELICIOUS!” These no-knead doughnuts were brought to Israel by Moroccan Jews in the early 20th century. A breakfast treat of the Maghreb year-round, they’re often eaten by Sephardic Jews during Hanukkah. Yes, 250° is the right temperature. Roasting at a low heat, with lots of olive oil, yields perfectly cooked fish every time. And all that oil makes it a perfect food for Hanukkah. More from Bon Appétit Contact © 2024 Condé Nast.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. At halftime of \"Sunday Night Football,\" the visiting Atlanta Falcons lead the Washington Commanders, 17-7. In a battle of two rookie quarterbacks selected in the top 10 of this past year's draft, it was the Bijan Robinson show prior to the break as the second-year back racked up 84 yards and two touchdowns on his 15 total touches. Michael Penix Jr. and Jayden Daniels were each intercepted once in the first half, with the teams each capitalizing on those picks with touchdown drives. The difference in the first half was the success of Atlanta's Robinson-led run game, along with its pass rush, which pressured Daniels multiple times and also brought him to the ground for a pair of sacks. The Falcons were thus more able to sustain their drives, which allowed them to come through with an additional touchdown and a late-half field goal to take a 10-point lead. Can Washington seal its trip to the postseason by staging a second-half comeback, or will Atlanta throw a wrench into those plans and maintain its hold on first place in the NFC South? We'll find out soon enough. In the meantime, keep it locked to our live blog throughout the evening as we update you with stats, scores and highlights. Date: Sunday, Dec. 29 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: Northwest Stadium (Landover, Maryland)Channel: NBC | Stream: fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports App Betting odds: Commanders -3.5, O/U 46 (via Caesars Sportsbook) Some really, really bad clock management from Atlanta on this final drive, and then Penix airmailed an open corner route on third down, so the Falcons settled for a Younhoe Koo field goal to take a 10-point lead into the break. Washington gets the ball to begin the third quarter. It looked like the second score of the night for Bijan Robinson, but apparently the ball was behind him as he went through the front corner of the end zone, so they took the score off the board. Michael Penix then got stopped on a QB sneak from inside the 1-yard line. Falcons still trying to punch it in. And then Bijan took it into the end zone anyway, bouncing it outside the tackle box and easily jumping into the end zone to give the Falcons their first lead of the night. Really undisciplined performance from the Washington defense so far. Already three penalties to extend drives. After a penalty set Washington's drive back inside the red zone, Kaden Elliss came up with a huge play to shut down the scoring opportunity. Looks like Daniels got fooled by the coverage and never saw Elliss dropping into his zone, and just threw the ball right into the defender's chest. Former Falcons WR Olamide Zaccheus has 5-53-1 against his former team less than 5 minutes into the second quarter. One of the best games of his career already. That looked like the third miscommunication of the game for the Falcons already. The snap operation isn't on the same page, and neither are the receivers. Thankfully it looks like Jayden Daniels is okay after a scary-looking hit where he got bent backwards over his knee. He stayed in the game and looked just fine in completing a rollout pass on third-and-forever, but Washington still had to punt it away. After another penalty on the Washington secondary, the Falcons got set up with first-and-goal from the 1, and it ended with Bijan Robinson's 11th touchdown of the season. Nice design with the full-house backfield and a direct snap to Robinson. The ball got snapped before anybody was ready for it on third-and-4, and Penix had to essentially throw the ball away. Second miscommunication of the night already, in the rookie's second NFL start. HOWEVER. Mike Sainristil lined up offside on the field goal attempt, so the Falcons get a new set of downs and another chance to score. That was a laser from Penix over the middle to KhaDarel Hodge but Hodge just got lit up by Jeremy Chinn and couldn't hang on. The Commanders went for it on yet another fourth down, and converted yet again. They're now an incredible 17 of 20 on fourth downs this year after the 7-yard score on the great play-action concept. No idea where Michael Penix Jr. was going with this throw. No receiver was even in the area. Looks like a miscommunication with Chris Blair. Washington set up with great field position now. Michael Davis looked like he injured his shoulder tackling Bijan Robinson on that last play. As they said on the broadcast, Davis is already filling in for Marshon Lattimore. Less than ideal situation brewing in the defensive backfield for the Commies. No Marshon Lattimore is notable here. No surprises here for Atlanta in Michael Penix's road debut. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Jayden Daniels and the Commanders took a decisive step toward the playoffs with a thrilling Week 16 win over the Eagles, putting themselves in position to clinch a playoff berth Sunday. Daniels threw five touchdowns in the win, overcoming five turnovers from the offense and making his case for Offensive Rookie of the Year. The Falcons aren't just looking to play spoiler. They control their fate in the NFC South, and they were given a spark by rookie QB Michael Penix Jr. in a blowout win over the Giants last weekend. The competition only gets tougher for Penix in his second career start, but a win could put him on track for a trip to the playoffs. Daniels beat out Penix in last season's Heisman race, but Penix has a chance to get the better of the former LSU star in their first NFL meeting — and potentially threaten threaten the Commanders' playoff hopes in the process.

It's a balmy 60 degrees. 6:40 p.m. — Bo Nix had some big moments yesterday, but the Broncos' loss and his quiet overtime drives mean Jayden Daniels remains the heavy Offensive Rookie of the Year favorite even as Brock Bowers and Malik Nabers continue to shine. 6:30 p.m. — Let's set the stage for tonight: the Commanders can clinch a playoff berth with a win. The Falcons can't, but an Atlanta win would leave them one win away from an NFC South title. If the Vikings hold on, the Commanders would move to the No. 6 seed with a win AND clinch the NFC West for the Rams. Sunday's game between the Falcons and Commanders will kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET from Northwest Stadium in Landover, Md. Falcons vs. Commanders will be broadcast nationally on NBC.

Kickoff is scheduled for 8:20 p.m. ET on Sunday Night Football. The Falcons sign ILB Josh Woods to active roster in lieu of the move. Kickoff is scheduled for Sunday night at 8:20 p.m. at Northwest Stadium. Since the bye week, the Falcons have one of the most productive pass-rush units in the NFL. The Falcons will be without key pieces of depth in the defensive secondary, though. Terrell is playing lockdown defense, while Drake London and Darnell Mooney are on the verge of history. The Falcons' defense must prepare for the rookie quarterback who leads the Commanders in rushing yards. London told reporters in the locker room Thursday that he expects to be full-go for Sunday Night Football. Atlanta will face Washington on 'Sunday Night Football' at Northwest Stadium.

                "content": "Baker Reagan Mayfield (born April 14, 1995)[1] is an American professional football quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). After beginning his college football career with the Texas Tech Red Raiders, Mayfield played for the Oklahoma Sooners, where he was the first walk-on player to win the Heisman Trophy in 2017.[2][3][4][5] He was selected first overall by the Cleveland Browns in the 2018 NFL draft. Mayfield set the NFL rookie quarterback record for passing touchdowns during his first season, along with ending a 19-game winless streak for the Browns in his debut. His most successful season with the franchise was in 2020 when he led the Browns to their first playoff appearance since 2002 and first playoff victory since 1994. Due to a performance decline and conflict with Browns management, Mayfield was traded from Cleveland in 2022, spending the year with the Carolina Panthers and Los Angeles Rams. Mayfield joined the Buccaneers ahead of the 2023 season, leading the team to a division title and a playoff victory and earning Pro Bowl honors. Baker Reagan Mayfield was born on April 14, 1995, in Austin, Texas, to James and Gina Mayfield as the younger of two sons.[1][6] James, a private equity consultant, encountered financial difficulties during his younger son's senior year in high school. These struggles forced the Mayfields to sell their home and live in rental homes.[6] Mayfield was given his distinctive name, Baker, which was his mother's idea, under the condition by his father that he also be named after the 40th U.S. President Ronald Reagan, which became his middle name.[7] Mayfield grew up as a fan of the University of Oklahoma; he attended a number of their games during his childhood.[4] His father played football for three years for the University of Houston, though he never lettered.[6] Mayfield was the starting quarterback for the Lake Travis High School Cavaliers football team in Austin.[8] He led Lake Travis to a 25–2 record in two seasons and won the 2011 4A State Championship.[8] He finished his high school football career totaling 6,255 passing yards, 67 touchdowns, and eight interceptions.[1] He was offered scholarships by Washington State, Rice, New Mexico and Florida Atlantic.[9] Mayfield said \"I easily could've gone to a place like Florida Atlantic, but my dad pushed me to realize that my dream was to play somewhere big.\" He chose to go to Texas Tech, where he was a walk-on.[10] Sources: Shortly before the start of the 2013 season, Mayfield was named as the starting quarterback following a back injury to projected starter and former Lake Travis quarterback Michael Brewer.[11] Mayfield was the first walk-on true freshman quarterback to start an FBS season opener at the quarterback position.[6] In his first start against SMU, Mayfield passed for 413 yards and four touchdowns. His 43 completions of 60 attempts broke a school record held by Billy Joe Tolliver, and fell only four completions short of the NCAA Division I FBS single-game record for completions by a freshman, held by Luke McCown.[12][13] For his performance, Mayfield was named Big 12 Conference Offensive Player of the Week – the first freshman Texas Tech quarterback to be named so since former Red Raider head coach Kliff Kingsbury in 1999.[14] The game featured the last four former Lake Travis quarterbacks combined on both teams: Garrett Gilbert, Michael Brewer, Collin Lagasse, and Mayfield.[15] Following the Red Raiders' second victory over Stephen F. Austin, Mayfield's 780 season yards and seven touchdowns already exceeded the 755 yards and six touchdowns accrued by Texas Tech's last true freshman quarterback, Aaron Keesee, in 10 games.[16] After being affected by a knee injury and losing the starting job to fellow true freshman Davis Webb, Mayfield finished the season with 2,315 yards on 218-of-340 completions with 12 touchdowns and 9 interceptions.[17] Mayfield was named one of 10 semifinalists for the Burlsworth Trophy in November; the award is given to the best player in Division I football who began his college career as a walk-on.[18] Mayfield earned Big 12 Conference Freshman Offensive Player of the Year for the 2013 season.[19][20] Mayfield announced that he would be leaving the program due to a \"miscommunication\" with the coaching staff.[21][better source needed] After playing for Texas Tech, Mayfield transferred to the University of Oklahoma in January 2014, but had not contacted the Sooners coaching staff. Mayfield further elaborated in an interview with ESPN that he sought to transfer due to scholarship issues and a perception that he had earned the starting position and that further competition was not \"really fair\".[3][21] The alleged scholarship issues were denied by Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury.[22] In February 2014, Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops confirmed that Mayfield would be walking on for the Oklahoma Sooners. Mayfield was not eligible to play until the 2015 season, and he lost a season of eligibility due to Big 12 Conference transfer rules following an unsuccessful appeal of his transfer restrictions.[23] On August 24, 2015, Mayfield was named the starting quarterback for the Sooners after winning an open quarterback competition against Trevor Knight.[24] On September 6, 2015, Mayfield started against Akron. Mayfield totaled 388 passing yards with three passing touchdowns on 23 completions in the 41–3 win.[25] In the second game of the 2015 season, Mayfield started at Tennessee at Neyland Stadium. The Sooners were ranked 19th at the time and the Volunteers were ranked 23rd. Mayfield started off very slow in the game, not even reaching midfield until the 13-minute mark of the fourth quarter. Oklahoma came back from a 17-point deficit to win the game by a score of 31–24 in double overtime. Mayfield threw for 187 yards and three touchdowns on 19 completions while throwing two interceptions early in the game.[26] In the third game of the season, Mayfield started against Tulsa. He had a career day, throwing for 487 yards and four touchdowns, including 316 yards in the first half. Mayfield also ran for 85 yards and two touchdowns in the 52–38 win.[27][28] Mayfield finished the year with 3,700 passing yards, 36 touchdowns, and seven interceptions, a résumé which propelled him to fourth place in voting for the Heisman Trophy.[29] Mayfield helped lead Oklahoma to the 2015 Orange Bowl, which served as the semifinal for the 2015 College Football Playoff. However, Oklahoma lost to Clemson by a score of 37–17.[30] Mayfield started off the 2016 season with 323 passing yards and two touchdowns in a 33–23 loss to #15 Houston.[31] In the rivalry game against Texas on October 8, he had 390 passing yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 45–40 victory.[32] On October 22, in a 66–59 victory over Texas Tech, Mayfield had 545 passing yards and seven touchdowns in a historic matchup against future NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Mahomes tallied 734 passing yards and five touchdowns to go along with Mayfield's numbers in a game that broke various single-game passing records.[33] Over the final five games of the regular season, Mayfield totaled 1,321 passing yards, 15 passing touchdowns, and three interceptions, to go along with three rushing touchdowns. All five games were victories for the Sooners.[34] In December 2016, it was announced that Mayfield and his top receiving target, Dede Westbrook, would be finalists for the 2016 Heisman Trophy. It was also announced that they would play in the 2017 Sugar Bowl.[35] Mayfield ended up finishing third in the Heisman voting.[36] In the 2017 Sugar Bowl, Mayfield helped lead the Sooners to a 35–19 victory over Auburn. He finished the game with 19 completions on 28 attempts for 296 passing yards and two touchdowns, earning him the MVP award.[37] On September 9, 2017, after a win against the Ohio State Buckeyes in Columbus, Mayfield planted the Sooners' flag in the middle of the painted \"O\" at Ohio Stadium, causing a major public backlash.[38][39] Mayfield issued an apology shortly afterwards.[39] On November 4, 2017, Mayfield threw for a school-high 598 yards against in-state rival Oklahoma State.[40] Mayfield finished 24-for-36 with five passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown, and Oklahoma won the game by a score of 62–52.[41][42] Mayfield completed his career 3–0 as the starting Oklahoma quarterback in the Bedlam Series.[41] In November 2017, Mayfield was under fire again after an interaction during the game against Kansas. After Kansas players refused to shake his hand pregame, and following a cheap shot by a Kansas defender, Mayfield was seen grabbing his crotch and mouthing \"Fuck you!\" at the Kansas coach on the sideline, and told the fans to \"Go cheer on basketball.\"[43] In response, Mayfield issued another public apology.[44] Days after the 41–3 victory over Kansas, Sooners head coach Lincoln Riley announced that Mayfield would not start or be the captain during the upcoming game against West Virginia due to his actions against Kansas.[45] On December 2, 2017, with the return of the Big 12 Championship Game after a six-year hiatus,[46] Mayfield led Oklahoma to its third straight Big 12 championship, with Oklahoma beating the TCU Horned Frogs 41–17.[47][48] Mayfield won MVP honors while Oklahoma clinched a second playoff berth in three years.[47] A month later, the Sooners lost to the Georgia Bulldogs 54–48 in the 2018 Rose Bowl, which served as the national semifinal game.[49] On December 9, 2017, Mayfield won the 2017 Heisman Trophy with a sweeping majority.[50] He received 732 first-place votes and a total of 2,398 points.[51] This amount translated to 86% of the possible points and the third highest percentage in Heisman history.[50] In addition, Mayfield became the first and only walk-on player to ever win the Heisman Trophy.[51] When Mayfield transferred from Texas Tech to Oklahoma after his freshman year, he filed an appeal to the NCAA to allow him to be eligible to play immediately at Oklahoma on the basis that he was a walk-on and not a scholarship player at Texas Tech; therefore, the transfer rules that apply to scholarship players should not be applicable to his situation. The NCAA denied his appeal as he did not meet the criteria. Big 12 Conference rules additionally stipulate that intra-conference transfers will lose one year of eligibility over and beyond the one-year sit-out imposed by the NCAA.[52] Mayfield attempted to appeal his initial loss of eligibility to the Big 12 Conference faculty athletics representatives but was denied in September 2014.[53] Officials from Oklahoma asked Texas Tech officials to authorize Mayfield's immediate eligibility, but Texas Tech officials objected and declined the request before granting a release in July 2014.[54] Mayfield was thus forced to sit out the 2014 season, while also losing one year of eligibility, as required by the rules.[55][56] On June 1, 2016, the Big 12 faculty athletic representatives voted against a rule proposal that would have allowed walk-on players to transfer within the conference and not lose a year of eligibility. The next day, the rule proposal was amended to allow walk-on players, without a written scholarship offer from the school they are transferring from, to transfer within the conference without losing a season of eligibility. The faculty athletic representatives approved the amended proposal with a vote of 7–3. The rule change made Mayfield eligible to play for Oklahoma through the 2017 season. Texas Tech voted in favor of the rule.[57][58] The Cleveland Browns selected Mayfield with the first overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft.[61] Mayfield signed a four-year rookie contract with the Browns on July 24, 2018, with the deal worth $32.68 million in guaranteed salary.[62] Mayfield played in his first NFL game in Week 3 against the New York Jets, replacing an injured Tyrod Taylor with the Browns down 14–0. Mayfield went 17 of 23, passing for 201 yards as the Browns came back and prevailed 21–17, ending their winless streak at 19 games.[63] Mayfield became the first player since Fran Tarkenton in 1961 to come off the bench in his debut, throw for more than 200 yards, and lead his team to its first win of the season.[64] Mayfield started for the first time in the Browns' next game, making him the 30th starting quarterback for the Browns since their return to the NFL in 1999,[65] in a 45–42 overtime loss to the Oakland Raiders.[66] In Week 5, Mayfield threw for 342 passing yards and one touchdown as he earned his first victory as a Browns starter, in a 12–9 overtime win over the Baltimore Ravens.[67] In Week 10, Mayfield led the Browns to a 28–16 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. throwing for 216 yards, three touchdowns, and a passer rating of 151.2, with no turnovers.[68] The following week, Mayfield led the Browns to their first away win since 2015, against the Cincinnati Bengals. He completed 19 of 26 passes for 258 yards and four touchdowns.[69] In Week 12, in a 29–13 loss to the Houston Texans, Mayfield passed for 397 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions.[70] Mayfield bounced back in the following game, a 26–20 victory over the Carolina Panthers, going 18 of 22 for 238 passing yards and one touchdown.[71] In Week 16, Mayfield completed 27 of 37 passes for 284 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions in a 26–18 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, earning him American Football Conference (AFC) Offensive Player of the Week.[72] He also won the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week fan vote for the sixth time.[73] On December 29, Mayfield was fined $10,026 for unsportsmanlike conduct during the game. As reported by The Plain Dealer, Mayfield \"pretended to expose his private parts\" to Browns offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens after throwing a touchdown to tight end Darren Fells. Kitchens later defended the gesture as an inside joke between the two. Mayfield's agent Tom Mills said they would appeal the fine.[74] On December 30, in the regular-season finale against the Ravens' league-best defense and fellow rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson, Mayfield threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns, but his three costly interceptions — one of which came at the hands of linebacker C. J. Mosley with 1:02 left in the fourth quarter while attempting to drive the team into range of a game-winning field goal attempt — ultimately contributed to a 26–24 loss. Nonetheless, Mayfield helped lead the Browns to finish the season at 7–8–1, their best record since 2007.[75] He finished with 3,725 passing yards, and surpassed Peyton Manning and Russell Wilson for most touchdowns thrown in a rookie season with 27.[76][77] While Mayfield was considered by many to be the favorite for Offensive Rookie of the Year for 2018, the award was won by Giants running back Saquon Barkley.[78] On the annual Top 100 Players list for 2019, Mayfield's peers named him the 50th best player in the league, one spot behind teammate Myles Garrett.[79] He was named 2018 PFWA All-Rookie, the second Cleveland quarterback to receive this honor since Tim Couch in 1999.[80] In Week 1 against the Tennessee Titans, Mayfield threw for 285 yards and a touchdown. However, he also threw three fourth-quarter interceptions, one of which was returned by Malcolm Butler for a touchdown. The Browns lost 43–13.[81] After the blowout loss, Mayfield said, \"I just think everybody just needs to be more disciplined. I think everybody knows what the problem is. We'll see if it's just bad technique or just see what it is. Dumb penalties hurting ourself and then penalties on my part. Just dumb stuff.\"[82] In Week 2 against the Jets, Mayfield finished with 325 passing yards, including a quick-attack pass to Beckham that went 89 yards for a touchdown, as the Browns won 23–3.[83] In Week 4 against the Ravens, Mayfield threw for 342 yards, one touchdown, and one interception in the 40–25 win.[84] Against the San Francisco 49ers, Mayfield struggled against a stout 49ers defense, completing just 8-of-22 passes for 100 yards with two interceptions as the Browns were routed 31–3.[85] Mayfield threw two touchdown passes in a game for the first time that year in a Week 10 victory against the Buffalo Bills, completing 26 of 38 passes for 238 yards with two TDs, including the game-winner to Rashard Higgins, as the Browns snapped a four-game losing streak with a 19–16 win.[86] Four days later, against the Pittsburgh Steelers and former Big 12 Conference rival Mason Rudolph, Mayfield recorded his first career win against Pittsburgh, accounting for three total touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing), as Cleveland won 21–7.[87] In Week 12 against the Miami Dolphins, Mayfield threw for 327 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in the 41–24 victory.[88] In Week 17 against the Bengals, Mayfield became the first Cleveland Browns QB to start all 16 games in a season since Tim Couch in 2001.[89] In the game, Mayfield threw for 279 yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions as the Browns lost 33–23.[90] Mayfield finished the 2019 season with 3,827 passing yards, 22 touchdowns, and 21 interceptions as the Browns finished with a 6–10 record.[91] In Week 1 against the Ravens, Mayfield threw for 189 passing yards, a touchdown and an interception in a 38–6 loss. He bounced back in Week Two, against the Bengals, finishing with 218 passing yards, two touchdowns and an interception in the Browns' 35–30 win.[92] In Week 6 against the Steelers, Mayfield completed 10 of 18 passes for 119 yards, with one touchdown, two interceptions and took four sacks during the 38–7 loss.[93] Mayfield was replaced by Case Keenum in the third quarter due to aggravation of a minor rib injury he suffered in the previous week's game.[94][95] In Week 7, against the Cincinnati Bengals, Mayfield struggled early, as the only one of his first five pass attempts which was caught was an interception, but later completed 22 of 23 passes for 297 yards and a career-high five touchdowns – the last one to Donovan Peoples-Jones with 11 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter – leading the Browns to a stunning 37–34 comeback victory.[96][97] Mayfield was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance in Week 7.[98] Mayfield was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list on November 8 after being in close contact with a person who tested positive for the virus,[99][100] and was activated three days later.[101] In Week 13 against the Titans, Mayfield completed 25 of 33 passes for 334 yards. His four touchdown passes all came in the first half, as the Browns defeated the Titans by a score of 41–35.[102] Mayfield's four first-half TDs tied Otto Graham for a franchise record. Mayfield came close to throwing six first-half TDs, as Peoples-Jones dropped a would-be touchdown, leading to a field goal, and running back Nick Chubb wrapped up the scoring with a one-yard run near the end of the first half after Mayfield completed a 17-yard pass play to Rashard Higgins, setting up Chubb for the score. The Browns scored on all six of their first half possessions.[103] The victory gave the Browns a 9–3 record, clinching the Browns' first winning season since 2007.[103] Mayfield was named the FedEx Air player of the week for Week 13.[104][105] In Week 14 against the Ravens, Mayfield threw for 343 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception as well as rushing for 23 yards and a touchdown during the 47–42 loss.[106] In Week 16 against the Jets, Mayfield lost a fumble on fourth down with 1:25 remaining in the game while attempting a quarterback sneak during the 23–16 loss.[107] In Week 17, Mayfield and the Browns defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 24–22 and earned their first playoff berth since 2002, at which time Mayfield was seven years old. The Browns finished the 2020 regular season 11–5.[108] In the Wild Card Round against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Mayfield went 21 of 34 for 263 yards and 3 touchdowns during the 48–37 win, leading the Browns to their first playoff victory since the 1994 season, the year before Mayfield was born. It was also the Browns' first playoff road victory in 51 years, way back in 1969.[109] In the Divisional Round of the playoffs against the Kansas City Chiefs, Mayfield threw for 204 yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 interception during the 22–17 loss.[110] Overall, Mayfield finished the 2020 season with 4,030 passing yards, 30 touchdowns, and nine interceptions through 18 total games.[111] He was ranked 71st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.[112] The Browns exercised Mayfield's fifth-year contract option for the 2022 season on April 23, 2021,[113] worth $18.9 million guaranteed.[114] On October 7, 2021, it was revealed that Mayfield was playing with a partially torn labrum which he suffered during the Browns' Week 2 victory over the Texans.[115] Mayfield continued to play with the injury until reaggravating it in Week 6 against the Arizona Cardinals. Due to the injury, Mayfield was ruled out for the Browns' Week 7 game against the Denver Broncos, missing his first game since taking over as the Browns' starter in 2018.[116] On November 14, 2021, Mayfield suffered a right knee contusion during their crushing Week 10 loss to the New England Patriots. While the injury was not severe, coach Kevin Stefanski decided not to put him in for the rest of the game due to Mayfield absorbing hits and the game being out of reach.[117] After the Browns were eliminated from the postseason following a Week 17 loss to the Steelers, the Browns announced Mayfield would undergo surgery on the torn labrum, ending Mayfield's season.[118] He was placed on injured reserve on January 5, 2022.[119] Mayfield threw for 3,010 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions in 14 games played.[120] In the 2022 offseason, after the Browns traded for quarterback Deshaun Watson and signed him to a contract extension, Mayfield requested that the team trade him.[121] On July 6, 2022, Mayfield was traded to the Panthers for a 2024 conditional fifth-round draft pick. The fifth-round pick would become a fourth-round pick if Mayfield played in 70% of the Panthers' offensive snaps, but it did not happen.[122][123] Mayfield competed against Sam Darnold for the starting position with the team.[124] On August 22, 2022, Mayfield was named the Week 1 starter for the Panthers for their game against the Browns.[125] Against the Browns, Mayfield threw for 235 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in the 26–24 loss despite a late rally.[126] Mayfield suffered a high-ankle sprain in the Panthers Week 5 loss to the 49ers, which made him miss the next week against the Los Angeles Rams.[127] Mayfield returned and backed up P. J. Walker starting in Week 8. In the Week 9 game against the Bengals, the Panthers were trailing 35–0 at halftime behind a disastrous start by QB PJ Walker. Interim Head Coach Steve Wilks inserted Mayfield for the second half, in which he threw for 155 yards and two touchdowns in the 42–21 loss.[128] Coach Wilks announced that he would return to Walker as his starting quarterback for Week 10.[129] With a 1–5 record, Mayfield later requested his release from the Panthers, which was granted on December 5, 2022.[130] On December 6, 2022, Mayfield was claimed off waivers by the Rams after starting quarterback Matthew Stafford sustained a spinal cord injury on December 2.[131] The Rams inherited the remaining $1.35 million on his contract.[132] With only two days for Mayfield to learn the playbook after he was claimed, the Rams started John Wolford at quarterback for their game against the Las Vegas Raiders. Rams' head coach Sean McVay benched Wolford after the first offensive series, though, and inserted Mayfield. The Rams were trailing 16–3 in the fourth quarter, seemingly headed for their seventh consecutive loss, when Mayfield led them on a comeback. With 1:45 remaining in the game, still down by 6 points, and with no timeouts left to use, the Rams' offense took the field at their own two-yard line. Mayfield then led the Rams to a game-winning 98-yard drive, which became the longest touchdown drive of his career.[133][134] Mayfield completed 22 of 35 passes for 230 yards without an interception in the game and was named the National Football Conference Offensive Player of the Week.[135] In a Week 15 Monday Night Football matchup against the Green Bay Packers, Mayfield threw his 100th career passing touchdown.[136] In a Week 16 matchup against the Broncos, Mayfield led the Rams to a dominant 51–14 win while completing 24 of 28 pass attempts for 230 yards and throwing for two touchdowns.[137] Mayfield would later credit his five-game stint with the Rams for rejuvenating his career following the disappointment of his time with Carolina. “It brought the fun back. When I’m having fun, talking trash, and enjoying it, like that’s when I’m my best. Yeah, I needed that,” Mayfield said.[138] On March 15, 2023, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed Mayfield to a one-year, $4.00 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $2.87 million.[139] Mayfield was brought in to compete against Kyle Trask and John Wolford to determine who would be the successor at starting quarterback to Tom Brady after he retired after the 2022 NFL season.[140] In Week 1 against the Minnesota Vikings, Mayfield went 3 for 11 to start the game, but soon thereafter threw a touchdown to end the first half. After that, Mayfield went 18/23 for 110 yards and a touchdown for the rest of the game, including a crucial scramble for a first down to secure a 20–17 victory.[141] In Week 2 against the Chicago Bears, Mayfield went 26 for 34 for 317 yards and one touchdown in a 27–17 win. His 76% completion percentage for this game narrowly marked the best completion rate of his career at that point, in any of 33 games with 33+ pass attempts. Before that, his 75.8% completion rate on December 6, 2020, in a win against the Titans while on the Browns, had been his highest completion rate. This was also the first time in his career that Mayfield had started 2–0.[142] In Week 3 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Mayfield went 15/25 for 146 yards, with one touchdown and one interception, his first turnover of the season. He had one rush for 2 yards and fumbled once, which was recovered by Tampa Bay. Mayfield was also sacked twice.[143] In Week 15 against the Packers, Mayfield posted a perfect passer rating, completing 22 of 28 passes for 381 yards and four touchdowns in a 34–20 win.[144] He was the first opposing quarterback to ever have a perfect passer rating at Lambeau Field.[145] He was named the National Football Conference (NFC) Offensive Player of the Week for this performance.[146] In Week 18 against the Panthers, Mayfield led the Buccaneers to a 9–0 victory, clinching the Buccaneers' third straight NFC South title.[147] Mayfield concluded the season with 28 touchdown passes, 4,044 passing yards and a 64.3% completion rate, all career highs.[148] He earned his first Pro Bowl nomination.[149] In the Wild Card Round game against the Eagles, Mayfield completed 22 of 36 passes, for 337 yards, with three touchdowns and no interceptions. He led the Buccaneers to a 32–9 win over the defending NFC champions.[150] In the Divisional round against the Detroit Lions, Mayfield completed 26 of 41 passes for 349 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. The second interception proved costly as it allowed the Lions to run out the clock as the Buccaneers lost, 31–23.[151] On March 10, 2024, Mayfield signed a three-year contract extension with the Buccaneers, worth up to $100 million, with $50 million guaranteed.[152] In Week 1, Mayfield went 24-of-30 for 289 yards and four touchdowns in a 37–20 win over the Commanders.[153] In a rematch of last season's Divisional round playoff game, Mayfield completed 12 passes for 185 yards and ran for a go-ahead touchdown as the Buccaneers beat the Lions 20–16.[154] After a poor performance against the Denver Broncos, Mayfield rebounded the following week against the Eagles, throwing for 347 yards and accounting for three touchdowns as Tampa improved to 3–1.[155] In Week 5 against the Falcons, Mayfield threw three touchdown passes in the first half, but a lack of efficiency on offense in the second half cost the Buccaneers as they lost in overtime.[156] In Week 6, Mayfield threw for 325 yards, four touchdown passes, and overcame three interceptions in the second quarter to win 51–27 against the Saints, leading the offense to a franchise record 594 yards.[157] In a 41–31 loss to the Baltimore Ravens in Week 7, Mayfield threw for 370 yards and three touchdowns, but he threw a pair of costly interceptions in the first half and lost receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, the latter of whom ruled out for the season.[158] Without his top receivers, Mayfield still completed a career-high 37 passes the following week against the Falcons.[159] He finished with over 300 yards and three touchdowns for the third straight game but threw two interceptions inside the Falcons' 10-yard line as the Buccaneers lost 31–26.[160] Mayfield cut down on his interception miscues and led last-minute game-tying drives against the Chiefs and 49ers, but the Buccaneers lost both games, dropping to 4–6 heading to their bye week.[161] With the return of Mike Evans, Mayfield was efficient against the Giants, completing 24 of 30 passes for 294 yards, no interceptions, and a rushing touchdown as the Bucs won 30–7, snapping their four-game skid.[162] Against the Panthers in Week 13, Mayfield rallied from an Achilles injury and a poor first half to lead Tampa to a game-winning field goal drive in overtime.[163] Mayfield's play continued to improve with three touchdowns in a win over the Las Vegas Raiders, followed by a near-flawless performance against the league's top-ranked Los Angeles Chargers defense, completing 22-of-27 passes for 288 yards and four touchdowns in a 40–17 victory.[164] On February 25, 2017, Mayfield was arrested in Washington County, Arkansas on charges of public intoxication, disorderly conduct, and fleeing and resisting arrest.[174] At 2:29 a.m. that Saturday, a police officer was flagged down on an assault and battery report. The person who flagged the officer was yelling at Mayfield. The preliminary police report described Mayfield as unable to walk straight, having slurred speech and food covering the front of his shirt. When he was asked to stay so the police could get a statement, Mayfield began shouting obscenities and \"causing a scene\". Mayfield was booked at 8:21 a.m. local time on the misdemeanor charges. He had a court date on April 7 for the public intoxication charge, and pleaded not guilty to all charges.[175] On June 15, 2017, the University of Oklahoma ordered Mayfield to undergo 35 hours of community service along with completing an alcohol education program.[176] In July 2019, Mayfield married Emily Wilkinson.[177] In December 2023, the pair announced they were expecting their first child, a girl, who was born in April 2024.[178][179] During his tenure with the Browns, Mayfield starred in a continuing series of ads for Progressive Insurance. The ads showed him living \"at home\" in FirstEnergy Stadium with his wife and performing household chores like mowing the lawn and holding a yard sale.[180]",

                "content": "By Ignacio Cairola Updated on November 21, 2024 12:10AM EDT Updated on November 21, 2024 12:10AM EDT By Ignacio Cairola The Tampa Bay Buccaneers‘ current situation requires statements from notable figures to boost the morale of a team that is on a four-game losing streak and has a 4-6 record. Quarterback Baker Mayfield enters the midway point of the 2024 NFL season hoping to improve the Bucs’ present through quality performances. Mayfield has contributed touchdowns in each of the Buccaneers‘ 10 games this season and has been vital to the team. The 29-year-old quarterback seems to have found his place in the world in his second campaign with Tampa Bay. As each game passes, the former Cleveland Browns player is gaining more recognition. The former Super Bowl champion quarterback with the Buccaneers who sent a message to Mayfield is none other than Brad Johnson, who praised the work of the Bucs’ current starting QB: “He’s got all the skills, he was the first pick in the draft and he’s been through adversity. He’s had to go through a couple of different teams and now he’s found his home. He produces and gets the most out of the players around him,” Johnson stated clearly about Mayfield during an interview with WDAE in Tampa Bay. Johnson sees Mayfield as a player who can lead the Buccaneers to another Super Bowl. In recent days, franchise notables such as Tom Brady have talked about the current starting quarterback as someone who can ensure quality performances for Tampa Bay. Baker Mayfield, quarterback of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Johnson played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2001 to 2004. During his time with the Bucs, he was the starting quarterback and a key player in the team’s 48-21 victory over the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003. see also Top 15 NFL quarterbacks with the most Super Bowl rings: The greatest legends Although the Bucs are not on a hot streak, Mayfield’s season so far has been outstanding. In 10 games played, he records 24 touchdowns, just four fewer than in all of last year’s campaign. In addition, the 29-year-old quarterback has completed 243 passes for 2505 yards and nine interceptions. Ignacio Cairola is a bilingual sports journalist and writer fluent in English and Spanish.

                "content": "Paul Andrew Lock (born November 10, 1996) is an American professional football quarterback for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Missouri Tigers and was selected by the Denver Broncos in the second round of the 2019 NFL draft. He has also played for the Seattle Seahawks. Lock attended Lee's Summit High School in Lee's Summit, Missouri.[1] As a junior, he passed for 3,060 yards and 35 touchdowns. As a senior in 2014, he was the Kansas City Star's All-Metro Player of the Year after passing for 2,731 yards and 28 touchdowns.[2] Lock was rated by Rivals as a four-star recruit and was ranked as the sixth-best pro-style quarterback in the 2015 class.[3] He committed to the University of Missouri to play college football.[4] He was considered a two-star basketball prospect as a shooting guard, but he retired from basketball after high school.[5] Lock began his collegiate career by going 6-for-10 for 138 yards and a touchdown in the 2015 season-opener against Southeast Missouri State while coming off the bench for two series.[6] He took over as Mizzou's starting quarterback over the final eight games of 2015.[7] In a 24–10 win over South Carolina, he became the school's first true freshman to start at quarterback since Corby Jones in 1995,[8] going 21-for-28 for 136 yards and a pair of touchdowns.[9] Against BYU at Arrowhead Stadium, Lock was 19-of-28 for a career-best 244 yards and a touchdown while also setting career highs in both passer rating and passing yards while posting his second-best completion percentage of the season.[10] He finished the season 129-of-263 for 1,332 yards, four passing touchdowns, and eight interceptions to go along with a rushing touchdown.[7] In Missouri's second game of the 2016 season, Lock completed 24-for-37 for a career-high 450 yards while tying a school record with five touchdowns against Eastern Michigan in Mizzou's home opener.[11][12] He tossed for three more touchdowns on 23-of-38 passing in Missouri's 28–27 loss to Georgia.[13] His passing total of 1,106 yards was more than any Mizzou quarterback in his first three games ever. He played only the first half against Delaware State, but put up huge numbers in the 79–0 win. In the first half alone, he completed 26 of 36 passes for 402 yards while matching the school record with five touchdowns.[14] He closed his season by sparking a second-half 17-point comeback with a 67-yard touchdown pass to Johnathon Johnson against Arkansas.[15] He finished that game going 16-for-26 with 268 yards and a score.[16] Lock finished the 2016 season with 3,399 passing yards, 23 passing touchdowns, and ten interceptions to go along with a rushing touchdown.[17] Lock finished the 2016 regular season ranked second in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in passing yards (3,399)[18] In the Tigers' 2017 season opener, Lock passed for 521 yards, seven touchdowns, and one interception in a victory over Missouri State.[19] On October 21, against Idaho, he had 467 passing yards, six touchdowns, and one interception to break a five-game losing streak for Missouri.[20] On November 24, on the road against Arkansas, he had 448 yards, five passing touchdowns, and two interceptions.[21] In the 2017 season, Lock led the NCAA (FBS) and set the SEC and Missouri record for passing touchdowns (44) while helping the Tigers reach a bowl game after starting the season 1–5.[22][23][24] He finished the season with 242-of-419 passing (57.8%) for 3,964 yards with 44 touchdowns and 13 interceptions (165.7 rtg.).[25] Lock was selected to the First-team All-SEC.[26] Lock helped lead Missouri to a 3–0 start with 11 passing touchdowns and one interception in the stretch against UT Martin, Wyoming, and Purdue.[27][28][29] On October 20, against Memphis, he passed for 350 yards and four touchdowns in the win.[30] Missouri closed out the regular season with a four-game winning streak against Florida, Vanderbilt, Tennessee, and Arkansas where Lock had nine passing touchdowns to two interceptions while having three rushing touchdowns. In the 2018 season, Lock had 3,498 passing yards, 28 passing touchdowns, and eight interceptions to go along with six rushing touchdowns.[31] He led the SEC in pass attempts and completions in the 2018 season.[32] Lock finished his college football career with a total of 108 (99 passing, 9 rushing) touchdowns.[33] Lock was selected by the Denver Broncos in the second round as the 42nd overall pick in the 2019 NFL draft.[36][37][38] Lock suffered a thumb injury in the preseason and was placed on injured reserve on September 1, 2019.[39] He was designated for return from injured reserve on November 12, 2019, and resumed practicing with the team. On November 30, 2019, the Broncos activated Lock off of injured reserve and named him the starter for their game the next day against the Los Angeles Chargers.[40] He threw for 134 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception, and he moved the Broncos down the field in the last 15 seconds (via a pass interference penalty on the Chargers' Casey Heyward Jr.) to set up a Brandon McManus 53-yard field goal as time expired, quarterbacking the Broncos to a 23–20 win, his first NFL victory.[41] During Week 14 against the Houston Texans, a game in which the Texans were favored by nine points, Lock threw three touchdowns in the first half and led another scoring drive to start the second half, giving his team a 38–3 lead. The Broncos eventually won the game 38–24, and Lock finished with 309 passing yards, three touchdowns, and an interception.[42] Lock started the remainder of the season. In five games, he finished with 1,020 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and three interceptions.[43] He went 4–1 as a starter in 2019 and in the process, tied with legendary Broncos quarterback John Elway for the most franchise wins by a rookie QB with four, only needing five games to accomplish the feat that Elway did not reach until his 10th game.[44] In Week 1 against the Tennessee Titans on Monday Night Football, Lock threw for 216 yards and a touchdown during the 16–14 loss.[45] In Week 2, he left the game early in the first quarter with a shoulder injury against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Without Lock the Broncos lost the game 26–21.[46] In Week 6, Lock returned from his injury against the New England Patriots. He had 189 yards passing and two interceptions, but the Broncos won the game 18–12 thanks to six Brandon McManus field goals.[47] With the win, Lock became the youngest quarterback ever to defeat the Patriots at Gillette Stadium under head coach Bill Belichick, as well as the second quarterback to do so while throwing multiple interceptions (Kurt Warner also accomplished the feat in 2001). In Week 8 against the Chargers, he had 248 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in a 31–30 comeback victory.[48] The third touchdown pass was a game-winning one-yard pass to K. J. Hamler with no time remaining.[49] In Week 9 against the Atlanta Falcons, Lock threw for 313 yards, two touchdown passes, an interception and rushed for 47 yards and another touchdown in the 34–27 loss.[50] In Week 10 against the Las Vegas Raiders, Lock had the worst passing performance of his career, throwing for 257 yards, one touchdown, and 4 interceptions in a 37–12 loss.[51] On November 28, 2020, Lock was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list after coming in close contact with Jeff Driskel, who tested positive for the virus.[52] Lock and the other three quarterbacks on the Broncos roster were fined by the team for violating COVID-19 protocols.[53] He was activated on December 1.[54] In Week 14, against the Carolina Panthers, he had 280 passing yards and four passing touchdowns in a 32–27 victory.[55] In Week 17 against the Raiders, Lock threw for 339 yards and 2 touchdowns in a 32–31 loss.[56] Lock finished the 2020 season with 16 touchdowns and 15 interceptions, tied for the most interceptions in the NFL with Carson Wentz, despite only playing in 13 games. His completion percentage of 57.3% was the lowest among the 35 quarterbacks with at least 150 passing attempts in 2020.[57][58] Lock spent the 2021 preseason in a competition with newly acquired quarterback Teddy Bridgewater. On August 25, Bridgewater was named the starter for week 1[59] ahead of Lock, after a close battle in the first and second preseason games. In Week 4, Lock played against the Baltimore Ravens after Bridgewater suffered a concussion. He completed 12-of-21 (57.1%) passes for a total of 113 yards and an interception, resulting in a 52.3 QB rating in the 23–7 loss.[60][61] In Week 12, Lock entered the game against the Chargers late in the first half after a leg injury temporarily sidelined Bridgewater. Lock completed 4-of-7 (57.1%) for a total of 26 yards and an interception, resulting in a QB rating of 25.6 in the 28–13 win.[62] Bridgewater reentered and finished the game in the second half.[63] In Week 15, Lock came in against the Cincinnati Bengals after Bridgewater left the game with a concussion. He completed 6-of-12 passes (50%) for 88 yards and a touchdown, and lost a fumble in the 15–10 loss.[64] In Week 16, Lock was the starter against the Raiders due to Bridgewater's injury.[65] Lock threw for 153 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions in the 17–13 loss.[66] Lock started for the remainder of the season after Bridgewater was placed on injured reserve.[67] Against the Kansas City Chiefs, Lock completed 12-of-24 passes for 162 yards, rushing for 35 yards and two touchdowns, becoming the first Broncos quarterback to rush for two touchdowns since Tim Tebow in 2011, in the 28–24 loss.[68] On March 16, 2022, Lock was traded to the Seattle Seahawks with two first-round picks, two second-round picks, a fifth-round pick, defensive lineman Shelby Harris, and tight end Noah Fant in exchange for quarterback Russell Wilson.[69] Upon arriving in Seattle, Lock changed his jersey number from #3, which he had worn in Denver and at Missouri, to #2, telling reporters he did so both out of respect for Wilson, who wore #3, and out of a desire to \"write my own story.\"[70] After Lock competed with Geno Smith for three preseason games, Smith was named the starter.[71] Lock never took the field during his first season in Seattle, as Smith took every snap.[72] Lock re-signed with the Seahawks on March 20, 2023.[73] In Week 4, against the New York Giants, Lock came in mid-game for an injured Smith. He led the Seahawks on a 75-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown and was replaced later in the game by Smith.[74] In Week 11, against rival Los Angeles Rams on November 19, 2023, at SoFi Stadium, Lock again came in for Smith who had been momentarily sidelined with an elbow injury following a tackle by Rams’ linebacker Ernest Jones and defensive tackle Aaron Donald.[75][76] Lock played poorly, completing 2-of-6 passes, including a critical interception to Rams' cornerback Derion Kendrick, which ultimately lost the game for the Seahawks.[77][78][79] In Week 14, against the San Francisco 49ers, Lock had his first start since being traded to Seattle, due to Smith suffering a groin injury. He completed 22-of-31 for 269 yards, with two touchdowns and two interceptions, in a 16–28 loss.[80] Although Smith was active for the Week 15 game against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had not recovered enough to start, making Lock the starter again.[80] With the Seahawks down 13–17 and 1:52 left in the game, Lock led a 92-yard touchdown drive, concluding with a 29-yard touchdown throw to Jaxon Smith-Njigba with 0:28 left. The Seahawks won 20–17.[81] Lock finished the season with three touchdowns and three interceptions for a total QBR of 44.9.[82] On 14 March, Lock signed with the New York Giants on a one-year deal worth $5 million.[83] Once thought to be competing with Daniel Jones for the starting quarterback job, Lock asserted that he was brought in to be a backup.[84] Lock was named the starter for the Giants' Week 13 Thanksgiving matchup against the Dallas Cowboys, following the release of Jones and an injury to Tommy DeVito.[85] He threw a career-high equalling four touchdown passes in the Giants' week 17 win over the Indianapolis Colts on 28 December.[86] Lock married model and influencer Natalie Newman in April 2023.[87]",

                "content": "NFL Quarterback Drew Lock is in the frame to start for the New York Giants this evening, with Tommy DeVito a major doubt for the team’s Thanksgiving clash with the Dallas Cowboys. The Giants have listed DeVito as ‘questionable’ for the Week 13 match-up, after the 26-year-old suffered an arm injury in last Sunday’s defeat to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. ESPN’s Jordan Raanan has reported that DeVito is a “long shot” to play against the Cowboys at AT&T Stadium, where the 2-9 Giants will bid to end a six-game losing streak. DeVito was himself only promoted to starting QB last weekend, in the wake of Daniel Jones’ departure from the franchise. Speaking to reporters ahead of the Giants’ trip to Texas, Lock said he’s always primed to step into Brian Daboll’s team. “It’s just typical of the job right?” the 28-year-old said. “You’ve always got to be ready, no matter what the week, whatever the situation is. You’re just planning like you’re going to go out there and play. My mindset didn’t change this week.\" Signed by the Giants in March, Lock is in line to make his first start for the franchise, and only his third start in the last three seasons. A second-round Draft pick for the Denver Broncos in 2019, the former Missouri Tigers star has made 23 career starts in his six-year NFL career, 21 of which came across his three seasons with the Broncos. He then made two starts for the Seattle Seahawks in 2023, before signing a one-year deal with the Giants. Currently 9-14 as a starter in the NFL, Lock has thrown for 5,292 yards, 28 touchdowns and 23 interceptions in his total of 31 appearances in the US’s elite football league. He has an average passer rating of 79.1. Per sport finance experts Spotrac, Lock’s one-year Giants contract is worth $5 million, with $4.95 million guaranteed. On top of a $2 million signing bonus, he has a base salary of $2.95 million. The Week 13 clash between the Giants and the Cowboys kicks off today, Thursday November 28, at 4:30 p.m. ET/1:30 p.m. PT.

                "title": "Joe Flacco - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Joseph Vincent Flacco (born January 16, 1985) is an American professional football quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Pittsburgh Panthers and the Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens and was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round of the 2008 NFL draft. Flacco was Baltimore's starting quarterback from 2008 until midway through the 2018 season, helping lead the Ravens to the playoffs six times during his tenure in Baltimore. The Ravens won the AFC North twice, appeared in three AFC Championship Games, and won Super Bowl XLVII following the 2012 season. Flacco was named Super Bowl XLVII's MVP, concluding a postseason run in which he tied Joe Montana's single postseason record for touchdown passes (11) without an interception. That off-season, he signed a six-year contract worth $120.6 million, a record high for a quarterback at the time.[2] A decline in performance and a hip injury resulted in Flacco losing his starting position to Lamar Jackson; he was subsequently traded to the Denver Broncos in 2019. A neck injury cut his season short and he was waived by the Broncos with a failed physical designation. Flacco joined the Jets in 2020 as a backup to Sam Darnold. He then signed with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2021, but was traded back to the Jets after they lost Zach Wilson to injury. Flacco joined the Browns midway through the 2023 season following a season-ending injury to Deshaun Watson. He led Cleveland to a playoff berth and won the Comeback Player of the Year award. As of the 2023 NFL season, Flacco has the most career passing yards and touchdowns for any quarterback who has never been to a Pro Bowl (he was invited to the 2015 Pro Bowl following the 2014 season, but declined).[3] At the height of his career, Flacco was also known for having one of the strongest arms in the NFL.[4][5] Flacco was born on January 16, 1985, in Audubon, New Jersey, the eldest of five sons to Karen (née Madden) and Steve Flacco.[6] The Flacco family is originally from Haddon Township, New Jersey. Flacco played football, baseball, and basketball at Audubon High School and was the starting quarterback for the Green Wave.[7] Regarded as a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Flacco was listed as No. 39 among quarterback prospects in the class of 2003.[8] Flacco was redshirted as a freshman for the Pittsburgh Panthers football team that went 8–5 in 2003.[9] In 2004, Flacco was the backup quarterback behind starter Tyler Palko, who led the team to an 8–4 record.[10] He saw action in three games against Ohio University, University of Nebraska, and the University of South Florida.[11] Flacco threw only four passes and finished the season with one completion for 11 yards and a 25-yard punt.[12] Flacco transferred to the University of Delaware in 2005, but was not eligible to play that season.[13] He saw his first full-time action during the 2006 season, throwing for 2,783 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions.[14] The Fightin' Blue Hens ultimately struggled to a 5–6 record and failed to qualify for the FCS playoffs.[15] In the 2007 season, Flacco led his team to an 8–3 regular-season record while compiling 4,263 yards, 23 touchdowns and 5 interceptions.[14] Arguably his best game came against Navy where he threw for 434 yards and four touchdowns.[16] Flacco showed another solid performance in the first-ever meeting against the Delaware State Hornets in the first round of the playoffs. Behind Omar Cuff's record-setting day, Flacco threw efficiently for 189 yards and a touchdown, leading the Blue Hens to a 44–7 victory.[17] Flacco continued Delaware's playoff run by upsetting the Northern Iowa Panthers 39–27 in the FCS quarterfinals and upsetting the Southern Illinois Salukis 20–17 the next weekend in the semifinals. Flacco threw two touchdowns to win against both the Panthers and Salukis, but went on to lose in the FCS National Championship Game to the Appalachian State Mountaineers 49–21.[17] Flacco set 20 school records during his career at Delaware.[18] At Delaware, Flacco was pessimistic about his chances to play in the NFL, and after his junior year asked his coach for permission to play baseball. The coach predicted that he would be selected in the NFL draft, surprising Flacco.[21] With a solid showing at the Senior Bowl and NFL Combine, Flacco solidified himself as a top five quarterback in the 2008 NFL draft.[22] Flacco won the long distance throw competition in ESPN's State Farm College Football All-Star Challenge with a 74-yard throw, beating out Matt Ryan, Colt Brennan, Chad Henne, and John David Booty, later winning the Taco Bell Quarterback Scramble with a time of 15.72 seconds.[23] Members of the Baltimore Ravens' front office, having attended Flacco's workout at the Senior Bowl, were impressed by his ability to throw in rainy and windy conditions. Flacco again impressed the Ravens' personnel in the poor weather conditions of his workout at Delaware, despite their low expectations given Delaware's small-school pedigree—Flacco performed the workout on an uncut, unlined field with his own footballs. Ravens assistant general manager Eric DeCosta later stated the workouts left him confident Flacco could succeed in the late-season conditions in Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and Cincinnati.[24] Flacco was drafted by the Ravens in the first round as the 18th overall pick in the 2008 NFL draft after the team traded out of the eighth overall selection to the 26th, then up again.[25] The selection made Flacco the highest drafted player ever from the University of Delaware.[18] He was also the first Division I-FCS (formerly I-AA) quarterback selected in the first round of the draft since Steve McNair went third overall to the Houston Oilers in the 1995 NFL draft. Draft commentators initially criticized the pick as a \"reach\", feeling Flacco would likely have still been available in the middle of the second round. DeCosta, however, stated waiting was too much of a gamble and that choosing Flacco in the first round was \"an easy decision to make.\"[24] On July 16, 2008, he signed a five-year contract with a maximum value of around $30 million, and $8.75 million guaranteed.[26] Due to a season-ending injury to incumbent starter Kyle Boller and an illness to former Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith, Flacco became the starting quarterback in the 2008 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals. He completed 15 of 29 passes for 129 yards, his longest pass being a 15-yard play to Derrick Mason. He threw no touchdowns and no interceptions in his debut, but he had a 38-yard rushing touchdown,[27] which was the longest rushing touchdown by a quarterback in Ravens' franchise history at the time (the record has since been broken several times by Lamar Jackson). Flacco's touchdown put the Ravens up by 17–3; the team eventually won the game 17–10.[28] In his first season, Flacco was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week in Week 9, NFL Rookie of the week, the NFLPA Rookie of the week, and NFL Rookie of the Month for November. Flacco finished his rookie season 257/428 for 2,971 yards with a total of 16 touchdowns (14 passing, 2 rushing), and 14 turnovers (12 interceptions and 2 lost fumbles).[29][30] In the wild card round of the 2008–09 NFL playoffs, Flacco became only the third rookie quarterback in NFL history to win his first post-season start, and the first to do it on the road, when the Ravens defeated the Miami Dolphins, 27–9. Flacco completed 9-of-23 attempted passes, accumulating 135 yards without throwing a touchdown or interception. He also scored the victory-sealing rushing touchdown on a quarterback draw in the 4th quarter.[31] Shaun King, Ben Roethlisberger, Russell Wilson, Mark Sanchez, Brock Purdy and most recently C. J. Stroud are the only other rookie quarterbacks to ever win their debut playoff game. He then won his second game against the Tennessee Titans. Flacco led the Ravens to a 13–10 win in the divisional playoff round. Flacco made tight-window throws to Todd Heap and Mark Clayton on the go ahead scoring drive in the fourth quarter to set up a game-winning field goal from Matt Stover. On the day, Flacco was 11-of-22 for 148 yards and a touchdown, without turning the ball over for the second straight game. He became the first rookie quarterback to win two playoff games.[32] In the AFC Championship Game versus the Steelers, the Ravens lost 23-14, with Flacco throwing for 141 yards, being sacked three times and throwing three interceptions, one being the game clincher to Troy Polamalu, who returned the pass for a touchdown.[33] Flacco was named the Diet Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year in January 2009.[34] In the season opening game in Baltimore against the Kansas City Chiefs, Flacco led the Ravens to their first win of the season. He threw for 307 yards and three touchdowns, both career highs, along with 18 yards rushing. He also threw one interception and had a quarterback rating of 95.8.[35] During this game, the Ravens broke the franchise record for most offensive yards in a game with a total of 501. In Week 15 against the Chicago Bears, Flacco broke his personal record for most touchdowns thrown in a game with four, while throwing for 234 passing yards and completing 72 percent of his passes, earning him a career-high passer rating of 135.6. The Ravens would go on to win the game 31–7.[36] With 3,613 yards and 21 touchdowns, Flacco became the first Ravens quarterback since Vinny Testaverde to throw for more than 3,000 yards and 20 touchdowns in a single season.[37] He also tied his interception number from his rookie season of 12. An injury limited Flacco's performance on Wild Card Weekend against the New England Patriots. The Ravens routed the Patriots 33–14 despite Flacco throwing 4-of-10 for just 34 yards and one interception.[38] In the season opener, Flacco and the Ravens opened New Meadowlands Stadium against the New York Jets. Flacco threw for 248 yards while completing 52.6% of his passes, throwing one interception and losing a fumble. In a defensive contest, the Ravens came away with the 10–9 win over their former defensive coordinator Rex Ryan.[39] In a Week 2 10–15 loss against the Bengals, Flacco had arguably his worst NFL start of his young career, throwing for 154 yards while completing just 43.6% of his passes and throwing a career-high four interceptions, while throwing one touchdown and accumulating a passer rating of 23.8.[40] Coming off of the worst start of his career, Flacco and the Ravens had their home opener against the Cleveland Browns. Flacco bounced back from his Week 2 loss to the Bengals and had his best game of the young season, throwing for 262 yards and completing 71% of his passes. He then connected with prized offseason acquisition wide receiver Anquan Boldin for three touchdowns while throwing no interceptions and accumulating a passer rating of 128.7. The Ravens won the game 24–17.[41] On December 26, 2010, with a win against the Cleveland Browns, Flacco became one of only four NFL quarterbacks to lead his team to the playoffs in all three of his first three seasons. During this game, Flacco reached 10,000 career passing yards. Ending the season, Flacco set season highs in passing yards (3,622), passing touchdowns (25), passer rating (93.6), and a season low in interceptions (10), yet set a career-high with four lost fumbles.[42] In defeating the Chiefs (30–7) in the Wild Card Round of the 2010–11 NFL playoffs, Flacco completed 25 of 34 passes for 265 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions, for a post-season-high passer rating of 115.4.[43] With the win, Flacco became the first quarterback in NFL history to start and win a playoff game in each of his first three seasons, and tied Len Dawson, Roger Staubach, Jake Delhomme, and Mark Sanchez for most career post-season road wins by a quarterback.[44] In the Divisional Round, Flacco and the Ravens would once again head to Pittsburgh to play their arch-rival Steelers. The difference this time would be the season was on the line. The Ravens got out to an early 21–7 lead after a 12-yard rush by running back Ray Rice, a fumble recovery run back for a touchdown by defensive end Cory Redding, and a four-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to tight end Todd Heap. But in the third quarter, in which the Ravens had been dominant all through the regular season, Baltimore fell apart. The Ravens turned the ball over three times in their own territory with an uncharacteristic fumble by Rice, an interception by Flacco, and a fumbled snap by center Matt Birk (Flacco was credited with the lost fumble), and with those the Steelers took a 31–24 lead. But even after all of the Ravens miscues and errors, the Ravens still had a shot to tie it at the end when Flacco threw a dart to T.J. Houshmandzadeh on 4th and 18, but it was dropped. Flacco finished the game 16-of-30 for 125 yards, one touchdown, and one interception.[45] He was ranked 90th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.[46] Flacco had his best game of the season in Week 3 against the St. Louis Rams. He went 27-of-48 with a season-high 389 yards through the air and three touchdowns, all in the first quarter and to rookie wideout Torrey Smith (who actually finished the game with a five catch, 152-yard breakout performance). Flacco had a 103.6 rating, as well as 27 yards rushing and a lost fumble. The Ravens scored a season-high 37 points in the 30-point blowout victory, and also gained a franchise record 553 offensive yards.[47] Flacco had three more 300-yard games during the regular season: against the Houston Texans, Arizona Cardinals, and Steelers. He won all three of these games, sweeping Pittsburgh for the first time in his career, but also lost fumbles in each one. Despite losing to the San Diego Chargers in Week 15, the Ravens clinched the playoffs for the fourth straight year that week. The Ravens clinched their division, along with the number 2 seed in the AFC, in a Week 17 win over the rival Bengals. Flacco threw for 130 yards and a touchdown.[48][49] Flacco finished the season starting all 16 games. He had 312 completions on 542 attempts (57.6%). He threw for 3,610 yards, 20 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, and had one rushing score. He averaged 225.6 yards per game, was sacked 31 times over the course of the season and set a new career high with six lost fumbles. He finished the year with an 80.9 QB rating.[50] Flacco continued his playoff dominance that year. In the Divisional Round against the Houston Texans, he threw for 176 yards and two touchdowns, with no turnovers.[51] In the AFC Championship, Flacco completed 22 out of 36 passes for 306 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception. These stats were enough to outplay Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who threw for 67 fewer yards, two fewer touchdowns, and one more interception than Flacco. Despite Flacco's performance, the Patriots advanced to the Super Bowl when a potential game-tying field goal attempt by kicker Billy Cundiff was shanked wide left in the final minute of the game.[52] On the NFL Network's Top 100 Players of 2012 list, Flacco was ranked 74th by his fellow players.[53] Despite Flacco's success—the Ravens were in the playoffs each of his first four seasons[21]—few saw him as among the NFL's best quarterbacks. Before January 2015, he had never been selected for the Pro Bowl.[54] In April 2012, Flacco was, as The New York Times later stated, \"almost universally mocked\" when he stated that he was the best quarterback in the NFL, superior to Brady, Peyton Manning, or Aaron Rodgers. \"I don't think I'd be very successful at my job if I didn't feel that way\", Flacco said.[55] In July, he turned down the Ravens' offer of a new contract, reportedly for $16 million a year, telling his agent that he believed he could improve and earn more.[21] In the opening week, Flacco passed for 299 yards and two touchdowns in a 44–13 victory over the Bengals to earn his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor.[56][57] By Week 11, the Ravens had amassed a 9–2 record. Flacco played poorly, however, once again in a Week 12 rematch with the Steelers, completing only 16 of 34 passes for 188 yards with one touchdown and an interception. The game saw the Ravens squander a ten-point lead and lose 20–23, despite their division rival starting backup Charlie Batch at quarterback.[58] The following week against the Washington Redskins, Flacco went 16-of-21 with three touchdowns but again amassed less than 200 passing yards in the season's first back-to-back losses.[59] With the offense remaining inconsistent and the team missing opportunities to win their division with each loss, offensive coordinator Cam Cameron was unexpectedly fired and replaced by quarterbacks coach – and former Indianapolis Colts head coach – Jim Caldwell. The change at coordinator was followed by a lopsided loss to the Denver Broncos, leading to widespread criticism of Flacco in the media.[60] Flacco and the Ravens responded with a decisive 33–14 win over the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants in which Flacco threw for 309 yards and two touchdowns, with another rushing.[61] Despite the victory over New York, much of the local and national media wrote the team off as Super Bowl contenders,[62] with ESPN writing that the team had \"backed into the playoffs with a disastrous December.\"[63] On January 6, 2013, in the Wild Card round against the Indianapolis Colts, Flacco finished the game 12 of 23 for 282 yards, two touchdowns, and a career postseason high 125.6 passer rating.[64] The 24–9 win at home set up a Divisional round rematch with the Denver Broncos, who entered the game as nine-point favorites after their regular season win over the Ravens, which included a 98-yard interception touchdown return by Broncos' cornerback Chris Harris that marked the lowest point of Flacco's season.[65] Continuing his postseason success, Flacco played one of the best games in his career, throwing for 331 yards and 3 touchdowns. In the fourth quarter, the Ravens were down 35–28 and had one last chance to tie the game. After an incomplete pass and a 7-yard scramble, on 3rd down and 3, with the clock running and less than 45 seconds remaining in regulation with no timeouts, Flacco heaved a 70-yard touchdown pass to Jacoby Jones, sending the game into overtime. The pass has been called the \"Mile High Miracle\", and \"one of the greatest plays in NFL history\"[66] and drew comparisons to the \"Hail Mary\", \"Immaculate Reception\", and \"The Catch\".[67][68] The Ravens would go on to win the game in double overtime 38–35 after an interception by Corey Graham from Peyton Manning and a 47-yard field goal from rookie kicker Justin Tucker, sending the Ravens to face the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship for a second straight year.[67] On January 20, 2013, Flacco and the Ravens avenged the previous year's AFC Championship Game loss to the Patriots with a 28–13 win, securing their spot in the 2013 Super Bowl. Flacco threw for 240 yards and three touchdowns, notching his third straight game with a passer rating over 100.[69] With this win, Flacco became the second NFL quarterback to defeat both Peyton Manning (with the Broncos) and Tom Brady in the same postseason since both became starting quarterbacks in 2001 (the first to do so was Mark Sanchez in 2010). On February 3, 2013, the Ravens faced the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII. The 49ers were a 4-point favorite to win the game,[70] but Flacco completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Ravens to a 34–31 win. Flacco's three touchdowns in the game tied him for first place on the list of most consecutive playoff games with at least three touchdown passes (3 games). With a record fourth playoff game with a 100+ passer rating in a single postseason,[5] Flacco was named the game's Most Valuable Player[55] and was awarded a brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Corvette.[71] Flacco finished the postseason having completed 73-of-126 (57.9 percent) passes for 1,140 yards with 11 touchdowns and zero interceptions, tying Montana and Kurt Warner for the most touchdowns in a single postseason[72] and additionally tying Montana for the most touchdowns without an interception in a single postseason.[73] Flacco's 117.2 passer rating tied him for third place all-time with Steve Young in a Super Bowl-winning postseason.[73] These accomplishments gave Flacco what The New York Times stated, \"might be the best start to a player's free agency in the history of professional sports\", as his contract expired after the season.[55] He was ranked 19th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.[74] On March 4, 2013, Flacco became the highest-paid quarterback in NFL history when he signed a six-year contract worth $120.6 million.[2] However, within months, he was surpassed by the Green Bay Packers' Aaron Rodgers[75][76] and the Atlanta Falcons' Matt Ryan.[77] Flacco's 2013 season was statistically the worst of his career. For the first time as an NFL quarterback, Flacco threw more interceptions than touchdowns. His 22 interceptions in the season were 10 more than he had thrown in any other season. His 19 touchdowns were also his lowest since his rookie year. His passer rating was a career low 73.1, approximately 7 points lower than Flacco's previous worst season passer rating. He was also sacked more times (48) than he was in any other season in his career. Despite all this, he also set a high in passing yards, with 3,912.[78] The Ravens finished 8–8 for the season and Flacco missed the playoffs for the first time in his career.[79] He was ranked 58th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.[80] In their 2014 season home opener, the Ravens played against the division rival Bengals. The game saw the Ravens trailing practically the entire time; however, their one lead of the game came off of an 80-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to wide receiver Steve Smith Sr. At the time, it was the longest touchdown throw of Flacco's career.[81] However, the Ravens would go on to lose the game 16–23, after Bengals' quarterback Andy Dalton connected with receiver A. J. Green for an even more stupendous 77-yard touchdown that would ultimately be the game winner.[82] It would be the first time since 2005 that the Ravens lost their home opener. Flacco finished the game completing 35 of 62 passes and throwing for a season-high 345 passing yards along with a touchdown and an interception, with a passer rating of 71.0.[83] Flacco had his best game of the season in Week 6, and one of the best games of his career. He completed 21 of 28 passes for 306 yards and a career-high five touchdown passes to four different receivers (Smith Sr., Torrey Smith, Kamar Aiken, and Michael Campanaro) with no interceptions. He once again wasn't sacked and had a season-high passer rating of 149.7. Flacco became the fastest quarterback to throw five touchdown passes, as it only took him 16 minutes and 3 seconds. The Ravens blew out the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 48–17.[84] He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for the third time in his career.[85] In Week 16, the Ravens took on the Texans with a chance to clinch the playoffs. Flacco played his worst game of the season, and arguably the worst of his career. He ended the first half with only 27 passing yards and two interceptions, as the Ravens trailed 0–16 going into halftime. The Ravens would rally in the second half, as Flacco threw two touchdown passes to Torrey Smith, but the Ravens never held a lead in the entire game and ended up losing 13–25. Flacco finished completing 21 of 50 passes for 195 yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions with a season-low passer rating of 41.7. He was also sacked twice.[86] In Week 17, the Ravens took on the Browns in Baltimore with a chance to clinch the final playoff seed, but they needed a win and for the Kansas City Chiefs to beat or tie the San Diego Chargers. Trailing 6–10 in the fourth quarter, Flacco stepped up big time, heaving a deep pass to Torrey Smith, who caught the ball at the Browns' 16-yard line. On the next play of the game, Flacco connected with Smith again, this time for a touchdown, which put the Ravens up 13–10 for good with 7:33 left in the game. With 3:44 left in the game, Flacco threw another touchdown pass to Kamar Aiken, sealing a 20–10 win. Kansas City would beat San Diego 19–7, giving Baltimore the final AFC playoff spot. Flacco finished the game with 22 of 36 completed passes, 312 passing yards, 2 touchdowns, and no interceptions with a passer rating of 107.6. Flacco was also sacked one time, which caused one of his two fumbles in the game (he did not lose either).[87] 2014 saw Flacco have the best regular season of his career. He set highs in passing yards (3,986), passing touchdowns (27), times sacked (19), fumbles (5), and fumbles lost (0). He also attempted and completed the second most single season passes in his career (344 completions out of 554 attempts) and tied his mark for second fewest interceptions thrown in a regular season (12). From Weeks 2 through 4, Flacco was not sacked at all. In 5 of Flacco's last 6 games of the season, his passer rating was 99 or higher, with the one exception being the 13–25 loss to Houston. He led Baltimore to a 10–6 record.[88] In the Wild Card round of the playoffs, the Ravens faced the AFC North-winning Steelers at Heinz Field. Flacco completed 18 of 29 passes for 259 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions with a passer rating of 114.0, as the Ravens beat the Steelers 30–17. He was sacked once, after getting tripped up by his offensive lineman on the Ravens' first offensive play of the game. This became the first time that the Ravens beat the Steelers in the postseason. Flacco also continued his streak of winning a game in his team's first round of the playoffs. His biggest accomplishment, however, may have been that he became the first quarterback in NFL history to start and win a playoff game in six of their first seven seasons.[89] In the Divisional round of the playoffs, the Ravens traveled to Foxborough to take on the number-one seeded Patriots, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions in a 31–35 shootout, despite two back-to-back 14-point leads. Flacco still performed well, going 28/45 with 292 passing yards, a career-postseason-high 4 touchdown passes, 2 interceptions and a 92.1 passer rating. Once again, he was not sacked.[90] For his efforts during the 2014 season, Flacco was invited to the 2015 Pro Bowl as an alternate but turned down the opportunity to play because his wife, Dana, was due to give birth to the couple's third child the same month.[91] On the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015, Flacco was ranked number 97, the lowest that he has ever been ranked, on the NFL's Top 100 Players list. He fell 39 spots from the previous year, where he was ranked number 58.[92] The Ravens began their 2015 season in a road game against the Broncos, the place where Flacco had his breakout playoff performance nearly three years earlier. Leading the game, 13–9, with less than a minute left in the third quarter, Flacco threw a pass down the middle of the field, aiming for Steve Smith Sr., but missed the pass terribly, as it was intercepted by Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and returned 51 yards for a touchdown. It was Flacco's first pick-six since the 2013 season finale. With less than a minute left in the game, the Ravens had the ball at the Denver 16-yard line and were trailing, 19–13. Flacco threw a pass into the end zone, intended for double-covered tight end Crockett Gillmore, which was intercepted by safety, and former Raven, Darian Stewart, officially ending the game for Baltimore.[93] In Week 2, against the Oakland Raiders, Flacco bounced back by going 32-of-45 with 384 yards and two touchdown passes to Crockett Gillmore, with a 102.5 passer rating. However, while trying to rally the Ravens back at the end of the game, he was picked off by cornerback Neiko Thorpe with less than 30 seconds left, giving the Raiders a 37–33 upset win.[94] It was the first time in his NFL career that Flacco started a season with a 0–2 record. On the final drive of the Ravens' Week 11 game versus the Rams, Flacco suffered a torn ACL and MCL, ending his 2015 season.[95] He stayed in the game to complete the drive and put Baltimore into a position to kick the game-winning field goal, giving the Ravens a 16–13 win at home. The Ravens had a 3–7 record with Flacco at starting quarterback. Flacco finished the season with 266 completed passes out of 413 attempts, 2,791 yards, 14 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, an 83.1 passer rating, three rushing touchdowns and five fumbles, losing two.[96] Flacco's injury ended his streak of consecutive starts at 122 games. On March 2, 2016, Flacco agreed to a three-year extension to remain with the team.[97] After their Week 3 victory against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Flacco and the Ravens had accrued a 3–0 record, their best record after three games since 2009, but the Ravens would struggle down the stretch, finishing with an 8–8 record and missing the playoffs for the second straight season, the first consecutive playoff misses for the franchise since 2004–2005. Flacco posted a career-high and franchise record 4,317 passing yards, the first time he reached at least 4,000 yards, but only threw 20 touchdowns and 15 interceptions, the second highest of his career. Flacco posted a 6.4 average per attempt, tying his career worst. Flacco also completed a career-high and franchise best 436 completions, and a career-high and franchise best 672 attempts.[98][99] The 672 pass attempts currently rank fifth most in a single season in league history. The longest touchdown pass of his career came in Week 9 of the 2016 season against the Steelers. In the first quarter of the game, Flacco's short pass to Mike Wallace went for a 95-yard touchdown, and is the longest regular-season pass play in Ravens history.[100] On July 26, 2017, it was revealed that Flacco was diagnosed with a back injury, ruling him out for 3–6 weeks of training camp.[101] Against the Dolphins in Week 8, Flacco suffered a concussion after a hit from Kiko Alonso. Flacco left the game, and was relieved by Ryan Mallett for the rest. The Ravens nevertheless won 40–0.[102] The Ravens finished the season with a 9–7 record and just missed the playoffs after losing 31–27 to the Bengals in Week 17, allowing the Buffalo Bills to qualify for the postseason. Flacco finished the season starting all 16 games, throwing for 3,141 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions.[103] On September 9, 2018, Flacco threw for three touchdowns and had a passer rating of 121.7 in the season-opening blowout against the Buffalo Bills 47–3.[104] The next week he recorded 376 yards and two touchdowns along with two interceptions against the Bengals, losing his seventh game in Cincinnati. He fumbled the ball in the fourth quarter, ending the chance for a comeback.[105] After suffering a hip injury during a Week 9 loss to the Steelers,[106] Flacco was replaced by rookie Lamar Jackson as the Ravens' starting quarterback.[107] Jackson performed well, going 6–1 at the helm, and Flacco served in a backup role for the first time in his NFL career after he was cleared to play.[108] During the Wild Card Round at home against the Los Angeles Chargers, in which the Ravens were trailing 23–3 due to early struggles by Jackson, many fans chanted for Flacco to return to the field and replace Jackson. Flacco would not see action in the game, as Jackson's late comeback bid down 23–17 was stopped following a fumble with 0:28 remaining in the fourth quarter.[109] Overall, Flacco finished the season with 2,465 passing yards, 12 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions.[110] On February 13, 2019, the Ravens agreed to trade Flacco to the Denver Broncos in exchange for their fourth-round pick in the 2019 NFL draft.[111] The deal became official on March 13, 2019.[112] In his Broncos debut, Flacco threw for 268 yards and a touchdown in a 24–16 road loss to the Raiders.[113] Flacco made his debut at Empower Field at Mile High in Week 2 against the Bears. In the game, Flacco threw for 292 yards, one touchdown, and one interception as the Broncos lost 16–14. With 31 seconds left in the game, Flacco threw a seven-yard touchdown pass and a two-point conversion, both to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders to take a 14–13 lead. However, the Bears quickly drove down the field and Eddy Piñeiro kicked a 53-yard game winning field goal, spoiling Flacco's home debut.[114] In Week 4 against the Jaguars, Flacco threw for 303 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in the 26–24 loss.[115] In Week 5 against the Chargers, Flacco threw for 182 yards, one touchdown, and one interception as the Broncos won their first game of the season by a score of 20–13.[116] In Week 7 against the Chiefs, Flacco threw for 213 yards. During the game, Flacco was sacked a career high nine times in a single game.[117] In a Week 8 loss to the Colts, Flacco threw for 174 yards in the 15–13 loss. In the game, he suffered a neck injury which prematurely ended his season.[118][119] Flacco finished the 2019 season posting 1,822 passing yards, six touchdowns, five interceptions, and an 85.1 passer rating in eight games.[120] On March 19, 2020, the Broncos released Flacco with a failed physical designation.[121] He underwent neck surgery in April 2020.[122] On May 27, 2020, Flacco signed a one-year, $1.5 million deal with the New York Jets as the backup quarterback to 2018 first-round pick Sam Darnold.[123] He was placed on the active/physically unable to perform list at the start of training camp on July 30, 2020.[124] He was activated from the list at the start of the regular season on September 5, 2020.[125] Flacco made his Jets debut when he briefly entered the Week 4 matchup on October 2 after starter Sam Darnold injured his shoulder late in the first quarter.[126] He played only four snaps, going 2 for 2 for 16 yards before Darnold returned in the second quarter in the 37–28 loss to the Broncos.[127] On October 7, 2020, Flacco was named the starter against the Cardinals due to Darnold's shoulder injury.[128] Making his first start with the Jets in Week 5 against the Cardinals, Flacco finished with 195 passing yards and a touchdown as the Jets lost 30–10.[129] In the next game against the Dolphins, Flacco finished with 186 passing yards, an interception, and a fumble that he recovered. The Jets again lost 24–0, the first time Flacco had ever been shut out in his NFL career.[130] In Week 9 against the Patriots, Flacco was again thrust into the starting role after Darnold re-injured his shoulder the previous week. He had his best game of the season, going 18 for 25 for 262 yards and three touchdowns while also passing Joe Montana for 20th on the all-time passing yards list.[131] However, he also threw a costly fourth quarter interception that allowed the Patriots to rally and eventually beat the Jets 30–27.[132][133] In Week 11 against the Chargers, Flacco completed 15 of 30 passes for 205 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception as the Jets lost 34–28 despite an attempted comeback.[134][135] On March 25, 2021, Flacco signed a one-year, $3.5 million contract with the Philadelphia Eagles to back up 2020 second-round pick Jalen Hurts.[136][137][138] Flacco led all Eagles quarterbacks in completions, pass attempts, passing yards, and passing touchdowns during the pre-season, but did not appear in a regular season game for Philadelphia. On October 25, 2021, the Eagles traded Flacco back to the Jets for a conditional sixth-round draft pick, after Jets starting quarterback Zach Wilson suffered a knee injury.[139] Flacco served as a backup to Mike White and Josh Johnson for his first three games back with the Jets, coming into the Week 10 game against the Bills in relief of White. He completed all three of his pass attempts for 47 yards and a touchdown.[140] On November 17, 2021, Flacco was named the starting quarterback for the Jets' Week 11 game against the Dolphins.[141] He was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list by the Jets on November 23 as a close contact with White, who tested positive for COVID-19. Flacco was activated on November 30.[142] On March 16, 2022, Flacco re-signed with the Jets for one year and $3.5 million.[143] He was announced as the starter for the first three weeks of the season due to an injury to starter Zach Wilson.[144] Making the start in Week 1 against his former team, the Baltimore Ravens, Flacco completed 37 of 59 passes for 307 yards, a touchdown, and an interception as the Jets lost 24–9.[145] During Week 2 against the Browns, Flacco finished with 307 passing yards and four touchdowns. With 1:22 left of regulation, trailing 30–17, Flacco made a 66-yard touchdown pass to Corey Davis and the Jets successfully executed an onside kick, allowing Flacco to throw another touchdown with 14 seconds left in their 31–30 win. It was his first winning start since the 2019 season.[146] On October 30, before the week 8 game against the Patriots, Flacco was demoted to third string in favor of Mike White.[147] After watching Mike White and Zach Wilson start from Week 4 until Week 17, Flacco was renamed the starter for the season finale after White was ruled out with five broken ribs.[148] On November 20, 2023, Flacco was signed to the Cleveland Browns practice squad, following a season-ending injury to starting quarterback Deshaun Watson.[149][150] Flacco was named the starter for Week 13 against the Los Angeles Rams after Dorian Thompson-Robinson was ruled out with a concussion.[151] He was again named the starter against the Jaguars in Week 14. In the game, Flacco completed 26 of 45 passes for 311 yards, three touchdowns and one interception as the Browns won 31–27. Following the win, the Browns announced that Flacco would remain the starter moving forward.[152] After reverting to the practice squad, he officially joined the active roster after signing a one-year deal with Cleveland on December 14.[153] In Week 16 against the Texans, Flacco completed 27-of-42 passes for 368 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions in a 36–22 victory.[154] It was the first time in Flacco's career that he had three consecutive games with over 300 yards passing and he was named the FedEx Air Player of the Week for his performance.[155][156] In Week 17 against the Jets, Flacco threw three touchdowns and passed for 296 yards in the first half alone, marking the most yards in any half in his career as the Browns won 37–20, clinching their first playoff berth in three years.[157] Flacco became the first player in NFL history to have 250 passing yards and multiple passing touchdowns in each of his first five games with a franchise.[158] On January 13, 2024, Flacco made his first playoff start since 2015 against the Texans in the Wild Card round. The nine-year gap between playoff starts is the second-longest gap in NFL postseason history, behind Doug Flutie's 12-year gap from 1987 to 1999.[159] In the game, Flacco had a strong first half, completing 15 of 19 passes for 172 yards and a touchdown. However, two interceptions returned for touchdowns in the third quarter put Cleveland in a deep hole as they lost 45–14.[160] This marked Flacco's first loss in a Wild Card game, having previously gone 5–0.[161] Following the season, Flacco was named NFL Comeback Player of the Year by the Associated Press, becoming the oldest player to win the award since Jim Martin in 1963.[162] On March 22, 2024, Flacco signed with the Indianapolis Colts on a one-year deal.[163] He began the season as the backup to Anthony Richardson but took over in Week 4 against the Steelers after Richardson got injured. Flacco finished the game with 168 yards and two touchdowns, leading the Colts to a 27–24 victory.[164] With Richardson out, Flacco started against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 5, completing 33-of-44 passes for 359 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions in a narrow 37–34 loss.[165] He led the Colts to victory the following week against the Tennessee Titans.[166] With Richardson struggling, the Colts announced on October 30 that Flacco would be the starter moving forward, beginning in their Week 9 matchup against the Minnesota Vikings.[167] After losing both starts and committing six turnovers across those games, Flacco was benched and Richardson was reinstated as the starter prior to Week 11.[168] Flacco signed a three-year contract with Reebok as a rookie in 2008.[182] In 2009–2010, Flacco was a spokesperson for Pizza Hut, which sold a product called \"Flacco's Favorites\".[183] Flacco has also endorsed Nike[184] and 1st Mariner Bank, as well as Haribo since January 2013.[184] Also in 2013, Flacco signed an endorsement deal with McDonald's to promote their new menu item, the Mighty Wings.[185] Flacco has also teamed up with opendorse to promote a Zynga mobile application called \"NFL Showdown: Football Manager\" as well as a line of women's apparel for Spirit Football Jersey.[186] Flacco married his wife Dana in a Catholic ceremony in 2011, at the same church where his parents were married.[187][188] Together they have five children; their first child, a son, was born in June 2012.[189][non-primary source needed] Their second son was born September 15, 2013, about an hour before the start of the Ravens' home opener.[190] Their third son was born in January 2015 and[191] their fourth son was born in April 2018.[192] The Flaccos' only daughter was born in September 2016.[193] While playing for the Ravens, Flacco lived in the Baltimore suburb of Reisterstown, Maryland, until selling his home for $1.6 million in 2019 after being traded to the Denver Broncos.[194] Flacco is the oldest of the five boys in his family. His brothers are Mike, John, Brian, and Tom;[195] he also has a sister, Stephanie. His brother Mike was selected in the 31st round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft by the Baltimore Orioles.[196] Another brother, John, was a walk-on receiver with the Stanford Cardinal football team.[197][198] Joe's youngest brother, Tom Flacco, enrolled in 2015 at Western Michigan University, where he played quarterback for two seasons before transferring to Rutgers in 2017 and then Towson in 2018.[199][200] In 2021, Tom was signed by the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League.[201] In a survey by Fanatics[202] in January 2017, Flacco was elected as the most attractive player in the NFL.[203][204][205] In 2018, Flacco made a donation of an undisclosed amount to University of Delaware athletics. It was the largest donation from a Delaware alumnus in the NFL.[206] On May 25, 2024, Flacco received an honorary doctorate degree in Humane Letters from his alma mater, the University of Delaware.[207]",

                "content": "Aaron LaRae Jones (born December 2, 1994) is an American professional football running back for the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the UTEP Miners and was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the fifth round of the 2017 NFL draft. In seven seasons with the Packers, Jones led the league in rushing touchdowns in 2019, made the Pro Bowl in 2020, and ranks third in the team's all-time rushing yards list. Jones was born in Savannah, Georgia, to Vurgess and Alvin Jones Sr., two career non-commissioned officers in the US Army. As a child, Jones looked up to Emmitt Smith.[1] He and his twin brother Alvin Jr., older brother Xavier, and sister Chelsirae moved around often, living in Germany, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and near the Mexican border in the city of El Paso due to their parents' postings.[2] Jones attended and played high school football for Burges High School in El Paso, Texas.[3] He had a three-star composite rating from 247Sports.com.[4] His father retired before his senior year and started a marketing company to jump-start the recruiting process for his sons.[2] Jones attended and played college football for the UTEP Miners from 2013 to 2016 under head coach Sean Kugler.[5] As a freshman, Jones played in nine football games. In his collegiate debut, against New Mexico, he had 11 carries for 127 yards and two rushing touchdowns.[6] On October 26, against Rice, he had a season-high 186 rushing yards.[7] Overall, he finished the 2013 season with 811 rushing yards, four rushing touchdowns, and four receptions for 14 yards.[8] As a sophomore, Jones played in 12 games.

As a senior, Jones played in 12 games. In his first game back from the ankle injury, he had 249 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in a win over New Mexico State,[18] then the third-most in school history.[14] In his second game of the season, Jones had 123 rushing yards on 18 carries in a loss against the Texas Longhorns with the Miners' lone touchdown of the game coming from a 51-yard run by Jones.[19] On October 29, against Old Dominion, he threw a three-yard passing touchdown in the loss.[20] In the next game against Houston Baptist, he had 228 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.[21] He followed that up with 229 rushing yards and two more rushing touchdowns in a loss at Florida Atlantic.[22] In his finale collegiate game, a win over North Texas, he had 301 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns,[23] second only to Fred Wendt's 326 yards in 1948 in school history.[14] Overall, he had eight carries of more than 40 yards[2] and finished his final collegiate season with 1,773 rushing yards, 17 rushing touchdowns, 28 receptions, 233 receiving yards, three receiving touchdowns, and one passing touchdown.[24] This made Jones the most prolific rusher in UTEP Miners history and a top player. In terms of rushing yards, he had five of the school's top 12 games, and school records of 17 games with 100+ yards rushing, and five with 200+ yards. He holds the record for most rushing yards in a career (4,114), season (1,773; also fifth his second year), and career yards per game (117.5) including the 2nd- and 6th-best seasons in school history (147.8 in 2016; 110.1 in 2014). He is second all-time with 33 rushing touchdowns, including the school's 3rd- and 7th-best seasons (17 in 2016; 11 in 2014). His 4,760 career all-purpose yards and 136.0 per game average are both second all-time and included the school's fourth- and eighth-best seasons. He has three of the school's 10 longest rushing plays, including the record 91-yarder from his short junior season. His 240 career points scored is 4th all-time, and 2nd among non-kickers.[14] Jones was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the fifth round, 182nd overall, in the 2017 NFL draft.[29] He was the 19th running back selected in that year's draft.[30] He was signed to a contract on May 5, 2017.[31] After injuries to Ty Montgomery and Jamaal Williams, Jones came into the Thursday Night Football game against the Chicago Bears in Week 4.

By Week 9, he had enough rushes to qualify for the NFL leaderboards and took over the top spot in yards-per-rush at 6.02.[38] On November 11, he had 15 carries for a career-high 145 yards and two rushing touchdowns in a 31–12 Week 10 victory over the Miami Dolphins.[39] The following week, he caught his first NFL receiving touchdown and ran for another in a 24–27 loss to the Seattle Seahawks.[40] In Week 12, he scored his fifth touchdown in three games on route to 93 total yards against the Minnesota Vikings.[41] He suffered a knee injury in Week 15 and was placed on injured reserve on December 18, 2018.[42][43] Overall, he finished the 2018 season with 728 rushing yards, eight rushing touchdowns, 26 receptions, 206 receiving yards, and one receiving touchdown.[44] In his first two seasons, Jones' averaged 9 touches per game[2] and a league-leading 5.5 yards per carry.[45] In Week 2 against the Vikings, Jones rushed 23 times for 116 yards and a touchdown as the Packers won 21–16.[46] In Week 3 against the Denver Broncos, Jones rushed 10 times for 19 yards and two touchdowns as the Packers won 27–16.[47] During Week 5 against the Cowboys, Jones finished with 107 rushing yards, 75 receiving yards, and four touchdowns as the Packers won 34–24, earning him NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[48][49] During Sunday Night Football against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 8, Jones finished with 13 carries for 67 rushing yards, seven catches for 159 receiving yards, and two receiving touchdowns as the Packers won 31–24.[50] He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[51] In Week 10 against the Carolina Panthers, Jones rushed 13 times for 93 yards and three touchdowns in the 24–16 win.[52] In Week 14 against the Redskins, Jones rushed 16 times for 134 yards and a touchdown in the 20–15 win.[53] During a rematch with the Minnesota Vikings on Monday Night Football in Week 16, Jones highlighted a big play with a 56-yard touchdown run.

J. Dillon, failing to reach 1,000 rushing yards for the first time since 2018.[72] In Week 1 against the Saints, Jones rushed five times for just nine yards.[73] He bounced back the following week against the Lions, rushing for 66 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries, and added six receptions for 48 yards and three receiving touchdowns. He was the first Packers running back to catch three touchdowns in a game since Andy Uram in 1942, as the Packers won 35–17.[74][75] Jones had his first 100-yard game in a Week 5 25–22 overtime win against the Cincinnati Bengals, tallying 103 yards on 14 carries, including a season-long 57-yard run.[76] In Week 8 against the Arizona Cardinals, with wide receivers Davante Adams, Allen Lazard and Marquez Valdes-Scantling out due to COVID or injury, Jones was the primary target of quarterback Aaron Rodgers, catching a team-high seven passes for 51 yards as the Packers won 24–21.[77] In Week 10 against the Seahawks, Jones went down with an MCL sprain.[78] He returned to limited action in a Week 12 win over the Rams. He surpassed 1,000 yards from scrimmage for the third consecutive year in a Week 16 victory over the Cleveland Browns.[79][80] Jones finished the 2021 season with 171 carries for 799 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns to go along with 52 receptions for 391 receiving yards and six receiving touchdowns.[81] The Packers earned a first-round bye and faced off against the 49ers in the Divisional Round. Jones had 41 rushing yards on 12 carries but had nine receptions for 129 receiving yards in the 13–10 loss.[82] In Week 2, against the Bears, Jones had 15 carries for 132 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown to go along with three receptions for 38 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown.[83] In Week 4, against the New England Patriots, he had 16 carries for 110 rushing yards in the 27–24 overtime victory.[84] In Week 7, against the Washington Commanders, he had two receiving touchdowns in the 23–21 loss.[85] In the following game, against the Bills, he had 20 carries for 143 rushing yards.[86] In Week 10, against the Cowboys in a 31–28 victory, he had 24 carries for 138 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown.[87] In Week 17, in a 41–17 win over the Vikings, he had 14 carries for 111 rushing yards.[88] Jones rushed for a personal best 1,121 yards on 213 carries.

In back-to-back-to-back must-win games for the Packers to earn a playoff berth in the team's first season with Jordan Love as the starting quarterback, Jones recorded at least 130 offensive yards in each game, helping secure a wild-card playoff spot.[94] Jones ran for 118 yards with three touchdowns on 21 attempts in a Wild Card Round 48–32 win over the Cowboys at AT&T Stadium.[95] In that performance, Jones set the franchise record for playoff rushing touchdowns with seven and tied the record for most rushing touchdowns by a Packer in a playoff game.[96] In a season-ending 24–21 Divisional Round loss to the 49ers, Jones became the first player in the more than 100-year history of the Green Bay Packers to record five consecutive 100-yard rushing games.[97] On March 11, 2024, Jones was released by the Packers after seven seasons.[98] On March 12, 2024, Jones signed a one-year contract with the Minnesota Vikings.[99] In Week 12, against the Chicago Bears, he had 22 carries for 106 yards and a touchdown in the 30–27 win.[100] During his tenure in Green Bay, Jones was known for wearing wraparound Oakley sunglasses and a sombrero decorated in Packers colors when arriving at a stadium before a game, on the sidelines, and in postgame interviews.[103] The sombrero is an homage to his hometown of El Paso, a majority-Hispanic city.[104] He also pays tribute to El Paso in his signature touchdown celebration, in which he holds up nine, one, and five fingers in quick succession before flexing his bicep (El Paso is covered by area code 915).[105] Jones graduated from UTEP on May 12, 2018, with a degree in multidisciplinary studies, fulfilling a promise he had previously made to his parents that he would finish school even if drafted into the NFL.[2][106] Jones had a close bond with his father, Alvin Sr., who died on April 6, 2021, from COVID-19.[107] Jones Sr. was cremated following his death, with the ashes put into a chain for Aaron. During a game against the Detroit Lions, he lost the chain upon scoring a touchdown (one of four that night), but an athletic trainer found it and returned it to him.[108] Jones was an ambassador of the now bankrupt FTX and received compensation via cryptocurrency. Jones had also purchased an equity stake in the exchange which he is unlikely to recoup.[109] On November 20, 2017, Jones was cited for a traffic stop, an incident that occurred on October 1 in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin. The day the incident occurred Jones was speeding at 79 miles per hour (127 km/h) at a 55 miles per hour (89 km/h) speed limit and had possession of marijuana. Jones was arrested and charged with operating with a restricted controlled substance, operating without a valid license, and speeding.[110] Jones pleaded no contest to the charges and was fined for court costs and had his license suspended for six months.[111] Jones' cousin, Tristen Newton, was the starting point guard for the UConn Huskies men's basketball team during their 2023 national championship run and 2024 national championship run, and was named the 2024 Final Four Most Outstanding Player. Aaron and his brother Alvin Jr. attended both Final Fours.[112]",

                "title": "A Message for Green Bay by Aaron Jones | The Players‘ Tribune",
                "content": "Aaron Jones Minnesota Vikings It’s funny how so much of life is just about people seeing you or not. Growing up, and wanting to make it as a football player, I had all these people basically telling me I wasn’t anything special. Coming out of high school I only had two college offers. Going into the draft I waited almost 200 picks for my name to be called. So when I finally did get drafted, I think there’s a part of me that figured it’s about to be the same in the NFL: more people who just see right past me, or who see me as nothing worth investing in. Then I became a Green Bay Packer. I remember this one moment early on in camp my rookie season. The Packers had drafted three running backs in 2017, and the receivers started taking “bets” on which of us was going to come out on top. Obviously a lot of guys had Jamaal since he was drafted the highest. Then one day in camp, Davante walks up to me. He’s the No. 1 receiver, right? Fourth year and about to make a Pro Bowl. He’s the dude in that room — and he comes over to me on the sideline, I don’t even know why, and he says, “I got you as my dog in this race.” I can’t even tell you what that did for me, honestly. It was like, OK, Davante Adams believes in me?? It meant a lot. I also remember the very first time I played an offensive snap — it was Week 4 at home against Chicago. Both our main running backs had gone down, so it’s only me and our fullback left. I run onto the field, and when I get into the huddle it’s crazy: A-Rod, he just looks at me and he says, “Hey. I am one of your biggest fans in this entire organization. It’s your time. Yours, right now.” I ended up scoring and we won that game. The next few weeks, both main backs were still out and I played really well. Pretty soon they got healthy though and I went back to not being out there as much. In my head I’m thinking, I had a nice moment. Maybe it’s over. But then I’ll never forget there was this one drive, later in the season — and out of nowhere, A-Rod calls timeout, turns to the sideline and yells: “I WANT 33 IN THE GAME!!! I WANT 33 IN THE GAME!!! 33!!! NOW!!!” I’m standing there, I’m looking down at my jersey … and suddenly I’m like, Oh wait. I’m 33. That’s ME. I don’t even remember what the play was, or what happened on it, but I just know how good that felt. It was this reminder that I was there for a reason, you know what I mean? One of the best QBs who’s ever lived is actually seeing something in me. It wasn’t just my teammates who made me feel seen in Green Bay — it was our fans, too. Especially in those first few years when I was trying to make my name in the league, I think people started to notice that good things would happen when I had the ball, and they wanted me to be more involved. So they started tweeting with the hashtag #FREEAARONJONES. I know it’s just a hashtag, but I won’t lie, that was cool. Every time I saw it in my mentions, it reassured me I wasn’t going unnoticed. Our fans understood how hard I was working to make things happen, and I fed off of that. I’m also very grateful for the Packers organization, and the way they had faith in me as a person. One of the biggest mistakes I ever made was as a rookie: I got cited for driving with marijuana in my system, and suspended by the league for the start of my second year. I was so embarrassed after it happened. They say you represent the G at all times, and I hadn’t held up my part of that. I felt like I’d let everyone down who gave me a chance as a fifth-round pick — and for a guy like me who wasn’t established yet, a lot of teams might’ve said “let’s just cut him.” It definitely could have gone either way … but the Packers had my back. Their mentality was, This mistake isn’t you. It’s only you if you don’t learn from it. They made sure I walked around our building with my head held high, even when I was feeling really low. Then in the spring of 2021, two very different events happened — and they both changed my life forever. The first one happened on March 26th: I signed a second contract with the Packers. Four years for $48 million. I’d been on my rookie contract until then, and I hadn’t grown up with money, so it was a big moment. It was the feeling of security for my family, and knowing they’ll always be taken care of. It was also the feeling of validation for the work I’d put in — that all those people who’d doubted me had been proven wrong. At the center of both of those feelings was my dad. He was the single biggest influence in my life, by far, in terms of who I became both as a football player and as a man. He was the one who made me fall in love with football, he was my coach, my trainer, my biggest supporter, my best friend, and of course he was also just my dad. He was a diehard Cowboys fan (you know the kind) ... but as soon as I got drafted by Green Bay, none of that mattered. You weren’t going to see a Cowboys color in our house ever again. It was dark green, cheese gold, Packers everything. He came to every game — every single one. During pregame, he’d make sure he was in the end zone where we were warming up. I’d go find him before kickoff and shake his hand, then he’d kiss me on the forehead and tell me how proud he was. “Go rip it up, go have a day.” That’s how he’d leave it. So it’s hard to put into words the emotions I was going through when, less than two weeks after I signed my new deal, my dad passed away. It pretty much came out of nowhere: He got COVID, and there were complications, and it just happened very fast. One day I was with my family in El Paso to celebrate that the contract terms had been agreed to … and by the time I was in Green Bay to actually sign, he was at the hospital. Eleven days later, on April 6th, he was gone. He passed away at home, which is what he wanted and something I took a lot of comfort in. My parents both served in the military, and they’d been off to war multiple times. Whenever my dad would be away, he’d know that Alvin, Chelsirae and I were worried about him — so he’d tell us, “I’m coming home to you guys. I’m coming home.” I’m glad he could come home for us one last time. I guess that’s a heavy story to put in a letter like this…… Maybe it’s too heavy, I don’t know. I wanted to share it with you all though. Because when I think about my seven years in Green Bay, the thing that probably will stay with me most is the way that the Packers were there for me when I lost my dad. That’s the toughest thing I’ve been through in my whole life, and I went through it while we were preparing for a season where the goal was the Super Bowl. I knew that everyone was counting on me to be at my best — which is a lot to carry when you’re grieving a loved one. The Packers helped me carry that grief as much as they could. So many of my teammates reached out, and made me feel that fraternity. At the funeral, I honestly couldn’t believe it, Coach LaFleur flew all the way down to Texas. Brian Gutekunst (our GM) and Ben Sirmans (our running backs coach) also flew down. To say they didn’t have to do that is an understatement … and I know I could never repay them on a football field. So I’ll just say, “Thank you.” That’s the biggest thing I want to write here, not just to the Packers organization but really to all of Green Bay. Thank you. It’s going to feel strange being on that visiting sideline for the first time, and being on the other side of this NFC North thing in general — but it’s ALL love, and it’s so much gratitude. Thanks for “betting” on me, riding with me, hashtagging for me, and everything else. Thanks for SEEING me. No G on the helmet Sunday, always one in my heart. -Aaron To all the Las Vegas Raiders fans, Antonio Pierce is ready to go: “It’s intimidation. It’s winning the game before the game’s played. That’s the Raider way.” Before the NFL Draft, Jayden Daniels has a few things to say: “I don’t back down from anything or anybody. So I worked hard for it, and I hoped God would meet my effort with a blessing.” Michael Penix Jr. pens a letter to GMs ahead of the NFL Draft: “As a QB, my job is to be an elevator. I need to uplift all those around me so that they too can be at their best.” © 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved",

                "title": "Brock Bowers - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Brock Allen Bowers (born December 13, 2002) is an American professional football tight end for the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs, where he was a two-time national champion and John Mackey Award winner and holds the school record for single-season receiving touchdowns with 13. A three-time All-American, Bowers is the most decorated tight end in college football history and was selected by the Raiders in the first round of the 2024 NFL draft. Bowers was born on December 13, 2002, in Napa, California.[1][2][3] His parents met at Utah State University, where his mother was an All-American softball player who was later inducted into the schools athletic Hall of Fame and his father was an All-Big West center on the school's football team.[4][5] After graduating, his mother became a high school math teacher and softball coach, while his father founded a construction company.[4][6][5] His sister plays softball at Sacramento State.[7] Growing up Bowers played a variety of sports including football, basketball, baseball and soccer.[1] Bowers attended Napa High School in Napa, California, where he played football and basketball.[8] As a freshman he played quarterback for the school's junior varsity team, running the triple option.[1] Bowers joined the varsity team as a sophomore, playing tight end and linebacker, and received his first college offer from Nevada.[1] Following his sophomore season, he attended a Nike camp where his athleticism gained the attention of college scouts and led to him receiving about a dozen offers.[1][8] As a junior, Bowers accounted for 1,499 all-purpose yards and set a school record with 14 touchdown receptions, helping lead Napa to the state playoffs just one year after the team finished 0–10.[5][9] For his efforts he was named the Napa County Player of the Year.[10] Bowers entered his senior season as a preseason All-American but the season was canceled due to COVID-19 restrictions in California.[11][7][1] Unable to play or train due to restrictions, he stayed in shape by running up and down the hills of Napa.[8] Despite not playing as a senior, he would still be named to the All-American Bowl.[12] Bowers was a highly sought-after prospect, deemed a four-star recruit and the second-ranked tight end of his class by 247Sports, although some programs such as Notre Dame would recruit him as a linebacker.[13][7] Despite being from the West Coast, Bowers wanted to play college football in the South due to the region's passion for the sport, later stating “It is a little different (in the South) — people just care a lot more about football, it’s like a religion out here.\"[5][7] He ultimately committed to play college football at the University of Georgia under Kirby Smart, citing his relationship with the team's tight ends coach Todd Hartley and a desire to play as a freshman as additional factors in his commitment.[14][11][1] Sources: An early enrollee, Bowers arrived at Georgia in January 2021.[17] As a true freshman, he was originally set to share playing time with fellow tights ends Darnell Washington and Arik Gilbert.[1] However, Washington broke his foot and Gilbert stepped away from the team for personal reasons, leaving Bowers as the team's primary option at tight end.[1] In his first career game, Bowers led the Bulldogs in receiving with six catches for 43 yards in a 10–3 win over Clemson.[18][19] The following week against UAB, he caught his first two touchdowns, including a career-long 89-yard reception, and recorded his first 100-yard performance in a 56–7 win.[20] Two weeks later against Vanderbilt, Bowers caught two touchdowns and rushed for another en route to a blowout victory.[21] On October 16, he had another 100-yard performance, catching five passes for 101 yards and two touchdowns in a 30–13 defeat of Kentucky.[22] Bowers had additional multi-touchdown performances against Charleston Southern and rival Georgia Tech.[23][24] In the SEC Championship Game against Alabama, Bowers caught 10 passes (the most by a tight end in SEC Championship history) for a then career-high 139 yards and a touchdown in the Bulldogs 41–24 loss, their first of the season.[25] Despite the loss to Alabama, Georgia qualified for the College Football Playoff as the third seed.[26] In the Orange Bowl semifinal against Michigan, Bowers made five receptions for 55 yards and a touchdown in a 34–11 win, sending Georgia to the national championship game.[27][28] In the championship game, Georgia faced off against Alabama, who had handed the Bulldogs their lone loss of the season a month prior.[28] Bowers caught four passes in the game, including a crucial touchdown with just over three minutes remaining which extended the Bulldogs' lead to eight points.[29] Georgia defeated Alabama 33–18, capturing their first national championship since 1980.[29] At the conclusion of his freshman season, Bowers was named SEC Freshman of the Year and was included on the All-SEC first team and All-American second team.[30][31] He finished the season as Georgia's leading receiver with 56 receptions for 882 yards and a program record 13 receiving touchdowns.[32][33][34] He also had 56 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown.[33] Following his strong freshman season, Bowers entered the 2022 season with high expectations, and was named a preseason All-American.[35] In the Bulldogs season opener against Oregon, he had two receptions for 38 yards in a 49–3 victory.[33] Two weeks later, against South Carolina, Bowers caught five passes for 121 yards and two touchdowns, while rushing for another touchdown in a 48–7 win.[36] The following week against Kent State, he would have the best game of his career on the ground, rushing for 77 yards and two touchdowns in a 39–22 victory.[37][38] In the Bulldogs victory over Florida, Bowers recorded a career-high 154 receiving yards on five receptions, including an improbable 73-yard touchdown catch off of a deflection which some media outlets dubbed the \"catch of the season\".[39][40] Following a victory over LSU in the SEC Championship, the undefeated Bulldogs advanced to the College Football Playoff as the no. 1 seed.[41] In the Peach Bowl semi-final against Ohio State, Bowers caught four passes for 64 yards, including a crucial fourth down conversion in the final quarter to extend an eventual touchdown drive.[42][33] Georgia would defeat Ohio State 42–41 to advance to the national championship.[43] In the championship game, he caught a season-high seven passes for 152 yards and a touchdown on his final catch of the year to help Georgia capture their second consecutive national championship in a 65–7 blowout of TCU, the largest margin of victory in championship history.[44][45] At the conclusion of his sophomore season, Bowers was named a first team All-American and won the John Mackey Award for the nation's best tight end.[46][47] He once again finished the season as Georgia's leading receiver with 63 receptions for 942 yards and seven touchdowns as well as 109 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns.[33][48] Bowers won the John Mackey Award again in 2023, making him the only two-time winner for that award.[49] He won the award despite missing three games in 2023 due to an ankle injury.[50] He still led Georgia in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns, something he accomplished in all three of his seasons at UGA.[51] In 10 games, Bowers caught 56 passes for 714 yards and six touchdowns.[52] Bowers declared for the 2024 NFL draft following the 2023 season.[53] A three-time All-American, he has been cited as among the greatest tight ends in college football history.[54][55][56][57] Bowers was selected by the Las Vegas Raiders in the first round with the 13th overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft.[60] On May 9, 2024, Bowers signed a four-year fully-guaranteed contract worth $18.1 million.[61] In his NFL debut, he had six receptions for 58 yards in a 10–22 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 1.[62] In a Week 2, 26–23 win over the Baltimore Ravens, Bowers had nine receptions for 98 yards.[63] In Week 5, Bowers caught a 57-yard pass for his first NFL touchdown as a part of an eight reception, 97 yard game during an 18–34 loss to the Denver Broncos.[64] In Week 10, he had 13 receptions for 126 yards and a touchdown in the 34–19 loss to the Miami Dolphins.[65] In Week 12, he had ten receptions for 140 yards and a touchdown in the 19–17 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.[66]",

                "content": "A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. It is often referred to as a twister, whirlwind or cyclone,[1] although the word cyclone is used in meteorology to name a weather system with a low-pressure area in the center around which, from an observer looking down toward the surface of the Earth, winds blow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern.[2] Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, and they are often (but not always) visible in the form of a condensation funnel originating from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud, with a cloud of rotating debris and dust beneath it. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 180 kilometers per hour (110 miles per hour), are about 80 meters (250 feet) across, and travel several kilometers (a few miles) before dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 480 kilometers per hour (300 mph), can be more than 3 kilometers (2 mi) in diameter, and can stay on the ground for more than 100 km (62 mi).[3][4][5] Various types of tornadoes include the multiple-vortex tornado, landspout, and waterspout. Waterspouts are characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator and are less common at high latitudes.[6] Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirl, and steam devil. Tornadoes occur most frequently in North America (particularly in central and southeastern regions of the United States colloquially known as Tornado Alley; the United States has by far the most tornadoes of any country in the world).[7] Tornadoes also occur in South Africa, much of Europe (except most of the Alps), western and eastern Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh and adjacent eastern India, Japan, the Philippines, and southeastern South America (Uruguay and Argentina).[8][9] Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of pulse-Doppler radar by recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data, such as hook echoes or debris balls, as well as through the efforts of storm spotters.[10][11] There are several scales for rating the strength of tornadoes. The Fujita scale rates tornadoes by damage caused and has been replaced in some countries by the updated Enhanced Fujita Scale. An F0 or EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees, but not substantial structures. An F5 or EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes.[12] The International Fujita scale is also used to rate the intensity of tornadoes and other wind events based on the severity of the damage they cause.[13] Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (trochoidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and assign a rating.[14][15] The word tornado comes from the Spanish tronada (meaning 'thunderstorm', past participle of tronar 'to thunder', itself in turn from the Latin tonāre 'to thunder').[16][17] The metathesis of the r and o in the English spelling was influenced by the Spanish tornado (past participle of tornar 'to twist, turn,', from Latin tornō 'to turn').[16] The English word has been reborrowed into Spanish, referring to the same weather phenomenon. Tornadoes' opposite phenomena are the widespread, straight-line derechos (/dəˈreɪtʃoʊ/, from Spanish: derecho Spanish pronunciation: [deˈɾetʃo], 'straight'). A tornado is also commonly referred to as a \"twister\" or the old-fashioned colloquial term cyclone.[18][19] A tornado is a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud.[20] For a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. The term is not precisely defined; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes.[5] Tornado refers to the vortex of wind, not the condensation cloud.[21][22] A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor in the air to condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.[23] There is some disagreement over the definition of a funnel cloud and a condensation funnel. According to the Glossary of Meteorology, a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition.[24] Among many meteorologists, the \"funnel cloud\" term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud.[5] Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, and not all funnel clouds evolve into tornadoes. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance.[5] Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same storm cell are referred to as a \"tornado family\".[25] Several tornadoes are sometimes spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a tornado outbreak (although the term \"tornado outbreak\" has various definitions). A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a tornado outbreak sequence, occasionally called an extended tornado outbreak.[20][26][27] Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow funnel, a few hundred meters (yards) across, with a small cloud of debris near the ground. Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them.[28] Small, relatively weak landspouts may be visible only as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than 64 km/h (40 mph), the circulation is considered a tornado.[21] A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relatively low height is sometimes referred to as a \"stovepipe\" tornado. Large tornadoes which appear at least as wide as their cloud-to-ground height can look like large wedges stuck into the ground, and so are known as \"wedge tornadoes\" or \"wedges\".[29] The \"stovepipe\" classification is also used for this type of tornado if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges.[29] Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be \"roping out\", or becoming a \"rope tornado\". When they rope out, the length of their funnel increases, which forces the winds within the funnel to weaken due to conservation of angular momentum.[30] Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or they may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel.[31] In the United States, tornadoes are around 500 feet (150 m) across on average.[28] However, there is a wide range of tornado sizes. Weak tornadoes, or strong yet dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet or couple meters across. One tornado was reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2.1 m) long.[28] On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6 km) wide or more. A tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska on May 22, 2004, was up to 2.5 miles (4.0 km) wide at the ground, and a tornado in El Reno, Oklahoma on May 31, 2013, was approximately 2.6 miles (4.2 km) wide, the widest on record.[4][32] In the United States, the average tornado travels on the ground for 5 miles (8.0 km). However, tornadoes are capable of both much shorter and much longer damage paths: one tornado was reported to have a damage path only 7 feet (2.1 m) long, while the record-holding tornado for path length—the Tri-State Tornado, which affected parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana on March 18, 1925—was on the ground continuously for 219 miles (352 km).[28] Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles (160 km) or longer are composed of a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado.[26] A 2007 reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado may have begun 15 miles (24 km) further west than previously thought.[33] Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water (as a waterspout), tornadoes can turn white or even blue. Slow-moving funnels, which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.[28] Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is \"back-lit\" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink.[18][35] Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors that can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free,[36] making them visible.[37] Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds.[26] There is mounting evidence, including Doppler on Wheels mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the eye of tropical cyclones. Lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado.[38][39][40] Tornadoes normally rotate cyclonically (when viewed from above, this is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the Coriolis effect, thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is negligible, as indicated by their large Rossby numbers. Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected.[41][42] Low-level mesocyclones and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment.[43] Approximately 1 percent of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction in the northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell.[44] On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.[45] Tornadoes emit widely on the acoustics spectrum and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight train, rushing rapids or waterfall, a nearby jet engine, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature of and the propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.[5] The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent turbulent eddies, as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable bees or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of \"noise\".[46] Since many tornadoes are audible only when very near, sound is not to be thought of as a reliable warning signal for a tornado. Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound.[47] Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible infrasonic signatures.[48] Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long-distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation.[49] Tornadoes also produce a detectable seismic signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process.[50] Tornadoes emit on the electromagnetic spectrum, with sferics and E-field effects detected.[49][51][52] There are observed correlations between tornadoes and patterns of lightning. Tornadic storms do not produce more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning at all. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado touches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado dissipates. In many cases, intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges.[53] Luminosity has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and power flashes from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever have been recorded. In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as temperature, moisture, and atmospheric pressure. For example, on June 24, 2003, near Manchester, South Dakota, a probe measured a 100-millibar (100 hPa; 3.0 inHg) pressure decrease. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850 mbar (850 hPa; 25 inHg) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado.[54] Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as supercells. Supercells contain mesocyclones, an area of organized rotation a few kilometers/miles up in the atmosphere, usually 1.6–9.7 km (1–6 miles) across. Most intense tornadoes (EF3 to EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.[55][56] Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle which begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.[21] As the mesocyclone lowers below the cloud base, it begins to take in cool, moist air from the downdraft region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an area of low pressure at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, in the form of a visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.[21][57] Many other aspects of tornado formation (such as why some storms form tornadoes while others do not, or what precise role downdrafts, temperature, and moisture play in tornado formation) are still poorly understood.[58] Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist air flowing inward to power it, and it grows until it reaches the \"mature stage\". This can last from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than 1.6 km (1 mile) across. The low pressured atmosphere at the base of the tornado is essential to the endurance of the system.[59] Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado.[21] The flow inside the funnel of the tornado is downward, supplying water vapor from the cloud above. This is contrary to the upward flow inside hurricanes, supplying water vapor from the warm ocean below. Therefore, the energy of the tornado is supplied from the cloud above. [60][61] As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, becoming thin and rope-like. This is the \"dissipating stage\", often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado ends. During this stage, the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns.[26][34][35] Even though the tornado is dissipating, it is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, due to conservation of angular momentum, winds can increase at this point.[30] As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. Sometimes, in intense supercells, tornadoes can develop cyclically. As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm and possibly feed a new mesocyclone. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old (occluded) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.[citation needed] Although this is a widely accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development—however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one.[62] A multiple-vortex tornado is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate about their own axes and at the same time revolve around a common center. A multi-vortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path.[5][21] This is a phenomenon that is distinct from a satellite tornado, which is a smaller tornado that forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to \"orbit\" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct circulation, and is much smaller than the main funnel.[5] A waterspout is defined by the National Weather Service as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish \"fair weather\" waterspouts from tornadic (i.e. associated with a mesocyclone) waterspouts. Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar to dust devils and landspouts. They form at the bases of cumulus congestus clouds over tropical and subtropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth laminar walls, and typically travel very slowly. They occur most commonly in the Florida Keys and in the northern Adriatic Sea.[63][64][65] In contrast, tornadic waterspouts are stronger tornadoes over water. They form over water similarly to mesocyclonic tornadoes, or are stronger tornadoes which cross over water. Since they form from severe thunderstorms and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are more dangerous.[66] In official tornado statistics, waterspouts are generally not counted unless they affect land, though some European weather agencies count waterspouts and tornadoes together.[5][67] A landspout, or dust-tube tornado, is a tornado not associated with a mesocyclone. The name stems from their characterization as a \"fair weather waterspout on land\". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel that often does not reach the surface. Landspouts also create a distinctively laminar cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they can produce strong winds which could cause serious damage.[5][21] A gustnado, or gust front tornado, is a small, vertical swirl associated with a gust front or downburst. Because they are not connected with a cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are tornadoes. They are formed when fast-moving cold, dry outflow air from a thunderstorm is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a \"rolling\" effect (often exemplified through a roll cloud). If low level wind shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned vertically or diagonally and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado.[5][68] They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage.[citation needed] A dust devil (also known as a whirlwind) resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low-level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.[28][69] Small-scale, tornado-like circulations can occur near any intense surface heat source. Those that occur near intense wildfires are called fire whirls. They are not considered tornadoes, except in the rare case where they connect to a pyrocumulus or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. They can, however, produce significant damage.[26] A steam devil is a rotating updraft between 50-and-200-metre wide (160 and 660 ft) that involves steam or smoke. These formations do not involve high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.[28] The Fujita scale, Enhanced Fujita scale (EF), and International Fujita scale rate tornadoes by damage caused. The EF scale was an update to the older Fujita scale, by expert elicitation, using engineered wind estimates and better damage descriptions. The EF scale was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating, and was implemented starting in the United States in 2007. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler weather radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.[5][71][72] Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger.[73] In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from subvortices.[26] In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are EF0 and EF1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strength—less than 1% are violent tornadoes (EF4, T8 or stronger).[74] Current records may significantly underestimate the frequency of strong (EF2-EF3) and violent (EF4-EF5) tornadoes, as damage-based intensity estimates are limited to structures and vegetation that a tornado impacts. A tornado may be much stronger than its damage-based rating indicates if its strongest winds occur away from suitable damage indicators, such as in an open field.[75][76] Outside Tornado Alley, and North America in general, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America.[77] The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, nearly four times more than estimated in all of Europe, excluding waterspouts.[78] This is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent. North America is a large continent that extends from the tropics north into arctic areas, and has no major east–west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the middle latitudes, where most tornadoes of the world occur, the Rocky Mountains block moisture and buckle the atmospheric flow, forcing drier air at mid-levels of the troposphere due to downsloped winds, and causing the formation of a low pressure area downwind to the east of the mountains. Increased westerly flow off the Rockies force the formation of a dry line when the flow aloft is strong,[79] while the Gulf of Mexico fuels abundant low-level moisture in the southerly flow to its east. This unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms throughout the year. A large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the central United States known as Tornado Alley.[80] This area extends into Canada, particularly Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, although southeast Quebec, the interior of British Columbia, and western New Brunswick are also tornado-prone.[81] Tornadoes also occur across northeastern Mexico.[5] The United States averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year, followed by Canada, averaging 62 reported per year.[82] NOAA's has a higher average 100 per year in Canada.[83] The Netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country (more than 20, or 0.00048/km2, 0.0012/sq mi annually), followed by the UK (around 33, 0.00013/km2, 0.00034/sq mi per year), although those are of lower intensity, briefer[84][85] and cause minor damage.[78] Tornadoes kill an average of 179 people per year in Bangladesh, the most in the world.[86] Reasons for this include the region's high population density, poor construction quality, and lack of tornado safety knowledge.[86][87] Other areas of the world that have frequent tornadoes include South Africa, the La Plata Basin area, portions of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and far eastern Asia.[8][88] Tornadoes are most common in spring and least common in winter, but tornadoes can occur any time of year that favorable conditions occur.[26] Spring and fall experience peaks of activity as those are the seasons when stronger winds, wind shear, and atmospheric instability are present.[89] Tornadoes are focused in the right front quadrant of landfalling tropical cyclones, which tend to occur in the late summer and autumn. Tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices, which persist until landfall.[90] Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day, because of solar heating.[91] Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 15:00 (3 pm) and 19:00 (7 pm) local time, with a peak near 17:00 (5 pm).[92][93][94][95][96] Destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The Gainesville Tornado of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time.[26] The United Kingdom has the highest incidence of tornadoes per unit area of land in the world.[97] Unsettled conditions and weather fronts transverse the British Isles at all times of the years, and are responsible for spawning the tornadoes, which consequently form at all times of the year. The United Kingdom has at least 34 tornadoes per year and possibly as many as 50.[98] Most tornadoes in the United Kingdom are weak, but they are occasionally destructive. For example, the Birmingham tornado of 2005 and the London tornado of 2006 both registered F2 on the Fujita scale and both caused significant damage and injury.[99] Associations with various climate and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the sea surface temperature of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season.[100] Some evidence does suggest that the Southern Oscillation is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity, which vary by season and region, as well as whether the ENSO phase is that of El Niño or La Niña.[101] Research has found that fewer tornadoes and hailstorms occur in winter and spring in the U.S. central and southern plains during El Niño, and more occur during La Niña, than in years when temperatures in the Pacific are relatively stable. Ocean conditions could be used to forecast extreme spring storm events several months in advance.[102] Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via teleconnections in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it is reasonable to suspect that global warming may affect trends in tornado activity,[103] any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region.[104] Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm. However, with the advent of weather radar, areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public tornado warnings were issued in 1950 and the first tornado watches and convective outlooks came about in 1952. In 1953, it was confirmed that hook echoes were associated with tornadoes.[105] By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from several miles away.[106] Today most developed countries have a network of weather radars, which serves as the primary method of detecting hook signatures that are likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries, Doppler weather radar stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial direction (towards or away from the radar) of the winds within a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from over 160 km (100 miles) away. When storms are distant from a radar, only areas high within the storm are observed and the important areas below are not sampled.[107] Data resolution also decreases with distance from the radar. Some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and tornado development may occasionally take place more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data. Doppler weather radar systems can detect mesocyclones within a supercell thunderstorm. This allows meteorologists to predict tornado formations throughout thunderstorms.[108] In the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train storm spotters so they could spot key features of storms that indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as storm damage and flash flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) spotters, storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request these spotters to look out for severe weather and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.[citation needed] Spotters usually are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as sirens and the Emergency Alert System (EAS), and they forward the report to the NWS.[109] There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States.[110] In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called Canwarn, helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers.[111] In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn Europe[112] and the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since 1974.[113] Storm spotters are required because radar systems such as NEXRAD detect signatures that suggest the presence of tornadoes, rather than tornadoes as such.[114] Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or an imminent one, but ground truth from an observer can give definitive information.[115] The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.[107] Storm spotters are trained to discern whether or not a storm seen from a distance is a supercell. They typically look to its rear, the main region of updraft and inflow. Under that updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of tornadogenesis is the formation of a rotating wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell.[74] Evidence of a supercell is based on the storm's shape and structure, and cloud tower features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large overshooting top, a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level winds), and a corkscrew look or striations. Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and the likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a \"beaver tail\", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and rear flank downdraft, and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow.[21] Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and they usually precede the tornado between five and thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds may be a visual manifestation of a low-level mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly afterwards; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also develop without wall clouds, under flanking lines and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.[116] The tornado which holds most records in history was the Tri-State Tornado, which roared through parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana on March 18, 1925. It was likely an F5, though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (219 miles; 352 km), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado (73 mph; 117 km/h) anywhere on Earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead).[26] The tornado was also the costliest tornado in history at the time (unadjusted for inflation), but in the years since has been surpassed by several others if population changes over time are not considered. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it ranks third today.[117] The deadliest tornado in world history was the Daultipur-Salturia Tornado in Bangladesh on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1,300 people.[86]Bangladesh has had at least 19 tornadoes in its history that killed more than 100 people, almost half of the total in the rest of the world.[citation needed] One of the most extensive tornado outbreaks on record was the 1974 Super Outbreak, which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern Ontario on April 3 and 4, 1974. The outbreak featured 148 tornadoes in 18 hours, many of which were violent; seven were of F5 intensity, and twenty-three peaked at F4 strength. Sixteen tornadoes were on the ground at the same time during its peak. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed.[118] While direct measurement of the most violent tornado wind speeds is nearly impossible, since conventional anemometers would be destroyed by the intense winds and flying debris, some tornadoes have been scanned by mobile Doppler radar units, which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301 ± 20 mph (484 ± 32 km/h) in the F5 Bridge Creek-Moore, Oklahoma, tornado which killed 36 people.[119] The reading was taken about 100 feet (30 m) above the ground.[3] Storms that produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding 150 mph (240 km/h). Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected Great Bend, Kansas, in November 1915, was an extreme case, where a \"rain of debris\" occurred 80 miles (130 km) from the town, a sack of flour was found 110 miles (180 km) away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of Palmyra, Nebraska, 305 miles (491 km) to the northeast.[120] Waterspouts and tornadoes have been advanced as an explanation for instances of raining fish and other animals.[121] Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that can be taken to increase the chances of survival. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center in the United States advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival.[122] In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have underground storm cellars, which have saved thousands of lives.[123] Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as tornado watches and warnings in the United States and Canada). Weather radios provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, mainly available only in the United States. Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes, as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass.[124] Folklore often identifies a green sky with tornadoes, and though the phenomenon may be associated with severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes.[125] It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, the pressure difference is unlikely to cause significant damage. Opening windows may instead increase the severity of the tornado's damage.[126] A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.[126][127] Another commonly held misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. This belief is partly inspired by widely circulated video captured during the 1991 tornado outbreak near Andover, Kansas, where a news crew and several other people took shelter under an overpass on the Kansas Turnpike and safely rode out a tornado as it passed nearby.[128] However, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado, and the subjects of the video remained safe due to an unlikely combination of events: the storm in question was a weak tornado, the tornado did not directly strike the overpass,[128] and the overpass itself was of a unique design. Due to the Venturi effect, tornadic winds are accelerated in the confined space of an overpass.[129] Indeed, in the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at each of the three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries.[130] By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2,000 homes were completely destroyed and another 7,000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.[124] An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases the chances of survival.[126][127] There are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by being in a city, near a major river, hill, or mountain, or even protected by supernatural forces.[131] Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains,[132] affect valleys, and have damaged several city centers. As a general rule, no area is safe from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others.[28][126][127] Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes is newer still. Although researched for about 140 years and intensively so for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery.[133] Meteorologists have a fairly good understanding of the development of thunderstorms and mesocyclones,[134][135] and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation. However, the step from supercell, or other respective formative processes, to tornadogenesis and the prediction of tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well known and is the focus of much research.[89] Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level vorticity which tightens into a tornado,[89] in particular, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone.[136] In particular, the role of downdrafts, particularly the rear-flank downdraft, and the role of baroclinic boundaries, are intense areas of study.[137] Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with mesovortices within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones.[138] Meteorologists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued.[139] Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.[140] Research programs, including field projects such as the VORTEX projects (Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment), deployment of TOTO (the TOtable Tornado Observatory), Doppler on Wheels (DOW), and dozens of other programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists.[49] Universities, government agencies such as the National Severe Storms Laboratory, private-sector meteorologists, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the National Science Foundation.[114][141] The pace of research is partly constrained by the number of observations that can be taken; gaps in information about the wind, pressure, and moisture content throughout the local atmosphere; and the computing power available for simulation.[142] Solar storms similar to tornadoes have been recorded, but it is unknown how closely related they are to their terrestrial counterparts.[143]",

Read More > Privacy Policy Philadelphia/Mt Holly Weather Forecast Office Tornado - A violently rotating column of air touching the ground, usually attached to the base of a thunderstorm. Tornadoes are nature\"s most violent storms. Spawned from powerful thunderstorms, tornadoes can cause fatalities and devastate a neighborhood in seconds. Winds of a tornado may reach 300 miles per hour. Damage paths can be in excess of one mile wide and 50 miles long. Strong downburst (straight-line) winds may also occur due to the same thunderstom. Hail is very commonly found very close to the tornadoes, as the strongest thunderstorms that spawn tornadoes are formed under the atmospheric conditions that are also highly likely to make hail. Every state is at some risk from this hazard. Some tornadoes are clearly visible, while rain or nearby low-hanging clouds obscure others. Tornadoes develop extremely rapidly, and may dissipate just a quickly. Most tornadoes are on the ground for less than 15 minutes. Before a tornado hits, the wind may die down and the air may become very still. A cloud of debris can mark the location of a tornado even if a funnel is not visible. Tornadoes generally occur near the trailing edge of a thunderstorm. It is not uncommon to see clear, sunlit skies behind a tornado. The EF-Scale is a rating of how strong a tornado was. It is calculated by surveying the damage and comparing it with damage to similar objects at certain wind speeds. The EF-Scale is not meant to be used as a measure of how strong a tornado currently on the ground is. Link to the SPC Page on the EF-Scale The EF Scale was implemented across the country in February of 2007. The EF-Scale is meant to further refine the tornado wind-force classifications begun using the F-Scale. The use of the EF-Scale should lead to more accurate and uniform tornado strength estimates by investigators.

                "content": "Anthony Dashawn Richardson Sr. (born May 22, 2002) is an American professional football quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Florida Gators and was selected by the Colts fourth overall in the 2023 NFL draft. Richardson was born on May 22, 2002, in Miami, Florida.[1] He later attended Loften High School in Gainesville, Florida. However, he played quarterback for Eastside High School's football team.[2][3] During his high school career, he had 4,633 passing yards with 37 passing touchdowns, along with 1,633 rushing yards and 41 touchdowns.[4] He committed to play college football at the University of Florida.[5] Richardson appeared in just four games during his first year at Florida in 2020, completing one of two passes for 27 yards with a touchdown and interception.[6][7] He was able to redshirt his first year of collegiate eligibility.[8] Richardson entered 2021 as the backup to Emory Jones.[9][10][11] Against the LSU Tigers, he replaced Jones and completed 10 of 19 passes for 167 yards with three touchdowns, two interceptions and a rushing touchdown.[12] Richardson officially became the starting quarterback for the Gators in 2022. In the first game of the season, he helped lead a 29–26 upset over the seventh-ranked Utah Utes on September 3, 2022.[13] On September 24, in a 38–33 loss to the Tennessee Volunteers, Richardson passed for 453 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception to go along with 17 carries for 62 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.[14] Overall, in 2022, Richardson played in 12 games and passed for 2,549 yards, 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions, as well as rushing for 654 yards and 9 touchdowns in his first full season as a starting quarterback for a college team.[15] During his time at Florida, Richardson amassed a 6–6 record as the starting quarterback for the Gators.[16] As a collegiate player, Richardson was stated to have displayed \"dynamic talent\" as a passer and runner during his college years but lacked accuracy and consistency.[17] Richardson's physical gifts also helped propel him as a possible first-round NFL draft selection.[18] Following the end of the 2022 season, Richardson announced that he would enter the 2023 NFL draft.[19] Richardson was drafted in the first round by the Indianapolis Colts with the fourth overall pick in the 2023 NFL draft.[21] He joined Cam Newton and Daunte Culpepper as the only quarterbacks to have achieved a perfect RAS score.[22][23] During his first training camp with the Colts, Richardson underwent nasal septum surgery to improve his breathing.[24][25] On August 15, 2023, Richardson was named by head coach Shane Steichen as the Colts' starting quarterback over Gardner Minshew and Sam Ehlinger.[26] On September 10, 2023, Richardson made his NFL debut in Week 1 against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Richardson threw his first touchdown pass to Michael Pittman Jr., ran for a touchdown, and threw his first career interception to Tyson Campbell in the 31–21 loss.[27] In Week 2 against the Houston Texans, Richardson ran for two touchdowns before leaving the game with a concussion in the second quarter as a result of a hit taken as he scored his second touchdown.[28] On September 22, 2023, Richardson was declared out in Week 3 due to a concussion he suffered in Week 2.[29] He returned the next week against the Los Angeles Rams and recorded two passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown and erased a 23 point deficit in a 29–23 loss in overtime.[30] His rushing touchdown in this game marked the first time in NFL history that a rookie quarterback has scored a rushing touchdown in each of his first three starts.[31] On October 9, 2023, Richardson was placed on the injured reserve due to a grade three AC joint sprain he suffered in Week 5 against the Tennessee Titans, which was initially announced for him to miss one to two months.[32] On October 18, 2023, the Colts announced that Richardson would miss the remainder of the season, and successfully underwent shoulder surgery to repair the sprain on October 24, 2023.[33][34] Richardson opened the season as the Colts' starter after recovering from shoulder surgery the previous year. He missed Weeks 5 and 6 with an oblique injury.[35] In Week 8 against the Texans, Richardson completed 10 of 32 passes for 175 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. He also voluntarily took himself out for one play in the third quarter, stating that he \"needed a breather\" as the Colts lost 23–20.[36] Richardson was benched the following week in favor of backup quarterback Joe Flacco.[37] Prior to the benching, Richardson had generated an NFL-worst 44.4% completion percentage in six games.[38] After two losses with Flacco, the Colts announced that Richardson would be the starter for the remainder of the season, beginning in their Week 11 matchup against the New York Jets.[39] In his return as the starter, Richardson completed 67% of his passes for a career-high 272 yards, a touchdown, and added two rushing scores, including the game-winner in the final minute as the Colts won 28–27.[40] In Week 13, Richardson orchestrated a 19-play, 80-yard touchdown drive, capped off with a go-ahead two-point conversion with under 15 seconds left as the Colts came back to win 25–24 over the New England Patriots.[41]",

Richardson set a new career high with 272 passing yards – the most New York has allowed all season – and scored two rushing touchdowns, including the game-winner with 46 seconds left, as the Colts beat the Jets, 28-27, on Sunday at MetLife Stadium. Colts head coach Shane Steichen said Richardson made \"great strides\" over the last two weeks, opening the door for him to return this week as the Colts' starting quarterback. The quarterback's teammates said they still have full faith in Richardson and know he will continue to learn and develop into \"the person he's meant to be.' Head coach Shane Steichen said the Colts have not lost faith in Richardson, but made the decision to start Flacco over him in the best interest of the team. Head coach Shane Steichen made the announcement of a quarterback change from Anthony Richardson to Joe Flacco on Wednesday. Richardson completed 10 of 32 passes in the Colts' Week 8 loss to the Houston Texans. For the first time in his career, Richardson will face a team for the second time in a season when he takes the field against the Houston Texans on Sunday. Richardson (oblique) was inactive for the Colts' last two games. Anthony Richardson was listed inactive as the Colts' emergency third quarterback in their Week 6 game against the Tennessee Titans. Quarterback Anthony Richardson (oblique), wide receiver Josh Downs (toe) and wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. (back) on Friday were not ruled out for this weekend's game. The Colts held their first practice of Week 6 on Wednesday at the Indiana Farm Bureau Football Center. Here's what you need to know about the status of quarterback Anthony Richardson, running back Jonathan Taylor, center Ryan Kelly, defensive end Kwity Paye and cornerback Kenny Moore II. Richardson sustained an oblique injury in the Colts' Week 4 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Richardson (oblique) was a limited participant in Wednesday's practice, while Taylor (ankle) did not participate. The Colts improved to 2-2 with a 27-24 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday at Lucas Oil Stadium. Richardson sustained a hip injury late in the first quarter of the Colts' 27-24 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers and did not return. The Colts improved to 1-2 in 2024 with Week 3's 21-16 win over the Chicago Bears at Lucas Oil Stadium. Richardson completed 50 percent of his passes and threw two interceptions, but the Colts have ultimate confidence in their starting quarterback – with one play in the third quarter encapsulating that belief. Downs, who broke Bill Brooks' franchise rookie receptions record in 2023, has missed the Colts' first two games with an ankle injury. The Colts fell to 0-2 with Sunday's 16-10 loss to the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.

                "title": "The Great Anthony Richardson Debate - Go Long ",
                "content": "This is the continuation of a 2023 series looking at active players and their current situation vis a vis what it was entering the NFL draft. The comments from personnel men were made in the months leading up to the draft for my NFL Draft Series, which dates to 1985. Scouting football prospects is an inexact science, particularly when it comes to off-the-field considerations. It has been said that no two evaluators view a player exactly the same way. When Anthony Richardson lines up under center Sunday at Lucas Oil Stadium neither fans of his Indianapolis Colts nor of the visiting Detroit Lions have any idea what’s in store for them. Will Richardson be the error-prone, scatter-armed, overmatched quarterback that led to his benching for two games just a month ago? Or will he be the poised, rugged, dynamic playmaker of last Sunday on the road against the Jets in the most complete performance of his fledgling career? “We don’t know,” said Bill Polian, the Hall of Fame general manager for the Bills, Panthers and Colts in an NFL career that spanned 32 seasons. “You’re hoping that at the end of the year the arrow will be up and he’ll stay healthy. The injuries are a concern, obviously. Accuracy, touch, all that stuff is still in the developmental stage. He’s a developmental player at this point.” Nineteen months ago, Richardson became the fourth quarterback selected at the No. 4 slot since the inception of the common draft in 1967. The Dolphins’ Bob Griese (1967) made the Pro Bowl as a rookie and is enshrined in Canton, the Colts’ Art Schlichter (1981) started merely six games in his woeful, gambling-marred career and the Chargers’ Philip Rivers (2004) sat behind Drew Brees for two years before making the Pro Bowl in his third season. Limited by injury to just four games as a rookie, Richardson has been up and down in seven starts in Year 2. The Colts fully expected this would be the case given the fact he made only 13 starts in an injury-punctuated three seasons at Florida. Polian worked for Colts owner Jim Irsay in Indianapolis and is well-acquainted with Chris Ballard since he was hired to replace Ryan Grigson as the team’s general manager in January 2017. “Chris Ballard knows exactly what the road map is for him,” Polian said. “He’s told that to Jim; Jim’s mentioned it to me. They understand. The thing they’ve got to do is get the kid past the media and fan whiplash that will take place because everybody expects instant success. And no one has instant success.” Well, some have. The list of quarterbacks that were an immediate hit includes Dan Marino, Ben Roethlisberger, Cam Newton, Russell Wilson, Matt Ryan and C.J. Stroud. But Polian’s spot on when he says most rookies have difficulty. “Peyton (Manning) threw 26 (actually, 28) in his rookie year,” he cracked. “It’s still a record.” Others that needed at least two seasons to find themselves were Jim Plunkett, Aaron Rodgers, Alex Smith, Jared Goff, Ryan Tannehill, Sam Darnold, Baker Mayfield and Josh Allen. “The NFL has a major quarterback development problem,” an executive in personnel for an AFC team said. “Just the level of impatience anymore. It’s like petulant toddlers and their expectations of people. They take like Dan Marino’s rookie year and treat it like the norm. That’s not the norm. “The NFL is such a win-now league, and it’s only become worse with the advent of all this social media and everyone’s a genius. That’s why you’re seeing guys having success a little bit later in their careers after they were deemed garbage. Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold. Jared Goff was like a throw-in to the (Matthew Stafford) trade, and now he’s great.” Of course, some quarterbacks flop almost from the first day they step on the practice field. That long list surely would include these 15 names: Rich Campbell, Ryan Leaf, JaMarcus Russell, Zach Wilson, Josh Rosen, Cade McNown, Matt Leinart, Johnny Manziel, Jake Locker, Brady Quinn, Joey Harrington, Chuck Long, Todd Blackledge, Brandon Weeden and Dwayne Haskins. “That’s true,” Polian acknowledged. “That’s right.” Richardson’s rank inexperience, callow youth (he’s 22 ½) and boundless athletic gifts gives the Colts at least a puncher’s chance to be proven correct in the final judgment. “There’s a lot of data that would support him failing,” the AFC executive said. “But the more I watched (before the ’23 draft), this guy does too many things that nobody else can do. Sometimes when you see that much talent you’ve just got to swing the bat. The minute you start being afraid to be wrong then you’re kind of not valuable. Then you’re conservative and end up being 8-9 every year. People don’t understand there’s not a quarterback tree in the backyard.” According to Polian, he “absolutely” would have taken Richardson at No. 4 had he been back running the Colts’ draft. “You couldn’t pass up that talent,” he said. “As far as physically, as gifted a quarterback as I’ve seen. Physically, he’s got everything you want. But he’s still exceedingly young chronologically and from an experience standpoint. So it’s a work in progress, and we’ll see what happens when he reaches full maturity.” Granted, the 28-27 victory over the Jets was one game, and scouts said it was the best Richardson has played. That exquisite tape showed seven snaps in which Richardson drilled the ball on receivers at least 15 yards downfield. It showed perfect touch and accuracy on a 31-yard corner route. It showed him stiff-arming defensive end Micheal Clemons to turn the corner and demolishing safety Jalen Mills on a 2-yard touchdown run, then powering through cornerback D.J. Reed from 4 yards out to score the winning touchdown standing up. And it showed him completing an 11-yard pass on third and 9 with Clemons draped on his back. At the same time, there were a pair of fumbles and an overthrown two-point pass and a third-and-4 pass that missed badly at point-blank range. “If you had one word to tattoo on this guy’s arm right now it would be immature,” one scout said. “All of his mistakes are mainly immature. Kind of doesn’t know what he doesn’t know. “Players respect talent because they know they’re getting an opportunity to win. Yes, they want guys to work and be pros. But if you’re a real vet and have a good, solid mindset you’ll understand this is a 22-year-old kid and it might take a little bit of time.” Height: 6-4 1/4. Weight: 244 (246 at pro day). Age: 22. From: Gainesville, Fla. 40-yard dash: 4.41. Vertical jump: 40 1/2 inches. Broad jump: 10-9. Wonderlic test: 21. Arms: 32 ¾. Hands: 10 ½. His 40, vertical jump and broad jump surpassed all quarterbacks at the combine; it was one of the best testing performances ever by a quarterback. His family moved from Miami to Gainesville when he was 11. His mother, LaShanda Lane, enrolled him at Professional Academies Magnet at Loften High School, where students were trained to become first responders in various occupations. Since Loften had no interscholastic athletics program, he played football and basketball at Eastside High School. “He was not recruited to a high school, as most of these guys are,” said Polian. “He did not go to a private school. His mother sent him to a school where the aim was to get people ready to be EMTs and firefighters. It was a specialized school, and he had to commute to go play football. His mom was dedicated to seeing to it that he got a good education. I met him. He’s a nice, level-headed kid.” A wide receiver as a freshman, Richardson shifted to quarterback when another player was injured. As a junior, he suffered a meniscus tear that never healed properly. His senior season was cut short to six games by a season-ending right shoulder injury. He finished his four-year varsity career with 37 passing touchdowns and 41 rushing touchdowns. Richardson committed to nearby Florida in the summer between his sophomore and junior year. After decommitting and almost signing with Penn State, he went back to the Gators. He averaged 10.5 points and 7.5 rebounds as a junior, his final season of prep basketball. As a freshman in 2020, Richardson attempted two passes in just four games, preserving his redshirt status as the Gators went 8-4 under coach Dan Mullen. The top two quarterbacks were Kyle Trask and Emory Jones. The Gators slipped to 6-7 in 2021 and Mullen was fired after 11 games. He made one start, in Game 8 against Georgia when Florida went off as a 14-point underdog. Richardson struggled in the 34-7 defeat, passing for 82 yards and two interceptions before leaving near the halfway mark after taking a shot to the head and neck area. In all, Richardson completed 38 of 64 passes (59.4%) for an NFL passer rating of 84.7. His injuries in 2021 included a pulled hamstring, a concussion and a meniscus tear in his knee that he reportedly suffered while dancing in the team hotel and missed the Nov. 6 game at South Carolina. He reinjured the knee three weeks later in the finale against Florida State and underwent cartilage surgery. In April 2022, Richardson was ticketed for driving 105 mph in a 60-mph zone at 4:11 a.m. outside of Gainesville. He pleaded no contest and was ordered to complete a traffic safety course, write an essay and pay a $349 fine. Two months later, Richardson was drunk at the Manning Passing Academy at Nicholls State (La.) University. The police reportedly became angry when he leaned on a squad car. Manning staffers ushered him into a van but Richardson screamed an obscenity at officers as he departed the scene. No arrest was made. Under new coach Billy Napier, Richardson started 12 games in another 6-7 season, opting out of the bowl game and giving up his final two years of eligibility to enter the NFL draft. His passer rating was 85.3 in 2022, and 85.1 for his career. Also, he rushed 161 times for 1,116 yards, a 6.9-yard average and 12 touchdowns. He fumbled eight times in three seasons. His career completion mark was 54.7%. His career won-lost record was 6-7. Chris Ballard was about to enter his third season as general manager of the Colts in August 2019 when quarterback Andrew Luck announced his retirement. Abruptly, and without warning. It was “a nuclear weapon launched in the middle of that regime,” an executive in personnel for an AFC South Division team said. With Luck, the successor to all-time quarterback Peyton Manning, the Colts reached the playoffs four times and won four playoff games in his seven years. A pack of veterans — Jacoby Brissett, Philip Rivers, Carson Wentz, Matt Ryan — each held the job for one year from 2019-’22. Their composite record of 31-34-1 (and 0-1 in the playoffs) left the Colts with tremendous urgency to draft a quarterback in 2023. After doing their due diligence for months, the Colts determined that Ohio State’s C.J. Stroud and Florida’s Anthony Richardson, in that order, were the top prospects. Alabama’s Bryce Young wasn’t a consideration. Kentucky’s Will Levis was the other candidate. In my survey of 16 evaluators that April, Young finished with 10 first-place votes and 72 points followed by Stroud (two, 56), Levis (three, 46) and Richardson (one, 40). When asked which of the leading quarterbacks had the best chance to bust, Richardson drew eight votes, Levis had five, Stroud got two and Young had one. The evaluations of Richardson by the Colts included early reports from assistant director of college scouting/Southeast area scout Jamie Moore and chief personnel executive Morocco Brown, who handled the cross-check. That was during the 2022 season. After the season, Ballard, assistant GM Ed Dodds and the entire scouting division studied tape of the quarterbacks in group and individual sessions. “I give Roc (Brown) credit, he was fired up about it (Richardson) from the start,” Dodds told reporters in Indianapolis a few days after the selection of Richardson. “I went down there early in the year, and he wasn’t playing as well. It’s just a hard study, right? “Last year, I’m talking his sophomore year (2021), he threw like 60 balls. There’s really not an accurate grade on the scale for a guy that, ‘OK, he’s got blue traits but there’s no resume.’ Then the very little part that he has, it was a roller coaster all year. I was kind of late. I was hard on him at first.” After Richardson made waves posting the extraordinary testing numbers at the combine in late February, the Colts sent only Brown to his pro day in Gainesville. Later, some of their coaches and scouts worked him out privately in Florida and then had him in for a visit at the team’s facility. Richardson’s score of 21 on the Wonderlic test was a mild concern for the coaches after the combine. Later, after putting Richardson on the so-called board peppering him with tactical football questions, those concerns were alleviated. There also were questions involving the inexperience, the inaccurate passing, the injury history and the off-field incidents. “There are a lot of guys that I know that I trust that I talked to about him and everything was right at the top of the list as far as that concern,” said Shane Steichen, who had yet to coach his first game for the Colts. “Then, just going through having him here, getting to know him as a person, talking football with him, I think he’s got a chance to be a really good player in this league.” On April 27, Young went No. 1 to Carolina, Stroud went No. 2 to Houston, edge rusher Will Anderson Jr. of Alabama went No. 3 to Houston and Richardson went No. 4 to Indianapolis. Driving home April 29 upon completion of the three-day draft, Ballard got to the heart of the matter to select this talented but untamed quarterback in an interview with NBC’s Peter King. “I would rather take the risk, the risk that he might fail, than pass on him and see him become a star somewhere else,” Ballard said. “We’re taking a guy not only for what he can do today but for what he can become tomorrow. “I’ve told our guys here: Anthony might have some games where he’s nine of 22 for 105 but in the game he’ll run 10 times for 115 yards. It just might look different for a while. “We gotta get him in here and see where he is. We don’t know. He turns 21 this month (May 22) — he’s so young still. Let us figure out what he can handle before making any decisions. But there’s not many people who can do what he does.” The Colts went to training camp in 2023 with Gardner Minshew, a five-year veteran; Sam Ehlinger, a three-year veteran, and Richardson at quarterback. On his first drive in the exhibition opener at Buffalo, Richardson threw a careless, wayward pass in the flat that was intercepted and set up a touchdown. Two days later, Shane Steichen informed Richardson and Minshew that the rookie would start the season. “Honestly, I was shocked,” said Richardson. “I want to be great. I want to be remembered. I don’t want to just be one of those guys like, ‘Well, he was in the league.’ I want my legacy to be remembered forever.” Said Minshew: “This is his franchise. That’s the reason they picked him where he is. And he’s going to be really special.” In Game 2 of the regular season, Richardson suffered a concussion in the second quarter at Houston on the second of his two touchdown runs. After sitting out a week, he returned to start against the Rams (a 29-23 overtime loss) and against the Titans (a 23-16 win). His season ended in the first half against Tennessee when linebacker Harold Landry dragged him down on a scramble. He suffered a sprain of the AC joint in his right shoulder and underwent surgery. “You go back and watch tape from 2023 prior to his injury and he was playing pretty well,” an AFC South scout said. “I didn’t think he was making bad mental decisions. Only thing he didn’t do well was take too many hits. He’s not necessarily the best at being tackled. When you get to the NFL, where there are a lot of big, strong guys, you’ve got to use your head a little bit more. That’s what his biggest blunder was early in his rookie year.” Playing just 12 quarters, Richardson posted a passer rating of 87.3 while rushing for 136 yards and four touchdowns. This year, the Colts signed Joe Flacco for one year and $5 million while bringing back Ehlinger, who is close to Richardson and operates almost as the de-facto assistant quarterbacks coach. “It’s a lot on him now,” Ballard said in late August. “Now all of a sudden you get drafted, you got the injury, you become a dad — handling the pressure and the expectations. He’s still young. I mean, like any 22-year-old young man, they’re not fully matured yet even though they think they are. But just being probably more aware of everything that he’s got going on around him. Responsible, really tightening his circle up of who’s involved, who’s with him. “Like with any young player, there’s ups and there’s downs, and they look bad and they’ll look great. That’s normal. They get beat, they miss a pass, they drop a ball. I mean, (bleep) happens. Unfortunately, Twitter today accentuates the one negative. There might be 10 positives but there’s the one negative that they’ll pull out and just needle at.” The Colts got off to a 2-2 start. In Game 4, a 27-24 victory over Pittsburgh, Richardson suffered oblique and hip injuries and missed the next two games. After misfiring on some easy passes and tossing two interceptions Sept. 22 in a 21-16 victory over Chicago, Richardson tried to explain his frustrations. “Not necessarily pressing but it’s, like, ‘Oh, my God, it’s wide open, let me give him the ball,’” Richardson said. “And I just get too excited and I just miss. So I’ve just got to let it spin and just give him the ball. Just get too antsy.” Asked if he was injury prone a few days after being hurt against the Steelers, Richardson replied: “I’m pretty sure if they (people that wonder if he’s injury prone) got out of the house and came out here and got hit by somebody that’s running 20-plus miles per hour every week, I’m pretty sure they’d be dealing with injuries as well. People are going to talk. That’s what people do.” Back in the lineup Oct. 27 at Houston, Richardson turned in possibly his worst performance of the season in a 23-20 loss. At one point, he removed himself from the game for one play after he ran around and was tackled. “Tired — I ain’t going to lie,” he said. Amid deafening criticism from far and wide, and amid obvious concerns about a disgruntled locker room, Steichen announced the change to Joe Flacco while maintaining that the tap-out didn’t impact the decision. “I mean, he knows he can’t do that in that situation,” he said. “That’s part of the growth and development process that we go through … I feel that Joe gives us the best chance to win right now. With that being said, not giving up on Anthony by any means — really not.” Said Flacco, the 17-year veteran: “He’s very young with a bright future. Now I know this is a little bit different because it feels like you’re getting something taken away from you. I think there are a lot of advantages of being able to remove yourself a little bit and watch from a distance and learn. Not to talk for the Colts and Shane, but you would think that’s part of the thought process, at least a little bit, is to try to help him out.” Two days after the Colts went 0-2 under Flacco, Steichen switched back to Richardson in a move he said was for the remainder of the season. The next day, defensive tackle DeForest Buckner, a nine-year veteran, reiterated what Steichen had been suggesting for weeks. Namely, that Richardson would have to devote even more time and energy to his job. “As a player, to go where you have never been and become the player that you want to be, you have to be willing to do things that you’ve never done and make certain sacrifices you’ve never made,” said Buckner. “At the end of the day, there’s a price that needs to be paid. I feel like within this process the past two weeks, he’s been able to really see that and that’s what gives us so much confidence in him. Knowing that he’s rooting in the process and he’s developing as a pro.” Richardson’s first game back probably was the finest of his career in the come-from-behind 28-27 road victory over the Jets. His 2024 stats include a 4-3 record, a 66.2 passer rating and 274 rushing yards. After 11 games (6-5 record), his career passer rating is 73.4. NFC scout: “It depends on where he goes. Teams can really screw these guys up. He has rare stuff. Really, really unique tools to work with. He’s not as far off as I thought he’d be when you really study him. The narrative was he was this huge project. I don’t see it as that big of a project. You’re closer to getting him on the field than he was given credit for.” AFC scout: “If there was a dunk contest he’d win. We don’t love him but he’s talented. He hasn’t played. Started one year and wasn’t very good.” NFC scout: “He cannot play quarterback. This guy has no feel for the position at all. He is raw as raw can be. He’s got no vision, no feel. His delivery is like he’s never thrown a football before. He’s not accurate. He’ll have a couple wow plays just running around but he isn’t even that special just running around. He doesn’t know when to run and when not to run. Lacks pocket poise. He’s a project, a gadget guy project. Guys like this don’t change ... Maybe once a game he’ll move around and just chuck it. Besides that, he chucks it up into coverage all the time. Ten times he just chucks it up into coverage vs. the one time it actually looks good … Let me know the first time there’s a combine warrior quarterback that’s a Super Bowl champ or MVP. Amazing. Vertical jump and 40 – what does that have to do with playing quarterback? Or reading the defense? Nothing.” AFC scout: “Great kid. Does he live it enough to do the extra that it’s going to take so he can catch up to the others with regard to footwork and being able to process and look at the defense, (make) post-snap reads and decision-making? With him, you just don’t know. You have to be able to play the position … Think Michael Vick with a Brett Favre arm. Ripped-up muscle. This dude ran 4.42. He’s a monster. He has the highest ceiling I’ve ever seen in a quarterback. Even higher than Cam Newton. Cam was fast and big but not as fast as this kid. Cam had a strong arm but not as strong as this kid. This kid is unique … If you hit on him, oh my God, you’re talking perennial Pro Bowl (and) All-Pro. But it’s a big if. Are you going to be employed long enough to see it through? Or will it be another (coaching) staff?” NFC scout: “If (Colts GM Chris) Ballard takes him at No. 4, he’s stupid. (Richardson) scares the fuck out of me … If you use him right he may not (bust). He’s got to sit a minimum of two years. That’s why you’ve got a guy for five years. You hope your guys can develop him. He’s so gifted athletically you almost got to take a shot and just see what happens. But what is that value at? … All the talent in the world has only started 13 games in the NCAA. If you want to measure his record against Mitchell Trubisky, 6-7 record shows you need more seasoning. He should have stayed in college … He’s more athletic than Cam Newton, I can tell you that. He can (rush), too. Just as good an athlete as Lamar Jackson. Different style of running, but as good. That’s what his strength is. He has unbelievable feet and lateral agility. He’s got incredible arm strength. But he doesn’t know how to play the game yet.” AFC scout: “I don’t know if there is one (an apt comparison). Josh Allen? That’s ridiculous. I haven’t seen many like him. Maybe Cam Newton. Colin Kaepernick? This guy is so big and so fast. Colin was fast, could get out and run. Colin wasn’t an accomplished passer. Maybe they are similar.” NFC scout: “Love the ability. I’m concerned that he hasn’t played a lot of football and he hasn’t done a lot of winning. Even in high school they were kind of average … I have problems with his accuracy. I think he has a long way to go but he has tons of potential. He scares me. The accuracy scares me. His experience scares me … Believe it or not, I think Richardson has a little more natural ability to throw the ball than Lamar did. He runs well but not as good as him (Jackson) … I had Justin Fields graded higher coming out … Terrelle Pryor was just a tremendous athlete. That’s actually not a bad comparison.” AFC scout: “He is tremendously talented. I did see improvement throughout the year. There’s not a lot of natural rhythm and timing. He’s still working through that stuff. I know he was in a new offense this year, which is hard. It wouldn’t surprise me if he went No. 1 because he is so physically talented. My impression is he’s a pretty good kid and I do think football’s pretty important to him … I wish he would have played another year of college football but I can’t blame him because he’s going to be a high pick and there’s good quarterbacks in next year’s class, too. But I have major reservations about guys that have started one year. It’s hard. I think his inconsistencies are time on the job and having different coaches in his three-year career there … I don’t think he’s as elusive or dynamic as Lamar Jackson with the ball in his hand. He is big and powerful. The only guy I could even comp with him physically was Josh Allen just because of his size and explosiveness. Richardson actually is faster. In terms of jumping and explosiveness, Allen is the only other guy that’s even close that I’ve seen … Cam Newton was a big, strong player, too, and was probably a better thrower. Not as strong an arm but maybe a little better passer because he had played more … He’s bigger than Justin Fields. Fields was a better quarterback coming out than Richardson is right now … This isn’t a slight to anyone but I could see him in an offense similar to what Philadelphia does with Jalen Hurts, a kid’s that developing into being a very dangerous and dynamic player. Jalen’s intangibles were so high. He had won at Alabama, won at Oklahoma. He was a much more experienced player … Just from a skill standpoint, no reason this kid can’t be successful in the NFL. He is a freak athlete. In my mind, if Richardson’s a bust, it’s because either he gets hurt or it’s the organization. If you take that kid you have to be committed to doing what he can do. History tells us four of the (top) five will be busts.” NFC scout: “He is a freak athlete for his size. He’s got maybe the best arm and is the most physically gifted kid. I don’t know about his decision-making. Does he have the natural feel for the position? Physically, he has all the tools you want. It’s just, does he know how to play quarterback or not? Can someone get him to play quarterback? He’s very raw still. He has to learn how to go through progressions. He’s a year or two away but he has the highest ceiling of any of them … Not Kaepernick. Richardson is more Cam Newton but he throws the ball better. It’s just his accuracy is off some. He’s way better than Terrelle Pryor … I was at his pro day. He put on a show. At his pro day he didn’t throw with the laces. The ball looked like a Nerf ball in his hand for how big his hand is. Whichever way it comes back he throws it – with or without the laces.” AFC scout: “This guy’s the most incredible prototype. He’s 6-4 ¼, 243, ran 4.43. He’s the biggest, strongest candidate in the history of the NFL. He’s faster than Cam (Newton), he’s bigger than Michael Vick by a mile. He is rare … In a traditional NFL sense, you would say bust. He isn’t going to have it from the mental part. But if in today’s NFL, where there’s enough college stuff percolating around, and we saw what happened with (Jalen) Hurts, there’s at least a 50-50 chance that he can do it … In high school they were 7-4 and he got hurt. They take him at Florida and he’s a 5-star and he redshirts. Then they say, ‘We’re about to get fired, we’ve got to get him on the field.’ So they get him on the field and he gets hurt. He played some in ’21 and this year, his first to actually start …. Remember the Utah game (Sept. 3 at Florida)? You could have sold his stock sky-high that night. A week later, he’s throwing picks against Kentucky and looks haphazard and just average … If Shane Steichen did what he did with Jalen Hurts, then you gotta believe somebody out there thinks, ‘OK, we can do something similar because this guy’s more gifted.’” NFC scout: “Sky’s the limit. Probably more Lamar Jackson with a little bit of Josh Allen thrown in there. If he ever figures it out … The first Utah game (Sept. 3), he had time to prepare and was completely different. He’s so big and strong, and he can throw it forever. I’m not going to say he’s not going to make it.” NFC scout: “He could take a bad team and make ‘em at least mediocre. He could win seven or eight games, but that’s it for him until his passing improves. People call him developmental. He’s a project … He played one year of college football. He got all his notoriety because he can run. Then he shows up at the combine and he’s as big as the (edge) rushers that are going to try to chase him down. He’s as fast or maybe faster than them. But I’m going to tell you, he is not a quarterback. I don’t think he has vision. He runs around until he finds somebody open and throws the ball … I think (Tim) Tebow was a little bit better than him. Vince Young is a good call. He’s got athletic talent and physical toughness but he’s a sandlot quarterback. It just takes too long, and you don’t have time (in the NFL). Even if you (draft) him and pick up the fifth-year option, you’re going to have to coach him and train him, and he’s only played one year. He throws the ball all over the f------ field.” AFC scout: “Some games he has more tackles than completions (laughs). They’d have to build a system around him. But, why not? Lamar (Jackson) did it.” AFC scout: “Know who he reminded me of? Vince Young. Also Terrelle Pryor. (Pryor) ran high 4.3’s at Pitt Stadium on astroturf. We didn’t think he’d be an NFL quarterback but we weren’t going to discourage him. He stayed at quarterback for a couple years, and once he saw he wasn’t a quarterback moved to receiver. Pryor was a great athlete, too … I don’t like Richardson but he’s a great athlete. He’s not a great passer. He has no feel. They had some talent on that (Florida) team but they had a bad season, and I think it all reflects on him. More slinger, not a passer. I questioned his decisions, his mechanics. Justin Fields was better as a football player. Richardson was so inconsistent … If you take him in the first (round) you’re taking a big risk. He’s not a pro quarterback.” NFC scout: “He’s got a little Vince Young in him. He’s a freak athlete but he’s a long ways away as an NFL passer. I mean, a long way away. He’s one of those raw, green guys. I don’t want him. He’s a raw athlete. That’s what you’re banking on. You’re rolling some big dice if you take him in the first, or (you have) a lot of rocks in your head.” AFC scout: “I think the easy answer (for No. 1 bust) is to say Anthony Richardson but I think his talent level is too good. Hopefully, he goes to a system that suits him.” NFC scout: “I worry about that (intelligence) on him but he’s such a rare talent that you take a chance on him. I don’t see it (top 10), no, but somebody’s going to take him. Just look around. People talk about taking him in the top five picks. I’m, like, ‘Holy shit.’ Glad I’m not picking him. I’d be scared to death of him … His accuracy is really off. That’s the one that scares you on him … It was just like Terrelle Pryor when he came out. He ran 4.4. I’d have drafted him in the fourth. Al (Davis) took him in the third. He was promising for a while, with limitations, but he didn’t get beyond a certain point. That’s what I think will happen to Richardson.” Dan Campbell, Lions coach: “What you saw last week was (Richardson) at his best. I’m not even sure you can go back to earlier in the year because I feel they’ve taken the handcuffs off him. They’ve got quarterback power, they’ve got the RPO, they’ve got the read run, they’ve got play-action off that, and then he can scramble. Then, if he’s in the pocket and you’ve got your arms around him trying to bring him to the ground, he’ll just stiff-arm you off him and then throw it down the field. It’s rare, his strength, and he really does have a nice deep ball. He’s an accurate passer down the field, and I mean deep. It’s all-encompassing is what it is.” Teryl Austin, Steelers defensive coordinator: “He’s just an avatar of an athlete. You’ll see him on some designed quarterback runs (where) guys will have an angle on him and he’ll beat them to the sideline. He’s unique in that way. Even as he’s moving a little bit off balance he has the ability to uncork a bomb. That’s always dangerous. We obviously preach with our guys to make sure they don’t relax at any time against this guy.” Eric Washington, Bears defensive coordinator: “That’s tough defensively when the quarterback is a second runner.” Zaire Franklin, Colts linebacker: “I think after the Houston situation (tap-out) I think he’s just dug a little deeper and has been giving more of himself. Not only to the team but to the game.” NFC executive in personnel: “Yes, he was a mess in college, and hasn’t changed.” Aaron Glenn, Lions defensive coordinator: “Listen, if you’re in his way, he’s going to try to run over you, and his arm is lively. He’s at his minus-30 and throws it 70 yards on one foot. One thing that’s underrated about this quarterback is his ability to be accurate down the field.” Not only is the jury not in on Anthony Richardson, it hasn’t been sequestered or even called. Let’s be honest. No one has a clue if he’ll end up being a star, a bust or somewhere in between.

Watt Derrick Henry In the NFL if your QB lacks decision making skills he will cost you more games than he will win you with his physical skills. Yes you can teach the player how to play the NFL game but it takes time and time is not something that most clubs in today’s NFL can afford to give to the position that touches the ball on every offensive play. Anthony’s selection by the Colts reportedly was an organizational one, meaning EVERYONE agreed that his development would require time for him to learn the NFL game. Their practice in playing him thus far however seems to be more of a need to get his superstar arm and fleet feet in the game and that is not congruent with their intended plan. The result thus far is what it is and will be unless they give the kid the time to develop. Decision making at an organizational level must be aligned and practiced. If not then the result will be what you deserve….and that won’t be the benefit you seek nor will your QB be all that he could be. Sit the kid down or you failed him and not the other way around. Hope it works out for the kid. From here it looks like a classic case of googly eyes over athletic ability and trying to, in a relative crash course (even if he would've sat a couple years) turn an incredible athlete with minimal experience into a world-class QB. That's a tall task in any case, but even more when he has a heavy injury history and there are obviously-if reading between the lines-questions about his work ethic. He'll need to become a world-class worker, continue to progress in all the nuances of the position at a fast rate, and stay healthy to reach the potential of what some think he can be.
