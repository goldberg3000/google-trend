                "content": "See text Eagle is the common name for the golden eagle, bald eagle, and other birds of prey in the family of the Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several groups of genera, some of which are closely related. True eagles comprise the genus Aquila. Most of the 68 species of eagles are from Eurasia and Africa.[1] Outside this area, just 14 species can be found—two in North America, nine in Central and South America, and three in Australia. Eagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any kind of bird of prey large enough to hunt sizeable (about 50 cm long or more overall) vertebrates. The word \"eagle\" is borrowed into English from Anglo-Norman: eagle and Middle French: aigle, both derived ultimately from Latin: aquila (\"eagle\"). It is cognate with terms such as French: aigle, Portuguese: águia and Spanish: águila.[2] It is broadly synonymous with the less common English term \"erne\" or \"earn\", deriving from Middle English: ern, from Old English: earn, in which it acts as the usual word for the bird. The Old English term is turn derived from Proto-Germanic: *arnuz and is cognate with other synonymous words in Germanic languages such as Swedish: örn, German: Aar and Gothic: ara. Through the Proto-Indo-European root, it is further related to words such as Greek: ὄρνις (\"bird\") and Lithuanian: erelis (\"eagle\"). Although \"erne\" can be used to refer to any eagle, it is most commonly used for the golden eagle or sea-eagle.[3][4] Eagles are large, powerfully-built birds of prey, with heavy heads and beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as the booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus), which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (Buteo buteo) or red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct, faster flight, despite the reduced size of their aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors, apart from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is the Great Nicobar serpent eagle (Spilornis klossi), at 450 g (1 lb) and 40 cm (16 in). The largest species are discussed below. Like all birds of prey, eagles have very large hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey, strong, muscular legs, and powerful talons. The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful. It is estimated that the wedge-tailed eagle has a visual acuity twice that of a typical human.[5][6][7] This acuity enables eagles to spot potential prey from a very long distance. This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming light. Like most diurnal raptors, eagles have little ability to see ultraviolet light.[8] The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the male.[9][10] Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the older, larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. The parents take no action to stop the killing.[11][12] It is said[by whom?] that eagles fly above clouds but this is not true.[citation needed] Eagles fly during storms and glide from the wind's pressure. This saves the bird's energy. Due to the size and power of many eagle species, they are ranked at the top of the food chain as apex predators in the avian world. The type of prey varies by genus. The Haliaeetus and Icthyophaga eagles prefer to capture fish, though the species in the former often capture various animals, especially other water birds, and are powerful kleptoparasites of other birds. The snake and serpent eagles of the genera Circaetus, Terathopius, and Spilornis predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes found in the tropics of Africa and Asia. The eagles of the genus Aquila are often the top birds of prey in open habitats, taking almost any medium-sized vertebrate they can catch. Where Aquila eagles are absent, other eagles, such as the buteonine black-chested buzzard-eagle of South America, may assume the position of top raptorial predator in open areas. Many other eagles, including the species-rich genus Spizaetus, live predominantly in woodlands and forests. These eagles often target various arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds, which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense, knotty environments. Hunting techniques differ among the species and genera, with some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques based on their environment and prey at any given time. Most eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it, so the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart.[13] The bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified to be carried by any flying bird, since one eagle flew with a 6.8 kg (15 lb) mule deer fawn.[14][15] However, a few eagles may target prey considerably heavier than themselves; such prey is too heavy to fly with, thus it is either eaten at the site of the kill or taken in pieces back to a perch or nest. Golden and crowned eagles have killed ungulates weighing up to 30 kg (66 lb) and a martial eagle even killed a 37 kg (82 lb) duiker, 7–8 times heavier than the preying eagle.[13][16] Authors on birds David Allen Sibley, Pete Dunne, and Clay Sutton described the behavioral difference between hunting eagles and other birds of prey thus (in this case the bald and golden eagles as compared to other North American raptors):[17] They have at least one singular characteristic. It has been observed that most birds of prey look back over their shoulders before striking prey (or shortly thereafter); predation is after all a two-edged sword. All hawks seem to have this habit, from the smallest kestrel to the largest Ferruginous – but not the Eagles. Among the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey: only the condors and some of the Old World vultures are markedly larger. It is regularly debated[according to whom?] which should be considered the largest species of eagle. They could be measured variously in total length, body mass, or wingspan. Different lifestyle needs among various eagles result in variable measurements from species to species. For example, many forest-dwelling eagles, including the very large harpy eagle, have relatively short wingspans, a feature necessary for being able to maneuver in quick, short bursts through densely forested habitats.[13] Eagles in the genus Aquila, found almost exclusively in open country, are noted for their ability to soar, and have relatively long wings for their size.[13] These lists of the top five eagles are based on weight, length, and wingspan, respectively. Unless otherwise noted by reference, the figures listed are the median reported for each measurement in the guide Raptors of the World[18] in which only measurements that could be personally verified by the authors were listed.[13] The eagles are generally distributed in all types of habitats and nearly all parts of the world. The birds can be found in northern tundra to tropical rainforests and deserts. In North America, bald eagles and golden eagles are very common. Eagles are often informally divided into four groups.[a][25] The snake eagles are placed in the subfamily Circaetinae. The fish eagles, booted eagles, and harpy eagles have traditionally been placed in the subfamily Buteoninae together with the buzzard-hawks (buteonine hawks) and harriers. Some authors may treat these groups as tribes of the Buteoninae; Lerner & Mindell[26] proposed separating the eagle groups into their own subfamilies of Accipitridae. Sea eagles or fish eagles take fish as a large part of their diets, either fresh or as carrion. Proposed subfamily Haliaeetinae. Genera: Haliaeetus, Icthyophaga. Some authors include Gypohierax angolensis, the \"vulturine fish eagle\" (also called the palm-nut vulture) in this group.[25] However, genetic analyses indicate it is related to a grouping of Neophron–Gypaetus–Eutriorchis (Egyptian vulture, bearded vulture (lammergeier), and Madagascar serpent eagle).[27] The fish eagles have a close genetic relationship with Haliastur and Milvus; the whole group is only distantly related to the Buteo group.[27] Fish eagles exist in every continent throughout the world, except for South America.[28] Although fish eagles can be found in many different places around the world, they have been classified as \"Near Threatened\". Reasons such as overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and the use of pesticides have contributed to the species' rapid population drop.[29] The booted eagle is a group of eagle that typically migrates across the Sahara Desert to Europe. It usually reaches Europe around the beginning of March and leaves by the end of September. It's interesting to note that these types of eagles usually mate with the same partner and return to the same areas years later. Female booted eagles usually lay 1-4 eggs, which promptly hatch after 37 to 40 days. Researchers estimate that there are between 3600 and 6900 pairs of booted eagles in Europe, which are mostly situated in the Iberian Peninsula.[30] Booted eagles or \"true eagles\"[25][31] have feathered tarsi (lower legs). Tribe Aquililae or proposed subfamily Aquilinae. Genera: Aquila, Hieraaetus; Spizaetus, Oroaetus, Spizastur; Nisaetus;[27] Ictinaetus, Lophoaetus; Polemaetus; and Stephanoaetus.[25][31] See comments under eagle species for changes to the composition of these genera. Most snake or serpent eagles, as the name suggests, primarily prey on snakes. Despite filling the niche of a snake eagle, genetic studies suggest that the Madagascar serpent eagle (Eutriorchis) is not related to them.[27] Over several decades, a great deal of research has been done on the Snake-eagle's diet, which is mainly made up of reptiles, especially snakes. When it comes to catching snakes, it is generally accepted that the bird exhibits generalist feeding behavior, which means it does not hunt down specific types of snakes but rather feeds on them depending on their availability in the wild.[32] Harpy eagles[25] or \"giant forest eagles\"[24] are large eagles that inhabit tropical forests. The group contains two to six species, depending on the author. Although these birds occupy similar niches and have traditionally been grouped, they are not all related: the solitary eagles are related to the black hawks and the Philippine eagle to the snake eagles. Major new research into eagle taxonomy suggests that the important genera Aquila and Hieraaetus are not composed of nearest relatives, and it is likely that a reclassification of these genera will soon take place, with some species being moved to Lophaetus or Ictinaetus.[26] Family Accipitridae The modern English term for the bird is derived from Latin: aquila by way of French: aigle. The origin of aquila is unknown, but it is believed to possibly derive from aquilus (meaning dark-colored, swarthy, or blackish) as a reference to the plumage of eagles. Old English used the term earn, related to Scandinavia's ørn/örn. It is similar to other Indo-European terms for \"bird\" or \"eagle\", including Greek: ὄρνις (ornís), Russian: орёл (orël), and Welsh: eryr. In the southern part of Finland, near the Gulf of Finland, is the town of Kotka, which literally means \"eagle\", while the town of L'Aquila in the central part of Italy literally means \"the eagle\". In Britain before 1678, eagle referred specifically to the golden eagle, with the other native species, the white-tailed eagle, being known as erne. The modern name \"golden eagle\" for aquila chrysaetos was introduced by the naturalist John Ray.[33] The village of Eagle in Lincolnshire, England, has nothing to do with the bird; its name is derived from the Old English words for \"oak\" and \"wood\" (compare Oakley).[34] In the ancient Sumerian mythology, the mythical king Etana was said to have been carried into heaven by an eagle.[35] Classical writers such as Lucan and Pliny the Elder claimed that the eagle was able to look directly at the sun, and that they forced their fledglings to do the same. Those that blinked would be cast from the nest. This belief persisted until the Medieval era.[36] The eagle is the patron animal of the ancient Greek god Zeus. In particular, Zeus was said to have taken the form of an eagle in order to abduct Ganymede, and there are numerous artistic depictions of the eagle Zeus bearing Ganymede aloft, from Classical times up to the present (see illustrations in the Ganymede (mythology) page.)[37] Eagles appear metaphorically in many translations of the Old Testament. God is spoken of as carrying Israel on \"eagles' wings\" in Exodus 19:4, Isaiah 40:31 compares those who wait on the Lord to flying eagles, and Psalm 103 mentions renewing one's youth \"as the eagle\". In explaining this rejuvenation, Augustine of Hippo says in his commentary on the Psalms that eagles' beaks overgrow as they age and that they break them against rocks to restore them.[38] The translation, however, is uncertain: the word in the Hebrew, נשר, can also be translated vulture,[39] and is listed alongside specific kinds of vulture in Leviticus' discussion of unclean animals. The eagle is also often used in Christian iconography to represent the Gospel of John,[40] and eagle-shaped lecterns are common in Anglican and some Roman Catholic churches.[41] The eagle was believed to be able to look directly into the sun in the same way that the Gospel of John looks directly at Jesus' divinity, and the great distances the eagle flies represent the spread of the gospel to the ends of the earth. The United States eagle feather law stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain eagle feathers for religious or spiritual reasons.[42] In Canada, the poaching of eagle feathers for the booming U.S. market has sometimes resulted in the arrests of First Nations person for the crime.[43] The Moche people of ancient Peru worshiped the eagle and often depicted eagles in their art.[44] The golden eagle was sacred to the Aztec god Huitzilopochtli while the harpy eagle was sacred to Quetzalcoatl.[45] Eagles are an exceptionally common symbol in heraldry, being considered the \"King of Birds\" in contrast to the lion, the \"King of Beasts\". Whereas the lion (e.g. England) usually represents authority, the eagle is the symbol of power. They are particularly popular in Germanic countries such as Austria, due to their association with the Holy Roman Empire. The eagle of the Holy Roman Empire was two-headed, supposedly representing the two divisions, East and West, of the old Roman Empire. This motif, derived from the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire was also adopted by the Russian Empire and is still featured in the Flag of Albania. The Roman eagle was preceded by the eagle of Ptolemaic Egypt and the Achaemenid Empire. In the coat of arms of Kotka, Finland, the eagle is depicted carrying an anchor and the caduceus on its feet. Heraldic eagles are most often found displayed, i.e. with their wings and legs extended. They can also occur close, i.e. with their wings folded, or rising, i.e. about to take flight. The heads, wings, and legs of eagles can also be found independently. Eagles symbolize strength, courage, and independence and are commonly found in the heraldry of many nations across the world. Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Dagestan, Egypt, Germany, Ghana, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Montenegro, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Palestine, Panama, Russia, Romania, Serbia, South Sudan, Somaliland, the United States of America, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe are the nations whose coats of arms feature an eagle. The eagle's continuing significance and worldwide appeal as a forceful symbol in national identity and imagery is demonstrated by its widespread usage.[46]",

                "content": "Chronological history Vikings were seafaring people originally from Scandinavia (present-day Denmark, Norway, and Sweden),[3][4][5][6] who from the late 8th to the late 11th centuries raided, pirated, traded, and settled throughout parts of Europe.[7][8][9] They also voyaged as far as the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle East, Greenland, and Vinland (present-day Newfoundland in Canada, North America). In their countries of origin, and some of the countries they raided and settled in, this period is popularly known as the Viking Age, and the term \"Viking\" also commonly includes the inhabitants of the Scandinavian homelands as a whole. The Vikings had a profound impact on the early medieval history of Scandinavia, the British Isles, France, Estonia, and Kievan Rus'.[10] Expert sailors and navigators of their characteristic longships, Vikings established Norse settlements and governments in the British Isles, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Normandy, and the Baltic coast, as well as along the Dnieper and Volga trade routes across modern-day Russia, Belarus,[11] and Ukraine,[12] where they were also known as Varangians. The Normans, Norse-Gaels, Rus' people, Faroese, and Icelanders emerged from these Norse colonies. At one point, a group of Rus Vikings went so far south that, after briefly being bodyguards for the Byzantine emperor, they attacked the Byzantine city of Constantinople.[13] Vikings also voyaged to Iran[14][page needed] and Arabia.[15] They were the first Europeans to reach North America, briefly settling in Newfoundland (Vinland). While spreading Norse culture to foreign lands, they simultaneously brought home slaves, concubines, and foreign cultural influences to Scandinavia, influencing the genetic[16] and historical development of both. During the Viking Age, the Norse homelands were gradually consolidated from smaller kingdoms into three larger kingdoms: Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The Vikings spoke Old Norse and made inscriptions in runes. For most of the period, they followed the Old Norse religion, but later became Christians. The Vikings had their own laws, art, and architecture. Most Vikings were also farmers, fishermen, craftsmen, and traders. Popular conceptions of the Vikings often strongly differ from the complex, advanced civilisation of the Norsemen that emerges from archaeology and historical sources. A romanticised picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century; this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival.[17][18] Perceived views of the Vikings as violent, piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth that had taken shape by the early 20th century. Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on cultural clichés and stereotypes, complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy. These representations are rarely accurate—for example, there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets, a costume element that first appeared in the 19th century. The etymology of the word Viking has been much debated by academics, with many origin theories being proposed.[20][21] One theory suggests that the word's origin is from the Old English wicing 'settlement' and the Old Frisian wizing, attested almost 300 years prior.[22] Another less popular theory is that víking came from the feminine vík 'creek', 'inlet', 'small bay'.[23] Another etymology that gained support in the early 21st century derives Viking from the same root as Old Norse vika 'sea mile', originally referring to the distance between two shifts of rowers, ultimately from the Proto-Germanic *wîkan 'to recede'.[24][25][26][27] This is found in the early Nordic verb *wikan 'to turn', similar to Old Icelandic víkja 'to move, to turn', with \"well-attested nautical usages\", according to Bernard Mees.[26] This theory is better attested linguistically, and the term most likely predates the use of the sail by the Germanic peoples of northwestern Europe.[27][26][28] In the Middle Ages, viking came to refer to Scandinavian pirates or raiders.[29][30][31] The earliest reference to wicing in English sources is from the Épinal-Erfurt glossary (c. 700), about 93 years before the first known attack by Viking raiders in England. The glossary lists the Latin translation for wicing as piraticum 'pirate'.[32][33] In Old English, the word wicing appears in the Anglo-Saxon poem Widsith, probably from the 9th century. The word was not regarded as a reference to nationality, with other terms such as Northmen and Dene 'Danes' being used for that. In Asser's Latin work The Life of King Alfred, the Danes are referred to as pagani 'pagans'; historian Janet Nelson states that pagani became \"the Vikings\" in standard translations of this work, even though there is \"clear evidence\" that it was used as a synonym, while Eric Christiansen avers that it is a mistranslation made at the insistence of the publisher.[34] The word wicing does not occur in any preserved Middle English texts. The word Viking was introduced into Modern English during the 18th-century Viking revival, at which point it acquired romanticised heroic overtones of \"barbarian warrior\" or noble savage.[35] During the 20th century, the meaning of the term was expanded to refer not only to seaborne raiders from Scandinavia and other places settled by them (like Iceland and the Faroe Islands), but also any member of the culture that produced the raiders during the period from the late 8th to the mid-11th centuries, or more loosely from about 700 to as late as about 1100. As an adjective, the word is used to refer to ideas, phenomena, or artefacts connected with those people and their cultural life, producing expressions like Viking age, Viking culture, Viking art, Viking religion, Viking ship and so on. The Viking Age in Scandinavian history is taken to have been the period from the earliest recorded raids by Norsemen in 793 until the Norman conquest of England in 1066.[36] Vikings used the Norwegian Sea and Baltic Sea for sea routes to the south. The Normans were descendants of those Vikings who had been given feudal overlordship of areas in northern France, namely the Duchy of Normandy, in the 10th century. In that respect, descendants of the Vikings continued to have an influence in northern Europe. Likewise, King Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, had Danish ancestors. Two Vikings even ascended to the throne of England, with Sweyn Forkbeard claiming the English throne in 1013 until 1014 and his son Cnut the Great being king of England between 1016 and 1035.[37][38][39][40][41] Geographically, the Viking Age covered Scandinavian lands (modern Denmark, Norway and Sweden), as well as territories under North Germanic dominance, mainly the Danelaw, including Scandinavian York, the administrative centre of the remains of the Kingdom of Northumbria,[42] parts of Mercia, and East Anglia.[43] Viking navigators opened the road to new lands to the north, west and east, resulting in the foundation of independent settlements in the Shetland, Orkney, and Faroe Islands; Iceland; Greenland;[44] and L'Anse aux Meadows, a short-lived settlement in Newfoundland, circa 1000.[45] The Greenland settlement was established around 980, during the Medieval Warm Period, and its demise by the mid-15th century may have been partly due to climate change.[46] The Viking Rurik dynasty took control of territories in Slavic and Finnic-dominated areas of Eastern Europe; they annexed Kiev in 882 to serve as the capital of the Kievan Rus'.[47] As early as 839, when Swedish emissaries are first known to have visited Byzantium, Scandinavians served as mercenaries in the service of the Byzantine Empire.[48] In the late 10th century, a new unit of the imperial bodyguard formed. Traditionally containing large numbers of Scandinavians, it was known as the Varangian Guard. The word Varangian may have originated in Old Norse, but in Slavic and Greek it could refer either to Scandinavians or Franks. In these years, Swedish men left to enlist in the Byzantine Varangian Guard in such numbers that a medieval Swedish law, the Västgötalagen, from Västergötland declared no-one could inherit while staying in \"Greece\"—the then Scandinavian term for the Byzantine Empire—to stop the emigration,[49] especially as two other European courts simultaneously also recruited Scandinavians:[50] Kievan Rus' c. 980–1060 and London 1018–1066 (the Þingalið).[50] There is archaeological evidence that Vikings reached Baghdad, the centre of the Islamic Empire.[51] The Norse regularly plied the Volga with their trade goods: furs, tusks, seal fat for boat sealant, and slaves. Important trading ports during the period include Birka, Hedeby, Kaupang, Jorvik, Staraya Ladoga, Novgorod, and Kiev. Scandinavian Norsemen explored Europe by its seas and rivers for trade, raids, colonisation, and conquest. In this period, voyaging from their homelands in Denmark, Norway and Sweden the Norsemen settled in the present-day Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norse Greenland, Newfoundland, the Netherlands, Germany, Normandy, Italy, Scotland, England, Wales, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,[52] Ukraine, Russia and Turkey, as well as initiating the consolidation that resulted in the formation of the present-day Scandinavian countries. In the Viking Age, the present day nations of Norway, Sweden and Denmark did not exist, but the peoples who lived in what is now those countries were largely homogeneous and similar in culture and language, although somewhat distinct geographically. The names of Scandinavian kings are reliably known for only the later part of the Viking Age. After the end of the Viking Age, the separate kingdoms gradually acquired distinct identities as nations, which went hand-in-hand with their Christianisation. Thus, the end of the Viking Age for the Scandinavians also marks the start of their relatively brief Middle Ages. Slavic and Viking tribes were \"closely linked, fighting one another, intermixing and trading\".[53][54][55] In the Middle Ages, goods were transferred from Slavic areas to Scandinavia, and Denmark could be considered \"a melting pot of Slavic and Scandinavian elements\".[53] Leszek Gardeła, of the Department of Scandinavian Languages and Literatures at the University of Bonn, posits that the presence of Slavs in Scandinavia is \"more significant than previously thought\",[53] while Mats Roslund states that \"the Slavs and their interaction with Scandinavia have not been adequately investigated\".[56] A 10th-century grave of a warrior-woman in Denmark was long thought to belong to a Viking. However, new analyses suggest that the woman may have been a Slav from present-day Poland.[53] The first king of the Swedes, Eric, was married to Gunhild, of the Polish House of Piast.[57] Likewise, his son, Olof, fell in love with Edla, a Slavic woman, and took her as his frilla (concubine).[58] They had a son and a daughter: Emund the Old, King of Sweden, and Astrid, Queen of Norway. Cnut the Great, King of Denmark, England and Norway, was the son of a daughter of Mieszko I of Poland,[59] possibly the former Polish queen of Sweden, wife of Eric. Colonisation of Iceland by Norwegian Vikings began in the 9th century. The first source mentioning Iceland and Greenland is a papal letter from 1053. Twenty years later, they appear in the Gesta of Adam of Bremen. It was not until after 1130, when the islands had become Christianised, that accounts of the history of the islands were written from the point of view of the inhabitants in sagas and chronicles.[60] The Vikings explored the northern islands and coasts of the North Atlantic, ventured south to North Africa, east to Kievan Rus (now – Ukraine, Belarus), Constantinople, and the Middle East.[61] They raided and pillaged, traded, acted as mercenaries and settled colonies over a wide area.[62] Early Vikings probably returned home after their raids. Later in their history, they began to settle in other lands.[63] Vikings under Leif Erikson, heir to Erik the Red, reached North America and set up short-lived settlements in present-day L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, Canada. This expansion occurred during the Medieval Warm Period.[64] Viking expansion into continental Europe was limited. Their realm was bordered by powerful tribes to the south. Early on, it was the Saxons who occupied Old Saxony, located in what is now Northern Germany. The Saxons were a fierce and powerful people and were often in conflict with the Vikings. To counter the Saxon aggression and solidify their own presence, the Danes constructed the huge defence fortification of Danevirke in and around Hedeby.[65] The Vikings witnessed the violent subduing of the Saxons by Charlemagne, in the thirty-year Saxon Wars of 772–804. The Saxon defeat resulted in their forced christening and the absorption of Old Saxony into the Carolingian Empire. Fear of the Franks led the Vikings to further expand Danevirke,[65] and the defence constructions remained in use throughout the Viking Age and even up until 1864.[66] The southern coast of the Baltic Sea was ruled by the Obotrites, a federation of Slavic tribes loyal to the Carolingians and later the Frankish empire. The Vikings—led by King Gudfred—destroyed the Obotrite city of Reric on the southern Baltic coast in 808 AD and transferred the merchants and traders to Hedeby.[67] This secured Viking supremacy in the Baltic Sea, which continued throughout the Viking Age. Because of the expansion of the Vikings across Europe, a comparison of DNA and archeology undertaken by scientists at the University of Cambridge and University of Copenhagen suggested that the term \"Viking\" may have evolved to become \"a job description, not a matter of heredity\", at least in some Viking bands.[68] The motives driving the Viking expansion are a topic of much debate. The concept that Vikings may have originally started sailing and raiding due to a need to seek out women from foreign lands was expressed in the 11th century by historian Dudo of Saint-Quentin in his semi-imaginary History of The Normans.[69] [70][71] As observed by Adam of Bremen, rich and powerful Viking men tended to have many wives and concubines;[72] and these polygynous relationships may have led to a shortage of women available to the Viking male. Consequently, the average Viking man may have felt compelled to seek wealth and power to have the means to acquire suitable women.[73] Several centuries after Dudo's observations, scholars revived this idea, and over time it became a cliché among scholars of the Viking Age.[74] Viking men would often buy or capture women and make them into their wives or concubines;[75][76] such polygynous marriages increase male-male competition in society because they create a pool of unmarried men who are willing to engage in risky status-elevating and sex-seeking behaviors.[77][78] The Annals of Ulster states that in 821 the Vikings plundered an Irish village and \"carried off a great number of women into captivity\".[79] One common theory posits that Charlemagne \"used force and terror to Christianise all pagans\", leading to baptism, conversion or execution, and as a result, Vikings and other pagans resisted and wanted revenge.[80][81][82][83][84] Professor Rudolf Simek states that \"it is not a coincidence if the early Viking activity occurred during the reign of Charlemagne\".[80][85] The ascendance of Christianity in Scandinavia led to serious conflict, dividing Norway for almost a century. However, this time period did not commence until the 10th century. Norway was never subject to aggression by Charlemagne and the period of strife was due to successive Norwegian kings embracing Christianity after encountering it overseas.[86] Another explanation is that the Vikings exploited a moment of weakness in the surrounding regions. Contrary to Simek's assertion, Viking raids occurred sporadically long before the reign of Charlemagne; but exploded in frequency and size after his death, when his empire fragmented into multiple much weaker entities.[87] England suffered from internal divisions and was a relatively easy prey given the proximity of many towns to the sea or to navigable rivers. Lack of organised naval opposition throughout Western Europe allowed Viking ships to travel freely, raiding or trading as opportunity permitted. The decline in the profitability of old trade routes could also have played a role. Trade between Western Europe and the rest of Eurasia suffered a severe blow when the Western Roman Empire fell in the 5th century.[88] The expansion of Islam in the 7th century had also affected trade with Western Europe.[89] Raids in Europe, including raids and settlements from Scandinavia, were not unprecedented and had occurred long before the Vikings arrived. The Jutes invaded the British Isles three centuries earlier, from Jutland during the Age of Migrations, before the Danes settled there. The Saxons and the Angles did the same, embarking from mainland Europe. The Viking raids were, however, the first to be documented by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times.[87] Vikings themselves were expanding; although their motives are unclear, historians believe that scarce resources or a lack of mating opportunities were a factor.[90] The slave trade was an important part of the Viking economy, with most slaves destined to Scandinavia although many others were shipped east where they could be sold for large profits.[91] The \"Highway of Slaves\" was a term for a route that the Vikings found to have a direct pathway from Scandinavia to Constantinople and Baghdad while traveling on the Baltic Sea. With the advancements of their ships during the 9th century, the Vikings were able to sail to Kievan Rus and some northern parts of Europe.[92] Jomsborg was a semi-legendary Viking stronghold at the southern coast of the Baltic Sea (medieval Wendland, modern Pomerania), that existed between the 960s and 1043. Its inhabitants were known as Jomsvikings. Jomsborg's exact location, or its existence, has not yet been established, though it is often maintained that Jomsborg was somewhere on the islands of the Oder estuary.[93] While the Vikings were active beyond their Scandinavian homelands, Scandinavia was itself experiencing new influences and undergoing a variety of cultural changes.[94] By the late 11th century, royal dynasties were legitimised by the Catholic Church (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) which were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, with the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden taking shape. Towns appeared that functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and monetary economies began to emerge based on English and German models.[95] By this time the influx of Islamic silver from the East had been absent for more than a century, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in the mid-11th century.[96] Christianity had taken root in Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses in the 11th century, and the new religion was beginning to organise and assert itself more effectively in Sweden. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at Lund, Scania, then part of Denmark. The assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking from other European peoples. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so chattel slavery diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly. The kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107, Sigurd I of Norway sailed for the eastern Mediterranean with Norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established Kingdom of Jerusalem; the kings of Denmark and Sweden participated actively in the Baltic Crusades of the 12th and 13th centuries.[97] A variety of sources illuminate the culture, activities, and beliefs of the Vikings. Although they were generally a non-literate culture that produced no literary legacy, they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on runestones. Most contemporary literary and written sources on the Vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them.[98] Since the mid-20th century, archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the Vikings.[99][100] The archaeological record is particularly rich and varied, providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement, crafts and production, ships and military equipment, trading networks, as well as their pagan and Christian religious artefacts and practices. The most important primary sources on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the Vikings were active.[101] Writing in Latin letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.[102] The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in runes, but these were usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity. Later writings on the Vikings and the Viking Age can also be important for understanding them and their culture, although they need to be treated cautiously. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into mainstream medieval Christian culture in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources began to appear in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the Icelandic sagas. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is doubtful, but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of skaldic poetry attributed to court poets of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self-images, and the ethical values that are contained in these literary writings. Indirectly, the Vikings have also left a window open onto their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and shed light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them. Examples include place names like Egilsay (from Eigils ey meaning Eigil's Island), Ormskirk (from Ormr kirkja meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), Meols (from merl meaning Sand Dunes), Snaefell (Snow Fell), Ravenscar (Ravens Rock), Vinland (Land of Wine or Land of Winberry), Kaupanger (Market Harbour), Tórshavn (Thor's Harbour), and the religious centre of Odense, meaning a place where Odin was worshipped. Viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present-day parliamentary body of the Tynwald on the Isle of Man. Many common words in everyday English language stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings and give an opportunity to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the British Isles.[103] In the Northern Isles of Shetland and Orkney, Old Norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now extinct Norn language. Some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records, such as York (Horse Bay), Swansea (Sveinn's Isle) or some of the place names in Normandy like Tocqueville (Toki's farm).[104] Linguistic and etymological studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the Viking culture, their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met, traded, attacked or lived with in overseas settlements.[105][106] A lot of Old Norse connections are evident in the modern-day languages of Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Faroese and Icelandic.[107] Old Norse did not exert any great influence on the Slavic languages in the Viking settlements of Eastern Europe. It has been speculated that the reason for this was the great differences between the two languages, combined with the Rus Vikings' more peaceful businesses in these areas, and the fact that they were outnumbered. The Norse named some of the rapids on the Dnieper, but this can hardly be seen from modern names.[108][109] The Norse of the Viking Age could read and write and used a non-standardised alphabet, called runor, built upon sound values. While there are few remains of runic writing on paper from the Viking era, thousands of stones with runic inscriptions have been found where Vikings lived. They are usually in memory of the dead, though not necessarily placed at graves. The use of runor survived into the 15th century, used in parallel with the Latin alphabet. The runestones are unevenly distributed in Scandinavia: Denmark has 250 runestones, Norway has 50 while Iceland has none.[110] Sweden has as many as between 1,700[110] and 2,500[111] depending on the definition. The Swedish district of Uppland has the highest concentration with as many as 1,196 inscriptions in stone, whereas Södermanland is second with 391.[112] The majority of runic inscriptions from the Viking period are found in Sweden. Many runestones in Scandinavia record the names of participants in Viking expeditions, such as the Kjula runestone that tells of extensive warfare in Western Europe and the Turinge Runestone, which tells of a war band in Eastern Europe. Other runestones mention men who died on Viking expeditions. Among them are the England runestones (Swedish: Englandsstenarna), which is a group of about 30 runestones in Sweden which refer to Viking Age voyages to England. They constitute one of the largest groups of runestones that mention voyages to other countries, and they are comparable in number only to the approximately 30 Greece Runestones[113] and the 26 Ingvar Runestones, the latter referring to a Viking expedition to the Middle East.[114] They were engraved in Old Norse with the Younger Futhark.[115] The Jelling stones date from between 960 and 985. The older, smaller stone was raised by King Gorm the Old, the last pagan king of Denmark, as a memorial honouring Queen Thyre.[116] The larger stone was raised by his son, Harald Bluetooth, to celebrate the conquest of Denmark and Norway and the conversion of the Danes to Christianity. It has three sides: one with an animal image; one with an image of the crucified Jesus Christ; and a third bearing the following inscription: King Haraldr ordered this monument made in memory of Gormr, his father, and in memory of Thyrvé, his mother; that Haraldr who won for himself all of Denmark and Norway and made the Danes Christian.[117] Runestones attest to voyages to locations such as Bath,[118] Greece (how the Vikings referred to the Byzantium territories generally),[119] Khwaresm,[120] Jerusalem,[121] Italy (as Langobardland),[122] Serkland (i.e. the Muslim world),[123][124] England[125] (including London[126]), and various places in Eastern Europe. Viking Age inscriptions have also been discovered on the Manx runestones on the Isle of Man. The last known people to use the Runic alphabet were an isolated group of people known as the Elfdalians, that lived in the locality of Älvdalen in the Swedish province of Dalarna. They spoke the language of Elfdalian, the language unique to Älvdalen. The Elfdalian language differentiates itself from the other Scandinavian languages as it evolved much closer to Old Norse. The people of Älvdalen stopped using runes as late as the 1920s. Usage of runes therefore survived longer in Älvdalen than anywhere else in the world.[127] The last known record of the Elfdalian Runes is from 1929; they are a variant of the Dalecarlian runes, runic inscriptions that were also found in Dalarna. Traditionally regarded as a Swedish dialect,[128] but by several criteria closer related to West Scandinavian dialects,[129] Elfdalian is a separate language by the standard of mutual intelligibility.[130][131][132] Although there is no mutual intelligibility, due to schools and public administration in Älvdalen being conducted in Swedish, native speakers are bilingual and speak Swedish at a native level. Residents in the area who speak only Swedish as their sole native language, neither speaking nor understanding Elfdalian, are also common. Älvdalen can be said to have had its own alphabet during the 17th and 18th century. Today there are about 2,000–3,000 native speakers of Elfdalian. There are numerous burial sites associated with Vikings throughout Europe and their sphere of influence—in Scandinavia, the British Isles, Ireland, Greenland, Iceland, Faeroe Islands, Germany, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Russia, etc. The burial practices of the Vikings were quite varied, from dug graves in the ground, to tumuli, sometimes including so-called ship burials. According to written sources, most of the funerals took place at sea. Funerals involved either burial or cremation, depending on local customs. In the area that is now Sweden, cremations were predominant; in Denmark burial was more common; and in Norway both were common.[133] Viking barrows are one of the primary sources of evidence for circumstances in the Viking Age.[134] The items buried with the dead give some indication as to what was considered important to possess in the afterlife.[135] It is unknown what mortuary services were given to dead children by the Vikings.[136] Some of the most important burial sites for understanding the Vikings include: There have been several archaeological finds of Viking ships of all sizes, providing knowledge of the craftsmanship that went into building them. There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best-known type is probably the longship.[143] Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the Leidang, the Scandinavian defence fleets. The longship allowed the Norse to go Viking, which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings.[144][145] The Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The knarr was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, a deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the 'beitass', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind.[146] It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crew and cargo from the ship to shore. Ships were an integral part of Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a major religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the buried vessels at Gokstad and Oseberg in Norway[147] and the excavated ship burial at Ladby in Denmark. Ship burials were also practised by Vikings overseas, as evidenced by the excavations of the Salme ships on the Estonian island of Saaremaa.[148] Well-preserved remains of five Viking ships were excavated from Roskilde Fjord in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the knarr. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect Roskilde, then the Danish capital, from a seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on display at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde. In 2019, archaeologists uncovered two Viking boat graves in Gamla Uppsala. They also discovered that one of the boats still holds the remains of a man, a dog, and a horse, along with other items.[149] This has shed light on the death rituals of Viking communities in the region. Viking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: thralls, karls and jarls. This is described vividly in the Eddic poem of Rígsþula, which also explains that it was the god Ríg—father of mankind also known as Heimdallr—who created the three classes. Archaeology has confirmed this social structure.[150] In daily life, there were many intermediate positions in the overall social structure and it appears that there was some social mobility between them. These details are unclear, but titles and positions like hauldr, thegn, and landmand, show mobility between the karls and the jarls. Other social structures included the communities of félag in both the civil and the military spheres, to which its members (called félagi) were obliged. A félag could be centred around certain trades, a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader. Members of the latter were referred to as drenge, one of the words for warrior. There were also official communities within towns and villages, the overall defence, religion, the legal system and the Things. Like elsewhere in medieval Europe, most women in Viking society were subordinate to their husbands and fathers and had little political power.[156][157] However, written sources portray free Viking women as having independence and rights. Viking women generally appear to have had more freedom than women elsewhere,[157] as illustrated in the Icelandic Grágás and the Norwegian Frostating laws and Gulating laws.[158] Most free Viking women were housewives, and a woman's standing in society was linked to that of her husband.[157] Marriage gave a woman a degree of economic security and social standing encapsulated in the title húsfreyja (lady of the house). Norse laws assert the housewife's authority over the 'indoor household'. She had the important roles of managing the farm's resources, conducting business, as well as child-rearing, although some of this would be shared with her husband.[159] After the age of 20, an unmarried woman, referred to as maer and mey, reached legal majority and had the right to decide her place of residence and was regarded as her own person before the law.[158] An exception to her independence was the right to choose a husband, as marriages were normally arranged by the family.[160] The groom would pay a bride-price (mundr) to the bride's family, and the bride brought assets into the marriage, as a dowry.[159] A married woman could divorce her husband and remarry.[157][161] Concubinage was also part of Viking society, whereby a woman could live with a man and have children with him without marrying; such a woman was called a frilla.[161] Usually she would be the mistress of a wealthy and powerful man who also had a wife.[156] The wife had authority over the mistresses if they lived in her household.[157] Through her relationship to a man of higher social standing, a concubine and her family could advance socially; although her position was less secure than that of a wife.[156] There was little distinction made between children born inside or outside marriage: both had the right to inherit property from their parents, and there were no \"legitimate\" or \"illegitimate\" children.[161] However, children born in wedlock had more inheritance rights than those born out of wedlock.[159] A woman had the right to inherit part of her husband's property upon his death,[159] and widows enjoyed the same independent status as unmarried women.[161] The paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter, referred to as odalkvinna, all had the right to inherit property from a deceased man.[158] A woman with no husband, sons or male relatives could inherit not only property but also the position as head of the family when her father or brother died. Such a woman was referred to as Baugrygr, and she exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan, until she married, by which her rights were transferred to her new husband.[158] Women had religious authority and were active as priestesses (gydja) and oracles (sejdkvinna).[162] They were active within art as poets (skalder)[162] and rune masters, and as merchants and medicine women.[162] There may also have been female entrepreneurs, who worked in textile production.[157] Women may also have been active within military offices: the tales about shieldmaidens are unconfirmed, but some archaeological finds such as the Birka female Viking warrior may indicate that at least some women in military authority existed.[163] These liberties of the Viking women gradually disappeared after the introduction of Christianity,[164] and from the late 13th century, they are no longer mentioned.[158] Examination of Viking Age burials suggests that women lived longer, and nearly all well past the age of 35, as compared to earlier times. Female graves from before the Viking Age in Scandinavia hold a proportionally large number of remains from women aged 20 to 35, presumably due to complications of childbirth.[165] Examination of skeletal remains also allows the relative health and nutritional status of boys and girls in the past to be reconstructed, using anthropometric techniques. Burials from Scandinavia and other European countries suggest that, in comparison with other societies at the time, female equality was remarkably high in rural Scandinavia. Females in the rural periphery of Nordic countries during the Viking period and the later Middle Ages had relatively high status, resulting in substantial nutritional and health resources being allocated to girls, enabling them to grow stronger and healthier.[166] Scandinavian Vikings were similar in appearance to modern Scandinavians: \"their skin was fair and the hair color varied between blond, dark and reddish\". Genetic studies suggest that people were mostly blond in what is now eastern Sweden, while red hair was mostly found in western Scandinavia.[167] Most Viking men had shoulder-length hair and beards, and slaves (thralls) were usually the only men with short hair.[168] The length varied according to personal preference and occupation. Men involved in warfare, for example, may have had slightly shorter hair and beards for practical reasons. Men in some regions bleached their hair a golden saffron colour.[168] Females also had long hair, with girls often wearing it loose or braided, and married women often wearing it in a bun.[168] The average height is estimated to have been 1.70 m (5 ft 7 in) for men and 1.55 m (5 ft 1 in) for women.[167] The three classes were easily recognisable by their appearance. Men and women of the Jarls were well groomed with neat hairstyles and expressed their wealth and status by wearing expensive clothes (often silk) and well-crafted jewellery like brooches, belt buckles, necklaces and arm rings. Almost all of the jewellery was crafted in specific designs unique to the Norse (see Viking art). Finger rings were seldom used and earrings were not used at all, as they were seen as a Slavic phenomenon. Most karls expressed similar tastes and hygiene, but in a more relaxed and inexpensive way.[150][169] Archaeological finds from Scandinavia and Viking settlements in the British Isles support the idea of the well-groomed and hygienic Viking. Burial with grave goods was a common practice in the Scandinavian world, through the Viking Age and well past the Christianisation of the Norse peoples.[170] Within these burial sites and homesteads, combs, often made from antler, are a common find.[171][172] The manufacturing of such antler combs was common, as at the Viking settlement at Dublin hundreds of examples of combs from the tenth-century have survived, suggesting that grooming was a common practice. The manufacture of such combs was also widespread throughout the Viking world, as examples of similar combs have been found at Viking settlements in Ireland,[173] England,[174] and Scotland.[175] The combs share a common visual appearance as well, with the extant examples often decorated with linear, interlacing, and geometric motifs, or other forms of ornamentation depending on the comb's period and type, but stylistically similar to Viking Age art.[176] All levels of Viking age society appear to have groomed their hair, as hair combs have been found in common graves as well as in aristocratic ones.[177] The sagas tell about the diet and cuisine of the Vikings,[178] but first-hand evidence, like cesspits, kitchen middens and garbage dumps have proved to be of great value and importance. Undigested remains of plants from cesspits at Coppergate in York have provided much information in this respect. Overall, archaeo-botanical investigations have been undertaken increasingly in recent decades, as a collaboration between archaeologists and palaeoethno-botanists. This new approach sheds light on the agricultural and horticultural practices of the Vikings and their cuisine.[179] The combined information from various sources suggests a diverse cuisine and ingredients. Meat products of all kinds, such as cured, smoked and whey-preserved meat,[180] sausages, and boiled or fried fresh meat cuts, were prepared and consumed.[181] There were plenty of seafood, bread, porridges, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, berries and nuts. Alcoholic drinks like beer, mead, bjórr (a strong fruit wine) and, for the rich, imported wine, were served.[182][183] Certain livestock were typical and unique to the Vikings, including the Icelandic horse, Icelandic cattle, a plethora of sheep breeds,[184] the Danish hen and the Danish goose.[185][186] The Vikings in York mostly ate beef, mutton, and pork with small amounts of horse meat. Most of the beef and horse leg bones were found split lengthways, to extract the marrow. The mutton and swine were cut into leg and shoulder joints and chops. The frequent remains of pig skull and foot bones found on house floors indicate that brawn and trotters were also popular. Hens were kept for both their meat and eggs, and the bones of game birds such as black grouse, golden plover, wild ducks, and geese have also been found.[187] Seafood was important, in some places even more so than meat. Whales and walrus were hunted for food in Norway and the northwestern parts of the North Atlantic region, and seals were hunted nearly everywhere. Oysters, mussels and shrimp were eaten in large quantities and cod and salmon were popular fish. In the southern regions, herring was also important.[188][189][190] Milk and buttermilk were popular, both as cooking ingredients and drinks, but were not always available, even at farms.[191] Milk came from cows, goats and sheep, with priorities varying from location to location,[192] and fermented milk products like skyr or surmjölk were produced as well as butter and cheese.[193] Food was often salted and enhanced with spices, some of which were imported like black pepper, while others were cultivated in herb gardens or harvested in the wild. Home grown spices included caraway, mustard and horseradish as evidenced from the Oseberg ship burial[182] or dill, coriander, and wild celery, as found in cesspits at Coppergate in York. Thyme, juniper berry, sweet gale, yarrow, rue and peppercress were also used and cultivated in herb gardens.[179][194] Vikings collected and ate fruits, berries and nuts. Apple (wild crab apples), plums and cherries were part of the diet,[195] as were rose hips and raspberry, wild strawberry, blackberry, elderberry, rowan, hawthorn and various wild berries, specific to the locations.[194] Hazelnuts were an important part of the diet in general and large amounts of walnut shells have been found in cities like Hedeby. The shells were used for dyeing, and it is assumed that the nuts were consumed.[179][191] The invention and introduction of the mouldboard plough revolutionised agriculture in Scandinavia in the early Viking Age and made it possible to farm even poor soils. In Ribe, grains of rye, barley, oat and wheat dated to the 8th century have been found and examined, and are believed to have been cultivated locally.[196] Grains and flour were used for making porridges, some cooked with milk, some cooked with fruit and sweetened with honey, and also various forms of bread. Remains of bread from primarily Birka in Sweden were made of barley and wheat. It is unclear if the Norse leavened their breads, but their ovens and baking utensils suggest that they did.[197] Flax was a very important crop for the Vikings: it was used for oil extraction, food consumption, and most importantly, the production of linen. More than 40% of all known textile recoveries from the Viking Age can be traced as linen. This suggests a much higher actual percentage, as linen is poorly preserved compared to wool, for example.[198] The quality of food for common people was not always particularly high. The research at Coppergate shows that the Vikings in York made bread from wholemeal flour—probably both wheat and rye—but with the seeds of cornfield weeds included. Corncockle (Agrostemma), would have made the bread dark-coloured, but the seeds are poisonous, and people who ate the bread might have become ill. Seeds of carrots, parsnip, and brassicas were also discovered, but they were poor specimens and tend to come from white carrots and bitter tasting cabbages.[195] The rotary querns often used in the Viking Age left tiny stone fragments (often from basalt rock) in the flour, which when eaten wore down the teeth. The effects of this can be seen on skeletal remains from that period.[197] Sports were widely practised and encouraged by the Vikings.[199] Sports that involved weapons training and developing combat skills were popular. These included spear and stone throwing, building and testing physical strength through wrestling (see glima), fist fighting, and stone lifting.[200] In areas with mountains, mountain climbing was practised as a sport. Agility and balance were built and tested by running and jumping for sport, and there is mention of a sport that involved jumping from oar to oar on the outside of a ship's railing as it was being rowed.[201] Swimming was a popular sport[202] – Snorri Sturluson describes three types: diving, long-distance swimming, and a contest in which two swimmers try to dunk one another. Children often participated in some of the sport disciplines,[203] and women have also been mentioned as swimmers, although it is unclear if they took part in competitions. King Olaf Tryggvason was acclaimed for his skill in both mountain climbing and oar-jumping, and reputedly excelled in the art of knife juggling as well. Skiing and ice skating were the principal winter sports, and also provided transport on snow and ice for adults.[199] Horse fighting was practised for sport, although the rules are unclear. It appears to have involved two stallions pitted against each other, within smell and sight of fenced-off mares. Whatever the rules were, the fights often resulted in the death of one of the stallions. Icelandic sources often mention knattleik, a ball game similar to hockey, played with a bat and a small hard ball, usually on a smooth surface of ice. Popular with both adults and children, it was a rugged game that often led to injuries. Knattleik appears to have been played only in Iceland, where it attracted many spectators, as did horse fighting.[199] Hunting was practiced as a sport only in Denmark, where it was not an essential food source. Deer and hares were hunted for meat, along with partridges and sea birds, while foxes were hunted to stop their killing of farm animals and for their furs. Spears, bows, and later crossbows, were the weapons used; stalking was the most common method, although game was also chased with dogs. Numerous kinds of snares and traps were used as well.[199] Archaeological finds and written sources indicate that the Vikings participated in social gatherings and festivities.[204][205] Board games and dice games were a popular pastime. Game boards were made of ornately carved wood, with gaming pieces fashioned mostly from wood, bone, or stone. Pieces were also made of glass, amber, and antler, along with materials such as walrus tusk and ivory from foreign sources. The Vikings played several types of tafl games; hnefatafl, nitavl (nine men's morris) and the less common kvatrutafl.[199] Hnefatafl was probably the oldest type of board game played in medieval Scandinavia.[199] The archaeological record indicates that hnefatafl was popular by the early medieval period, with the Vikings introducing it to England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.[206] The Ockelbo Runestone shows two men possibly playing hnefatafl,[207] and one saga suggests that dice games involved gambling.[204] Beer and mead were served on festive occasions, where music was played, poetry was recited, and stories were told.[204] Music was considered an art form and musical skill was viewed as suitable for a cultivated man. The Vikings are known to have played instruments including harps, lutes, lyres and fiddles.[199] Elements of a Scandinavian identity and practices were maintained in settler societies, but they could be quite distinct as the groups assimilated into neighbouring societies. Assimilation to the Frankish culture in Normandy for example was rapid.[208] Links to a Viking identity remained longer in the remote islands of Iceland and the Faroes.[208] Knowledge about the arms and armour of the Viking age is based on archaeological finds, pictorial representation, and to some extent on the accounts in the Norse sagas and Norse laws recorded in the 13th century. According to custom, all free Norse men were required to own weapons and were permitted to carry them at all times. These arms indicated a Viking's social status: a wealthy Viking had a complete ensemble of a helmet, shield, mail shirt, and sword. However, swords were rarely used in battle; they were probably not sturdy enough for combat and most likely only used as symbolic or decorative items.[209][210] A typical bóndi (freeman) was more likely to fight with a spear and shield, and most also carried a seax as a utility knife and side-arm. Bows were used in the opening stages of land battles and at sea, but they tended to be considered less \"honourable\" than melee weapons. Vikings were relatively unusual for the time in their use of axes as a main battle weapon. The Húscarls, the elite guard of King Cnut (and later of King Harold II) were armed with two-handed axes that could split shields or metal helmets with ease. The warfare and violence of the Vikings were often motivated and fuelled by their beliefs in Norse religion, focusing on Thor and Odin, the gods of war and death.[211][212] Violence was common in Viking Age Norway. An examination of Norwegian human remains from the Viking Age found that 72% of the examined males and 42% of the examined females had suffered weapon-related injuries. Violence was less common in Viking Age Denmark, where society was more centralized and complex than the clan-based Norwegian society.[213] The Viking warrior is often associated with violent fits of rage and frenzied fighting in modern popular culture, as reflected in meanings attached to the words berserkergang and berserker that would not have been the meanings understood by medieval Norse society.[214] Such a fighting style may have been deployed intentionally by shock troops, and it has been proposed that the berserk-state may have been induced by consuming large amounts of alcohol,[215] or through ingestion of materials with psychoactive properties, such as the solanaceous plant Hyoscyamus niger, as speculated by Karsten Fatur[216] or by consumption of the hallucinogenic mushroom Amanita muscaria, as first hypothesised by the Swedish theologian Samuel Ødman in 1784 and later by the botanist F.C. Schübeler in 1885.[217] The Norwegian battlefield archaeologist Are Skarstein Kolberg asserts that \"...Ödman's hypothesis is not supported by the saga literature or by the archaeological record\",[218] and according to Roderick Dale, there is no evidence for it from the Viking Age or from Old Norse literature.[214] The Vikings established and engaged in extensive trading networks throughout the known world and had a profound influence on the economic development of Europe and Scandinavia.[219][220] Other than in such trading centres as Ribe Hedeby in Denmark, Scandinavia was unfamiliar with the use of coinage. Therefore, its economy was based on bullion; that is, the purity and weight of precious metals used in exchange. Silver was the precious metal most commonly used, although gold was also used. Traders carried small portable scales, enabling them to measure weight precisely, which allowed an accurate medium of exchange, even lacking a regular coinage.[221] Organised trade covered everything from ordinary items in bulk to exotic luxury products. The Viking ship designs, like that of the knarr, were an important factor in their success as merchants.[222] Imported goods from other cultures included:[223] To counter these valuable imports, the Vikings exported a large variety of goods. These goods included:[223] Other exports included weapons, walrus ivory, wax, salt and cod. As one of the more exotic exports, hunting birds were sometimes provided from Norway to the European aristocracy, from the 10th century.[231] Many of these goods were also traded within the Viking world itself, as well as goods such as soapstone and whetstone. Soapstone was traded with the Norse on Iceland and in Jutland, who used it for pottery. Whetstones were traded and used for sharpening weapons, tools and knives.[223] There are indications from Ribe and surrounding areas, that the extensive medieval trade with oxen and cattle from Jutland (see Ox Road), reach as far back as c. 720 AD. This trade satisfied the Vikings' need for leather and meat to some extent, and perhaps hides for parchment production on the European mainland. Wool was also very important as a domestic product for the Vikings, to produce warm clothing for the cold Scandinavian and Nordic climate, and for sails. Sails for Viking ships required large amounts of wool, as evidenced by experimental archaeology. There are archaeological signs of organised textile productions in Scandinavia, reaching as far back as the early Iron Ages. Artisans and craftsmen in the larger towns were supplied with antlers from organised hunting with large-scale reindeer traps in the far north. They were used as raw material for making everyday utensils like combs.[231] In England the Viking Age began dramatically on 8 June 793 when Norsemen destroyed the abbey on the island of Lindisfarne. The devastation of Northumbria's Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe to the Viking presence. \"Never before has such an atrocity been seen\", declared the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin of York.[233] Medieval Christians in Europe were totally unprepared for the Viking incursions and could find no explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the \"Wrath of God\".[234] More than any other single event, the attack on Lindisfarne demonised perception of the Vikings for the next twelve centuries. Not until the 1890s did scholars outside Scandinavia begin to seriously reassess the achievements of the Vikings, recognising their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.[235] Norse Mythology, sagas, and literature tell of Scandinavian culture and religion through tales of heroic and mythological heroes. Early transmission of this information was primarily oral, and later texts relied on the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, including the Icelanders Snorri Sturluson and Sæmundur fróði. Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and legal codes. The 200-year Viking influence on European history is filled with tales of plunder and colonisation, and the majority of these chronicles came from western European witnesses and their descendants. Less common, although equally relevant, are references to Vikings in chronicles that originated in the east, including the Nestor chronicles, Novgorod chronicles, Ibn Fadlan chronicles, Ibn Rusta chronicles, and brief mentions by Photius, patriarch of Constantinople, regarding the first Viking attack on the Byzantine Empire. Other chroniclers of Viking history include Adam of Bremen, who wrote, in the fourth volume of his Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum, \"[t]here is much gold here (in Zealand), accumulated by piracy. These pirates, which are called wichingi by their own people, and Ascomanni by our own people, pay tribute to the Danish king.\" In 991, the Battle of Maldon between Viking raiders and the inhabitants of Maldon in Essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name. Early modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g. Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (History of the northern people) of Olaus Magnus (1555), and the first edition of the 13th-century Gesta Danorum (Deeds of the Danes), by Saxo Grammaticus, in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the Edda (notably Peder Resen's Edda Islandorum of 1665). In Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars Thomas Bartholin and Ole Worm and the Swede Olaus Rudbeck used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was George Hickes, who published his Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus (Dictionary of the Old Northern Languages) in 1703–05. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues. The word \"viking\" was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by Erik Gustaf Geijer in his poem, The Viking. Geijer's poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest of Romanticism in the Old North had contemporary political implications. The Geatish Society, of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent. Another Swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was Esaias Tegnér, a member of the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of Friðþjófs saga hins frœkna, which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Fascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called Viking revival in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a form of Romantic nationalism.[236] In Britain this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany \"Wagnerian\" pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries Scandinavism. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain. Archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs. The new dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled the Victorians to grapple with the primary Icelandic sagas.[237] Until recently, the history of the Viking Age was largely based on Icelandic sagas, the history of the Danes written by Saxo Grammaticus, the Primary Chronicle, and Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib. Few scholars still accept these texts as reliable sources, as historians now rely more on archaeology and numismatics, disciplines that have made valuable contributions toward understanding the period.[238][citation needed] The romanticised idea of the Vikings constructed in scholarly and popular circles in northwestern Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries was a potent one, and the figure of the Viking became a familiar and malleable symbol in different contexts in the politics and political ideologies of 20th-century Europe.[239] In Normandy, which had been settled by Vikings, the Viking ship became an uncontroversial regional symbol. In Germany, awareness of Viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Scandinavian mythology by Richard Wagner. The idealised view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking in accordance with the ideology of a Germanic master race.[240] Building on the linguistic and cultural connections between Norse-speaking Scandinavians and other Germanic groups in the distant past, Scandinavian Vikings were portrayed in Nazi Germany as a pure Germanic type. The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed interpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of Nazi mysticism. Other political organisations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party Nasjonal Samling, similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda. Soviet and earlier Slavophile historians emphasised a Slavic rooted foundation in contrast to the Normanist theory of the Vikings conquering the Slavs and founding the Kievan Rus'.[241] They accused Normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the Slavs as undeveloped primitives. In contrast, Soviet historians stated that the Slavs laid the foundations of their statehood long before the Norman/Viking raids, while the Norman/Viking invasions only served to hinder the historical development of the Slavs. They argued that Rus' composition was Slavic and that Rurik and Oleg's success was rooted in their support from within the local Slavic aristocracy.[citation needed]. After the dissolution of the USSR, Novgorod acknowledged its Viking history by incorporating a Viking ship into its logo.[242] Led by the operas of German composer Richard Wagner, such as Der Ring des Nibelungen, Vikings and the Romanticist Viking Revival have inspired many creative works. These have included novels directly based on historical events, such as Frans Gunnar Bengtsson's The Long Ships (which was also released as a 1963 film), and historical fantasies such as the film The Vikings, Michael Crichton's Eaters of the Dead (movie version called The 13th Warrior), and the comedy film Erik the Viking. The vampire Eric Northman, in the HBO TV series True Blood, was a Viking prince before being turned into a vampire. Vikings appear in several books by the Danish American writer Poul Anderson, while British explorer, historian, and writer Tim Severin authored a trilogy of novels in 2005 about a young Viking adventurer Thorgils Leifsson, who travels around the world. In 1962, American comic book writer Stan Lee and his brother Larry Lieber, together with Jack Kirby, created the Marvel Comics superhero Thor, which they based on the Norse god of the same name. The character is featured in the 2011 Marvel Studios film Thor and its sequels. The character also appears in the 2012 film The Avengers and its associated animated series. The appearance of Vikings within popular media and television has seen a resurgence in recent decades, especially with the History Channel's series Vikings (2013), directed by Michael Hirst. The show has a loose grounding in historical facts and sources, but bases itself more so on literary sources, such as fornaldarsaga Ragnars saga loðbrókar, itself more legend than fact, and Old Norse Eddic and Skaldic poetry.[243] The events of the show frequently make references to the Völuspá, an Eddic poem describing the creation of the world, often directly referencing specific lines of the poem in the dialogue.[244] The show portrays some of the social realities of the medieval Scandinavian world, such as slavery[245] and the greater role of women within Viking society.[246] The show also addresses the topics of gender equity in Viking society with the inclusion of shield maidens through the character Lagertha, also based on a legendary figure.[247] Recent archaeological interpretations and osteological analyses of previous excavations of Viking burials have given support to the idea of the Viking woman warrior, namely the excavation and DNA study of the Birka female Viking warrior, within recent years. However, the conclusions remain contentious. Vikings have served as an inspiration for numerous video games, such as The Lost Vikings (1993), Age of Mythology (2002), and For Honor (2017).[248] All three Vikings from The Lost Vikings series—Erik the Swift, Baleog the Fierce, and Olaf the Stout—appeared as a playable hero in the crossover title Heroes of the Storm (2015).[249] The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (2011) is an action role-playing video game heavily inspired by Viking culture.[250][251] Vikings are the lead focus of the 2020 video game Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which is set in 873 AD, and recounts an alternative history of the Viking invasion of Britain.[252] Modern reconstructions of Viking mythology have shown a persistent influence in late 20th- and early 21st-century popular culture in some countries, inspiring comics, movies, television series, role-playing games, computer games, and music, including Viking metal, a subgenre of heavy metal music. Since the 1960s, there has been rising enthusiasm for historical reenactment. While the earliest groups had little claim for historical accuracy, the seriousness and accuracy of reenactors has increased. The largest such groups include The Vikings and Regia Anglorum, though many smaller groups exist in Europe, North America, New Zealand, and Australia. Many reenactor groups participate in live-steel combat, and a few have Viking-style ships or boats. The Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League are so-named owing to the large Scandinavian population in the US state of Minnesota. During the banking boom of the first decade of the twenty-first century, Icelandic financiers came to be styled as útrásarvíkingar (roughly 'raiding Vikings').[253][254][255] Experimental archaeology of the Viking Age is a flourishing branch and several places have been dedicated to this technique, such as Jorvik Viking Centre in the United Kingdom, Sagnlandet Lejre and Ribe Viking Center [da] in Denmark, Foteviken Museum in Sweden or Lofotr Viking Museum in Norway. Viking-age reenactors have undertaken experimental activities such as iron smelting and forging using Norse techniques at Norstead in Newfoundland for example.[256] On 1 July 2007, the reconstructed Viking ship Skuldelev 2, renamed Sea Stallion,[257] began a journey from Roskilde to Dublin. The remains of that ship and four others were discovered during a 1962 excavation in the Roskilde Fjord. Tree-ring analysis has shown the ship was built of oak in the vicinity of Dublin in about 1042. Seventy multinational crew members sailed the ship back to its home, and Sea Stallion arrived outside Dublin's Custom House on 14 August 2007. The purpose of the voyage was to test and document the seaworthiness, speed, and manoeuvrability of the ship on the rough open sea and in coastal waters with treacherous currents. The crew tested how the long, narrow, flexible hull withstood the tough ocean waves. The expedition also provided valuable new information on Viking longships and society. The ship was built using Viking tools, materials, and much of the same methods as the original ship. Other vessels, often replicas of the Gokstad ship (full- or half-scale) or Skuldelev have been built and tested as well. The Snorri (a Skuldelev I Knarr), was sailed from Greenland to Newfoundland in 1998.[258] Apart from two or three representations of (ritual) helmets—with protrusions that may be either stylised ravens, snakes, or horns—no depiction of the helmets of Viking warriors, and no preserved helmet, has horns. The formal, close-quarters style of Viking combat (either in shield walls or aboard \"ship islands\") would have made horned helmets cumbersome and hazardous to the warrior's own side. Historians therefore believe that Viking warriors did not wear horned helmets; whether such helmets were used in Scandinavian culture for other, ritual purposes, remains unproven. The general misconception that Viking warriors wore horned helmets was partly promulgated by the 19th-century enthusiasts of Götiska Förbundet, founded in 1811 in Stockholm.[259] They promoted the use of Norse mythology as the subject of high art and other ethnological and moral aims. The Vikings were often depicted with winged helmets and in other clothing taken from Classical antiquity, especially in depictions of Norse gods. This was done to legitimise the Vikings and their mythology by associating it with the Classical world, which had long been idealised in European culture. The latter-day mythos created by national romantic ideas blended the Viking Age with aspects of the Nordic Bronze Age some 2,000 years earlier. Horned helmets from the Bronze Age were shown in petroglyphs and appeared in archaeological finds (see Bohuslän and Vikso helmets). They were probably used for ceremonial purposes.[260] Cartoons like Hägar the Horrible and Vicky the Viking, and sports kits such as those of the Minnesota Vikings and Canberra Raiders have perpetuated the myth of the horned helmet.[261] Viking helmets were conical, made from hard leather with wood and metallic reinforcements for regular troops. The iron helmet with mask and mail was for the chieftains, based on the previous Vendel-age helmets from central Sweden. The only original Viking helmet discovered is the Gjermundbu helmet, found in Norway. This helmet is made of iron and has been dated to the 10th century.[262] The image of wild-haired, dirty savages sometimes associated with the Vikings in popular culture is a distorted picture of reality.[9] Viking tendencies were often misreported, and the work of Adam of Bremen, among others, told largely disputable tales of Viking savagery and uncleanliness.[263] There is no evidence that Vikings drank out of the skulls of vanquished enemies. This was a misconception based on a passage in the skaldic poem Krákumál speaking of heroes drinking from ór bjúgviðum hausa (branches of skulls). This was a reference to drinking horns, but was mistranslated in the 17th century[264] as referring to the skulls of the slain.[265] Margaryan et al. 2020 analysed 442 Viking world individuals from various archaeological sites in Europe.[16] They were found to be closely related to modern Scandinavians. The Y-DNA composition of the individuals in the study was also similar to that of modern Scandinavians. The most common Y-DNA haplogroup was I1 (95 samples), followed by R1b (84 samples) and R1a, especially (but not exclusively) of the Scandinavian R1a-Z284 subclade (61 samples). The study showed what many historians have hypothesised: that it was common for Norseman settlers to marry foreign women. Some individuals from the study, such as those found in Foggia, displayed typical Scandinavian Y-DNA haplogroups but also southern European autosomal ancestry, suggesting that they were the descendants of Viking settler males and local women. The five individual samples from Foggia were likely Normans. The same pattern of a combination of Scandinavian Y-DNA and local autosomal ancestry is seen in other samples from the study, for example Varangians buried near lake Ladoga and Vikings in England, suggesting that Viking men had married into local families in those places too.[16] The study found evidence of a Swedish influx into Estonia and Finland; and Norwegian influx into Ireland, Iceland and Greenland during the Viking Age. However, the authors commented \"Viking Age Danish-like ancestry in the British Isles cannot be distinguished from that of the Angles and Saxons, who migrated in the fifth to sixth centuries AD from Jutland and northern Germany\".[16] Margaryan et al. 2020 examined the skeletal remains of 42 individuals from the Salme ship burials in Estonia. The skeletal remains belonged to warriors killed in battle who were later buried together with numerous valuable weapons and armour. DNA testing and isotope analysis revealed that the men came from central Sweden.[16] Female descent studies show evidence of Norse descent in areas closest to Scandinavia, such as the Shetland and Orkney islands.[266] Inhabitants of lands farther away show most Norse descent in the male Y-chromosome lines.[267] A specialised genetic and surname study in Liverpool showed marked Norse heritage: up to 50% of males of families that lived there before the years of industrialisation and population expansion.[268] High percentages of Norse inheritance—tracked through the R-M420 haplotype—were also found among males in the Wirral and West Lancashire.[269] This was similar to the percentage of Norse inheritance found among males in the Orkney Islands.[270] Recent research suggests that the Celtic warrior Somerled, who drove the Vikings out of western Scotland and was the progenitor of Clan Donald, may have been of Viking descent, a member of haplogroup R-M420.[271] Margaryan et al. 2020 examined an elite warrior burial from Bodzia (Poland) dated to 1010–1020 AD. The cemetery in Bodzia is exceptional in terms of Scandinavian and Kievian Rus links. The Bodzia man (sample VK157, or burial E864/I) was not a simple warrior from the princely retinue, but he belonged to the princely family himself. His burial is the richest one in the whole cemetery. Moreover, strontium analysis of his teeth enamel shows he was not local. It is assumed that he came to Poland with the Prince of Kiev, Sviatopolk the Accursed, and met a violent death in combat. This corresponds to the events of 1018 AD when Sviatopolk himself disappeared after having retreated from Kiev to Poland. It cannot be excluded that the Bodzia man was Sviatopolk himself, as the genealogy of the Rurikids at this period is extremely sketchy and the dates of birth of many princes of this dynasty may be quite approximative. The Bodzia man carried haplogroup I1-S2077 and had both Scandinavian ancestry and Russian admixture.[16][272]",

                "content": "The Vikings were Scandinavian people from Northern Europe who were known as great seamen and warriors. From the 8th to the 11th centuries they travelled to Europe in their long ships. They attacked and later settled in areas that are now modern Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy.[1] The people of the far north, later called Vikings, were first noticed by the Romans around the year 100 BC.[a][6] This is when the Cimbri and the Teutons moved into southern Gaul.[6] The Romans believed these war-like tribes came from Jutland. But the Romans suspected they were only a part of a greater threat located further north.[6] The Roman historians Jordanes described the destructive Ostrogoths and Visigoths as having come from Gotland.[6] The Frankish Empire that came after them in Gaul became more and more aware of the northern threat.[6] As the later Carolingian Empire expanded into northern Germany they came into contact with the Danish people. This is when the Vikings appear in written history.[6] The first recorded raid in Britain was at Lindisfarne in 793.[7] Why the Vikings began raiding is not clear. A popular theory is the populations had grown to the point there was not enough food to feed everyone.[8] The earliest raiders did not seem to want to move out of Scandinavia. They turned to looting, then returning home. These raids were possible because the Vikings were master boat builders. They made flat bottomed boats ideal for journeys up rivers. Many monasteries were on the rivers and were raided. [9] Raiding was easy. It became more and more popular among the Vikings.[8] Three different groups of Vikings took different, sometimes overlapping, routes.[8] Europeans were scared of the Vikings because of their strong weapons, swift attacks, and cruel fighting tactics. They were known for their bad treatment of women, children and monks in the places where they fought. When the Vikings came to England, the English kings paid them to leave the country. The Vikings took their money and sometimes fought them anyway. These payments were called Danegeld. From the 9th century to 1066, when the Duke of Normandy, who became King William I of England, conquered it, Danish and Norwegian Vikings ruled large parts of England. Because of their longships, which could float in 4 feet (1.3m) of water, the Vikings were able to make their way up rivers and land deep inside a country. They sailed up the River Shannon in Ireland and built a harbour 60 miles (100 km) from the coast. There was a difference in who led Viking raids. In the 9th century, Viking Age raids were led by men who may have been exiles in their own countries.[10] The later Viking raids in the late 10th century and early 11th century and were led by Kings.[10] Some of the early leaders tried to become kings with the riches they plundered from Europe and Russia. Some were successful but most were not.[10] The Vikings were called Rus' by the peoples east of the Baltic Sea.[11] The Vikings who settled in Kiev formed the first Russian state.[11] The Vikings (Rus') who served the Byzantine Emperors were called Varangians. They became the personal bodyguards to the Emperor and were called the Varangian Guard.[12] The Vikings travelled through Russia, the Mediterranean Sea, southern Europe, northern Africa and south-western Asia. Some Vikings sailed across the Atlantic Ocean via Iceland and Greenland and may have explored places in North America. The ruins of a Viking settlement have been found at L'Anse-aux-Meadows, Newfoundland.[13][14] Archaeologists used radiocarbon dating to find out how old the settlement was. Their tests gave them a range of dates from about AD 700 to about AD 1000.[15] Some English words, and many place names, come from the Scandinavian and Viking language (Norse). For example, the words skirt and shirt came from the word skyrta, meaning a tunic. As English changed, the semantics altered to give us the separate words 'skirt' and 'shirt' we know today. Skin came from the Norse word skinn (which meant to strip the meat off something). Some place-names in the areas the Vikings conquered are still in use.[16] For example, in Yorkshire places ending with thwaite meant a clearing[17] and dale meant a valley. The word thorpe meant new village, such as Scunthorpe.[18] The Anglo-Saxons called the Vikings pagans. They worshiped many gods. Viking gods belonged to two groups of gods in Norse mythology, the Aesir and the Vanir.[19] The pagan Vikings were exposed to Christianity from the beginning of the Viking Age.[20] They were surrounded by Christian countries. Early Christian missionaries were either enslaved or put to death.[21] The Vikings came into contact with Christianity when they raided other areas around them.[20] Viking raids produced many Christian slaves who were brought back to Scandinavia. They called Christians \"Cross-men\" because of the cross in their worship.[22] Many Vikings used Thors hammer as their religious symbol. When Vikings settled in Christian areas they converted to Christianity. There are still headstones in England with both a cross and a hammer. Perhaps they thought it was better to be safe than sorry.[20] That, or the more gods the better. As some Vikings turned from raiding to trading they found a nominal (in name only) profession of Christianity to be helpful.[23] Scandinavia, their homeland, was slower to change to the Christian religion. By the mid-11th century most of Norway and Denmark had converted. Sweden was converted by the mid-12th century.[20] The Viking's religion affected Christianity as well. The pagan celebration of Yuletide became Christmas.[22] Priests blessing the fields took the place of pagan fertility rites of spring held to make sure there was a good harvest.[22] Norse kept their \"farm gods\" well after Christianity just to make sure they were protected. Santa Claus owes much of his legend to the Norse god Odin. With his snow-white beard he traveled the midwinter sky on his eight-footed steed Sleipnir visiting his people with gifts. He became Father Christmas. Blended with the Christian Saint Nicholas he became Santa Claus. [22] In the late 19th century Richard Wagner and other artists in the Romantic period made operas and other artwork about ancient Germanic culture. They liked the Vikings because they were not Greeks or Romans. They came up with the idea of Vikings wearing fur clothes and helmets with wings or horns on them and drinking out of hollowed-out animal horns. Some ancient Germans wore helmets with horns on them, but real Vikings did not. Wagner and his partners dressed the actors in the opera Ring des Nibelungen so they would look like ancient Germans and so the audience would feel like modern Germans came from medieval Vikings.[24][25]",

From here they travelled great distances, mainly by sea and river – as far as North America to the west, Russia to the east, Lapland to the north and the Mediterranean World (Constantinople) and Iraq (Baghdad) to the south. We know about them through archaeology, poetry, sagas and proverbs, treaties, and the writings of people in Europe and Asia whom they encountered. They left very little written evidence themselves. As well as warriors, they were skilled craftsmen and boat-builders, adventurous explorers and wide-ranging traders. See Viking trade and Viking travel. What we call the Viking Age, and their relationship with England, lasted from approximately 800 to 1150 AD – though Scandinavian adventurers, merchants and mercenaries were of course active before and after this period. Their expansion during the Viking Age took the form of warfare, exploration, settlement and trade. During this period, around 200,000 people left Scandinavia to settle in other lands, mainly Newfoundland (Canada), Greenland, Iceland, Ireland, England, Scotland, the islands around Britain, France (where they became the Normans), Russia and Sicily. They traded extensively with the Muslim world and fought as mercenaries for the Byzantine emperors of Constantinople (Istanbul). However, by the end of the 11th century the great days of Viking expansion were over. Vikings in Britain: background and legacy Historians disagree about the origin of the word Viking. In Old Norse the word means a pirate raid, from either vikja (to move swiftly) or vik (an inlet). This captures the essence of the Vikings, fast-moving sailors who used the water as their highway to take them across the northern Atlantic, around the coasts of Europe and up its rivers to trade, raid or settle. In their poetry they call the sea 'the whale road'. Anglo-Saxon writers called them Danes, Norsemen, Northmen, the Great Army, sea rovers, sea wolves, or the heathen. From around 860AD onwards, Vikings stayed, settled and prospered in Britain, becoming part of the mix of people who today make up the British nation. Our names for days of the week come mainly from Norse gods – Tuesday from Tiw or Týr, Wednesday from Woden (Odin), Thursday from Thor and so on. Many of their other words have also become part of English, for example egg, steak, law, die, bread, down, fog, muck, lump and scrawny. To see questions children have asked about the Vikings, see our Viking starter lesson. A short history of the Vikings in Britain In 793 came the first recorded Viking raid, where 'on the Ides of June the harrying of the heathen destroyed God's church on Lindisfarne, bringing ruin and slaughter' (The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle). These ruthless pirates continued to make regular raids around the coasts of England, looting treasure and other goods, and capturing people as slaves. Monasteries were often targeted, for their precious silver or gold chalices, plates, bowls and crucifixes. Gradually, the Viking raiders began to stay, first in winter camps, then settling in land they had seized, mainly in the east and north of England. See The Vikings settle down. Outside Anglo-Saxon England, to the north of Britain, the Vikings took over and settled Iceland, the Faroes and Orkney, becoming farmers and fishermen, and sometimes going on summer trading or raiding voyages. Orkney became powerful, and from there the Earls of Orkney ruled most of Scotland. To this day, especially on the north-east coast, many Scots still bear Viking names. To the west of Britain, the Isle of Man became a Viking kingdom. The island still has its Tynwald, or ting-vollr (assembly field), a reminder of Viking rule. In Ireland, the Vikings raided around the coasts and up the rivers. They founded the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick as Viking strongholds. Meanwhile, back in England, the Vikings took over Northumbria, East Anglia and parts of Mercia. In 866 they captured modern York (Viking name: Jorvik) and made it their capital. They continued to press south and west. The kings of Mercia and Wessex resisted as best they could, but with little success until the time of Alfred of Wessex, the only king of England to be called ‘the Great'. King Alfred and the Danes King Alfred ruled from 871-899 and after many trials and tribulations (including the famous story of the burning of the cakes!) he defeated the Vikings at the Battle of Edington in 878. After the battle the Viking leader Guthrum converted to Christianity. In 886 Alfred took London from the Vikings and fortified it. The same year he signed a treaty with Guthrum. The treaty partitioned England between Vikings and English. The Viking territory became known as the Danelaw. It comprised the north-west, the north-east and east of England. Here, people would be subject to Danish laws. Alfred became king of the rest. Alfred's grandson, Athelstan, became the first true King of England. He led an English victory over the Vikings at the Battle of Brunaburh in 937, and his kingdom for the first time included the Danelaw. In 954, Eirik Bloodaxe, the last Viking king of York, was killed and his kingdom was taken over by English earls. See Egils Saga. Later Viking raids and rulers However, the Viking raiding did not stop – different Viking bands made regular raiding voyages around the coasts of Britain for over 300 years after 793. In 991, during the reign of Æthelred 'the Unready' ('ill-advised'), Olaf Tryggvason's Viking raiding party defeated the Anglo-Saxon defenders (recorded in the poem The Battle of Maldon), with Æthelred responding by paying 'Danegeld' in an attempt to buy off the Vikings. So the Vikings were not permanently defeated – England was to have four Viking kings between 1013 and 1042. The greatest of these was King Cnut, who was king of Denmark as well as of England. A Christian, he did not force the English to obey Danish law; instead he recognised Anglo-Saxon law and customs. He worked to create a north Atlantic empire that united Scandinavia and Britain. Unfortunately, he died at the age of 39, and his sons had short, troubled reigns. The final Viking invasion of England came in 1066, when Harald Hardrada sailed up the River Humber and marched to Stamford Bridge with his men. His battle banner was called Land-waster. The English king, Harold Godwinson, marched north with his army and defeated Hardrada in a long and bloody battle. The English had repelled the last invasion from Scandinavia. However, immediately after the battle, King Harold heard that William of Normandy had landed in Kent with yet another invading army. With no time to rest, Harold's army marched swiftly back south to meet this new threat. The exhausted English army fought the Normans at the Battle of Hastings on 14th October, 1066. At the end of a long day's fighting the Normans had won, King Harold was dead, and William was the new king of England. The irony is that William was of Viking descent: his great-great-great-grandfather Rollo was a Viking who in 911 had invaded Normandy in northern France. His people had become French over time, but in one sense this final successful invasion of England was another Viking one. Vikings: key concepts Viking Raiding Invasion Settlement Danelaw Viking Age | In Britain: background | Short history | King Alfred | Later raids & rulers | Key concepts This resource is free for everyone The Vikings' homeland was Scandinavia: modern Norway, Sweden and Denmark. From here they travelled great distances, mainly by sea and river – as far as North America to the west, Russia to the east, Lapland to the north and the Mediterranean World (Constantinople) and Iraq (Baghdad) to the south. We know about them through archaeology, poetry, sagas and proverbs, treaties, and the writings of people in Europe and Asia whom they encountered. They left very little written evidence themselves. As well as warriors, they were skilled craftsmen and boat-builders, adventurous explorers and wide-ranging traders. See Viking trade and Viking travel. What we call the Viking Age, and their relationship with England, lasted from approximately 800 to 1150 AD – though Scandinavian adventurers, merchants and mercenaries were of course active before and after this period. Their expansion during the Viking Age took the form of warfare, exploration, settlement and trade. During this period, around 200,000 people left Scandinavia to settle in other lands, mainly Newfoundland (Canada), Greenland, Iceland, Ireland, England, Scotland, the islands around Britain, France (where they became the Normans), Russia and Sicily. They traded extensively with the Muslim world and fought as mercenaries for the Byzantine emperors of Constantinople (Istanbul). However, by the end of the 11th century the great days of Viking expansion were over. Historians disagree about the origin of the word Viking. In Old Norse the word means a pirate raid, from either vikja (to move swiftly) or vik (an inlet). This captures the essence of the Vikings, fast-moving sailors who used the water as their highway to take them across the northern Atlantic, around the coasts of Europe and up its rivers to trade, raid or settle. In their poetry they call the sea 'the whale road'. Anglo-Saxon writers called them Danes, Norsemen, Northmen, the Great Army, sea rovers, sea wolves, or the heathen. From around 860AD onwards, Vikings stayed, settled and prospered in Britain, becoming part of the mix of people who today make up the British nation. Our names for days of the week come mainly from Norse gods – Tuesday from Tiw or Týr, Wednesday from Woden (Odin), Thursday from Thor and so on. Many of their other words have also become part of English, for example egg, steak, law, die, bread, down, fog, muck, lump and scrawny. To see questions children have asked about the Vikings, see our Viking starter lesson. In 793 came the first recorded Viking raid, where 'on the Ides of June the harrying of the heathen destroyed God's church on Lindisfarne, bringing ruin and slaughter' (The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle). These ruthless pirates continued to make regular raids around the coasts of England, looting treasure and other goods, and capturing people as slaves. Monasteries were often targeted, for their precious silver or gold chalices, plates, bowls and crucifixes. Gradually, the Viking raiders began to stay, first in winter camps, then settling in land they had seized, mainly in the east and north of England. See The Vikings settle down. Outside Anglo-Saxon England, to the north of Britain, the Vikings took over and settled Iceland, the Faroes and Orkney, becoming farmers and fishermen, and sometimes going on summer trading or raiding voyages. Orkney became powerful, and from there the Earls of Orkney ruled most of Scotland. To this day, especially on the north-east coast, many Scots still bear Viking names. To the west of Britain, the Isle of Man became a Viking kingdom. The island still has its Tynwald, or ting-vollr (assembly field), a reminder of Viking rule. In Ireland, the Vikings raided around the coasts and up the rivers. They founded the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick as Viking strongholds. Meanwhile, back in England, the Vikings took over Northumbria, East Anglia and parts of Mercia. In 866 they captured modern York (Viking name: Jorvik) and made it their capital. They continued to press south and west. The kings of Mercia and Wessex resisted as best they could, but with little success until the time of Alfred of Wessex, the only king of England to be called ‘the Great'. King Alfred ruled from 871-899 and after many trials and tribulations (including the famous story of the burning of the cakes!) he defeated the Vikings at the Battle of Edington in 878.

                "title": "139 Old Norse Words That Invaded The English Language",
                "content": "Modern English is commonly thought of as a West Germanic language, with lots of French and, thanks to the church, Latin influence thrown in the mix. But this take on English leaves out a very important piece of the linguistic puzzle: Old Norse, the language of the Vikings. The English we speak today is riddled with lingual remnants leftover from a time when wearing ornately-decorated helmets was all the rage. Let’s take a look at some Old Norse words that have withstood the test of time by fighting their way into our modern vocabulary. The Old Norse word víking meant an overseas expedition, and a vikingr was someone who went on one of these expeditions. In the popular imagination, the Vikings were essentially pirates from the fjords of Denmark and Norway who descended on medieval England like a bloodthirsty frat party — they pillaged, murdered and razed villages, only to sail right back across the North Sea with their loot. Reality is far more nuanced, though. The earliest Viking activity in England did consist of coastal raids, but by the 870s, the Danes had traded sword for plow and were settled across most of Northern England in an area governed by treaties known as the Danelaw. England even had Danish kings from 1018 to 1042. However, the more successful and longer-lasting Norman conquest in 1066 marked the end of the Viking era and virtually erased Danish influence in almost all aspects of English culture but one: its effect on the development of the English language. Traust me, þó (though) it may seem oddi at first, we er still very líkligr to use the same words the Vikings did in our everyday speech. Þeirra (their) language evolved into the modern-day Scandinavian languages, but þeir (they) also gave English the gift of hundreds of words. [A note on the letter þ: the Old Norse letter, called thorn, makes the same sound as the “th” in “thin”.] The most obvious Old Norse influence on modern English is the word Thursday (Þorsdagr), which you might guess means “Thor’s day.” “Tuesday,” “Wednesday” and “Friday” are sometimes also attributed to the Norse gods Tyr, Odin and Freya respectively, but the weekdays are actually named for the Anglo-Saxon equivalents of these gods, Tiw, Wodan and Friga. The similarity of these names points to the common ancestry shared by the various Germanic tribes in prehistoric northern Europe, centuries before their descendants clashed on England’s shores. If the Vikings are famous for one thing, it’s their obsession with war. They didn’t just bring death and destruction to medieval England, they brought really cool words for death and destruction. They were certainly a rough bunch. Just look at a Viking the rangr (wrong) way, and he might þrysta (thrust) a knifr into your skulle. Here are some more violent Old Norse words we can thank the Vikings for: a Viking warrior who entered battle wearing nothing for armor but an animal skin gunn (war) + hildr (battle) Life in the Danelaw wasn’t all murder and mayhem, of course. Ironically, these savage berserkers also gave us many Old Norse words now central to our more “civilized” culture: Although most English animal names retain their Anglo-Saxon roots (cow, bear, hound, swine, chicken, etc.), the Vikings did bring a few Old Norse words to our animal vocabulary: Some words associated with hunting and trapping also come from the Vikings. Sleuth now means “detective,” but the original slóth meant “trail” or “track.” Snare, on the other hand, retains the original meaning of the Old Norse snara. Old Norse words are good for describing bleikr landscapes and weather. This was especially useful in Viking-inhabited northern England, where both flatr and rogg (rugged) terrain are often shrouded in fok, and oppressed by gustr of wind and lagr (low) ský (clouds). Much of the Danelaw bordered swamps and alluvial plains, so it’s no surprise that many Old Norse words for dirty, mucky things still survive in English: Thanks to the cross-cultural fermentation that occurred in the Danelaw, the English language is much closer to those of its Scandinavian neighbors than many acknowledge. By the time the Norman conquest brought the irreversible influence of French, Old English had already been transformed beyond its Anglo-Saxon roots. This is still in evidence today: Modern English grammar and syntax are more similar to modern Scandinavian languages than to Old English. This suggests that Old Norse didn’t just introduce new words, it also influenced how the Anglo-Saxons constructed their sentences. Some linguists even claim that English should be reclassified as a North Germanic language (along with Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic and Swedish), rather than a West Germanic language (with Dutch and German). The Viking influence may be most apparent in the Yorkshire dialect, which uses even more Old Norse words in daily speech than standard English does. English is probably too much of a hybrid to ever neatly classify, but its Old Norse rót is clearly there among the tangle of Anglo-Saxon, French and Latin roots. The language of the Vikings may have become subdued over the centuries, but make no mistaka about it: from byrðr (birth) undtil we deyja (die), Norse’s raw energy simmers under the surface of everything we say. We use Old Norse words every day without even realizing it. John-Erik was born in Los Angeles and grew up in a suburb named after Tarzan (yes, really).

                "title": "Jalen Hurts - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Jalen Alexander Hurts[1] (born August 7, 1998) is an American professional football quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He began his college football career with the Alabama Crimson Tide, leading the team to consecutive College Football Playoff National Championship appearances in 2016 and 2017. After being benched for Tua Tagovailoa during Alabama's victory in the latter championship, Hurts spent one season as a backup in 2018. He played his final season with the Oklahoma Sooners, leading them to an appearance in the 2019–20 College Football Playoff. Selected by the Eagles in the second round of the 2020 NFL draft, Hurts became their starter near the end of his rookie season. Hurts had a breakout season in 2022 when he led the Eagles to their conference's top seed and an appearance in Super Bowl LVII, earning him Pro Bowl and second-team All-Pro honors. In total, he has led Philadelphia to the playoffs in all four of his seasons as the primary starter and received two Pro Bowl selections. Hurts attended Channelview High School in Channelview, Texas.[2] Hurts's father, Averion, was the football coach at Channelview High School throughout his son's high school career. As a senior, he passed for 2,384 yards with 26 touchdown passes and rushed for 1,391 yards and 25 touchdowns. Hurts was a second-team all-district selection as a sophomore and was named the District 21-6A Overall MVP as a junior during his high school playing years. Throughout his high school career Hurts was rated as a four-star recruit and was ranked among the top dual-threat quarterbacks in the Class of 2016.[3] Although Texas A&M made a strong push to recruit Hurts, Hurts committed to the University of Alabama on June 5, 2015. He was recruited by Alabama's defensive line coach Bo Davis and offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin.[4] In addition to football, Hurts participated in powerlifting. As a sophomore in high school, Hurts was squatting 500 pounds (230 kg) of weight and would eventually become regional finalist in the 198-pound weight class.[5] As a true freshman for the Alabama Crimson Tide football team in 2016, Hurts competed to open the season as the starting quarterback.[6][7] Blake Barnett started the first game against the USC Trojans, but by the second game, Hurts had taken over the starting role, becoming the first true freshman to start at quarterback for Alabama in 32 years (Vince Sutton in 1984 was the last).[8][9] Hurts produced a historic freshman season under head coach Nick Saban. He threw for 2,780 yards and 23 touchdowns with nine interceptions. His completion percentage was at 62.8 percent, and he finished the season with a quarterback rating of 139.12. He rushed for a total of 954 yards and 13 touchdowns, breaking the school single-season record for rushing yards by a quarterback, surpassing Steadman Shealy's previous record of 791 yards. He finished the 2016 season with 36 overall touchdowns breaking the previous record for touchdowns in a single season for the Crimson Tide (35) set by Blake Sims in 2014.[10] Hurts became the first quarterback coached by Nick Saban to rush for more than 11 touchdowns in a single season. He was the first player in Alabama history to pass for 300 yards and rush for 100 yards in the same game and the first quarterback to rush for 120 yards or more in multiple games. In the Iron Bowl game against Auburn, Hurts completed 75% of his passes, which set a new Iron Bowl record.[10] Alabama concluded its 2016–2017 regular season with a perfect 12–0 (8–0 SEC) record. On November 30, 2016, Hurts was declared one of the ten finalists for the Manning Award, which is given to the nation's top college quarterback. On December 3, 2016, he led his team to win the 2016 SEC Championship over the Florida Gators and was subsequently named SEC Offensive Player of the Year, SEC Freshman of the Year, and received Freshman All-American from several publications. Hurts was featured on the cover page of Sports Illustrated College Football Playoff magazine on December 6, 2016.[11] On January 9, 2017, top-seeded Alabama lost the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship against the Clemson Tigers by a score of 35–31.[12] The bowl game was played at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. In 2017, Hurts led the Tide to an 11–1 regular season record, losing 26–14 to Auburn in the regular season finale. The Tide still qualified for the College Football Playoff as the #4 seed, where they played Clemson in the 2018 Sugar Bowl semifinal. Hurts was the offensive MVP[13] in that game, with Daron Payne being the defensive MVP in a 24–6 win over the Tigers. Going up against the Georgia Bulldogs in the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship, Alabama fell behind 13–0 at halftime, and Hurts was benched in favor of true freshman Tua Tagovailoa.[14] Tagovailoa led the Crimson Tide to a come-from-behind 26–23 victory in overtime.[15] Hurts finished the 2017 season with 2,081 passing yards, 17 passing touchdowns, and one interception to go along with 855 rushing yards and eight rushing touchdowns.[16] After Tagovailoa led the Crimson Tide to victory in the National Championship the year before, questions arose if Hurts would remain the starting quarterback for Alabama.[17] In the season opener against Louisville, Tagovailoa was the starter. Hurts came into the game in a rotation. He had 70 passing yards in the 51–14 victory.[18] Tagovailoa was officially named the starter going into the next game against Arkansas State.[19] In a backup role, Hurts earned significant playing time in the 2018 season.[20] In the 2018 SEC Championship Game, he relieved an injured Tagovailoa and led the team to a comeback victory against Georgia.[21] Alabama moved to 13–0 and secured a spot in the College Football Playoff.[22][23] Hurts completed his B.A. in communication and information sciences in December 2018.[1] On January 16, 2019, Hurts announced via social media that he would be transferring to the University of Oklahoma for his final year of eligibility. As a graduate transfer, he was eligible to play for the 2019 season.[24] In his first game as a Sooner on September 1, 2019, Hurts shattered Oklahoma's single-game yardage record in a debut (previously held by Baker Mayfield when he put up 396 yards of total offense against Akron in 2015), putting up 508 yards of total offense against Houston.[25] On September 28, in a 55–14 victory over Texas Tech, he had 415 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, and one interception to go along with nine carries for 70 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown.[26] Hurts helped lead Oklahoma to a 7–0 start to the season. The team's first setback came against Kansas State on October 26. In the 48–41 loss, Hurts passed for 395 yards and a passing touchdown to go along with 19 carries for 96 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns.[27] Hurts helped lead Oklahoma to a Big 12 Championship and a spot in the College Football Playoff.[28] The Sooners' season ended with a 63–28 loss to LSU in the 2019 Peach Bowl.[29] Hurts recorded a successful season with the Sooners, recording 3,851 passing yards, 32 passing touchdowns, and eight interceptions to go along with 1,298 rushing yards and 20 rushing touchdowns.[30] He finished second in the Heisman Trophy voting to Joe Burrow.[31] Hurts completed his M.A. in human relations in May 2023.[32] The Philadelphia Eagles selected Hurts 53rd overall in the second round of the 2020 NFL draft.[35] After originally being named the third-string quarterback behind Nate Sudfeld, he gained the backup position at Week 2, mainly so he could be used for quarterback runs or as a decoy.[36][37] On December 6, 2020, Hurts relieved Carson Wentz, who was benched due to ineffective play, against the Green Bay Packers.[38] In this Week 13 matchup, Hurts threw his career first passing touchdown to Greg Ward and finished with 109 passing yards with a touchdown and an interception in the 30–16 loss.[39] On December 8, 2020, Hurts was named the starter for their Week 14 game against the New Orleans Saints.[40][41] In his first NFL start, Hurts completed 17 of 30 passing attempts for 167 passing yards and one touchdown, leading the Eagles to a 24–21 win. Hurts also added 106 rushing yards, totaling 273 all purpose yards.[42] On December 20, 2020, in Week 15 against the Arizona Cardinals, Hurts finished with 338 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, 63 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown in the 33–26 loss.[43] In Week 16 against the Dallas Cowboys, Hurts threw for 342 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions, and rushed for 69 yards during the 37–17 loss.[44] In Week 17 against the Washington Football Team on Sunday Night Football, Hurts threw for 72 yards and an interception and rushed for 34 yards and two touchdowns before being benched in favor of Sudfeld during the 20–14 loss.[45] Hurts's benching drew allegations of Eagles head coach Doug Pederson attempting to deliberately lose the game;[46][47][48] Pederson was fired shortly afterwards.[49] Before the start of the regular season, Hurts switched his jersey number to No. 1, which had become available with the departure of punter Cameron Johnston.[50] On August 31, 2021, Hurts was named the starter for the regular season by new head coach Nick Sirianni.[51] In the season opener against the Atlanta Falcons, Hurts led the Eagles to a 32–6 victory, throwing for three touchdowns and a passer rating of 126.4.[52] During a Week 12 loss to the New York Giants, Hurts suffered an ankle injury which kept him out for the following week's game against the New York Jets.[53] The Eagles won that game 33–18 led by backup quarterback Gardner Minshew.[54] Hurts returned after the bye week in a Week 15 matchup against Washington en route to a 27–17 victory.[55] Hurts helped lead the Eagles to a playoff berth after defeating the Washington Football Team 20–16 in Week 17 and with wins from the San Francisco 49ers and Packers later that day.[56] On December 23, 2021, Hurts was named a 2021 Pro Bowl National Football Conference (NFC) alternate.[57] In the 2021 season, Hurts finished with 3,144 passing yards, 16 passing touchdowns, and nine interceptions to go along with 139 carries for 784 rushing yards and ten rushing touchdowns.[58] He led all quarterbacks in rushing yards and rushing touchdowns in the 2021 season.[59] In the Wild Card Round against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Hurts threw for 258 yards and a touchdown, but fumbled once and threw two interceptions in the 31–15 loss.[60] Hurts completed 22 of his 35 pass attempts for 340 yards and three touchdowns in a 24–8 victory to improve to 3–0 on the season.[61] For his performance, Hurts was named NFC Offensive Player of Month for September, becoming the first Eagles player to win the award since 2017.[62] After a 29–17 victory over the Houston Texans, Hurts became the first Eagles quarterback to lead the team to an 8–0 record.[63] In Week 12, Hurts rushed for 157 yards and threw for 153 yards and two touchdowns in a 40–33 win over the Packers, earning NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[64] He became the first player with 150+ rushing yards, 150+ passing yards and multiple passing touchdowns in a single game.[65] In Week 13, Hurts threw 380 pass yards and four total touchdowns (three passing, one rushing) against the Tennessee Titans, becoming the first Eagles player with at least 350 pass yards, three passing touchdowns, and a rushing touchdown in the same game.[66] With a Week 14 win over the Giants, Hurts led the Eagles to a consecutive playoff berth. A day after the win over the Bears, it was revealed that Hurts sprained his throwing shoulder, ruling him out for the Eagles' Week 16 game against the Cowboys.[67][68] Despite his injury, Hurts would help lead the Eagles to a 22–16 victory over the Giants in Week 18.[69] Hurts finished the season with a starting record of 14–1, tying a franchise-best (with Randall Cunningham) 35 total touchdowns (22 passing, 13 rushing) to just six interceptions,[70] 3,701 passing yards, and a 101.5 quarterback rating. As a result of his play in the 2022 season, Hurts was named to his first career Pro Bowl,[71] and was a Second Team All-Pro.[72] On January 25, 2023, Hurts was named as one of the five finalists for the NFL Most Valuable Player Award.[73] On January 21, 2023, Hurts led the Eagles to a 38–7 victory over the Giants in the Divisional Round of the 2022–23 NFL playoffs.[74] In doing so, Hurts won his first playoff game, and later led the Eagles to a 31–7 win in the NFC Championship against the 49ers to advance to Super Bowl LVII and face the Kansas City Chiefs.[75] In the game, Hurts threw for 304 yards and a touchdown, and rushed for 70 yards and scored three rushing touchdowns, the most rushing yards and rushing touchdowns by a quarterback in Super Bowl history. His three touchdowns and a two-point conversion also tied the record for most points scored in a Super Bowl with 20. However, Hurts also lost a fumble which was returned for a touchdown by Nick Bolton in the second quarter, and attempted a Hail Mary pass on the last play of the game which fell short as the Eagles lost to the Chiefs, 38–35.[76][77][78] He was ranked third by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[79] On April 17, 2023, Hurts signed a five-year contract extension for $255 million ($180 million guaranteed), making him the highest paid player in NFL history, although that was surpassed just 10 days later by Lamar Jackson's contract with the Baltimore Ravens. The deal also includes a no-trade clause, the first in Eagles history.[80] In Week 8, Hurts threw for 319 yards and four touchdowns in a 38–31 win over the Washington Commanders, earning NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[81] In a Week 9 game against the Cowboys, Hurts scored his 33rd career rushing touchdown, surpassing Randall Cunningham for the most by a quarterback in franchise history.[82] In Week 12, Hurts achieved his 10th rushing touchdown for the season and finished with 265 total passing and rushing yards and five touchdowns in a 37–34 win over the Buffalo Bills. He became the first quarterback in NFL history to have three consecutive seasons with at least 10 rushing touchdowns each.[83] In Week 16, in a game against the Giants, Hurts scored his 15th rushing touchdown of the season, breaking the record for rushing touchdowns in a single season by a quarterback, which was previously set by Cam Newton in 2011.[84] The following week, in a game against the Cardinals, Hurts scored his 36th total touchdown of the season with a throw to wide receiver Julio Jones, breaking the franchise record held by Randall Cunningham that Hurts had tied the season prior.[85] In Week 18, Hurts suffered a dislocated middle finger against the Giants and was taken out of the game early. The following week, the Eagles lost 32–9 in the Wild Card round of the playoffs against the Buccaneers.[86] He earned Pro Bowl honors for the 2023 season.[87] Hurts ultimately finished the season with career highs in passing and rushing touchdowns, but also set career highs in interceptions and fumbles lost.[88] Hurts was ranked 15th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2024.[89] In his season debut, Hurts led the Eagles to a 34–29 victory over the Green Bay Packers in Brazil, completing 20 of 34 passes for 278 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions.[90] The following week, Hurts threw for 183 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in a 22–21 loss to the Atlanta Falcons, adding his first rush of the season with a two-point conversion to tie the game in the fourth quarter.[91] In Week 7, Hurts guided the Eagles to a commanding 28–3 win over the Giants, scoring two one-yard rushing touchdowns and a passing touchdown.[92] On November 10, Hurts accounted for four total touchdowns—two passing and two rushing—along with one interception in a 34–6 rout of the Cowboys.[93] It marked the third time the Eagles scored over 30 points in a game and the second time they accomplished the feat against a division rival.[94] Hurts's parents are Pamela and Averion Hurts. Hurts has two siblings: a younger sister, Kynnedy, and an older brother, Averion, named after their father.[95] Averion was the starting quarterback for Texas Southern University and is now a college football coach at the University of Alabama. As of Hurts's freshman year, one of his parents attended his football game every week, while the other attended Averion's game.[96] On September 13, 2024, Hurts announced his engagement to his college sweetheart, Bryonna \"Bry\" Rivera Burrows.[97][98] Hurts is a Baptist.[99][100] He has said, \"I keep God at the center of everything. I give Him all the praise, I lean on Him all the time. And I know that everything unfolds the way it’s supposed to.\"[101] On June 20, 2022, Hurts filed for a trademark for the phrase \"HURTS SO GOOD.\" The trademark registry says that it will be used for a clothing line that includes \"men's, women's and children's clothing, namely shirts, jackets, sweatshirts, pants, shorts, vests, gloves, socks, sweaters, underwear, skirts, hats and belts.\"[102] As of November 2024, the application is still under review by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.[103] Jalen Hurts is an advocate for women in sports and employs an all-female management team, including his social media, marketing, communications, and sports agent team members.[104] In 2021, Hurts honored female empowerment and women in sports when participating in the NFL's \"My Cause, My Cleats\" initiative.[105] In 2022, Hurts provided vocals on the Christmas album A Philly Special Christmas.[106]",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/philadelphia-eagles Eagles QB doubles down with mismatched cleats and a bold message to Roger Goodell's league Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is no stranger to making statements on and off the field, but his latest act has sparked controversy with the NFL. After being fined $5,628 for wearing two different colored cleats during Week 15 against the Steelers-a violation of the NFL's strict uniform policy-Hurts doubled down with a bold response during the Eagles' next matchup. As he arrived at FedEx Field for the Eagles' game against the Commanders, Hurts was seen wearing a two-tone suit, pairing a black shirt with a grey blazer. Many fans and analysts interpreted this as a subtle jab at the NFL's decision to fine him for his cleat choice. The fine stemmed from Hurts wearing mismatched Air Jordan 11 cleats that didn't align with the Eagles' official team colors. According to the league's uniform rules, cleats must match the team's designated palette. Hurts explained the situation, saying, \"I was supposed to wear the Columbia 11s that I gifted to the kids at the Wings Initiative after last week's game, but they never came in.\" Related: Despite the fine, Hurts wore the same mismatched cleats-Kelly green and a lighter green shade-against Washington, seemingly unfazed by the potential for a second penalty, which could reach $16,883. While $5,628 is negligible compared to Hurts' $51 million annual salary, the quarterback's actions appear to be less about money and more about challenging a rule that many see as outdated. Fans rallied behind him on social media, celebrating his rebellious stance. Jalen Hurts was removed from Sunday's game against the Washington Commanders in the first quarter after taking a hard hit to the head on a 13-yard scramble. Despite initially resisting the referee's orders to exit, Hurts left the field for a concussion evaluation, entering the medical tent and later the locker room.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/philadelphia-eagles Hurts evaluated for a concussion after taking a hit on a 13-yard scramble in the first quarter Philadelphia Eagles quarterbackJalen Hurts was forced to leave Sunday's game against the Washington Commanders in the first quarter to be evaluated for a concussion. The incident occurred after Hurts took a hit to the head on a 13-yard scramble to Washington's 21-yard line. Despite his initial reluctance, officials ultimately removed Hurts from the field for a medical evaluation. Backup quarterback Kenny Pickett stepped in and completed the drive, connecting with AJ Brown on a 3-yard touchdown pass to give the Eagles a 14-0 lead with just over seven minutes left in the opening quarter. Related: The play that sidelined Hurts began with a designed run up the middle. As Hurts dove forward, he took a hard hit to the head. Initially, he attempted to stay in the game, returning to the huddle despite the referee's orders to exit. After further insistence from officials, Hurts left the field and entered the blue medical tent. He briefly returned to the sideline as the Eagles offense advanced to Washington's 3-yard line, but rather than reentering the game, Hurts returned to the medical tent before heading to the locker room. The Eagles have not yet provided an official update on Hurts' status. He is undergoing further evaluations to determine if he suffered a concussion. Under NFL protocol, a player diagnosed with a concussion must clear several steps, including independent medical approval, before returning to game action. Pickett managed the offense effectively in Hurts' absence, but losing their star quarterback could significantly impact the Eagles' season, especially as they battle for playoff seeding. Fans and analysts alike will be closely monitoring Hurts' status in the coming days. Updates are expected postgame. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "content": "It took a fumble on a chaotic first-down play but the Dallas Cowboys earned their fourth win in five games, 26-24, over the visiting Tampa Bay Buccaneers on \"Sunday Night Football.\" Down two with 1:41 to go, Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield escaped pressure on first down and flicked the ball to running back Rachaad White, who ran forward for five yards before Cowboys cornerback Jourdan Lewis forced a fumble. Teammate DaRon Bland recovered the ball at the Tampa Bay 31 and the Cowboys' offense kneeled out the clock for the narrow victory. Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush had one of his best nights as a starter this season, including a career-high 226 passing yards in the first half. He finished the night 26 of 35 passing for 292 yards and a touchdown as the Cowboys leaned on the passing game all night. Tampa Bay struggled to start with a turnover on downs on their first drive due to a dropped pass on fourth down by wide receiver Sterling Shepard. They'd go three-and-out on their next drive but scored two touchdowns in their final three drives of the first half, the first on a two-yard run by running back Bucky Irving to cut Dallas' lead to 10-7. The Cowboys scored another 10 straight points on an Ezekiel Elliott touchdown run and a Brandon Aubrey field goal for a 20-7 lead. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. Rookie wide receiver Jalen McMillan had his fourth touchdown in the last three games with a sliding 11-yard catch in the end zone with less than a minute to go in the first half. Another Aubrey field goal from 58 yards out, one of four made field goals on the night, gave Dallas a 23-14 lead at halftime. Both defenses tightened up in the second half. Dallas had more punts (four) than points (three) in the second half and managed just 68 yards. Tampa Bay had just 60 yards in their first three drives of the second half. Mayfield threw his lone interception of the game on a deep shot to McMillan to end a promising drive. He'd come back on the next drive and complete all nine passes for 87 yards on the Buccaneers' lone touchdown drive of the second half, capped off by a 13-yard pass to Ryan Miller for a touchdown to make it a two-point game. Tampa Bay's defense forced a three-and-out on the ensuing Dallas drive to give their offense the ball back with nearly two minutes to go. But White's fumble on the first play of that drive ended hopes of a comeback. The Cowboys (7-8) have now won four of their last five games. They're eliminated from the playoffs and head on the road next week to take on the NFC East-leading Philadelphia Eagles (12-3). This loss snaps Tampa Bay's four-game winning streak. The Buccaneers (8-7) are now tied on record with Atlanta atop the NFC South, but the Falcons have an advantage with two head-to-head wins. The Buccaneers will close the season out with two home games, starting against the Carolina Panthers (4-11) next week. DO YOU LIKE FOOTBALL?

The Buccaneers' offense will take over at its own 23-yard line with 4:43 to go in the game. On 1st-and-10 from the Dallas 46, Baker Mayfield dropped back and threw a deep shot to Jalen McMillan but Cowboys cornerback Jourdan Lewis snagged the pass for an interception. He was downed in the end zone and the Cowboys take over on their own 20-yard line with 6:22 left in the game. Dallas' offense only managed 13 yards in three plays (10 from a penalty) in 98 seconds and the Cowboys settled for their second consecutive punt. Tampa Bay's offense takes over from its own 9-yard line with 7:32 left in the game. Cowboys safety Donovan Wilson got to Baker Mayfield on 1st-and-10 at the Buccaneers' 18-yard line.

Dallas has the ball at their own 32-yard line to start the final quarter with a nine-point advantage. The Buccaneers drove past midfield and inside the Dallas 30 before a Linval Joseph sack forced a 3rd-and-15. Tampa Bay couldn't overcome that setback and settled for a 45-yard field goal by Chase McLaughlin to make it a nine-point deficit with 31 seconds left in the third quarter. The Cowboys passed midfield on the first play of their drive but only managed four more yards on the next four plays to set up Brandon Aubrey for a 53-yard field goal. Aubrey drilled it to continue his impressive night with three field goals from beyond 50 yards. Baker Mayfield couldn't connect with tight end Payne Durham on 3rd-and-40 from the Buccaneers' 44. Tampa Bay was in that spot after Mayfield fumbled the ball on a sack and it went out of bounds after Cowboys linebacker couldn't corral it in time. Dallas takes over on its own 35 after a short punt. Dallas managed to move the ball 30 yards within the final minute of the second half to set up kicker Brandon Aubrey for another long field goal. Aubrey made it inside the left upright from 58 yards out as time expired in the second quarter. Dallas holds a two-score lead to close the first half.

CeeDee Lamb made multiple crucial catches, including a 52-yard deep shot from Cooper Rush, to get the Cowboys into scoring range. He briefly left the field due to what appeared to be pain in his right shoulder. The Buccaneers' offense made it past midfield but on 3rd-and-5 from the Dallas 40, Cowboys' defensive end Chauncey Golston brought down Baker Mayfield for a sack and a loss of five yards. Tampa Bay couldn't pin the Cowboys deep and Dallas will take over at their own 20-yard line with 4:14 to go in the first half. Dallas was driving into Tampa Bay territory but Cooper Rush overthrew CeeDee Lamb on 3rd-and-5 from the Buccaneers' 31-yard line. The Cowboys settled for a field goal and Brandon Aubrey extended the lead with a 49-yard field goal, his second make of the night, with 9:15 to go in the first half. Rookie running back Bucky Irving broke a tackle on 2nd-and-goal from the 2-yard line and powered forward for the Buccaneers' first score of the night.

Cooper Rush threw just his second incomplete pass of the night on 3rd-and-8 as tight end Jake Ferguson couldn't hang on to move the chains.

Quarterback Cooper Rush is 9-of-10 for 70 yards and a touchdown after the first 15 minutes of action. Tampa Bay's offense sputtered in their second drive of the night. Baker Mayfield's pass deep down the middle to Sterling Shepard fell incomplete again on 2nd-and-4. Rachaad White couldn't get the last yard needed to move the chains on third down and the Buccaneers punted for the first time on the night. Dallas takes over at their own 20 with 1:12 left in the first quarter. Dallas needed just over two minutes to march 48 yards for the first touchdown of the game. Cooper Rush threw to Jalen Tolbert in the back of the end zone on 3rd-and-9 for the score. Brandon Aubrey's extra point is good and the Cowboys extend their lead at home.

This season will mark the first time since 2020 that the Cowboys have not qualified for the postseason. The Cowboys have six playoff appearances in the last 11 seasons, with the furthest the team advanced in the postseason being the divisional round. The Cowboys haven't reached the NFC championship game since the 1995 season, when the team went on to win Super Bowl XXX. With the Atlanta Falcons' win over the New York Giants on Sunday, the Buccaneers enter \"Sunday Night Football\" with a half-game edge in the NFC South.

AFC NFC Here's the projected 2025 NFL draft order ahead of \"Sunday Night Football\" in Week 16, according to Tankathon.com: Jerry Jones hasn’t shared his hand one way or another when it comes to Mike McCarthy’s future in Dallas. He recently noted that the endorsements given to the coach by Dak Prescott, Micah Parsons and Troy Aikman were \"not surprising at all\" and were indicative of the success McCarthy has enjoyed during his NFL career. \"He wouldn't be in this job had he not had the kind of credibility that those endorsements reflect,\" Jones said. \"He's a heck of a head coach in the NFL, and he's got the skins on the wall to prove it.\" Dak Prescott suffered a partial hamstring avulsion – a tear during which part of the tendon rips off the bone – during Dallas' 27-21 loss to the Falcons in Week 9. He told reporters after the contest that he wasn't sure if the injury occurred while he was running or being tackled. He is out for the season. Could edge rusher Micah Parsons be the odd man out after the Dallas Cowboys paid quarterback Dak Prescott and wide receiver CeeDee Lamb last offseason? If he is, Parsons doesn't seem too worried about it. \"I understand how the business side goes,\" he said when asked about the trade speculation on Sunday, per The Athletic. \"There are no hard feelings in this business, whether I'm here or anywhere else. Obviously I've stated that I wanted to be here. But at the end of the day, I understand the business side.\" Jerry Jones squashed the trade rumors earlier this week. “That’s never been uttered in this organization, that we don’t have a future with Micah Parsons,” he told 105.3 The Fan in Dallas. — Jack McKessy Baker Mayfield signed an extension with the Buccaneers this offseason to stay with Tampa Bay through the 2026 season. Mayfield's cap hit per season varies across the contract. For 2024, Mayfield's cap hit is $6.9 million. That escalates to $35.77 million in 2025 and $45.77 million in 2026. There are two void years tacked on to the end of the contract for 2027 and 2028. The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl wins with six. The Dallas Cowboys and Steelers have the unique distinction of playing each other more than any other team combination in Super Bowl history with three matchups. The Cowboys have appeared in eight Super Bowls (that's tied with three other teams for the second-most ever), but have not played in a Super Bowl since the 1995 season. In all, the Cowboys have won five Super Bowl wins. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have appeared in two Super Bowls, winning both.

                "content": "Staff Writer/Reporter The Buccaneers fell to the Cowboys, 26-24 in Week 16. Miscues and turnovers (two) became the storyline for the Bucs on the road. Baker Mayfield was sacked four times and completed 31 of 43 attempts for 304 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. The Cowboys opening 30-yard drive ended in a Brandon Aubrey 58-yard field goal, which gave the home team an early 3-0 lead. The Bucs' first offensive possession resulted in a turnover on downs following a drop from fourth-and-six. Dallas secured a touchdown on its second drive, as Cooper Rush found Jalen Tolbert in the back of the end zone for a 10-0 lead. On the aforementioned five-play, 52-yard scoring drive, a 29-yard gain by Brandin Cooks shifted the momentum in Dallas' favor, providing positive field position. To begin the second quarter, the Buccaneers reached the end zone. A Mike Evans' pickup of 26-yards down the left sideline fueled the drive. Evans was one-on-one with DaRon Bland down the left sideline and worked over the top. Mayfield let it rip, hitting Evans in stride. Bucky Irving picked up gains of 15 and eight yards on the scoring drive with shifty moves post-cut to bring Tampa Bay to the two-yard line and he punched it in with a two-yard run. The Cowboys answered with an Aubrey 49-yard field goal to make it a 13-7 game. The Cowboys crossed the goal line with less than two minutes in the second quarter. A 52-yard gain by CeeDee Lamb moved the Cowboys into the red area and they punched it in with an Ezekiel Elliott one-yard touchdown rush. The nine-play, 80-yard drive gave the Cowboys a 20-7 lead before the half. Tampa Bay quickly traveled 70 yards in seven plays with two plays of 15 yards for Evans and a gain of 20 for Sterling Shepard. The Bucs capped off the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass from Mayfield to Jalen McMillan. The Cowboys moved down the field until a Yaya Diaby six-yard sack on Rush set up third-and15. He won with quickness off the line and sped around the rush arc to bring down the signal-caller, which culminated in an Aubrey 58-yard field goal as time expired in the second frame. In the third frame, Aubrey capped off a five-play, 30-yard drive with a 53-yard field goal and Chase McLaughlin followed suit with a 45-yarder. The Bucs' promising drive midway through the fourth quarter stalled as Jourdan Lewis stole the ball away for an interception at the goal line, putting Rush and company back on the field. With just over two minutes to play in the fourth, Mayfield found Ryan Miller wide-open in the middle of the end zone on a 13-yard touchdown to make it a 26-24 game. Several quick out routes generated first downs to push the Bucs down the field on the late nine-play, 87-yard drive. The Bucs' defense then forced a punt and Mayfield took over with 1:52 on the clock but a fumble by Tampa Bay was recovered by Bland at the Bucs' 31-yard line to seal the victory for the Cowboys.

                "content": "Morning Rundown: Nissan and Honda merger talks, woman burnt to death on subway, and the Bucs lose control of their playoff fate Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The Dallas Cowboys won their fourth game in five weeks, upsetting the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 26-24 on “Sunday Night Football.” Cowboys cornerback Daron Bland forced a fumble on the first play of the Buccaneers’ final offensive possession, squashing a potential game-winning drive and sealing the victory for Dallas. The loss was a costly one for Tampa Bay, which dropped from first place in the NFC South to outside the playoff bracket. Bland’s forced fumble was a shocking play in a game filled with them. After Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield barely escaped a sack and flipped the ball to running back Rachaad White, Bland stripped White as he fought for more yards and then recovered the loose ball. Mayfield completed 31 of 43 passes for 304 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in the loss. Meanwhile, quarterback Cooper Rush played well for the Cowboys, throwing for 292 yards and a touchdown. Dallas came out strong offensively, taking a 10-0 lead in the first quarter before eventually taking a 23-14 lead into halftime. After a field goal on their first possession of the second half, however, the Cowboys wouldn’t score again. But their defense came up with multiple big stops to prevent a Tampa Bay comeback — including two key turnovers. In the middle of the fourth quarter, Mayfield appeared to find Jalen McMillan for a 46-yard touchdown on a deep pass, but as McMillan fell down to the field, Jourdan Lewis wrestled the ball away for an interception. Two drives later, after the Bucs made it a two-point game, Bland ended the game with his forced fumble. Dallas competed admirably despite having been eliminated from playoff contention before the game. The Cowboys improved to 7-8. They will play the Philadelphia Eagles next week. Tampa Bay, meanwhile, has had a roller-coaster season. The Buccaneers started 4-2, then lost four games, then won four straight before Sunday’s loss, which dropped them to 8-7. The Bucs now have the same record as the division-leading Atlanta Falcons but trail them in the standings after being swept in their two-game season series. Tampa Bay will play the Carolina Panthers in Week 17. Andrew Greif Daron Bland just made the play of the night in Dallas. With Tampa trying to drive the length of the field to win the game with less than 2 minutes remaining, Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield eluded multiple defenders to avoid a sack and keep the play alive by throwing a shuttle pass to his running back, Rachaad White. But as White was falling to the turf, Bland ripped the ball away for a turnover, and the Cowboys ran out the clock for the win. They will improve to 7-8, while Tampa will fall to 8-6. The Bucs are now second in the standings to Atlanta in the NFC South, and their road to the playoffs just got harder. Andrew Greif Don’t count out the Buccaneers just yet. They now trail Dallas just 26-24 with 2:36 remaining after their 87-yard touchdown drive took just 2:07 off the clock. It ended with Baker Mayfield finding a wide open Ryan Miller for a 13-yard pass. Mayfield had to reach just to get the ball over the outstretched arm of a Cowboys defender.Andrew Greif Rohan Nadkarni Cowboys receiver CeeDee Lamb wears the No. 88 jersey made famous by Michael Irvin, and tonight Lamb joined Irvin in another exclusive club. With his 100 receiving yards tonight, Lamb posted his fourth consecutive 1,000-yard season, tying Irvin for the most consecutive 1,000-yard seasons in Dallas history. Andrew Greif Baker Mayfield was going for the home-run touchdown pass to Jalen McMillan, but instead Jourdan Lewis ripped the ball away while in coverage, as McMillan was tumbling into the end zone. Incredible awareness by Lewis, and with Dallas now getting the ball back with six minutes to play in regulation, Dallas has a chance to run out the clock with a lengthy drive. Andrew Greif Trailing by nine points with 9:10 left in the fourth quarter, Tampa was pinned too deep inside its own half of the field to go for a long fourth-down try and punted instead. Baker Mayfield was seen entering the injury tent to be looked at. Andrew Greif That was an adventurous 11-play, 6-minute drive for Tampa, full of Baker Mayfield scrambles to varying levels of success, but it ends with points. Chase McLaughlin’s 45-yard field goal pulls the Bucs within nine points with 31 seconds left in the third quarter. Rohan Nadkarni Cowboys kicker Brandon Aubrey remains hilariously good at converting super-long field goals. Aubrey is 3 for 3 on kicks from over 50 tonight, hitting kicks of 53, 58 and 58 yards. Entering tonight, Aubrey was 11 of 13 on kicks from over 50 yards this season. One of those misses was a 70-yard attempt against the Panthers last week — the kind of kick you only really try when you have Brandon Aubrey. Including tonight, Aubrey is now 24 of 26 on kicks over 50 yards in his career — a 92.3% conversion rate. Aubrey converts 50-yarders at a higher percentage than the league’s all-time most accurate kicker (Justin Tucker) converts all field goals (89.1%). Aubrey’s only miss from over 50 but under 70 came earlier this season, when he shockingly missed a 51-yarder against the Giants. Andrew Greif Aubrey the automatic. The Cowboys’ kicker is 4-for-4 after a 53-yarder to extend the Dallas lead to 26-14 with 6:33 to go in the third quarter. Aubrey is now 3-for-3 beyond 50 yards tonight. Andrew Greif Tampa will punt with 9:25 to play in the third quarter to end a promising drive that seemed destined to end in points. But the Buccaneers avoided a turnover when Dallas couldn’t recover a wild fumble in bounds. Instead of starting a drive inside Tampa’s half of the field, the Cowboys didn’t have a short field. Andrew Greif Brandon Aubrey hits his third field goal of the first half by knocking in a 58-yarder as time expires to put the Cowboys ahead 23-14 at the break. That was a very convincing half from a team that should theoretically have little to play for after being eliminated from the postseason earlier today. Aubrey has now made two kicks of 58 yards, plus a 49-yarder. Rohan Nadkarni Before the Buccaneers’ final drive of the first half, Baker Mayfield had completed 9 of 13 passes for only 75 yards. That was a pretty pedestrian effort from a quarterback who entered the game fifth in the NFL in passing yards per game. On Tampa Bay’s final drive, however, Mayfield completed 5 of 6 passes for 67 yards, nearly matching his total from all four previous possessions. With Cooper Rush and the Cowboys playing well on offense so far, the Bucs will need more of the Mayfield who put together a flawless two-minute drive before halftime. In addition to racking up the yards this season, Mayfield entered the game third in passing touchdowns, third in completion percentage and second in success rate. Andrew Greif The Buccaneers have life. Taking the ball over with 1:45 to play before halftime, they went 71 yards in seven plays before scoring on an 11-yard touchdown pass from Baker Mayfield to Jalen McMillan. It was a superb play by Mayfield to avoid sacks in a collapsing pocket. It’s Dallas 20, Tampa 14 with 48 seconds before halftime. Andrew Greif Running back Ezekiel Elliott punches in a touchdown on a 1-yard dive to punctuate a critical scoring drive for Dallas, which now leads 20-7 with 1:45 to go before halftime. The drive belonged to CeeDee Lamb, who produced the catch of the first half with his adjustment while the ball was in the air en route to a 52-yard reception that put the Cowboys in scoring position. He immediately came off the field looking shaken up, potentially favoring the right shoulder he has previously hurt. But shortly after, Lamb re-entered the game and escaped two tacklers before rolling into the end zone for an apparent touchdown. After a review, his knee was marked short of the goal line. That’s when Dallas handed off to Elliott. Andrew Greif Tampa’s latest drive ends with 9:15 to go before halftime after Baker Mayfield was sacked on third-and-5. It was the Cowboys’ 43rd sack this season, fifth-most in the NFL. Andrew Greif Cooper Rush’s accurate streak to start the game has ended after failed targets to star wideout CeeDee Lamb, but the Cowboys did enough to get into position for a 49-yard field goal by Brandon Aubrey. Andrew Greif Tampa running back Bucky Irving scores on a short toss to pull the Buccaneers within 10-7 with 11:30 to play in the second quarter. That is the seventh rushing touchdown of Irving’s rookie season. Andrew Greif The Cowboys lead 10-0 after the opening quarter in Dallas. Was that was you were expecting? It’s likely it wasn’t, given the Bucs are playing for their playoff lives, while the Cowboys have been eliminated. And yet, the Bucs are 1-3 on third down, and 0-1 on fourth down, while the Cowboys have been better, at 3-5 on third downs. Rohan Nadkarni After throwing for only one touchdown in his first two starts, Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush has really found his footing in the last month. In his previous four starts before tonight, Rush threw eight touchdowns compared to only one interception. Dallas is 3-1 in those games, albeit with some wins over lesser opponents. (But one nice upset against the Commanders!) So far tonight, Rush has picked up where he left off last week, when he threw for three scores against the Panthers. After one quarter, Rush has thrown for 70 yards and a touchdown against the Bucs, completing 9 of his 10 passes. Andrew Greif Dallas is one of the NFL’s worst teams at scoring touchdowns once in the red zone, but it wasn’t a problem on its second drive of the night. Jalen Tolbert caught a 10-yard pass from Cooper Rush to extend the Cowboys’ lead to 10-0 with 2:49 left in the first quarter. Andrew Greif On its opening drive of the game Tampa went for fourth down, needing three yards, at midfield, but receiver Sterling Shepard dropped an open pass, leading to a turnover on downs. The Cowboys will take over at their own 48-yard line. Andrew Greif Brandon Aubrey nails a field goal from 58 yards to open the scoring for Dallas after the Cowboys’ opening drive went 30 yards. Cooper Rush has started 6-for-6 passing. Andrew Greif The Cowboys open the game with the ball. They have no chance to make the playoffs but can play spoiler with Tampa’s hopes of winning the NFC South. But to do that, quarterback Cooper Rush — filling in for the injured Dak Prescott since Week 8 — must play like he has in the last month, with eight combined touchdown passes. NBC News The Bucs' coach knows he can't win without containing Dallas' star receiver. NBC News The Cowboys' star kicker ahead of tonight's big game. Andrew Greif The race for the NFC South division championship and the postseason berth that comes with winning a division title will be close. Earlier today, Atlanta and new starting quarterback Michael Penix Jr. beat the Giants to improve to 8-7. As we broke down below, the Falcons hold the tiebreaker on the Buccaneers (8-6 entering ‘Sunday Night Football’), meaning Atlanta would get the edge if it finishes tied with the Buccaneers at season’s end. Tonight, Atlanta just became big fans of Dallas. Andrew Greif Washington’s victory against Philadelphia earlier Sunday mathematically eliminated Dallas from making the postseason. According to Cowboys beat reporter Todd Archer, this is the earliest that Dallas has been eliminated from playoff contention in seven years. Andrew Greif Tampa Bay has produced just eight 1,000-yard rushers in franchise history. This season, Bucky Irving is on pace to join that small club in only his first NFL season. Irving, who played at Oregon, currently has 852 yards with three games remaining. If Irving crosses the 1,000-yard threshold, he would be the youngest to do it in Buccaneers history. Andrew Greif Since starting Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott was lost for the season with a hamstring injury in Week 9, Dallas has ranked next-to-last in the league in expected points added per play, an advanced statistic that attempts to analyze a team’s efficiency. It also ranks fourth-worst in expected points added per dropback, and sixth-worse when rushing the ball. The Cowboys’ challenge will be keeping up with Tampa, whose overall EPA per play ranks fourth-best during their current four-game winning streak. Andrew Greif Dallas is 1-7 at AT&T Stadium since the end of the 2023 regular season and most losses were not close, with double-digit deficits in six of the seven losses. While that would be a black eye for any franchise, the contrast is especially stark for the Cowboys given that before that 1-7 stretch, they had won 16 consecutive home games, their longest home winning streak since 1982. Andrew Greif At 8-6, Tampa is currently projected as a No. 3 seed in the NFC and would host Green Bay in a first-round game. But the Buccaneers are also far from assured of clinching their playoff berth; in the NFC South, they sit just one game ahead of the 7-7 Falcons, who would hold a tiebreaker as Atlanta swept the Bucs this season. Tampa is guaranteed to win the division and make the playoffs if it wins its last three games — and all three of those opponents have losing records — but one slip-up could cost them. For Dallas, there is also uncertainty about what lies ahead. Coach Mike McCarthy is 48-33 overall and 1-3 in the playoffs with two NFC East titles in five seasons with the Cowboys but his contract runs out after this season. Cowboys players including star defender Micah Parsons have publicly vouched for McCarthy to return in 2025 Stephen Jones, the Cowboys’ executive vice president of personnel, said after league meetings last week that McCarthy had done an “outstanding” job of keeping Dallas in the playoff picture, even if slim, via their mini-turnaround of the past month. Jones said a decision on McCarthy’s future would take a wider view. “When you’re owning/managing a football team, you look at everything. It would be irresponsible not to,” Jones said about considering the team’s injuries in an evaluation of McCarthy’s job performance. “I know our fans and opponents don’t look at everything but we do.” Andrew Greif It’s been either boom-or-bust this season in Tampa. The Buccaneers were a team every opponent wanted to play in October. But since, they’ve been on a tear. Since losing four straight games to drop to 4-6, the Bucs have won four consecutive games, and tonight can extend that to five consecutive victories for the first time since 2016. This is Tampa’s last road game of the regular season. Despite losing starting quarterback Dak Prescott to a hamstring injury in November, the Cowboys also enter tonight on something close to a turnaround. Since falling to 3-7, the Cowboys have won three of their last four games to enter tonight’s game at 6-8. Rohan Nadkarni is a sports reporter for NBC News. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) Baker Mayfield came home to Texas looking to keep his Tampa Bay Buccaneers on track for the playoffs. Instead, they'll need some help. Cooper Rush threw a touchdown pass and Brandon Aubrey kicked two 58-yarders among four field goals Sunday night, boosting the Dallas Cowboys to a 26-24 victory that cost the Bucs control of their playoff fate. The end of a four-game winning streak left Tampa Bay (8-7) even with Atlanta atop the NFC South with two games remaining. The Falcons have the tiebreaker because they won both meetings with the Bucs, who are on a four-year playoff run. “We lost, we fell back in the pack,” coach Todd Bowles said. “We’ve got to eat it, can’t spend too much time on it. We had our chances. We’ve got to take care of us and let everything else take care of itself.” A three-year playoff streak for the Cowboys (7-8) ended when they were eliminated from postseason contention before the prime-time kickoff. Still, Dallas won for the fourth time in five games since a five-game losing streak that put those playoff hopes in peril. Dallas' hopes officially ended about four hours before the game when Washington scored in the final seconds to beat Philadelphia. “There wasn’t a whole lot of conversation about it,” coach Mike McCarthy said. “I made the point before the game, `Jjust play the way we always play. We’re playing really dang good football these past four, five weeks. Let’s grind this thing out.'” Mayfield, the former Texas high school standout playing not far from his Heisman Trophy-winning days at Oklahoma, was in position to lead a rally from a nine-point deficit late when he escaped a sack and shoveled the ball to Rachaad White in the final two minutes. DaRon Bland ripped the ball out of White's hands before the Tampa Bay running back hit the ground at the Bucs 32, allowing the Cowboys to run out the clock. Mayfield threw for 303 yards and two touchdowns, including a 13-yarder to Ryan Miller that pulled the Bucs within two with 2:36 to go. The Bucs got the ball back with 1:40 remaining, but the next play was the big one from Bland, who forced his first turnover in an injury-plagued season a year after the cornerback set an NFL record with five interception returns for touchdowns. White initially was carrying the ball in one hand away from his body after getting it from Mayfield before pulling it into his body and Bland closed in. “He had two hands on the ball, obviously you’ve got to be careful,” Mayfield said. “The same thing happened to me earlier in the game. They made some plays when it mattered. It’s all about the ball, and they did good taking it away.” The Cowboys appeared in firm control when Jourdan Lewis took the ball away from Jalen McMillan for an interception at the Dallas goal line on a deep throw with about six minutes remaining. Dallas failed to get a first down after that turnover, and again after the Bucs pulled within two. The defense came through again, though. “When we had to have it with the takeaways there in the fourth quarter, it's remarkable, just to see the bounce-back,” McCarthy said. A Tampa Bay defense that allowed an NFL-low 15 points during the winning streak had trouble early trying to slow Rush and receiver CeeDee Lamb, who had a 100-yard first half for the second week in a row. Lamb, who has been battling a bum right shoulder most of the season, came down hard on it again on a 52-yard catch in the second quarter. After going to the bench, Lamb returned for a catch underneath and fought his way inside the 1-yard line to set up Ezekiel Elliott's plunge for a 20-7 Dallas lead. Lamb finished with 105 yards after getting 100 before the break a week after going for 105 first-half yards, and 116 total, in a 30-14 victory at Carolina. Rush threw for 292 yards with a 10-yard TD to Jalen Tolbert in the first quarter. Mayfield needed less than a minute on a drive to his 11-yard touchdown pass to Jalen McMillan in the final minute of the first half, but the Cowboys answered with Aubrey's second 58-yard field goal on the final play before the break for a 23-14 lead. “I’ve said it all along, this group will not quit,” Mayfield said. “That’s the standard that we try to set. It’d be nice to not have to be in that situation, if we’d take care of business earlier in the game.” With his three field goals of at least 50 yards, Aubrey has 14 for the season, an NFL record. Houston's Ka'imi Fairbairn has 13, so the record remains up for grabs. Tampa Bay WR Sterling Shepard was ruled out in the second half with a hamstring injury. ... Cowboys LB Eric Kendricks was inactive with a calf injury after going through a pregame workout. Buccaneers: Host Carolina next Sunday.

                "title": "WEEK 16 RECAP: Detroit Lions vs. Chicago Bears, Sunday December 22",
                "content": "Senior Writer CHICAGO – The Detroit Lions talked all week about there being a bad taste in their mouth after suffering their first defeat in over three months last week to Buffalo. The Lions were on a mission to get back on track this week and did so in commanding fashion, 34-17, against division foe Chicago Sunday afternoon. Detroit's offense was rolling all game. The only time they didn't score on their first seven possessions of the game was a 65-yard missed field goal by Jake Bates as the first half expired. Jack Fox's first punt for the Lions was with under six minutes left in the game. Quarterback Jared Goff was terrific throwing for 336 yards and three touchdowns to three different receivers as the Lions' offense set a new franchise record with 493 points on the season, improving to 13-2 to stay atop the NFC North and NFC playoff standings. The Lions opened the scoring with a 30-yard Bates field goal on their first possession of the game after the defense forced a 3 & out on Chicago's first drive. Lions defensive end Josh Paschal jumped on a Rome Odunze fumble at the Bears' 36-yard line to give the ball right back to Detroit's offense with terrific field possession. It took Goff and Co. seven plays from there to punch it into the end zone on a 1-yard Jahmyr Gibbs touchdown to give Detroit a 10-0 first-quarter lead. Odunze fumbled again on Chicago's next possession as linebacker Mitchell Agude knocked it out of his hands and linebacker Jack Campbell jumped on it at the Detroit 40-yard line. The Lions turned it into a 34-yard Bates field goal. Detroit made it 20-0 early in the second quarter on an 82-yard scoring strike from Goff to wide receiver Jameson Williams, who got behind the Bears' defense. Goff hit him perfectly in stride. It was Williams' fourth reception of 50-plus yards this season, joining Calvin Johnson (2011) and Cloyce Box (1950) as the only players in franchise history to do that. Chicago notched their first points of the contest and trimmed the Lions' lead to 20-7 on a 1-yard Caleb Williams pass to tight end Cole Kmet that capped a 14-play, 70-yard Bears drive midway through the second quarter. Detroit's offense responded by driving the ball 70 yards on 11 plays and pushed the lead back up to 20 points with an 8-yard touchdown catch by wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown with less than a minute remaining in the first half. Chicago got a late 45-yard Keenan Allen touchdown with just 19 seconds left in the second quarter to make it 27-14 at the half. Detroit opened the second-half scoring with Goff's third touchdown pass of the contest, this one 21 yards to tight end Sam LaPorta to push the lead to 34-14. It was Goff's 33rd passing touchdown of the season, a new single-season career record for him. Chicago added a field goal midway through the third quarter to make it 34-17. Williams led the Lions in receiving with five catches for 143 yards and a touchdown. Gibbs ran 23 times for 109 yards with a touchdown and added four receptions for 45 yards. QB comparison: Goff finished the game 23-of-32 passing for 336 yards with three touchdowns, no interceptions and a 137.0 passer rating. He has produced 41 career 300-yard passing games, tying Dan Marino and Matt Ryan for the second most 300-yard games through nine seasons in the NFL. Caleb Williams completed 26 of his 40 passes for 334 yards with a couple touchdowns, no interceptions and a 107.7 rating. He also led the Bears in rushing with six carries for 34 yards as the Lions held Chicago to just 59 rushing yards in the contest. Big moment: Detroit had a 20-point lead with less than one minute remaining in the first half but allowed the Bears to score on a 45-yard touchdown with 19 seconds left in the half to trim the lead to 27-14. Detroit received the second-half kickoff and marched 79 yards in six plays capped off by a 21-yard Goff to LaPorta touchdown on what looked like a fake stumble by both Goff and Gibbs that froze the defense and allowed LaPorta to get wide open. It pushed the lead back up to 20 and Chicago could never recover. View photos from the Detroit Lions vs. Chicago Bears Week 16 game at Soldier Field on Sunday, December 22 in Chicago, Illinois.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. CHICAGO (AP) Jared Goff and the Detroit Lions locked in from the start and delivered a bounce-back performance. It came with a few team records, too. Goff threw for 336 yards and three touchdowns, and the Detroit Lions remained on top of the NFC with their franchise-best 13th win, 34-17 over the Chicago Bears on Sunday. Jameson Williams had a career-high 143 yards receiving on five catches, including an 82-yard touchdown in the second quarter. Jahmyr Gibbs ran for 109 yards and a score, and Detroit (13-2) broke a tie with the 1991 and 2023 teams for the most wins in franchise history. The Lions also set a single-season record for scoring with 493 points, and they improved to 7-0 away from home, a franchise record for road wins. The Lions took control early against the Bears (4-11), and they even flexed their dominance by executing a trick play in which Goff intentionally stumbled while dropping back. With Detroit players yelling “Fumble!” and Gibbs pretending to dive for the ball, Goff threw to Sam LaPorta for a 21-yard touchdown that made it 34-14. It was just what Detroit was looking for coming off a 48-42 loss to Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills. That stopped a franchise-best win streak at 11 games and dropped the Lions into a tie atop the conference with Philadelphia and NFC North rival Minnesota. “This is when your eyes get opened, when competition is at its highest, people are breathing down your neck or you’re chasing somebody and you’re at the top,” coach Dan Campbell said. “It just doesn’t get any better than this. This is what it’s all about. Can it get frustrating, can it get stressful? Yeah, it gets all those. But also it’s the drug. It’s the drug. This is what you live for. Look, some can’t. Some can’t handle this. It’s too much for them. Players, coaches, teams, it’s just too much. But not our group. This is the good stuff, man, and we’re in the middle of it right now.” The day took another good turn for Detroit when Washington beat Philadelphia 36-33 on Jayden Daniels' touchdown pass to Jamison Crowder in the closing seconds. Lions players watched the end of that game on their phones. “We know the circumstances that we’re in, and obviously Washington winning, that does do something for the playoffs, but we still have to win these games, and we know that,” Goff said. “It doesn’t change what we had to do anyways. Yeah, we’ve got to win, and San Francisco is next.” Caleb Williams threw for 334 yards and two touchdowns following a string of shaky performances for the Bears, who lost their ninth in a row and drew more boos from their frustrated fans. Goff delivered another strong showing a week after becoming the first NFL player to lose while throwing for 400-plus yards and five TDs with no interceptions. The three-time Pro Bowler completed 23 of 32 passes without an interception and had Lions fans chanting his name. Along with the deep ball to Jameson Williams and the trick play to LaPorta, Goff also threw to Amon-Ra St. Brown for an 8-yard TD in the second quarter. Gibbs scored on a 1-yard run in the first quarter and caught four passes for 45 yards. He joined Barry Sanders and Billy Sims as the only Lions running backs with at least 1,500 yards from scrimmage and 15 TDs. The Bears lost to Detroit for the fifth time in six games. Unlike the matchup on Thanksgiving Day - when then-coach Matt Eberflus mismanaged the ending and got fired the next day - they never really challenged in this one. “I think we fight. I think we’ve got to have better execution,” Caleb Williams said. Williams at least had a better outing for the Bears after he looked physically and mentally beaten in a lopsided loss at Minnesota. The No. 1 overall draft pick was 26 of 40. Keenan Allen caught nine passes for a season-high 141 yards, including a 45-yard touchdown near the end of the first half. Rome Odunze added 77 yards receiving, and Cole Kmet had a touchdown catch. The Bears fell to 0-3 under interim coach Thomas Brown. “Trying to find the positives, it’s just not good enough,” Kmet said. The Lions haven't lost consecutive games since dropping five in a row early in the 2022 season. And they weren't about to let the Bears change that. They outscored Chicago 13-0 in the first quarter and struck again early in the second. Jameson Williams beat Jonathan Owens down the middle on a play-action pass and Goff hit him in stride. It was Williams' fourth TD of 50 yards or more this season. Bears: LT Braxton Jones (ankle) exited early in the second quarter after he was hurt blocking on a pass. The Chicago sideline emptied, with players forming a semicircle as medical personnel tended to Jones before he was carted off the field. Lions: Visit San Francisco next Monday night in a rematch of last year's NFC championship game. The 49ers have already been eliminated from the playoffs. Bears: Host Seattle on Thursday night. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "content": "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 alongside with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[8] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023.[9][10] It was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable football club.[11] In 2024, Real Madrid become the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue according to the club's announcement.[12] Real Madrid are one of the most successful clubs in the sport. In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 35 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record nine FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[17] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[18][19] Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.[20][21] Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[22] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018); however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.[23] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million);[24] he became both the club's and history's all-time top goalscorer.[25][26][27][28] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham[29] and Kylian Mbappé.[30][31] Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[32] while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[33] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (55),[18] a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[34] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 and was the first and the only club to win La Decima (in 2013-14).[35] In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the sixth in eleven seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records.[36] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[37] As of July 2024,[update] Real Madrid are ranked 2nd in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall.[38][39] Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.[40] They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[41][42][43] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[7] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[44][45] Three years after its founding, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[46] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[47] In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[48] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[49] On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco.[note 2][50] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[51] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper Ya reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[52] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: Reds! Separatists!... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[53] Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's José Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while Ángel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'.\"[54] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[55] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[51] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[56] Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[57] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"cantera,\" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[58] In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel)[59] and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[60] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[58] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[61] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[62] The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[63] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name \"Yé-yé\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[64] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[65] and 1964.[63] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[66] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[67] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[68] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president. Bernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[69] In the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[70][71] Spanish sports journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. All five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[70][71] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[70][71] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club. In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[72] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[73] In November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[74] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[75] In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[76] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[77] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[78] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the field, the Zidanes y Pavones policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[79] The few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[80] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[81] \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[82] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[82] The 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[83] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[84] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[85] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,[86] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[87] Ramón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[88] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[89] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.[90] On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[91][92] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[93] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[94] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos.[95] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[96] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[97][98] José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[99][100] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[101][102] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[103] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe. In the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[104] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[105] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[106][107] Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[108] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[109] On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[110] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[111] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[112] By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[113] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[114] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La Décima\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la ˈðeθima]).[115] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[116] After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[117] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[118] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[119] After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[120] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[121] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[122] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[123] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012.[124] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[125] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[126][127] On 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[128] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez.[129][130][131] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to produce good results against top teams.[132] Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[133] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favour, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[134] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"La Undécima\".[135][136][127] Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[137] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[138] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[139] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[140] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[141] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[142] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[143][144] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duodécima\".[145] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[146] Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[147] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[148] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[149] In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[150][151] Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[152] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[153] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[98] On 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[154][155] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[156] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[157] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[158] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[159] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.[160] In the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million.[161] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[162] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[163] From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[164][165] Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[166] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[167] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[168][169][170] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[171] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[172] defeating pre-tournament favourites Paris Saint-Germain,[173][174] defending champions and favourites Chelsea,[175] Premier League champions and heavy favourites Manchester City,[176] all in dramatic fashion,[177] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favourites,[178] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius Júnior goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[179][180] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favoured to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[181] After a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club. Real Madrid's 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup. The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to FC Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate. In 2023, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham, who was given the number #5 jersey, previously used by Zinedine Zidane. Real also signed Arda Güler and Fran García. Meanwhile, Vinícius Júnior was given the number #7 jersey, previously used by Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo; while Rodrygo was given the number #11 jersey, previously used by Gareth Bale. Karim Benzema left the club, while Toni Kroos would later announce that he would retire from football after this season. The 2023-24 season would prove to be another highly successful season for Los Blancos. First, Real Madrid lifted the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona 4–1, taking revenge of the previous year's 3–0 defeat. Then, Real Madrid lifted the La Liga with relative ease, reaching 95 points, the second-best winning campaign by Real Madrid in La Liga history after the 2011–12 100 points season. In the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid knocked out RB Leipzig in the Round of 16, then defending champions Manchester City in penalties. In the semifinals, Real Madrid faced Bayern Munich again. The first match was a 2–2 draw, while the second match in the Bernabéu was marked by a double by Joselu in the last few minutes of the game, with Bayern Munich suffering a historic comeback after leading 1–0. Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in the final, and won 2–0, with Dani Carvajal being the man of the match and scoring with a header after a Toni Kroos corner, and Vinícius Júnior once again scoring in a UCL final. Real Madrid won their 15th Champions League without losing a single match during the campaign. Following the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, Real Madrid announced that striker Kylian Mbappé would be joining the club on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2024, concluding one of the most highly anticipated transfer sagas in modern history.[182] On 18 December 2024, Real Madrid clinched their second trophy of the season, uplifting the inaugural 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup by beating Pachuca 3-0.[183] The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[184] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[185] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[184] With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[49] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[186][57] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[184] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[184] Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[44] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 3] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[57] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[187] Real's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[188][189] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[190][191] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[192] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[193][194] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year.[195] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[196] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[197] Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[46] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[203] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[48] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[57][204] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[58] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[57] The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[205] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[205] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[206][207][208][209] The Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[210] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[211] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[212] On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground.[213] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.[214][165] The latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to nearly 85,000.[215][216] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[217][218] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[219][220] Raúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741 appearances from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times.[221] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176. Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[222][223] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[224] Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 129,690, which was for a European Cup match in 1956 against Milan. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 80,000.[225] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (36 as of 2023–24) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[226] The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fifteen times[227] and for the most semi-finals appearances (33). As of June 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[228] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game, before Bayern Munich breaks the record in 2021.[229] In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million).[230][231] The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million.[111] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[232] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million.[233] The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.[234] During most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[235] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[236][237] Real Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[238][239] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[240][241] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[242] Questioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\".[243] Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[244] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[245] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 100 victories for Madrid, 97 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[246] As early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[248][249] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[250] There is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[251] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[252][186] The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millonarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[253] Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[254] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[255] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[256] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[257] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[258] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[258][259] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.[258] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[258] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[258] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.[260] The club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.[48] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"[186] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were \"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\" – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).[261][262] The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[263] In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites).[264] By then, Real Madrid did not want to sign non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, \"Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote\" (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\").[265] Atlético's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the 2016–17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city.[266][267] In fact, the Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region). Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times has been favourable.[268] A high point came in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4–1 comeback victory in extra time.[269] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss.[270] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.[271] A further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico (the old classic),[272] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903.[273][274] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by El Clásico.[275] Athletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players,[276] have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the Lions won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005–06 to 2016–17.[272][277][278] However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.[279][262][280] Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times.[281][282] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws),[283] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings.[284][285][286] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\"). During the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium by the same method), then at the same stage in the 2013–14 edition with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate,[287] and again in 2017–18 with the Spanish club progressing 4–3;[288] both times they went on to win the competition. Another match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).[289][290][291] Their first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961–62 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in Paris.[290] At the quarter-final stage in 1995–96, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy.[290] In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1–0.[290][292] They met again in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate.[290] By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the Bianconeri in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.[293] The teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player Álvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid.[290] They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.[290][294][295] The latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017–18 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline.[296][297] Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick,[298] and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time,[299] he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.[300] It was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[301] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[79] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[302] The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[303] Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[82] By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion),[304] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million).[305] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[306] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.[307] A study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\"[308] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[309][310] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.[311] Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money,[312] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership.[313] The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[314] As of 2010, the club had 60,000 socios.[315] At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.[316][317] During the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football.[316] Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million.[316] For the 2010–11 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona;[318] furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, Forbes listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion.[319] Real Madrid was valued at €3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016–17 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million.[320] In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was £8.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona.[321][322] In 2022, Forbes listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.[323] Real Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the Goal! football movie trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream... (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.[324] Real, The Movie is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on galácticos such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase. The book White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled Legends, and a remix of the club's anthem, \"Himno del Real Madrid,\" was released as the first single from the album.[325] Real Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre. Hala Madrid is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the Madridistas Fan Club card holders.[326] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans).[6] The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches.[326] Real Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA, EA Sports FC, and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times. In 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play's liquidation in September 2009) would end up being Real Madrid: The Game, which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play's publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay. Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.

With fewer than three weeks left in the regular season, here's an updated look at who would be in, who would be out, and where all the potential postseason teams would be seeded going into the late Sunday and Monday games of Week 16: POWER RANKINGS: Lions, Vikings, Rams rise; Eagles, Steelers, Broncos fall for Week 17 1. Kansas City Chiefs 14-1 (champions, AFC West): The Chiefs, with a superhuman Patrick Mahomes, have a two-game lead over the Bills for the top seed, home-field advantage, and the lone bye in the AFC. They need to finish a game ahead of the Bills to keep No. 1, as the latter owns the head-to-head tiebreaker. The Chiefs can clinch home field on Wednesday of Week 17 vs. the Steelers after winning at home over the Texans in Week 16. 2. Buffalo Bills 12-3 (champions, AFC East): The Bills survived a challenge from the Patriots to keep pace with the Chiefs and also pick up a game on the losing Steelers in the quest for the No. 2 seed. 3. Pittsburgh Steelers 10-5 (first place, AFC North): The Steelers have clinched a wild-card playoff berth in yet another winning season under Mike Tomlin. The division title will come down to the final two weeks after losing to the Ravens. They hold the tiebreaker for now with a better conference record. The Steelers close with two tough home games against the Chiefs and Bengals. 4. Houston Texans 9-6 (champions, AFC South) The Texans have clinched a second consecutive division title and will just use the final two weeks to tune up for the playoffs ahead of likely hosting the North runner-up in the wild-card round. 5. Baltimore Ravens 10-5 (second place, AFC North): The Ravens have clinched at least a wild-card playoff berth. They now have a strong chance of winning the division after splitting the season series with the Steelers. The Ravens go to Houston in Week 17 before hosting Cleveland to close the season. 6. Los Angeles Chargers 9-6 (second place, AFC West): The Chargers jumped the Broncos by rallying big-time and completing a season sweep on Thursday night. They can clinch a playoff spot should the Dolphins and Colts lose in Week 16. 7. Denver Broncos 9-6 (third place, AFC West): The Broncos lost a heartbreaker on the road to fall behind the Chargers but can still clinch a playoff berth with losses by Dolphins, Colts, and Bengals. Who's in the hunt? The Bengals lose the tiebreaker for now, but they're the hottest team of the three with the best chance to make a shocking run but need help from the Colts and Dolphins losing on top of beating the Broncos in Week 17. Who's out? All of these teams were eliminated from playoff contention before Week 16. SN's NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule 1. Detroit Lions 13-2 (first place, NFC North): The Lions have clinched a return to the playoffs, but their hopes of repeating in the division are on hold as they lead by only a head-to-head tiebreaker over the Vikings ahead of the teams playing each other in Week 18. At least the win over the Bears in Week 16 gave them a game cushion over the Eagles. 2. Philadelphia Eagles 12-3 (first place, NFC East): The Eagles failed to clinch the division title by blowing a lead in Washington and losing to the Commanders. They will try to take care of that business next week against the Cowboys, maybe without a concussed Jalen Hurts. 3. Los Angeles Rams 9-6 (first place, NFC West) (first place, NFC West): The Rams lead the division by a half-game and a head-to-head tiebreaker over the Seahawks after beating the Jets in Week 16. They jumped up here with the Buccaneers losing and falling out of first place in their division. 4. Atlanta Falcons 8-7 (first place, NFC South): The Falcons jumped the Buccaneers with their resounding win over the Giants coupled with a Bucs loss to the Cowboys. The Falcons have the lead by head-to-head tiebreaker thanks to sweeping the season series and having a 4-1 conference record with games vs. the Commanders and Panthers left. 5. Minnesota Vikings 13-2 (second place, NFC North): The Vikings have clinched a playoff berth and kept the pressure on the Lions in the division race by beating the Seahawks in Week 16. 6. Green Bay Packers 10-4 (third place, NFC North): The Packers can clinch a playoff berth with a win over the Saints on Monday night or before with a loss by the Falcons coupled with a loss from either the Rams or Seahawks. 7. Washington Commanders 10-5 (second place, NFC East): The Commanders came back to beat the Eagles to stay in the hunt of the division title. They didn't clinch at least a wild-card berth yet but would do so by beating the Falcons at home next Sunday night in Week 17. Who's in the hunt? Both teams' chances are dwindling down to a division title, though the Bucs do own the tiebreaker vs. Washington should it come to that. Who's out? All these teams were eliminated from the playoffs during or before Week 16.

            {
                "title": "Liverpool - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Liverpool is a cathedral and port city and metropolitan borough in Merseyside, England, which had a population of 496,770 in 2022.[3] It is on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary, near the Irish Sea, 178 miles (286 km) northwest of London. Liverpool is the fifth largest city in the United Kingdom and the administrative headquarters of the Liverpool City Region, a combined authority area with a population of over 1.5 million.[5] Established as a borough in Lancashire in 1207, Liverpool became significant in the late 17th century when the Port of Liverpool was heavily involved in the Atlantic slave trade. The port also imported cotton for the Lancashire textile mills, and became a major departure point for English and Irish emigrants to North America. Liverpool rose to global economic importance at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century and was home to the first intercity railway, the first non-combustible warehouse system (the Royal Albert Dock), and a pioneering elevated electrical railway; it was granted city status in 1880 and was moved from Lancashire to the newly created county of Merseyside in 1974. It entered a period of decline in the mid-20th century, but has experienced regeneration since the European Union selected it as the European Capital of Culture in 2008,[a] which was reported to have generated over £800 million for the local economy within a year.[6][7] The economy of Liverpool is diversified and encompasses tourism, culture, maritime, hospitality, healthcare, life sciences, advanced manufacturing, creative, and digital sectors.[8][9][10] The city is home to the UK's second highest number of art galleries, national museums, listed buildings, and parks and open spaces, with only London having more.[11] It is often used as a filming location due to its architecture, and was the fifth most visited UK city by foreign tourists in 2022.[12] It has produced numerous musicians, most notably the Beatles, and artists from the city have had more UK No. 1 hit singles than anywhere else.[13] It has also produced academics, actors, artists, comedians, filmmakers, poets, scientists, sportspeople, and writers. It is the home of Premier League football teams Everton and Liverpool. The world's oldest still-operating mainline train station, Liverpool Lime Street, is in the city centre; it is also served by the underground Merseyrail network. The city's port was the fourth largest in the UK in 2023, with numerous shipping and freight lines having headquarters and offices there.[14] Residents of Liverpool are often called \"Scousers\" in reference to scouse, a local stew made popular by sailors in the city, while \"Scouse\" is also the most common name given to the local accent. The city's cultural and ethnic diversity is a result of attracting immigrants, especially from Ireland, Scandinavia, and Wales; it is also the home of a large black and Chinese community, and the first mosque in England.[15] The name comes from the Old English lifer, meaning thick or muddy water, and pōl, meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as Liuerpul.[16][17] According to the Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names, \"The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained\".[18] The place appearing as Leyrpole, in a legal record of 1418, may also refer to Liverpool.[19] Other origins of the name have been suggested, including \"elverpool\", a reference to the large number of eels in the Mersey.[20] The adjective \"Liverpudlian\" was first recorded in 1833.[17] Although the Old English origin of the name Liverpool is beyond dispute, claims are sometimes made that the name Liverpool is of Welsh origin, but these are without foundation. The Welsh name for Liverpool is Lerpwl, from a former English local form Leerpool. This is a reduction of the form \"Leverpool\" with the loss of the intervocalic [v] (seen in other English names and words e.g. Daventry (Northamptonshire) > Danetry, never-do-well > ne’er-do-well). In the 19th century, some Welsh publications used the name \"Lle'r Pwll\" (\"(the) place (of) the pool\"), a reinterpretation of Lerpwl, probably in the belief that \"Lle'r Pwll\" was the original form. Another name, which is widely known even today, is Llynlleifiad, again a 19th-century coining. \"Llyn\" is pool, but \"lleifiad\" has no obvious meaning. G. Melville Richards (1910–1973), a pioneer of scientific toponymy in Wales, in \"Place Names of North Wales\",[21] does not attempt to explain it beyond noting that \"lleifiad\" is used as a Welsh equivalent of \"Liver\". A derivative form of a learned borrowing into Welsh (*llaf) of Latin lāma (slough, bog, fen) to give \"lleifiad\" is possible, but unproven. In the Middle Ages, Liverpool existed firstly as farmland within the West Derby Hundred[22] before growing in to a small town of farmers, fishermen and tradesmen and tactical army base for King John of England. The town was planned with its own castle, although due to outbreaks of disease and its subordinance to the nearby Roman port of Chester, the town's growth and prosperity stagnated until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Substantial growth took place in the mid-late 18th century when the town became the most heavily involved European port in the Atlantic slave trade.[23] King John's letters patent of 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool (then spelt as Liuerpul). There is no evidence that the place had previously been a centre of any trade. The creation of the borough was probably due to King John deciding it would be a convenient place to embark men and supplies for his Irish campaigns, in particular John's Irish campaign of 1209.[24][25] The original street plan of Liverpool is said to have been designed by King John near the same time it was granted a royal charter, making it a borough. The original seven streets were laid out in the shape of a double cross: Bank Street (now Water Street), Castle Street, Chapel Street, Dale Street, Juggler Street (now High Street), Moor Street (now Tithebarn Street) and Whiteacre Street (now Old Hall Street).[25] Liverpool Castle was built before 1235, it survived until it was demolished in the 1720s.[26] By the middle of the 16th century, the population was still around 600, although this was likely to have fallen from an earlier peak of 1000 people due to slow trade and the effects of the plague.[27][28][29] In the 17th century, there was slow progress in trade and population growth. Battles for control of the town were waged during the English Civil War, including a brief siege in 1644.[30] In 1699, the same year as its first recorded slave ship, Liverpool Merchant, set sail for Africa,[31] Liverpool was made a parish by Act of Parliament. But arguably, the legislation of 1695 that reformed the Liverpool council was of more significance to its subsequent development.[32] Since Roman times nearby Chester on the River Dee had been the region's principal port on the Irish Sea. However, as the Dee began to silt up, maritime trade from Chester became increasingly difficult and shifted towards Liverpool on the neighbouring River Mersey. The first of the Liverpool docks was constructed in 1715, and the system of docks gradually grew into a large interconnected system.[33] As trade from the West Indies, including sugar, surpassed that of Ireland and Europe, and as the River Dee continued to silt up, Liverpool began to grow with increasing rapidity. The first commercial wet dock was built in Liverpool in 1715.[34][35] Substantial profits from the slave trade and tobacco helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow, although several prominent local men, including William Rathbone, William Roscoe and Edward Rushton, were at the forefront of the local abolitionist movement.[36] The 19th century saw Liverpool rise to global economic importance. Pioneering, world first, technology and civic facilities launched in the city to serve the accelerating population which was fuelled by an influx of ethnic and religious communities from all around the world. By the start of the 19th century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool, and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, Liverpool and Manchester became the first cities to have an intercity rail link, through the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when Irish migrants began arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the Great Famine. While many Irish settled during this time in the city, a large percentage also emigrated to the United States or moved to the industrial centres of Lancashire, Yorkshire and the Midlands.[37] In her poetical illustration \"Liverpool\" (1832), which celebrates the city's worldwide commerce, Letitia Elizabeth Landon refers specifically to the Macgregor Laird expedition to the Niger River, at that time in progress.[38] This is to a painting by Samuel Austin, Liverpool, from the Mersey.[39] Britain was a major market for cotton imported from the Deep South of the United States, which fed the textile industry in the country. Given the crucial place cotton held in the city's economy, during the American Civil War Liverpool was, in the words of historian Sven Beckert, \"the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself.\"[40] Liverpool merchants helped to bring out cotton from ports blockaded by the Union Navy, built ships of war for the Confederacy, and supplied the South with military equipment and credit.[41] During the war, the Confederate Navy ship, the CSS Alabama, was built at Birkenhead on the Mersey, and the CSS Shenandoah surrendered there (being the final surrender at the end of the war). The city was also the center of Confederate purchasing war materiel, including arms and ammunition, uniforms, and naval supplies to be smuggled by British blockade runners to the South.[42] For periods during the 19th century, the wealth of Liverpool exceeded that of London,[43] and Liverpool's Custom House was the single largest contributor to the British Exchequer.[44] Liverpool was the only British city ever to have its own Whitehall office.[45] During this century, at least 40% of the world's entire trade passed through Liverpool.[46] In the early 19th century, Liverpool played a major role in the Antarctic sealing industry, in recognition of which Liverpool Beach in the South Shetland Islands is named after the city.[47] As early as 1851, the city was described as \"the New York of Europe\".[48] During the late 19th and early 20th century, Liverpool was attracting immigrants from across Europe. This resulted in the construction of a diverse array of religious buildings in the city for the new ethnic and religious groups, many of which are still in use today. The Deutsche Kirche Liverpool, Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas, Gustav Adolf Church and Princes Road Synagogue were all established in the 1800s to serve Liverpool's growing German, Greek, Nordic and Jewish communities, respectively. One of Liverpool's oldest surviving churches, St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, served the Polish community in its final years as a place of worship. The 20th century saw Liverpool's established rank as a global economic powerhouse challenged. Its strategic location as an international seaport made it particularly vulnerable in two World wars. Economic depressions (both in the United Kingdom and across the world), changing housing patterns and containerisation in the maritime industry contributed to a downtrend in the city's productivity and prosperity. Despite this, the city's influence on global popular culture excelled and by the end of the century, the continuing process of urban renewal paved the way for the redefined modern city of the 21st century. The period after the Great War was marked by social unrest, as society grappled with the massive war losses of young men, as well as trying to re-integrate veterans into civilian life and the economy. Unemployment and poor living standards greeted many ex-servicemen. Union organising and strikes took place in numerous locations, including a police strike in Liverpool among the City Police. Numerous colonial soldiers and sailors from Africa and India, who had served with the British Armed Forces, settled in Liverpool and other port cities. In June 1919, they were subject to attack by whites in racial riots; residents in the port included Swedish immigrants, and both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and housing. In this period, race riots also took place in other port cities.[49] The Housing Act 1919 resulted in mass council housing being built across Liverpool during the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1920s and 1930s, as much as 15% of the city's population (around 140,000 people) was relocated from the inner-city to new purpose built, lower density suburban housing estates, based on the belief that this would improve their standard of living, though the overall benefits have been contested.[50][51] Numerous private homes were also built during this era. During the Great Depression of the early 1930s, unemployment peaked at around 30% in the city. Liverpool was the site of Britain's first provincial airport, operating from 1930. During the Second World War, the critical strategic importance of Liverpool was recognised by both Hitler and Churchill. The city was heavily bombed by the Germans, suffering a blitz second only to London's.[52] The pivotal Battle of the Atlantic was planned, fought and won from Liverpool.[53] The Luftwaffe made 80 air raids on Merseyside, killing 2,500 people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the Seaforth Dock, the largest dock project in Britain. Since 1952, Liverpool has been twinned with Cologne, Germany, a city which also suffered severe aerial bombing during the war. In the 1950s and 1960s, much of the immediate reconstruction that took place in the city centre proved to be deeply unpopular. The historic portions of the city that had survived German bombing suffered extensive destruction during urban renewal. It has been argued that the so-called \"Shankland Plan\" of the 1960s, named after the town planner Graeme Shankland, led to compromised town planning and vast road-building schemes that devastated and divided inner city neighbourhoods. Concrete brutalist architecture, compromised visions, botched projects and grand designs that were never realised became the subject of condemnation. Historian Raphael Samuel labelled Graeme Shankland \"the butcher of Liverpool\".[54][55][56][57] A significant West Indian black community has existed in the city since the first two decades of the 20th century. Like most British cities and industrialised towns, Liverpool became home to a significant number of Commonwealth immigrants, beginning after World War I with colonial soldiers and sailors who had served in the area. More immigrants arrived after World War II, mostly settling in older inner-city areas such as Toxteth, where housing was less expensive. The black population of Liverpool was recorded at 1.90% in 2011. In the 2021 Census, 5.2% described themselves as black African, Caribbean, mixed white and black African, mixed white and Caribbean or 'other black'.[58][59] In the 1960s, Liverpool was the centre of the \"Merseybeat\" sound, which became synonymous with the Beatles and fellow Liverpudlian rock bands. Influenced by American rhythm and blues and rock music, they also in turn strongly affected American music. The Beatles became internationally known in the early 1960s and performed around the world together; they were, and continue to be, the most commercially successful and musically influential band in popular history. Their co-founder, singer, and composer John Lennon was killed in New York City in 1980. Liverpool Airport was renamed after him in 2002, the first British airport to be named in honour of an individual.[60][61] Previously part of Lancashire, and a county borough from 1889, Liverpool became a metropolitan borough within the newly created metropolitan county of Merseyside, in 1974. From the mid-1970s onwards, Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries declined due to restructuring of shipping and heavy industry, causing massive losses of jobs. The advent of containerisation meant that the city's docks became largely obsolete, and dock workers were made unemployed. By the early 1980s, unemployment rates in Liverpool were among the highest in the UK,[62] standing at 17% by January 1982 although, this was about half the level of unemployment that had affected the city during the Great Depression some 50 years previously.[63] During this period, Liverpool became a hub of fierce left-wing opposition to the central government in London.[64] Liverpool in the 1980s has been labelled as Britain's 'shock city'. Once the acclaimed second city of the British Empire which rivalled the capital city in global significance, Liverpool had collapsed in to its 'nadir' at the depths of post-colonial, post-industrial Britain.[65][66] In the late 20th century, Liverpool's economy began to recover. The late 1980s saw the opening of a regenerated Albert Dock which proved to be a catalyst for further regeneration.[67] In the mid-1990s, the city enjoyed growth rates higher than the national average. At the end of the 20th century, Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration, a process that continues today. Ongoing regeneration combined with the hosting of internationally significant events has helped to re-purpose Liverpool as one of the most visited, tourist orientated, cities in the United Kingdom. City leaders are focussing on long-term strategies to grow the city's population and economy, while national government explores the continuous potential for devolution in the city. In 2002, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited Liverpool to mark the Golden Jubilee. On speaking to an audience at Liverpool Town Hall, the Queen recognised Liverpool as \"one of the most distinctive and energetic parts of the United Kingdom\", and paid tribute to the city's \"major orchestras, world-class museums and galleries\". She also acknowledged Liverpool's bid to become the European Capital of Culture.[68][69] To celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002, the conservation charity Plantlife organised a competition to choose county flowers; the sea-holly was Liverpool's final choice. The initiative was designed to highlight growing threats to the UK's flower species and also ask the public about which flowers best represented their county.[70] Capitalising on the popularity of 1960s rock groups, such as the Beatles, as well as the city's world-class art galleries, museums and landmarks, tourism and culture have become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy. In 2004, property developer Grosvenor started the Paradise Project, a £920 million development based on Paradise Street. This produced one of the most significant changes to Liverpool's city centre since the post-war reconstruction. Renamed as 'Liverpool One,' the centre opened in May 2008. In 2007, events and celebrations took place in honour of the 800th anniversary of the founding of the borough of Liverpool. Liverpool was designated as a joint European Capital of Culture for 2008. The celebrations included the erection of La Princesse, a large mechanical spider 20 metres high and weighing 37 tonnes, which represented the \"eight legs\" of Liverpool: honour, history, music, the Mersey, the ports, governance, sunshine and culture. La Princesse roamed the streets of the city during the festivities, and concluded by entering the Queensway Tunnel. Spearheaded by the multi-billion-pound Liverpool ONE development, regeneration continued throughout the 2010s. Some of the most significant redevelopment projects included new buildings in the Commercial District, King's Dock, Mann Island, around Lime Street, the Baltic Triangle, RopeWalks, and Edge Lane.[71][72][73] Changes to Liverpool's governance took place in 2014. The local authority of Liverpool City Council decided to pool its power and resources with surrounding boroughs through the formation of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority in a form of devolution. With a devolved budget granted by central government, the authority now oversees and invests in foremost strategic affairs throughout the Liverpool City Region, including major regeneration projects. The authority, along with Liverpool City Council itself, has embarked on long-term plans to grow the population and economy of the city.[74][75][76][77] By the 2020s, urban regeneration throughout the city continues. Liverpool Waters, a mixed-use development in the city's disused northern docklands, has been identified as one of the largest megaprojects in the UK's history. Everton's new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock was regarded as the largest single-site private sector development in the United Kingdom at the time of construction.[78][79] Major events, business and political conferences regularly take place in the city and form an important part of the economy. In June 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron launched the International Festival for Business in Liverpool, the world's largest business event in 2014,[80] and the largest in the UK since the Festival of Britain in 1951.[81] The Labour Party has chosen Liverpool numerous times since the mid 2010s for their annual Labour Party Conference. Liverpool hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2023. Liverpool has been a centre of invention and innovation. Railways, transatlantic steamships, municipal trams,[82] and electric trains were all pioneered in Liverpool as modes of mass transit. In 1829 and 1836, the first railway tunnels in the world were constructed under Liverpool (Wapping Tunnel). From 1950 to 1951, the world's first scheduled passenger helicopter service ran between Liverpool and Cardiff.[83] The first School for the Blind,[84] Mechanics' Institute,[85] High School for Girls,[86][87] council house,[88] and Juvenile Court[89] were all founded in Liverpool. Charities such as the RSPCA,[90] NSPCC,[91] Age Concern,[92] Relate, and Citizen's Advice Bureau[93] all evolved from work in the city. The first lifeboat station, public bath and wash-house,[94] sanitary act,[95] medical officer for health (William Henry Duncan), district nurse, slum clearance,[96] purpose-built ambulance,[97] X-ray medical diagnosis,[98] school of tropical medicine (Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine), motorised municipal fire-engine,[99] free school meal,[100] cancer research centre,[101] and zoonosis research centre[102] all originated in Liverpool. The first British Nobel Prize was awarded in 1902 to Ronald Ross, professor at the School of Tropical Medicine, the first school of its kind in the world.[103] Orthopaedic surgery was pioneered in Liverpool by Hugh Owen Thomas,[104] and modern medical anaesthetics by Thomas Cecil Gray. The world's first integrated sewer system was constructed in Liverpool by James Newlands, appointed in 1847 as the UK's first borough engineer.[105][106] Liverpool also founded the UK's first Underwriters' Association[107] and the first Institute of Accountants. The Western world's first financial derivatives (cotton futures) were traded on the Liverpool Cotton Exchange in the late 1700s.[108] In the arts, Liverpool was home to the first lending library (The Lyceum), athenaeum society (Liverpool Athenaeum), arts centre (Bluecoat Chambers),[109] and public art conservation centre (National Conservation Centre).[110] It is also home to the UK's oldest surviving classical orchestra (Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra)[111] and repertory theatre (Liverpool Playhouse).[112] In 1864, Peter Ellis built the world's first iron-framed, curtain-walled office building, Oriel Chambers, which was a prototype of the skyscraper. The UK's first purpose-built department store was Compton House, completed in 1867 for the retailer J.R. Jeffrey.[113] It was the largest store in the world at the time.[114] Between 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by John Hulley and Charles Pierre Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook.[115][116] The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics.[117] In 1865, Hulley co-founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the Olympic Charter. A concept devised by retail entrepreneur David Lewis, the first Christmas grotto opened in Lewis's department store in Liverpool in 1879.[118] Sir Alfred Lewis Jones, a shipowner, introduced bananas to the UK via Liverpool's docks in 1884.[119] The Mersey Railway, opened in 1886, incorporated the world's first tunnel under a tidal estuary[120] and the world's first deep-level underground stations (Liverpool James Street railway station). In 1889, borough engineer John Alexander Brodie invented the football goal net. He was also a pioneer in the use of pre-fabricated housing[122] and oversaw the construction of the UK's first ring road (A5058) and intercity highway (East Lancashire Road), as well as the Queensway Tunnel linking Liverpool and Birkenhead. Described as \"the eighth wonder of the world\" at the time of its construction, it was the longest underwater tunnel in the world for 24 years. In 1897, the Lumière brothers filmed Liverpool,[123] including what is believed to be the world's first tracking shot,[124] taken from the Liverpool Overhead Railway, the world's first elevated electrified railway. The Overhead Railway was the first railway in the world to use electric multiple units, employ automatic signalling, and install an escalator. Liverpool inventor Frank Hornby was a visionary in toy development and manufacture, producing three of the most popular lines of toys in the 20th century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways (both in 1901), and Dinky Toys in 1934.[125] The British Interplanetary Society, founded in Liverpool in 1933 by Phillip Ellaby Cleator, is the world's oldest existing organisation devoted to the promotion of spaceflight. Its journal, the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, is the longest-running astronautical publication in the world.[126] In 1999, Liverpool was the first city outside London to be awarded blue plaques by English Heritage in recognition of the \"significant contribution made by its sons and daughters in all walks of life\".[127] For the purposes of local government, Liverpool is classified as a metropolitan borough with city status. The metropolitan borough is located within both the county of Merseyside and the Liverpool City Region. Each of these geographical areas is treated as an administrative area with different levels of local governance applying to each. Liverpool City Council is the governing body solely for the Metropolitan Borough of Liverpool and performs functions that are standard of an English Unitary Authority. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region reserve major strategic powers over such things as transport, economic development and regeneration for the city along with the 5 surrounding boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Combined Authority has competency over areas which have been devolved by national government and are specific to the city region.[128] Nevertheless, there are a few exceptions to local governance apart from these two structures. Liverpool was administered by Merseyside County Council between 1974 and 1986 and some residual aspects of organisation which date back to this time have survived. When the County Council was disbanded in 1986, most civic functions were transferred to Liverpool City Council. However, several authorities such as the police and fire and rescue service, continue to be run at a county-wide level. The county of Merseyside, therefore, continues to exist as an administrative area for a few limited services only, while the capability and capacity of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority is evolving over time.[129] The city also elects five members of Parliament (MPs) to the Westminster Parliament, all Labour as of the 2024 general election. Liverpool City Council operates under a constitution comprising 85 city councillors who are directly elected by the Liverpool electorate every 4 years and represent a variety of different political parties. The city councillors make decisions about local services for the city's people. At each election, the political party that wins the majority of the 85 council seats leads the council for the following 4 years. The local leader of this party assumes the role of Leader of the City Council who then chairs a Cabinet of 9 councillors who are assigned specific responsibilities known as 'portfolios'. The incumbent Leader of Liverpool City Council is Councillor Liam Robinson, who represents the Labour Party, which secured a large majority at the 2023 local election,[131] the Leader is also a member of the Mayor of the Liverpool City Regions cabinet (Separate from the City Council Cabinet), at present Robinson holds the portfolio of Cabinet Member for Innovation. The City Council's decisions and scrutiny of activities are undertaken by a number of different committees and panels which include the Overview and Scrutiny Committees, Scrutiny Panels, Regulatory Committees and other committees. The day-to-day management of the council is carried out by the management team which includes the Chief Executive and several directors and senior officers. The management team works with the Cabinet and councillors to deliver strategic direction and priorities such as the budget and the City Plan.[132][133] Every four years, the city elects 85 councillors from 64 local council wards.[134] During the 2023 Liverpool City Council election, the Labour Party consolidated its control of Liverpool City Council, following on from the previous elections. Out of the total 85 City Council seats up for election, The Labour Party won 61 seats (53.13% of the electorate's total votes), the Liberal Democrats won 15 seats (21.61% of the votes), the Green Party won 3 seats (9.76% of the votes), the Liverpool Community Independents won 3 seats (4.64% of the votes) and the Liberal Party won the remaining 3 seats (3.21% of the votes). The Conservative Party, the political party in power at national government, had no representation on Liverpool City Council. Only 27.27% of the eligible Liverpool electorate turned out to vote.[135] Throughout most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was a municipal stronghold of Toryism. However, support for the Conservative Party in recent times has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the monetarist economic policies of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher. After the 1979 general election, many have claimed that her victory contributed to longstanding high unemployment and decline in the city.[136] Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's key strongholds; however, the city has also seen hard times under Labour governments. Particularly in the Winter of Discontent (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes along with the rest of the United Kingdom, but also when it suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied for long periods.[137] In recent years, Liverpool City Council began an extensive improvement program designed to ensure that the authority makes efficient use of taxpayer's money and to encourage more business and investment in the city. Grosvenor Group, the property company responsible for Liverpool One, commended the changes as an \"opportunity for bold thinking in liverpool\".[138] In 2021, a highly critical government inspection and subsequent report of Liverpool City Council (referred to as the Caller report) identified multiple shortcomings at Liverpool City Council. The Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Robert Jenrick sent government commissioners to oversee the City Council's highways, regeneration, property management, governance and financial decision-making. The authority was compelled to commit to a three-year improvement plan in which the entire structure of the council would be overhauled. As a result of the intervention, major structural changes at the City Council took place by the 2023 United Kingdom local elections, which were labelled \"the most unpredictable [elections] in the city's history\". The number of electoral wards in the city was doubled from 30 to 64, while the overall number of City Councillors up for election was reduced from 90 to 85. In future, the council would also change to 'all out' elections every four years whereby every single City Councillor would be eligible for re-election at the same time. The role of elected city mayor was also abolished and the Council reverted to the previous Leader and Cabinet style of leadership. The outcome of the elections were seen not only as a test of how the general public would respond to the government intervention in the city, but also to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government as a whole.[139][140][141][142] Councillor Liam Robinson became the new Leader of Liverpool City Council at the 2023 City Council election. The Liverpool Strategic Futures Advisory Panel, chaired by the Mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram, and including several high-profile figures with experience in local government, was established. The panel was tasked with directing the council's long-term future outside of government intervention measures and to advise on plans and priorities that the city should pursue.[143] In February 2008, Liverpool City Council was reported to be the worst-performing council in the country, receiving just a one-star rating (classified as inadequate). The main cause of the poor rating was attributed to the council's poor handling of tax-payer money, including the accumulation of a £20m shortfall while the city held the title of European Capital of Culture.[144] In April 2024, the Office for Local Government released a ranking of local authorities, placing Liverpool City Council 317th out of a possible 318.[145] The Lord Mayor of Liverpool is an ancient ceremonial role. Councillors within Liverpool City Council (not the general public) elect the Lord Mayor annually, who then serves a one-year term. The Lord Mayor is styled as the \"first citizen\" and is chosen to represent the city at civic functions and engagements, promote it to the wider world, support local charities and community groups, attend religious events, meet delegates from Liverpool's twin cities, chair council meetings and confer Honorary Freemen and associations.[146] The Lord Mayor is also the presiding officer for Liverpool City Council full meetings. . Liverpool is one of the six constituent boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Mayor of the Liverpool City Region is directly every four years by residents of those six boroughs and oversees the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. The Combined Authority is the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and is tasked with taking major strategic decisions on issues such as transport and investment, economic development, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure. The current Mayor is Steve Rotheram. Liverpool is included within five parliamentary constituencies, through which MPs are elected to represent the city in Westminster: Liverpool Riverside, Liverpool Walton, Liverpool Wavertree, Liverpool West Derby and Garston and Halewood.[147] At the last general election, all were won by Labour with representation being from Kim Johnson, Dan Carden, Paula Barker and Ian Byrne respectively.[148] Due to boundary changes prior to the 2010 election, the Liverpool Garston constituency was merged with most of Knowsley South to form the Garston and Halewood cross-boundary seat. At the most recent 2024 election, this seat was won by Maria Eagle of the Labour Party.[148] Liverpool has been described as having \"the most splendid setting of any English city.\"[149] At 53°24′0″N 2°59′0″W﻿ / ﻿53.40000°N 2.98333°W﻿ / 53.40000; -2.98333 (53.4, −2.98), 176 miles (283 kilometres) northwest of London, located on the Liverpool Bay of the Irish Sea, Liverpool is built across a ridge of sandstone hills rising up to a height of around 230 feet (70 m) above sea-level at Everton Hill, which represents the southern boundary of the West Lancashire Coastal Plain. The Mersey Estuary separates Liverpool from the Wirral Peninsula. The boundaries of Liverpool are adjacent to Bootle, Crosby and Maghull in south Sefton to the north, and Kirkby, Huyton, Prescot and Halewood in Knowsley to the east. Liverpool experiences a temperate maritime climate (Köppen: Cfb), like much of the British Isles, with relatively mild summers, cool winters and rainfall spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Rainfall and temperature records had been kept at Bidston Hill since 1867, but records for atmospheric pressure go back as far as at least 1846.[150] Bidston closed down in 2002 but the Met Office also has a weather station at Crosby. Since records began in 1867, temperatures have ranged from −17.6 °C (0.3 °F) on 21 December 2010 to 34.5 °C (94.1 °F) on 2 August 1990, although Liverpool Airport recorded a temperature of 35.0 °C (95.0 °F) on 19 July 2006.[151] The lowest amount of sunshine on record was 16.5 hours in December 1927 whereas the most was 314.5 hours in July 2013.[152][153] Tornado activity or funnel cloud formation is very rare in and around the Liverpool area and tornadoes that do form are usually weak. Recent tornadoes or funnel clouds in Merseyside have been seen in 1998 and 2014.[154][155] During the period 1981–2010, Crosby recorded an average of 32.8 days of air frost per year, which is low for the United Kingdom.[156] Snow is fairly common during the winter although heavy snow is rare. Snow generally falls between November and March but can occasionally fall earlier and later. In recent times, the earliest snowfall was on 1 October 2008[157] while the latest occurred on 15 May 2012.[158] Although historically, the earliest snowfall occurred on 10 September 1908[159] and the latest on 2 June 1975.[160] Rainfall, although light, is quite a common occurrence in Liverpool, with the wettest month on record being August 1956, which recorded 221.2 mm (8.71 in) of rain and the driest being February 1932, with 0.9 mm (0.035 in).[161] The driest year on record was 1991, with 480.5 mm (18.92 in) of rainfall and the wettest was 1872, with 1,159.9 mm (45.67 in).[162] Suburbs and districts of Liverpool include: In 2010, Liverpool City Council and the Primary Care Trust commissioned the Mersey Forest to complete \"A Green Infrastructure Strategy\" for the city.[171] Liverpool is a core urban element of a green belt region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, which is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.[172] Due to being already highly built up, the city contains limited portions of protected green belt area within greenfield throughout the borough at Fazakerley, Croxteth Hall and country park and Craven Wood, Woodfields Park and nearby golf courses in Netherley, small greenfield tracts east of the Speke area by the St Ambrose primary school, and the small hamlet of Oglet and the surrounding area south of Liverpool Airport.[173] The green belt was first drawn up in 1983 under Merseyside County Council[174] and the size in the city amounts to 530 hectares (5.3 km2; 2.0 sq mi).[175] Since the mid-20th century, Scouser has become the predominant demonym for the inhabitants of Liverpool, and is strongly associated with the Scouse accent and dialect of the city.[176] The Scouse accent is described as progressively diverging from the Lancastrian accent in the late 19th century.[177][178][179][180][181] The etymology of Scouser is derived from the traditional dish Scouse brought to the area by sailors travelling through Liverpool's port.[182][181][183] Prior to the establishment of Scouser as there have been a number of different terms used to refer to inhabitants of Liverpool of varying popularity and longevity: Professor Tony Crowley argues that up until the 1950s, inhabitants of Liverpool were generally referred to by a number of demonyms. He argues that there was a debate in the mid 20th century between the two rival terms of 'Liverpolitan' and 'Liverpudlian'. The debate surrounded the lexicology of these terms and their connotations of social class.[183][187] Professor John Belchem suggests that a series of other nicknames such as 'Dick Liver', 'Dicky Sam' and 'whacker' were used, but gradually fell out of use. Belchem and Philip Boland suggest that comedic radio presenters and entertainers brought the Liverpool identity to a national audience, which in turn encouraged locals to be gradually more known as 'scousers'. By the time that Frank Shaw's My Liverpool, a Celebration of 'Scousetown' was published in 1971, Belchem argues that 'Scouser' had firmly become the dominant demonym.[176][188][189] The city of Liverpool is at the core of a much larger and more populous metropolitan area, however, at the most recent UK Census in 2021, the area governed by Liverpool City Council had a population of 486,100, a 4.2% increase from the previous Census in 2011. This figure increased to 500,500 people by 2022, according to data from Liverpool City Council. Taking in to account how local government is organised within the cities and metropolitan areas of England, the Liverpool was the fifth largest of England's 'core cities' and had the second overall highest population density of those, by 2021.[201][202] The population of the city has steadily risen since the 2001 Census. As well as having a growing population, the population density also grew at the 2021 Census compared to the previous Census. Since 2011, its population size ranked 10th out of 309 local authority areas.[203] The population of the city is comparatively younger than that of England as a whole. Family life in the city is also growing at odds with the North West England region as a whole: At the 2021 Census, the percentage of households including a couple without children increased in Liverpool, but fell across the North West. The percentage of people aged 16 years and over (excluding full-time students) who were employed also increased in Liverpool compared to the overall North West region where it fell. The 2021 Census also showed that Liverpool's ethnic and international population was growing. The number of residents in the city born outside of England has increased since the previous Census, while the number of residents who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK has also increased at a faster rate than England as a whole. The overall share of the city's population who identified as Asian and Black increased, while the percentage who identified as white decreased in the city compared with previous Census.[204] It has been argued that the city can claim to have one of the strongest Irish heritages in the United Kingdom, with as many as 75 percent (estimated) of Liverpool's population with some form of Irish ancestry.[205] The growing population of Liverpool in the 21st century reverses a trend which took place between the 1930s and 2001, when the population of the city proper effectively halved. At the 1931 United Kingdom census, Liverpool's population reached an all-time high of 846,302. Following this peak, in response to central government policy, the Council authority of Liverpool then built and owned large several 'new town' council estates in the suburbs within Liverpool's metropolitan area. Tens of thousands of people were systematically relocated to new housing in areas such as Halton, Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral, Cheshire West and Chester, West Lancashire, Warrington and as far as North Wales. Such a mass relocation and population loss during this time was common practice for many British cities, including London and Manchester, In contrast, satellite towns such as Kirkby, Skelmersdale and Runcorn saw a corresponding rise in their populations (Kirkby being the fastest growing town in Britain during the 1960s).[206][207][204][208] Liverpool is typically grouped with the wider Merseyside (plus Halton) area for the purpose of defining its metropolitan footprint, and there are several methodologies. Sometimes, this metropolitan area is broadened to encompass urban settlements in the neighbouring counties of Lancashire and Cheshire.[209][210] The Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom uses the international standardised International Territorial Levels (ITLs) to divide up the economic territory of the UK. This enables the ONS to calculate regional and local statistics and data. The ONS uses a series of codes to identify these areas. In order of hierarchy from largest area to smallest area, Liverpool is part of the following regions:[211][212][213] North West England (code TLD) At the 2021 Census, the ITL 1 region of North West England had a usual resident population of 7,417,300.[214] Merseyside (code TLD7) The ITL 2 region of Merseyside is defined as the area comprising East Merseyside (TLD71) plus Liverpool (TLD72), Sefton (TLD73) and Wirral (TLD74). At the 2021 Census, the population of this area was as follows:[215] East Merseyside (TLD71): Liverpool (TLD72) = 486,100 Sefton (TLD73) = 279,300 Wirral (TLD74) = 320,200 Therefore, the total population of the ITL 2 Merseyside region was 1,551,500 based on the 2021 Census. The smallest ITL 3 area classed as Liverpool (code TLD72), therefore, had a population of 486,100 at the 2021 Census. At the 2021 Census, the ONS used a refreshed concept of built-up areas (BUAs) based on the physical built environment, using satellite imagery to recognise developed land, such as cities, towns, and villages. This allows the ONS to investigate economic and social statistics based on actual settlements where most people live. Data from the 2021 Census is not directly comparable with 2011 Census data due to this revised methodology. Using the population figures of BUAs at the 2021 Census (excluding London), Liverpool Built-up Area is the third largest in England with some 506,565 usual residents (behind only Birmingham and Leeds). Liverpool's built-up area is, therefore, larger than the major English cities of Bristol, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham and Sheffield.[216] Excluding London, the Liverpool City Region was the 4th largest combined authority area in England, by 2021. The population is approximately 1.6 million. The Liverpool City Region is a political and economic partnership between local authorities including Liverpool, plus the Metropolitan boroughs of Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens, Wirral and the Borough of Halton. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority exercises strategic governance powers for the region in many areas. The economic data of the Liverpool city region is of particular policy interest to the Office for National Statistics, particularly as the British Government continuously explores the potential to negotiate increased devolved powers for each combined authority area.[217][218][219][220] A 2011 report, Liverpool City Region – Building on its Strengths, by Lord Heseltine and Terry Leahy, stated that \"what is now called Liverpool City Region has a population of around 1.5 million\", but also referred to \"an urban region that spreads from Wrexham and Flintshire to Chester, Warrington, West Lancashire and across to Southport\", with a population of 2.3 million.[221] In 2006, in an attempt to harmonise the series of metropolitan areas across the European Union, ESPON (now European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion) released a study defining a \"Liverpool/Birkenhead Metropolitan area\" with an estimated population of 2,241,000 people. The metro area comprised a functional urban area consisting of a contiguous urban sprawl, labour pool, and commuter Travel to work areas. The analysis defined this metropolitan area as Liverpool itself, combined with the surrounding areas of Birkenhead, Wigan/Ashton, Warrington, Widnes/Runcorn, Chester, Southport, Ellesmere Port, Ormskirk and Skelmersdale.[222] Liverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered as one large polynuclear metropolitan area,[223][224][225] or megalopolis. In recent decades, Liverpool's population is becoming more multicultural. According to the 2021 census, 77% of all Liverpool residents described their ethnic group as White English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British. The remaining 23% were described as non-White English/British. Between 2011 and 2021, there was population growth across all ethnic groups, except 'White English/British' and 'Any Other', where there were overall losses. The number of 'Other White residents' in Liverpool also increased by almost 12,000 people, with notable increases in the 'Other Asian', 'Arab', and 'Other Mixed/Multiple' population categories. The non-White English/British population as a percentage of the total population across the 'newly organised city electoral wards' ranged from 5% in the Orrell Park ward to 69% in the Princes Park ward. 9 out of 10 Liverpool residents regarded English as their main language. The highest non-English languages in the city were Arabic (5,743 main speakers) followed by Polish (4,809 main speakers). Overall, almost 45,000 residents had a main language that was not English.[226] According to a 2014 survey, the ten most popular surnames of Liverpool and their occurrence in the population are:[228][229] Liverpool is home to Britain's oldest Black community, dating to at least the 1730s. Some Liverpudlians can trace their black ancestry in the city back ten generations.[230] Early Black settlers in the city included seamen, the children of traders sent to be educated, and freed slaves, since slaves entering the country after 1722 were deemed free men.[231] Since the 20th century, Liverpool is also noted for its large African-Caribbean,[4] Ghanaian,[232] and Somali[233] communities, formed of more recent African-descended immigrants and their subsequent generations. The city is also home to the oldest Chinese community in Europe; the first residents of the city's Chinatown arrived as seamen in the 19th century.[234] The traditional Chinese gateway erected in Liverpool's Chinatown is the largest such gateway outside China. Liverpool also has a long-standing Filipino community. Lita Roza, a singer from Liverpool who was the first woman to achieve a UK number one hit, had Filipino ancestry. The city is also known for its large Irish and Welsh populations.[235] In 1813, 10 per cent of Liverpool's population was Welsh, leading to the city becoming known as \"the capital of North Wales.\"[235] During, and in the decades following, the Great Irish Famine in the mid-19th century, up to two million Irish people travelled to Liverpool within one decade, with many subsequently departing for the United States.[236] By 1851, more than 20 per cent of the population of Liverpool was Irish.[237] At the 2001 Census, 1.17 per cent of the population were Welsh-born and 0.75 per cent were born in the Republic of Ireland, while 0.54 per cent were born in Northern Ireland,[238] but many more Liverpudlians are of legacy Welsh or Irish ancestry.[239] Other contemporary ethnicities include Indian,[4] Latin American,[240] Malaysian,[241] and Yemeni[242] communities, which number several thousand each. The thousands of migrants and sailors passing through Liverpool resulted in a religious diversity that is still apparent today. This is reflected in the equally diverse collection of religious buildings,[244] including two Christian cathedrals. Liverpool is known to be England's 'most Catholic city', with a Catholic population much larger than in other parts of England.[245] This is mainly due to high historic Irish migration to the city and their descendants since.[246] The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican Our Lady and St Nicholas, colloquially known as \"the sailors church\", which has existed near the waterfront since 1257. It regularly plays host to Catholic masses. Other notable churches include the Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas (built in the Neo-Byzantine architecture style), and the Gustav Adolf Church (the Swedish Seamen's Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles). Liverpool's wealth as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous cathedrals in the 20th century. The Anglican Cathedral, which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and plays host to the annual Liverpool Shakespeare Festival, has one of the longest naves, largest organs and heaviest and highest peals of bells in the world. The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral, on Mount Pleasant next to Liverpool Science Park, was initially planned to be even larger. Of Sir Edwin Lutyens's original design, only the crypt was completed. The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by Sir Frederick Gibberd. While this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens' original design, it still incorporates the largest panel of stained glass in the world. The road running between the two cathedrals is called Hope Street. The cathedral has long been colloquially referred to as \"Paddy's Wigwam\" due to its shape.[247] Liverpool contains several synagogues, of which the Grade I listed Moorish Revival Princes Road Synagogue is architecturally the most notable. Princes Road is widely considered to be the most magnificent of Britain's Moorish Revival synagogues and one of the finest buildings in Liverpool.[248] Liverpool has a thriving Jewish community with a further two orthodox Synagogues, one in the Allerton district of the city and a second in the Childwall district of the city where a significant Jewish community reside. A third orthodox Synagogue in the Greenbank Park area of L17 has recently closed and is a listed 1930s structure. There is also a Lubavitch Chabad House and a reform Synagogue. Liverpool has had a Jewish community since the mid-18th century. The Jewish population of Liverpool is around 5,000.[249] The Liverpool Talmudical College existed from 1914 until 1990, when its classes moved to the Childwall Synagogue.[citation needed] Liverpool also has a Hindu community, with a Mandir on Edge Lane, Edge Hill. The Shri Radha Krishna Temple from the Hindu Cultural Organisation in Liverpool is located there.[250] Liverpool also has the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Wavertree[251] and a Baháʼí Centre in the same area.[252] The city had the earliest Mosque in England and possibly the UK, founded in 1887 by William Abdullah Quilliam, a lawyer who had converted to Islam who set up the Liverpool Muslim Institute in a terraced house on West Derby Road.[253] Apart from the first mosque in England which now houses a museum,[254][255] the largest and main one, Al-Rahma mosque, was also the third purpose-built mosque in the United Kingdom.[256] The second largest mosque in Liverpool is the Masjid Al-Taiseer.[257] Other mosques in the city include the Bait ul Lateef Ahmadiyya Mosque,[258] Hamza Center (Community Center),[259] Islamic community centre,[260] Liverpool Mosque and Islamic Institute,[261] Liverpool Towhid Centre,[262] Masjid Annour,[263] and the Shah Jalal Mosque.[264] Liverpool forms an integral part of North West England's economy, the third largest regional economy in the United Kingdom. The city is also a major contributor to the economy of Liverpool City Region, worth over £40 billion per year.[268][269][270] The local authority area governed by Liverpool City Council accounts for 39% of the Liverpool city region's total jobs, 40% of its total GVA and 35% of its total businesses. At the local authority level, the city's GVA (balanced) at current basic prices was £14.3 billion in 2021. Its GDP at current market prices was £15.9 billion. This equates to £32,841 per head of the population.[271][272] At the 2021 United Kingdom census, 51.1% of Liverpool's population aged 16 years and over was classed as employed, 44.2% economically inactive and 4.8% unemployed. Of those employed, the most popular industries providing the employment were human health and social work activities (18.7%), wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motor cycles (15%), education (10.8%), public administration and defence; compulsory social security (7.3%), accommodation and food service activities (6.8%), construction (6.5%), transport and storage (5.8%), manufacturing (5.5%) and professional, scientific and technical activities (5.2%).[273] According to the ONS Business Register and Employment Survey 2021, some industries within Liverpool perform strongly compared to other local authorities in Great Britain. In terms of absolute number of jobs per industry in Great Britain's local authority areas, Liverpool features in the national top 10 for human health and social work activities; arts, entertainment and recreation; public administration and defence; compulsory social security; accommodation and food service activities and real estate activities. Liverpool features in the national top 20 for number of jobs in education; construction; wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; transportation and storage; financial and insurance activities and professional, scientific and technical activities.[274] In 2023, Liverpool City Council set out an economic growth plan for the city over the following 20 years. The City Council will have particular focus on economic sectors such as the visitor economy (tourism), culture, life sciences, digital and creative sectors, and advanced car manufacturing.[275] According to the International passenger Survey, from the ONS, Liverpool was one of the top 5 most visited cities in the UK by overseas tourists in 2022. As of the same year, the city's tourist industry was worth a total of £3.5 billion annually and was part of a larger city region tourist industry worth £5 billion. A consistent calendar of major events, as well as a plethora of cultural attractions, continue to provide a significant draw for tourists. Tourism related to the Beatles is worth an estimated £100m to the Liverpool economy each year alone. Liverpool One, as well as a growing retail offer overall, has led to the city being one of the most prominent destinations for shopping in the UK. Liverpool Cruise Terminal, which is situated close to the Pier Head, enables tourists to berth in the centre of the city.[276][277][278][279][280][281][282] Liverpool is home to the Knowledge Quarter, a 450-acre city centre district that hosts some of the world's most influential institutions in science, health, technology, education, music and the creative performing arts. The UK government has also identified the city as a 'pharmaceutical production superpower' and one of the UK's leading regions for bioprocessing. The accolade led to the government choosing the city for England's second ever 'Investment Zone' in 2023. This will involve millions of pounds being invested over the coming years in to science orientated districts including the Knowledge Quarter and the so-called 'pharma cluster' in the city suburb of Speke. The two clusters form an internationally significant role in infectious disease control. Liverpool City Council also plan to invest in the city's Baltic Triangle, which is renowned in the creative and digital industries.[283][284][285][286][287][288] Car manufacturing also takes place in the city at the Jaguar Land Rover Halewood plant, where the Range Rover Evoque model is assembled. In 2023, Jaguar Land Rover announced that the Halewood plant would begin to shift its focus to electric car production.[289][290] Historically, the economy of Liverpool was centred on the city's port and manufacturing base. Today, the Port of Liverpool is the UK's fourth largest port by tonnage of freight, handling over 30 million tonnes in 2020. The city is also the UK's largest port for transatlantic trade, handling 45% of the country's trade from the United States. In 2023, the city was chosen by the British government to be a designated Freeport to encourage growing international commerce. The Liverpool2 container terminal, completed in 2022, has greatly increased the volume of cargo which Liverpool is able to handle and has facilitated the world's biggest container vessels.[291][292][293][294][295][296][297] Liverpool is also home to numerous UK headquarters, or the major strategic branch offices, of many shipping and freight lines including: Atlantic Container Line,[298] Bibby Line,[299] Borchard Lines Ltd,[300] CMA CGM,[301] Hapag-Lloyd,[302] Independent Container Line,[303] Irish Ferries,[304] Maersk Line,[305] Mediterranean Shipping Company[306] and Zim Integrated Shipping Services.[307] Liverpool's rich architectural base has helped the city become the second most filmed city in the UK outside London. As well as being a featured location in its own right, it often doubles up for Chicago, London, Moscow, New York City, Paris and Rome. The Depot studios, close to the city centre, provide space for film and TV productions.[308][309] Major economic projects planned for the city include the revitalisation of disused land in the North docks/Ten Streets area, Liverpool Waters and a new purpose built TV studio at the former Littlewoods Pools building, adjacent to the Depot.[310][311][312] The Liverpool City Region GDP in 2021 was £40.479 billion. The 6 contributing boroughs to this GDP were as follows:[313] The policy agenda of the British Government is to continuously monitor the economy and productivity of the UK's core cities within the context of their respective city regions. The government's longer-term plan is to assess each area's potential for increased devolution and transfer of additional powers and budgets from central government in Whitehall to their corresponding combined authorities. As such, official statistics about Liverpool's economy within the context of the Liverpool City Region, are closely monitored by the Office for National Statistics. This allows policy and decision makers to more accurately assess the 'functional economic area' of the city, which is not bound by traditional local government geographies.[314][315][316][317][318] As of 2023, there are 10 city regions in England with Combined Authorities. The economy of Liverpool's combined authority area in comparison to the other city regions is as follows: Liverpool's long commercial history has given rise to a considerable variety of architectural styles found within the city, ranging from 16th century Tudor buildings to modern-day contemporary architecture.[320] The majority of buildings in the city date from the late-18th century onwards, the period during which the city grew into one of the foremost powers in the British Empire.[321] There are over 2,500 listed buildings in Liverpool, of which 27 are Grade I listed[322] and 85 are Grade II* listed.[323] The city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from Westminster and significant number of Georgian houses still exist.[324][325] This richness of architecture has subsequently seen Liverpool described by English Heritage, as England's finest Victorian city.[326] The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Known as the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City, the sites were added in recognition of the city's role in the development of international trade and docking technology.[327] However, this status was revoked in July 2021, when UNESCO resolved that recent and proposed developments, such as the Bramley-Moore Dock Stadium and Liverpool Waters projects, had resulted in the \"serious deterioration\" of the area's significance.[328] As a major British port, the docks in Liverpool have historically been central to the city's development. Several major docking firsts have occurred in the city including the construction of the world's first enclosed wet dock (the Old Dock) in 1715 and the first ever hydraulic lifting cranes.[329] The best-known dock in Liverpool is the Royal Albert Dock, which was constructed in 1846 and today comprises the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in Britain.[330] Built under the guidance of Jesse Hartley, it was considered to be one of the most advanced docks anywhere in the world upon completion and is often attributed with helping the city to become one of the most important ports in the world. Today, the Royal Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two hotels as well as the Merseyside Maritime Museum, International Slavery Museum, Tate Liverpool and The Beatles Story. North of the city centre is Stanley Dock, home to the Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse, which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in terms of area[331] and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building.[332] One of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the Pier Head, renowned for the trio of buildings – the Royal Liver Building, the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building – which sit upon it. Collectively referred to as the Three Graces, these buildings stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. Built in a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol of 'maritime Liverpool' and are regarded by many as contributing to one of the most impressive waterfronts in the world.[333][334][335][336] In the 21st century, several areas along Liverpool's waterfront have undergone significant redevelopment. Among the notable developments are the Museum of Liverpool, the construction of the Liverpool Arena, ACC Liverpool and Exhibition Centre Liverpool on King's Dock, Alexandra Tower and 1 Princes Dock on Prince's Dock and Liverpool Marina around Coburg and Brunswick Docks. The Wheel of Liverpool opened on 25 March 2010.[337][338] However, plans to redevelop parts of Liverpool city centre have been marred by controversy. In December 2016, a newly formed company called North Point Global Ltd. was given the rights to develop part of the docks under the \"New Chinatown\" working name. Though heavily advertised in Liverpool, Hong Kong and Chinese cities with high-profile advertisements and videos, the \"New Chinatown\" development failed to materialise.[339] In January 2018, the Liverpool Echo and Asia Times revealed that the site remained sans any construction. North Point Global as well as its subcontractor \"Bilt\" had both declared bankruptcy, and the small investors (mostly middle class couples) who had already paid money for the apartments had lost most of their savings in them.[340] Liverpool's historic position as one of the most important trading ports in the world has meant that over time many grand buildings have been constructed in the city as headquarters for shipping firms, insurance companies, banks and other large firms. The great wealth this brought then allowed for the development of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators to 'run the city with pride'.[341] The commercial district is centred on the Castle Street, Dale Street and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with many of the area's roads still following their medieval layout. Having developed predominantly over a period of three centuries, the area is regarded as one of the most important architectural locations in the city, as recognised by its inclusion in Liverpool's former World Heritage site.[342] The oldest building in the area is the Grade I listed Liverpool Town Hall, which is located at the top of Castle Street and dates from 1754. Often regarded as the city's finest piece of Georgian architecture, the building is known as one of the most extravagantly decorated civic buildings anywhere in Britain.[343][344] Also on Castle Street is the Grade I listed Bank of England Building, constructed between 1845 and 1848, as one of only three provincial branches of the national bank.[343] Among the other buildings in the area are the Tower Buildings, Albion House (the former White Star Line headquarters), the Municipal Buildings and Oriel Chambers,[345] which is considered to be one of the earliest Modernist style buildings ever built.[346] The area around William Brown Street is referred to as the city's 'Cultural Quarter', owing to the presence of numerous civic buildings, including the William Brown Library, Walker Art Gallery, Picton Reading Rooms and World Museum Liverpool. The area is dominated by neo-classical architecture, of which the most prominent, St George's Hall,[347] is widely regarded as the best example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe.[348] A Grade I listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with \"S.P.Q.L.\" (Latin senatus populusque Liverpudliensis), meaning \"the senate and people of Liverpool\". William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments and sculptures, including Wellington's Column and the Steble Fountain. Many others are located around the area, particularly in St John's Gardens, which was specifically developed for this purpose.[349] The William Brown Street area has been likened to a modern recreation of the Roman Forum.[350] While the majority of Liverpool's architecture dates from the mid-18th century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One of the oldest surviving buildings is Speke Hall, a Tudor manor house located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598.[351] The building is one of the few remaining timber framed Tudor houses left in the north of England and is particularly noted for its Victorian interiors, which were added in the mid-19th century.[352] In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former manor houses including Croxteth Hall and Woolton Hall, which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively.[353] The oldest building within the city centre is the Grade I listed Bluecoat Chambers,[354] which was built between 1717 and 1718. Constructed in British Queen Anne style architecture,[355][356] the building was influenced in part by the work of Christopher Wren[357] and was originally the home of the Bluecoat School (who later moved to a larger site in Wavertree in the south of the city). Since 1908, it has acted as a centre for arts in Liverpool.[355] Liverpool is noted for having two Cathedrals, each of which imposes over the landscape around it.[358] The Anglican Cathedral, which was constructed between 1904 and 1978, is the largest Cathedral in Britain[359] and the fifth largest in the world. Designed and built in Gothic style, it is regarded as one of the greatest buildings to have been constructed during the 20th century[360] and was described by former British Poet Laureate, John Betjeman, as \"one of the great buildings of the world\".[361] The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral was constructed between 1962 and 1967 and is known as one of the first cathedrals to break the traditional longitudinal design.[362] In the 21st century, many parts of Liverpool's city centre have undergone significant redevelopment and regeneration after years of decline. So far, the largest of these developments has been Liverpool One, which saw almost £1 billion invested in the redevelopment of 42 acres (17 hectares) of land, providing new retail, commercial, residential and leisure space.[363] Around the north of the city centre, several new skyscrapers have also been constructed including the RIBA award-winning Unity Buildings and West Tower, which at 140m is Liverpool's tallest building. Many redevelopment schemes are also in progress including Circus,[364] King's Dock,[365] Paddington Village[366] and Liverpool Waters.[367] There are many other notable buildings in Liverpool, including the art deco former terminal building of Speke Airport, the University of Liverpool's Victoria Building, (which provided the inspiration for the term Red Brick University), and the Adelphi Hotel, which was in the past considered to be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world.[368] The Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England describes Merseyside's Victorian Parks as collectively the \"most important in the country\".[369] Liverpool has ten listed parks and cemeteries, including two Grade I and five Grade II*, more than any other English city apart from London.[370] Liverpool has an extensive transport infrastructure that connects the city with its metropolitan area, the rest of the United Kingdom, Europe and the world. Various modes of transport provide considerable connections by road, rail, air and sea. The local network of buses, trains and ferries is managed by Merseytravel on behalf of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and the Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region. The Mayor and Combined Authority have control of a devolved transport budget and associated transport powers for this local system. The city's major port and international airport provide global links for both passengers and freight.[371][372] The city sits at the centre of a much larger metropolitan area. The city's suburbs run contiguously into the neighbouring boroughs defined by the ONS as the Liverpool Built-up Area. The wider City Region and Merseyside in general is densely urbanised and divided by several motorways and major roads. The city is served by a network motorways. The three motorways in closest proximity are the M58 to the north, and M62 and M57 to the east. To the north, the M58 motorway runs 12 miles and provides links to the neighbouring counties of Lancashire and Greater Manchester, finally joining with the M6 west of Wigan.[373] To the east, the M62 runs across the north of the UK, ultimately connecting Liverpool with Hull on the opposite coast, and along the route to several large cities including Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. The M62 also provides a connection to both the M6 and M1 motorways, providing indirect links to more distant areas including Birmingham, London, Nottingham, Preston and Sheffield.[374][375] To the east, but running north-south, the M57 acts as a 10-mile ring road for the city itself and links the M62 and M58 motorways, as well as the A580 East Lancashire Road providing a link directly to the A5300 that links to the bridges that cross the Mersey to the south of the city.[376] To the south, Liverpool is connected to Widnes and Warrington via the A562 and A5300 and across the River Mersey to Runcorn in Cheshire, via the Silver Jubilee and Mersey Gateway bridges. The M56 motorway then provides routes into parts of the neighbouring counties, with connections to the Wirral and North Wales, and a direct route to Manchester Airport.[377] The Kingsway and Queensway Tunnels connect Liverpool with the settlements on the Wirral Peninsula across the Mersey to the west, including Birkenhead, and Wallasey. The A41 road and M53 motorway, which both begin in Birkenhead, link to Cheshire and Shropshire and via the A55, to North Wales.[378] Liverpool is served by two separate rail networks. The local rail network is managed and run by Merseyrail and provides links throughout the Liverpool city region and beyond (see Local travel below). The national network, which is managed by Network Rail, provides Liverpool with connections to major towns and cities across England. The city's primary main line station is Lime Street station, which is the terminus for several lines into the city. The station is served by a number of different train operating companies including Avanti West Coast, East Midlands Railway, London North Eastern Railway, Northern Rail, TransPennine Express and West Midlands Trains.[380][381] Between them, the station is connected with direct train services to numerous destinations including London (in 2 hours 8 minutes with Pendolino trains), Birmingham, Glasgow, Hull, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Norwich, Nottingham, Preston, Scarborough, Sheffield and York.[382][383][384][385] Opened in 1836, Lime Street station is the world's oldest mainline terminus station still in use.[386] In the south of the city, Liverpool South Parkway provides a connection to the city's airport. The Port of Liverpool connects passengers and freight to Liverpool from all around the world. Passenger ferry services depart from the city across the Irish Sea to Belfast and the Isle of Man. Services are provided by several companies, including the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, P&O Ferries and Stena Line. The Liverpool Cruise Terminal handles over 200,000 passengers and crew annually and is located alongside the Pier Head in the city centre. Berthing facilities for long-distance passenger cruises are provided and served by a large number of different cruise lines. Ports in Australia, France, Faroe Islands, Iceland, North America, Norway, Spain and the Caribbean are served by the facility.[387][388][389] The cruise lines that call at Liverpool cruise terminal include the following: As of 2022[update], the Port of Liverpool is the fourth busiest port in the UK by freight tonnage, handling 33 million tonnes of freight cargo.[409] It is the main port in the country for transatlantic trade and the largest port on the west coast of the UK. The Royal Seaforth and Liverpool2 container terminals are the port's two main terminals and handle a wide variety of cargo including containers, liquid and dry bulk cargoes such as coal and grain, biomass and roll-on/roll-off cargoes such as cars and trucks.[410][411][412][413][414][415] Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs into Liverpool city centre via Liverpool Canal Link at Pier Head since 2009.[416] Liverpool John Lennon Airport, which is located in the south of the city, provides Liverpool with direct air connections across the United Kingdom and Europe. It offers direct services to over 60 airports worldwide and to over 100 destinations via one-stop connections in Frankfurt, Dublin and Reykjavík. The airport is primarily served by low-cost airlines namely Aer Lingus, easyJet, Jet2.com, Loganair, Lufthansa, Play, Ryanair, Widerøe and Wizz Air, although it does provide facilities for private aircraft.[417][418][419][420][421] Liverpool's urban railway network, known as Merseyrail, is one of the busiest and most extensive in the country. The network provides approximately 30 million passenger journeys per year, across a system of 69 stations throughout Liverpool's metropolitan area, within the formal boundaries of the Liverpool city region and adjacent areas of Cheshire and Lancashire.[422][423][424][425] The network consists of three lines: the Northern Line, which runs to Southport, Ormskirk, Headbolt Lane and Hunts Cross; the Wirral Line, which runs through the Mersey Railway Tunnel and has branches to New Brighton, West Kirby, Chester and Ellesmere Port; and the City Line, which begins at Lime Street, providing links to St Helens, Wigan, Preston, Warrington and Manchester.[426][427] The network is predominantly electric and covers 75 miles (120 kilometres) of track.[428][429] Trains are owned and operated by the Merseyrail franchise and managed by Merseytravel under the direction of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. Local services on the City Line are operated by Northern rather than Merseyrail, although the line itself remains part of the Merseyrail network. Within Liverpool city centre, four stations and over 6+1⁄2 miles (10.5 kilometres) of tunnels are underground.[428] Hamilton Square and Liverpool James Street are the oldest deep level underground stations in the world.[430] In 2023, for the first time in UK history, battery-powered passenger trains launched on Merseyrail tracks from the newly opened Headbolt Lane station in Kirkby. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority's long term \"Merseyrail for All\" plan is to reduce dependency on live third rail and promote battery power in order to further expand Merseyrail to previously inaccessible places across the city region and as far as Manchester, Wrexham, Warrington and Preston.[431][432] Local bus services within and around Liverpool are managed by Merseytravel[433] and are run by several different companies, including Arriva and Stagecoach. The two principal termini for local buses are Queen Square bus station (located near Lime Street railway station) for services north and east of the city, and Liverpool One bus station (located near the Royal Albert Dock) for services to the south and east.[434] Cross-river services to the Wirral use roadside terminus points in Castle Street and Sir Thomas Street. A night bus service also operates on Saturdays providing services from the city centre across Liverpool and wider region.[435] Tour bus services are provided by Maghull Coaches which allow tourists to hop-on-hop-off and view historical landmarks and attractions, as well as Liverpool F.C. and Beatles related locations.[436][437] National Express services operate from the Liverpool One bus station to and from destinations across the UK.[438] In 2023, the Liverpool city region confirmed plans to become the second place outside London to implement bus franchising. Local leaders have argued that it will improve services by transferring control over fares, ticketing and routes from bus companies to the Combined Authority. The full implementation of bus franchising will take place by the end of 2028.[439][440] The cross-river ferry service in Liverpool, known as the Mersey Ferry, is managed and operated by Merseytravel, with services operating between the Pier Head in Liverpool city centre and both Woodside in Birkenhead and Seacombe in Wallasey. Services operate at intervals ranging from 20 minutes, at peak times, to every hour during the middle of the day and at weekends.[441] Despite remaining an important transport link between the city and the Wirral Peninsula, the Mersey Ferry has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction within the city, with daytime River Explorer Cruises providing passengers with an historical overview of the River Mersey and surrounding areas.[442] A scooter-sharing system and electric bicycle scheme operates throughout Liverpool which allows residents and visitors to move around the city on rented scooters and bicycles. The scheme is operated by Swedish technology company Voi, and riders are able to pick up and drop off bikes and scooters at various locations around the city.[443][444][445] National Cycle Route 56, National Cycle Route 62 and National Cycle Route 810 run through Liverpool. As with other large cities, Liverpool is an important cultural centre within the United Kingdom, incorporating music, performing arts, museums and art galleries, literature and nightlife among others. In 2008, the cultural heritage of the city was celebrated with the city holding the title of European Capital of Culture, during which time a wide range of cultural celebrations took place in the city, including Go Superlambananas! and La Princesse. Liverpool has also held Europe's largest music and poetry event, the Welsh national Eisteddfod, three times, despite being in England, in 1884, 1900, and 1929. Liverpool is internationally known for music and is recognised by Guinness World Records as the \"World Capital City of Pop\".[447] Musicians from the city have produced 58 No. 1 singles, more than any other city in the world.[448] Both the most successful male band and girl group in global music history have contained Liverpudlian members. Liverpool is most famous as the birthplace of the Beatles and during the 1960s was at the forefront of the Beat Music movement, which would eventually lead to the British Invasion. Many notable musicians of the time originated in the city including Billy J. Kramer, Cilla Black, Gerry and the Pacemakers and The Searchers. The influence of musicians from Liverpool, coupled with other cultural exploits of the time, such as the Liverpool poets, prompted American poet Allen Ginsberg to proclaim that the city was \"the centre of consciousness of the human universe\".[449] Other musicians from Liverpool include Billy Fury, A Flock of Seagulls, Echo & the Bunnymen, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Frankie Vaughan, Anathema, Ladytron, The Zutons, Cast, Atomic Kitten and Rebecca Ferguson. The La's 1990 hit single \"There She Goes\" was described by Rolling Stone as a \"founding piece of Britpop's foundation.\"[450] The city is also home to the oldest surviving professional symphony orchestra in the UK, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, which is based in the Philharmonic Hall.[451] The chief conductor of the orchestra is Vasily Petrenko.[452] Sir Edward Elgar dedicated his Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 to the Liverpool Orchestral Society, and the piece had its first performance in the city in 1901.[453] Among Liverpool's curiosities, the Austrian émigré Fritz Spiegl is notable. He not only became a world expert on the etymology of Scouse, but composed the music to Z-cars and the Radio 4 UK Theme. Well established festivals in the city include Africa Oyé and Brazilica which are the UK's largest free African and Brazilian music festivals respectively.[454][455] The dance music festival Creamfields was established by the Liverpool-based Cream clubbing brand which started life as a weekly event at Nation nightclub. There are numerous music venues located across the city, however, the Liverpool Arena is by far the largest. Opened in 2008, the 11,000-seat arena hosted the MTV Europe Music Awards the same year, and since then has played host to world-renowned acts such as Andrea Bocelli, Beyoncé, Elton John, Kanye West, Kasabian, The Killers, Lady Gaga, Oasis, Pink, Rihanna, and UB40. On 7 October 2022, the [[publisherBBCrporation and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) announced that Liverpool would host the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 on behalf of the previous year's winning country Ukraine, which was unable to meet the demands of hosting the event due to security concerns caused by the Russian invasion of the country. The contest was held at Liverpool Arena, and consisted of two semi-finals on 9 and 11 May and a final on 13 May 2023. This was the first time that the contest took place in the city, and was also a record-extending ninth time that the UK has hosted the contest, having last done so in Birmingham in 1998.[456] Liverpool has more galleries and national museums than any other city in the United Kingdom apart from London.[11] National Museums Liverpool is the only English national collection based wholly outside London.[457] The Tate Liverpool gallery houses the modern art collection of the Tate in the North of England and was, until the opening of Tate Modern, the largest exhibition space dedicated to modern art in the United Kingdom. The FACT centre hosts touring multimedia exhibitions, while the Walker Art Gallery houses one of the most impressive permanent collections of Pre-Raphaelite art in the world.[458] Sudley House contains another major collection of pre-20th-century art.[459] Liverpool University's Victoria Building was re-opened as a public art gallery and museum to display the university's artwork and historical collections which include the largest display of art by Audubon outside the US.[460] A number of artists have also come from the city, including painter George Stubbs who was born in Liverpool in 1724. The Liverpool Biennial festival of arts runs from mid-September to late November and comprises three main sections; the International, The Independents and New Contemporaries although fringe events are timed to coincide.[461] It was during the 2004 festival that Yoko Ono's work \"My mummy was beautiful\" invited controversy when photographs of a woman's breast and crotch were exhibited on the main shopping street.[462] Felicia Hemans (née Browne) was born in Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1793, although she later moved to Flintshire, in Wales. Felicia was born in Liverpool, a granddaughter of the Venetian consul in that city. Her father's business soon brought the family to Denbighshire in North Wales, where she spent her youth. They made their home near Abergele and St. Asaph (Flintshire), and it is clear that she came to regard herself as Welsh by adoption, later referring to Wales as \"Land of my childhood, my home and my dead\". Her first poems, dedicated to the Prince of Wales, were published in Liverpool in 1808, when she was only fourteen, arousing the interest of Percy Bysshe Shelley, who briefly corresponded with her. [463] An engraving of a painting of The Wishing Gate. by S. F. Serres was published in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834 with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon to which she adds the note 'I believe that to this haunted gate, a common superstition is attached, namely, that to wish, and to have that wish fulfilled, is the result of such wish being uttered while passing'. It stood on the North Shore before the docks were built and was a place where farewells could be waved to departing voyagers.[464] A number of notable authors have visited Liverpool, including Daniel Defoe, Washington Irving, Charles Dickens, Thomas De Quincey, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Hugh Walpole. Defoe, after visiting the city, described it, as \"one of the wonders of Britain in his 'Tour through England and Wales'\".[465] Melville's novel Redburn deals with the first seagoing voyage of 19 years old Wellingborough Redburn between New York and Liverpool in 1839. Largely autobiographical, the middle sections of the book are set in Liverpool and describe the young merchantman's wanderings, and his reflections.[463] From 1842 to 1869, Dickens visited the city to give public readings of his novels.[466] Hawthorne was stationed in Liverpool as United States consul between 1853 and 1856.[467] Hopkins served as priest at St Francis Xavier Church, Langdale St., Liverpool, between 1879 and 81.[468] Although he is not known to have ever visited Liverpool, Jung famously had a vivid dream of the city which he analysed in one of his works.[469] Her Benny, a novel telling the tragic story of Liverpool street urchins in the 1870s, written by Methodist preacher Silas K. Hocking, was a best-seller and the first book to sell a million copies in the author's lifetime.[470] The prolific writer of adventure novels, Harold Edward Bindloss (1866–1945), was born in Liverpool. The writer, docker and political activist George Garrett was born in Seacombe, on the Wirral Peninsula in 1896 and was brought up in Liverpool's South end, around Park Road, the son of a fierce Liverpool–Irish Catholic mother and a staunch 'Orange' stevedore father. In the 1920s and 1930s, his organisation within the Seamen's Vigilance Committees, unemployed demonstrations, and hunger marches from Liverpool became part of a wider cultural force. He spoke at reconciliation meetings in sectarian Liverpool, and helped found the Unity Theatre in the 1930s as part of the Popular Front against the rise of fascism, particularly its echoes in the Spanish Civil War. Garrett died in 1966.[471] The novelist and playwright James Hanley (1897–1985) was born in Kirkdale, Liverpool, in 1897 (not Dublin, nor 1901 as he generally implied) to a working-class family.[472] Hanley grew up close to the docks and much of his early writing is about seamen. The Furys (1935) is first in a sequence of five loosely autobiographical novels about working-class life in Liverpool. James Hanley's brother, novelist Gerald Hanley (1916–92) was also born in Liverpool (not County Cork, Ireland, as he claimed).[473] While he published a number of novels he also wrote radio plays for the BBC as well as some film scripts, most notably The Blue Max (1966).[474] He was also one of several scriptwriters for a life of Gandhi (1964).[475] Novelist Beryl Bainbridge (1932–2010) was born in Liverpool and raised in nearby Formby. She was primarily known for her works of psychological fiction, often set among the English working classes. Bainbridge won the Whitbread Awards prize for best novel in 1977 and 1996 and was nominated five times for the Booker Prize. The Times newspaper named Bainbridge among their list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".[476] J. G. Farrell was born in Liverpool in 1935 but left at the outbreak of war in 1939.[477] A novelist of Irish descent, Farrell gained prominence for his historical fiction, most notably his Empire Trilogy (Troubles, The Siege of Krishnapur and The Singapore Grip), dealing with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. However, his career ended when he drowned in Ireland in 1979 at the age of 44. Helen Forrester was the pen name of June Bhatia (née Huband) (1919–2011),[478][479] who was known for her books about her early childhood in Liverpool during the Great Depression, including Twopence to Cross the Mersey (1974), as well as several works of fiction. During the late 1960s the city became well known for the Liverpool poets, who include Roger McGough and the late Adrian Henri. An anthology of poems, The Mersey Sound, written by Henri, McGough and Brian Patten, has sold well since it was first being published in 1967. Liverpool has produced several noted writers of horror fiction, often set on Merseyside – Ramsey Campbell, Clive Barker and Peter Atkins among them. A collection of Liverpudlian horror fiction, Spook City was edited by a Liverpool expatriate, Angus Mackenzie, and introduced by Doug Bradley, also from Liverpool.[480] Bradley is famed for portraying Barker's creation Pinhead in the Hellraiser series of films. Liverpool also has a long history of performing arts, reflected in several annual theatre festivals such as the Liverpool Shakespeare Festival, which takes place inside Liverpool Cathedral and in the adjacent historic St James' Gardens every summer; the Everyword Festival of new theatre writing, the only one of its kind in the country;[481] Physical Fest, an international festival of physical theatre;[482] the annual festivals organised by Liverpool John Moores University's drama department and the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts; and other festivals by the large number of theatres in the city, such as the Empire, Everyman,[483][484] Playhouse,[485][486] Royal Court, and Unity theatres. Notable actors and actresses from Liverpool include Arthur Askey, Tom Baker, Kim Cattrall, Jodie Comer, Stephen Graham, Rex Harrison, Jason Isaacs, Tina Malone, the McGann brothers (Joe, Mark, Paul, and Stephen), David Morrissey, Elizabeth Morton, Peter Serafinowicz, Elisabeth Sladen, Alison Steadman, and Rita Tushingham. Actors and actresses from elsewhere in the world have strong ties to the city, such as Canadian actor Mike Myers (whose parents were both from Liverpool) and American actress Halle Berry (whose mother was from Liverpool). Liverpool has a thriving and varied nightlife. The majority of the city's late-night restaurants, bars, pubs, nightclubs, music venues and comedy clubs are located in a number of distinct districts. In 2023, figures from global data company Square show that night-time spending in bars and restaurants in Liverpool city centre outperformed all major UK cities, including London.[487] Figures by the Liverpool BID Company suggest that the busiest nights of the week in Liverpool city centre are Friday and Saturday. Using cameras to track the flow of people in key locations between 7 pm and 4 am, at least 1.5 million people pass through the city centre every Friday night and almost 2 million people on Saturday nights. The data demonstrates that Monday night is the quietest night of the week in the city centre and footfall then increases every single night to reach its peak on Saturday nights. 125,889 people worked in the city's night time economy as of 2022, according to the Liverpool BID Company.[488][489][490] Liverpool's nightlife is concentrated in a number of districts including Ropewalks which comprises Concert Square, St. Peter's Square and the adjoining Seel Street and Duke Street. Other popular areas include Hardman Street, the Cavern Quarter, Baltic Triangle, Royal Albert Dock and the city's Pride Quarter, which is home to a large number of LGBT venues.[491][492] In the city's suburbs, Lark Lane in Aigburth is noted for an abundance of bars and late-night venues.[493][494] In Liverpool primary and secondary education is available in various forms supported by the state including secular, Church of England, Jewish, and Roman Catholic. Islamic education is available at primary level, but there is no secondary provision. One of Liverpool's important early schools was The Liverpool Blue Coat School; founded in 1708 as a charitable school. It is now a state grammar school. The Liverpool Blue Coat School is the top-performing school in the city with 100% 5 or more A*-C grades at GCSE resulting in the 30th best GCSE results in the country and an average point score per student of 1087.4 in A/AS levels.[495] Other notable schools include Liverpool College founded in 1840 Merchant Taylors' School founded in 1620.[496] Another of Liverpool's notable senior schools is St. Edward's College situated in the West Derby area of the city. Historic grammar schools, such as the Liverpool Institute High School and Liverpool Collegiate School—both closed in the 1980s—are still remembered as centres of academic excellence. Bellerive Catholic College is the city's top-performing non-selective school, based upon GCSE results in 2007. Liverpool has three universities: the University of Liverpool, Liverpool John Moores University and Liverpool Hope University. Edge Hill University, founded as a teacher-training college in the Edge Hill district of Liverpool, is now located in Ormskirk in South-West Lancashire. Liverpool is also home to the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA). The University of Liverpool was established in 1881 as University College Liverpool. In 1884, it became part of the federal Victoria University. Following a Royal Charter and Act of Parliament in 1903, it became an independent university, the University of Liverpool, with the right to confer its own degrees. It was the first university to offer degrees in biochemistry, architecture, civic design, veterinary science, oceanography and social science. Liverpool Hope University, which was formed through the merger of three colleges, the earliest of which was founded in 1844, gained university status in 2005. It is the only ecumenical university in Europe.[497] It is situated on both sides of Taggart Avenue in Childwall and has a second campus in the city centre (the Cornerstone). The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, founded to address some of the problems created by trade, continues today as a post-graduate school affiliated with the University of Liverpool and houses an anti-venom repository. Liverpool John Moores University was previously a polytechnic, and gained status in 1992. It is named in honour of Sir John Moores, one of the founders of the Littlewoods football pools and retail group, who was a major benefactor. The institution was previously owned and run by Liverpool City Council. It traces it lineage to the Liverpool Mechanics' institute, opened in 1823, making it by this measure England's third-oldest university. The city has one further education college, City of Liverpool College in the city centre. Liverpool City Council operates Burton Manor, a residential adult education college in nearby Burton, on the Wirral Peninsula. There are two Jewish schools in Liverpool, both belonging to the King David Foundation. King David School, Liverpool, is the High School and the King David Primary School. There is also a King David Kindergarten, featured in the community centre of Harold House. These schools are all run by the King David Foundation located in Harold House in Childwall; conveniently next door to the Childwall Synagogue. Liverpool is one of the most successful footballing cities in England, and is home to two top flight Premier League teams. Everton F.C. was founded in 1878 and was one of the twelve founder members of the Football League. It plays at Goodison Park. Liverpool F.C. were founded in 1892 and play at Anfield. Between them, the clubs have won 28 English First Division titles, 12 FA Cup titles, 10 League Cup titles, 6 European Cup titles, 1 FIFA Club World Cup title, 1 European Cup Winners' Cup title, 3 UEFA Cup titles, and 24 FA Charity Shields. The two clubs contest the Merseyside derby, dubbed the 'friendly derby'. Despite the name the fixture is known for its keen rivalry, having seen more sending-offs in this fixture than any other. Unlike many other derbies it is not rare for families in the city to contain supporters of both clubs.[498] Liverpool F.C. is the English and British club with the most European Cup titles with six, the latest in 2019. Liverpool has played at Anfield since 1892, when the club was formed to occupy the stadium following Everton's departure due to a dispute with their landlord. Liverpool are still playing there 125 years later, although the ground has been completely rebuilt since the 1970s. The Spion Kop (rebuilt as an all-seater stand in 1994–95) was the most famous part of the ground, gaining cult status across the world due to the songs and celebrations of the many fans who packed onto its terraces. Anfield as capacity for 54,000 spectators in comfort and is a distinctive landmark in an area filled with smaller and older buildings. Liverpool club also has a multimillion-pound youth training facility called The Academy. After leaving Anfield in 1892, Everton moved to Goodison Park on the opposite side of Stanley Park. The ground was opened on 24 August 1892, by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the FA but the first crowds to attend the ground saw a short athletics meeting followed by a selection of music and a fireworks display. Everton's first game there was on 2 September 1892 when they beat Bolton 4–2. It was one of the host venues during the 1966 FIFA World Cup. It now has the capacity for just under 40,000 spectators all-seated, but the last expansion took place in 1994 when a new Park End Stand gave the stadium an all-seater capacity. The Goodison Road Stand dates back to the 1970s, while the Gwladys Street Stand and Bullens Road Stand are refurbished pre-Second World War structures. Everton is currently in the process of relocating, with a stadium move first mooted as early as 1996.[499] In 2003, the club were forced to abandon plans for a 55,000-seat stadium at King's Dock due to financial constraints,[500] with further proposed moves to Kirkby (comprising part of Destination Kirkby, moving the stadium just beyond Liverpool's council boundary into Kirkby) and Walton Hall Park similarly scrapped. The club will relocate to the multimillion-pound Everton Stadium designed by the American architect Dan Meis at the nearby Bramley-Moore Dock on the River Mersey waterfront during the 2024/25 season, with ground broken on the project in August 2021.[501] The new stadium will have a capacity of 52,888 which could be expanded to 62,000 demand permitting and it will be a host venue for the UEFA Euro 2028. Everton also have a multimillion-pound training facility based at Finch Farm. The Everton Women's Team play in the Women's Super League at the Walton Hall Park Stadium. Boxing is massively popular in Liverpool. The city has a proud heritage and history in the sport and is home to around 22 amateur boxing clubs, which are responsible for producing many successful boxers, such as Nel Tarleton, Alan Rudkin, John Conteh, Andy Holligan, Liam Smith, Paul Hodkinson, Tony Bellew and Robin Ried. The city also boasts a consistently strong amateur contingent which is highlighted by Liverpool being the most represented city on the GB Boxing team, as well as at the 2012 London Olympics, the most notable Liverpool amateur fighters include; Jimmy Lloyd, George Turpin, Tony Willis, Robin Reid and David Price who have all medalled at the Olympic Games. Boxing events are usually hosted at the Echo Arena and Liverpool Olympia within the city, although the former home of Liverpool boxing was the renowned Liverpool Stadium. Aintree Racecourse in the adjacent Metropolitan Borough of Sefton is home to the world's most famous steeple-chase, the Randox Grand National which takes place annually in early April. The race meeting attracts horse owners/ jockeys from around the world to compete in the demanding 4-mile (6.5-kilometre) and 30-fence course. There have been many memorable moments of the Grand National, for instance, the 100/1 outsider Foinavon in 1967, the dominant Red Rum and Ginger McCain of the 1970s and Mon Mome (100/1) who won the 2009 meeting. In 2010, the National became the first horse race to be televised in high-definition in the UK. The Royal Liverpool Golf Club, situated in the nearby town of Hoylake on the Wirral Peninsula, has hosted The Open Championship on a number of occasions, most recently in 2023. It also hosted the Walker Cup in 1983. Liverpool once contained four greyhound tracks, Seaforth Greyhound Stadium (1933–1965), Breck Park Stadium (1927–1948), Stanley Greyhound Stadium (1927–1961) and White City Stadium (1932–1973). Breck Park also hosted boxing bouts and both Stanley and Seaforth hosted Motorcycle speedway. Wavertree Sports Park is home to the Liverpool Harriers athletics club, which has produced such athletes as Curtis Robb, Allyn Condon (the only British athlete to compete at both the Summer and Winter Olympics), and Katarina Johnson-Thompson; Great Britain was represented by Johnson-Thompson at the 2012 London Olympics in the women's heptathlon, and she would go on to win the gold medal at the 2019 World Championships, giving Liverpool its first gold medal and breaking the British record in the process. In August 2012, Liverpool gymnast Beth Tweddle won an Olympic bronze medal in London 2012 in the uneven bars at her third Olympic Games, thus becoming the most decorated British gymnast in history. Park Road Gymnastics Centre provides training to a high level. Liverpool has produced several swimmers who have represented their nation at major championships such as the Olympic Games. The most notable of which is Steve Parry who claimed a bronze medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics in the 200m butterfly. Others include Herbert Nickel Haresnape, Margaret Kelly, Shellagh Ratcliffe and Austin Rawlinson. There is a purpose-built aquatics centre at Wavertree Sports Park, which opened in 2008.

The city is the hub of the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition, an ECB Premier League.[502] Sefton Park and Liverpool are the league's founder members based in the city with Wavertree, Alder and Old Xaverians clubs having joined the league more recently.[503] Liverpool plays host Lancashire County Cricket Club as an outground most seasons, including six of eight home County Championship games during Lancashire's 2011[504] title winning campaign[505] while Old Trafford was refurbished.[506][507] Since 2014 Liverpool Cricket Club has played host[508] to the annual Tradition-ICAP Liverpool International tennis tournament, which has seen tennis stars such as Novak Djokovic, David Ferrer, Mardy Fish, Laura Robson and Caroline Wozniacki. Previously this had been held at Calderstones Park, situated in Allerton in the south of the city. Liverpool Tennis Development Programme at Wavertree Tennis Centre is one of the largest in the UK. Professional basketball came to the city in 2007 with the entry of Everton Tigers, later known as Mersey Tigers, into the elite British Basketball League. The club was originally associated with Everton F.C., and was part of the Toxteth Tigers youth development programme, which reached over 1,500 young people every year.[509] The Tigers began to play in Britain's top league for the 2007–08 season, playing at the Greenbank Sports Academy before moving into the newly completed Echo Arena during that season. After the 2009–10 season, Everton F.C. withdrew funding from the Tigers, who then changed their name to Mersey Tigers. The club were expelled from the British Basketball League in 2013 due to financial problems.[510] Liverpool is one of three cities which still host the traditional sport of British baseball and it hosts the annual England-Wales international match every two years, alternating with Cardiff and Newport. Liverpool Trojans are the oldest existing baseball club in the UK. The 2014 Tour of Britain cycle race began in Liverpool on 7 September, using a city centre circuit to complete 130 km (80.8 mi) of racing.[511] The Tour of Britain took nine stages and finished in London on 14 September. A 2016 study of UK fitness centres found that, of the top 20 UK urban areas, Liverpool had the highest number of leisure and sports centres per capita, with 4.3 centres per 100,000 of the city population.[512] The city has one daily newspaper: the Echo, published by Reach plc. The Liverpool Daily Post was also published until 2013.

                "title": "Scouse - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Scouse (/skaʊs/ skowss), more formally known as Liverpool English[2] or Merseyside English,[3][4][5] is an accent and dialect of English associated with the city of Liverpool and the surrounding Liverpool City Region. The Scouse accent is highly distinctive as it was influenced heavily by Irish and Welsh immigrants who arrived via the Liverpool docks, as well as Scandinavian sailors who also used the docks,[6] and thus has very little in common with the accents found throughout the rest of England.[7] People from Liverpool are known as Liverpudlians, but are usually called Scousers; the name comes from scouse, a stew originating from Scandinavian lobscouse eaten by sailors and locals.[8][9][10][11] The development of Liverpool since the 1950s has spread the accent into nearby areas such as the towns of Runcorn and Skelmersdale.[12] Variations within Scouse have been noted: the accent of Liverpool's city centre and northern neighbourhoods is usually described as fast, harsh, and nasal,[13] while the \"Beatles-like\" accent found in the southern suburbs of Liverpool is typically referred to as slow, soft, and dark.[14] Popular colloquialisms have shown a growing deviation from the historical Lancashire dialect that was previously found in Liverpool,[12] as well as a growth in the influence of the accent in the wider area.[7][15][16][17][18] Scouse is often considered by other Britons to be one of the country's least popular accents due to its difficulty, but it conversely also performs very well in polls of British accents that people perceive as happy and friendly.[19] The word scouse is a shortened form of lobscouse, the origin of which is uncertain.[20] It is related to the Norwegian lapskaus, Swedish lapskojs, and Danish labskovs (skipperlabskovs), as well as the Low German labskaus and refers to a stew of the same name commonly eaten by sailors. In the 19th century, poorer people in Liverpool, Birkenhead, Bootle and Wallasey commonly ate scouse as it was a cheap dish and familiar to the families of seafarers. Outsiders tended to call these people \"scousers\".[21] In The Lancashire Dictionary of Dialect, Tradition and Folklore, Alan Crosby suggested that the word only became known nationwide with the popularity of the BBC sitcom Till Death Us Do Part (1965–1975), which featured a Liverpudlian socialist and a Cockney conservative in a regular argument.[10] Originally a small fishing village, Liverpool developed as a port. After the 1700s, it developed into a major international trading and industrial centre. The city consequently became a melting pot of several accents and dialects as sailors and traders from different areas (specifically Wales and Ireland) established themselves in the area. Until the mid-19th century, the dominant local accent was similar to that of neighbouring areas of Lancashire. For instance, the comedian and actor Robb Wilton (1881–1957), despite coming from the Everton district of Liverpool, spoke with a dry Lancashire accent rather than a Scouse accent.[22][better source needed] The influence of immigrants from Ireland (especially Dublin) and Northern Wales, as well as visiting Scandinavian sailors, contributed to a distinctive local Liverpool accent.[23][24] The first reference to a distinctive Liverpool accent was in 1890. Linguist Gerald Knowles suggested that the accent's nasal quality may have derived from poor public health in the 19th century, by which the prevalence of colds among many people over a long time resulted in a nasal accent coming to be regarded as the norm and copied by newer incomers learning the dialect of the local area.[25] Scousers tend to speak at a higher pitch than most other English speakers, sometimes approaching falsetto. The Victorian phonetician Alexander John Ellis said that Liverpool and Birkenhead \"had no dialect proper\", as he conceived of dialects as speech that had been passed down through generations from the earliest English speakers. Ellis did research some locations on the Wirral, but these respondents spoke in the traditional Cheshire dialect at the time and not in Scouse.[26] The 1950s Survey of English Dialects recorded traditional Lancastrian dialect from the town of Halewood, finding no trace of Scouse influence. The phonetician John C. Wells wrote that \"the Scouse accent might as well not exist\" in The Linguistic Atlas of England, which was the Survey's principal output.[27] An academic study of Scouse was undertaken by Gerald Knowles at the University of Leeds in 1973. He identified a key problem: that traditional dialect research had focused on developments from a single proto-language, but Scouse (and many other urban dialects) had resulted from interactions between an unknown number of languages.[28] The phonemic notation used in this article is based on the set of symbols used by Watson (2007). Scouse is highly distinguishable from other English dialects. Because of this international recognition, Keith Szlamp made a request to IANA on 16 September 1996 to make it a recognised Internet dialect.[47] After citing a number of references,[48][49][50][51][11] the application was accepted on 25 May 2000 and now allows Internet documents that use the dialect to be categorised as Scouse by using the language tag \"en-Scouse\". Scouse has also become well-known globally as the accent of the Beatles.[52] While the members of the band are famously from Liverpool,[53] their accents have more in common with the older Lancashire-like Liverpool dialect found in the southern suburbs; the accent has evolved into Scouse since the 1960s. Other northern English dialects include:",

Liverpool, a city and seaport in northwestern England, forms an irregular crescent along the north shore of the Mersey estuary a few miles from the Irish Sea. It is the nucleus of the metropolitan county of Merseyside in the historic county of Lancashire. The location that became the city of Liverpool was granted a charter for a planned new town by King John of England in 1207. In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first in England to link two major cities, was opened. A rail network providing easy and cheap access to all major British industrial centers was soon created. All four of the Beatles—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr—were born and started their musical careers in Liverpool. Liverpool, city and seaport, northwestern England, forming the nucleus of the metropolitan county of Merseyside in the historic county of Lancashire. The city proper, which is a metropolitan borough of Merseyside, forms an irregular crescent along the north shore of the Mersey estuary a few miles from the Irish Sea. The first significant date in the history of Liverpool is 1207, when King John of England granted a charter for a planned new town there. The town’s medieval growth was slow, but in the 18th century it expanded rapidly as a result of profitable trade with the Americas and the West Indies and became the second most important port in Britain. A major element in the general trading pattern was the Liverpool Triangle—the exchange of manufactured goods from the Mersey hinterland for slaves in West Africa who were in turn traded for sugar, molasses, spices, and other plantation crops in the West Indies. The first dock in Liverpool was built in 1715. By the end of the century, four other docks had been established along the Mersey, so that the port outranked even London in dock space. In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first in England to link two major cities, was opened. A rail network providing easy and cheap access to all major British industrial centres was soon created, and steam ferry links between Liverpool and the Wirral, across the Mersey estuary, were established. This growth was accompanied by high levels of immigration from surrounding areas and from Ireland, especially during and after the Irish Potato Famine (1845–49). By the beginning of the 20th century, Liverpool had become the centre of 7 miles (11 km) of docks extending along the Mersey from Hornby (1884) in the north to Herculaneum (1866) in the south. Additional improvements were made to the docks, but after World War II Liverpool declined as an exporting and passenger port. That change can be attributed mainly to the decreasing significance, in the economic life of Britain, of Liverpool’s industrial hinterland and its traditional trade with the United States and West Africa. Low capital investment and unemployment in the docks intensified the situation. Liverpool continues to exert a great degree of dominance over the surrounding metropolitan region. Although the traditional activities of transport, communication, distribution, and shipping have declined, they are still important in the economic life of the city. The port, in addition to handling general cargo, has developed as a major facility for containerized shipping, and in 2012 it became a terminus for cruise ships. The docklands and several areas of the historic centre of the city collectively were named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004. However, that designation was rescinded in 2021 because of developments that have caused “the irreversible loss of attributes.” Paramount among Liverpool’s important contributions to 20th-century popular culture were the Beatles, who emerged from the Cavern (a nightclub that was part of the city’s musical scene in the 1960s) to become the world’s best-known rock group. Local “performance” poets such as Roger McGough, Adrian Henri, and Brian Patten helped popularize poetry in the 1960s. And from the heyday of the music hall to the radio comedy of Tommy Handley in the 1940s, Liverpudlians contributed to the British comedy tradition. Tourism has grown in importance and includes a rise in interest for visiting locations associated with the Beatles. Architectural landmarks include the 18th-century Town Hall and the 19th-century St. George’s Hall; the Neo-Gothic Anglican cathedral, founded in 1904 and completed in 1978; and the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral (1967), of strikingly modern design. Tate Liverpool (a branch of the national Tate galleries), Merseyside County Museum and Library, the Walker Art Gallery, the Picton Library, the International Slave Museum, and the University of Liverpool (chartered 1881) are among the many cultural institutions. Liverpool also has a well-known symphony orchestra, and the city is home to two world-class professional football (soccer) teams (Everton and Liverpool FC). Area 43 square miles (112 square km). Pop.

                "content": "Follow: Two US Navy pilots ejected safely after their fighter jet was shot down over the Red Sea on Saturday in an apparent friendly fire incident, US Central Command said in a statement. The pilots were recovered, and one of the crew members sustained minor injuries, according to initial assessments. The aircraft, an F/A-18, was operating from the USS Harry S. Truman when it was “mistakenly fired” upon by the USS Gettysburg, CENTCOM said. The USS Gettysburg, a Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser, is part of the Truman carrier strike group, which entered the waters of the Middle East one week ago. A full investigation is underway. CENTCOM stressed the incident was not the result of hostile fire. Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed in a statement Sunday that they shot down an F/A-18 aircraft over the Red Sea and targeted the USS Harry Truman aircraft carrier. The Houthis said their strikes were in response to American and British forces attacking their drones and missiles. The group has repeatedly made false claims of striking US warships operating in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The US has maintained a near-constant presence of major Navy warships in the region since the start of the war in Gaza, as the Houthis have targeted ships in the Red Sea, one of the world’s busiest waterways, calling the attacks a response to Israel’s war against Hamas. The apparent friendly fire incident comes the same day the US carried out airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, hitting a missile storage facility and a command-and-control facility in the capital of Sana’a. The US also shot down one-way attack drones and an anti-ship cruise missile, according to CENTCOM. The strikes on the Iran-backed rebel group involved the use of Navy F/A-18 fighter jets, as well as US Air Force assets, CENTCOM said. According to two US military officials, the downed fighter jet was not part of the strikes in Yemen. The Houthis, who control Yemen’s most populous regions, say they won’t stop striking Israel and its allies until a ceasefire is reached in Gaza. The F/A-18 incident also came the same day Houthi forces in Yemen said they fired a hypersonic ballistic missile at an Israeli military target in Tel Aviv’s Jaffa area. The missile fired from Yemen hit Tel Aviv overnight into Saturday, Israeli authorities said, in a rare instance of a failed interception over the city. More than a dozen people sustained minor injuries, according to emergency services, but no fatalities were reported. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

                "content": "Incident not the result of ‘hostile fire’, says US military, as Yemen’s Houthis claim their attack on US carrier brought the aircraft down. Two United States navy pilots have been shot down over the Red Sea in an apparent “friendly fire” incident, says the US military. Yemen’s Houthi fighters later on Sunday claimed they had “targeted” the aircraft carrier USS Harry S Truman a day earlier in an operation that led to “shooting down an F-18 aircraft”. The US Central Command (CENTCOM) said both pilots were recovered alive after ejecting from their aircraft, which was struck early on Sunday, with one suffering minor injuries. This incident “was not the result of hostile fire, and a full investigation is underway”, CENTCOM said, adding that the aircraft had just flown off the deck of Truman. The Houthis have repeatedly attacked Israel-linked ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, waterways vital to global trade. The group says its attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel has been waging a genocide for more than a year, killing more than 45,000 people. In a video statement, Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree said the group also launched eight drones and 17 cruise missiles in its attack. However, CENTCOM said warships and aircraft earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an antiship cruise missile launched by the Yemeni rebels. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday pledged to retaliate against Houthi rebels after they fired a missile at Tel Aviv, warning that Israel would target what he described as the last remaining arm of “Iran’s axis of evil”. The Houthis struck Israel’s commercial hub on Saturday with what they claimed was a ballistic missile, injuring 16 people and forcing many to leave their homes following the predawn attack. “As we acted with force against the terrorist arms of Iran’s axis of evil, so we will act against the Houthis… with force, determination and sophistication,” Netanyahu said in a video statement. Saturday’s strike on Tel Aviv was the second such attack on Israel by the Houthis this week, and one of several since the war in Gaza broke out. US and British forces have repeatedly struck rebel targets in Yemen in response to Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Israel has also previously struck the Houthis, including hitting ports and energy facilities, after rebel attacks against its territory. The latest Israeli attack against the Houthis was on Thursday, with Israeli warplanes striking Sanaa for the first time. Follow Al Jazeera English:",

                "title": "Game Observations: Eight Takeaways From the Patriots Competitive Loss to the Bills in Week 16",
                "content": "Staff Writer Orchard Park, N.Y. – The Patriots best first-half performance of the season sputtered out in a 24-21 loss to the Bills at Highmark Stadium in Buffalo on Sunday. In the opening two quarters, head coach Jerod Mayo's team emptied the clip. New England came out firing on a six-play, 44-yard opening touchdown drive. Defensively, they had answers for MVP favorite Josh Allen early on, forcing a punt on Buffalo's first possession that led to a surgical 16-play touchdown drive by the Patriots. With the Bills mafia stunned, New England had a 14-0 lead in the second quarter. As a massive underdog, the Pats were taking it to the Bills, out-gaining the heavy home favorites 127 to 11 yards in the first quarter. Following a week where the outside noise coming after the local football program grew to a roar, the Patriots responded with their best first half of the season. The offensive play-calling was on point, the defense punched back against a high-powered Bills offense, and we even got designed quarterback runs, QB sneaks, and a successful fake punt. The prevailing thought for those opening two quarters was, \"Who are these guys?\" However, reality set in when Buffalo marched down the field in nine plays to open the second half with a game-tying score. The Bills scored 24 straight points in a sloppy second half, particularly by the Patriot's offense, which turned the ball over twice, once in the high red zone and a backward pass recovered by Buffalo for a touchdown to give the Bills a 10-point cushion early in the fourth quarter – back-to-back Maye drop-backs ending in a turnover. Not ideal, to say the least. On the one hand, the urgency that the Patriots showed in what's always a hostile environment was refreshing. You can reasonably ask why they didn't coach with this much urgency sooner. Maybe they would have a few more wins. But my read is that this was Coach Mayo's way of saying, \"Hey, everyone, if we were to play a one-game playoff, this is what we would do.\" To that end, this was more like it from Mayo's staff. The other side of the coin is that the Patriots roster talent didn't allow them to sustain their hot start, which isn't surprising. The Pats offense went over 40 minutes without scoring to go along with two catastrophic turnovers. Plus, the run defense continued to give up chunks to the tune of 6.3 yards per rush for Buffalo, and Allen sprinkled just enough magic dust to lift his team to a win. These are all things we've seen before from this Patriots team this season, leading to their 12th loss of the year. New England deserves credit for playing the Bills much closer than most predicted. Many predicted a Buffalo blowout and the Pats held tough with the current kings of the AFC East. They deserve credit for that. However, they're still clearly undermanned to put it together for four quarters vs. a playoff-caliber opponent. Here are eight takeaways as the Patriots drop to 3-12 on the season with a loss to the Bills in Week 16. 1. SERVPRO Spotlight: QB Drake Maye Connects with WR Kayshon Boutte on 28-Yard TD The Patriots aggressive first-half approach began with their second opening drive touchdown of the season, where New England corrected a mistake it made the week prior in Arizona. Last week, WR Kayshon Boutte made headlines when he was critical of the offensive play-calling following a 30-17 loss to the Cardinals. The critique by the Pats second-year wideout was that New England didn't attack Arizona's man coverage to make the Cardinals pay, with the Cards playing man 50 percent of the time in the first quarter. \"We knew they was gonna play man the whole game. But I feel like it's disrespectful when they go man first quarter, you know? So I feel like we need to be better at attacking that instead of being shy about it,\" Boutte told reporters in the post-game locker room in Arizona. On Sunday, the Bills did the exact same thing, challenging the Patriots receivers to beat man coverage on New England's opening drive. This time, Boutte and Maye didn't shy away from seeing man-to-man. Buffalo was often in a man-free coverage structure, meaning they have a single-high safety in the deep middle with corners in single coverage. That toss was INCREDIBLE 🎯@DrakeMaye2 | @KayshonBoutte1 📺: CBS pic.twitter.com/gZogJ4XTwh On Boutte's touchdown, the Patriots played a third-and-4 in a three-by-one formation with the receivers condensed to Maye's left. As the Pats lone receiver to the right, Boutte is one-on-one with Bills cornerback Kaiir Elam, their No. 3 corner with starter Rasul Douglas inactive. Maye saw the matchup with his best go-ball receiver and gave Boutte a chance with a perfectly placed dime. Kudos also go to RB Antonio Gibson for an excellent blitz pickup to keep Maye clean to make the throw. \"Man coverage all around. Just got to win your route, and I won my route,\" Boutte said. Although everyone wants more than moral victories, the Patriots took a step forward by going toe-to-toe with Buffalo. A big part of that was taking an attack-minded approach and seeing it be successful will be good for the group. Hopefully, they use that as a confidence builder moving forward. 2. Patriots QB Drake Maye Lights Up in First Half, Second-Half Turnovers Prove Costly At halftime, the Patriots rookie quarterback was outplaying Bills superstar Josh Allen in his own house. It was pretty cool, honestly. #Patriots QB Drake Maye outplaying the frontrunner for MVP in the first half. The Pats played 61.1% of Buffalo's passing downs in man coverage. Allen vs. man: 3-for-10, 17 yards, INT, 4 PBUs for the NEP. pic.twitter.com/8Dq9MLqlgb In the first two quarters, Maye was adding +0.35 expected points compared to Allen's -0.06 EPA output. The third-overall pick was dealing, with a big-time throw to Boutte and two other \"plus\" plays, including converting a third down via scramble. Later on, Maye had a successful designed QB run for 13 yards in the fourth quarter. At times, this was Maye unleashed, which is what we've wanted to see. 10 & 9 connect again for 22 yards.@DrakeMaye2 | @KayshonBoutte1 📺: CBS pic.twitter.com/H96W0HPBKI Along with the big-time throw to Boutte, Maye also had an off-platform completion for a 22-yard gain that was Allen-like with the Bills QB watching. The play design is a two-man route combination with a vertical to occupy the post-safety and a deep dig by Boutte. With immediate pressure in his face, Maye threw back to the middle of the field while his body was moving right, getting enough on the pass to hit Boutte (nice blitz pickup by Gibson again). After being scorching hot in the first half, the second-half turnovers caused Maye's efficiency to fall to +0.14 expected points added for the game. It was still a net-positive performance and better than Allen (+0.07). But the two turnovers sunk New England in this game. Bills ball brought to you by Cam Lewis! 📺: @paramountplus & @NFLonCBS pic.twitter.com/CAg7KMqnCM On the interception, the Pats are running a scissors concept (corner-post) where the routes intersect to stress the coverage. Typically, you run those routes at different depths to avoid a collision, but TE Austin Hooper and WR Kendrick Bourne bring a party to the route break, which causes Hooper to get hung up on his route. Maye threw it early with anticipation to the corner, but it was picked when Hooper couldn't finish his route. Bills recover the backwards pass in the end zone!📺: #NEvsBUF on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/5M8pN2QBi1 As for the backward pass/fumble, this is a staple screen design for the Patriots this season. With two backs, Gibson releases as a lead blocker, and Stevenson swings into the flat. Unfortunately, RT Trey Jacobs misses the cut block on Greg Rousseau, allowing Rousseau to force the ball to go backward, leading to a catastrophic play. In hindsight, this play call backed up on their own goal line was a little too risky. Overall, the Patriots rookie quarterback had some great moments. Still, Maye will need to kick the turnover bug at some point, with interceptions in seven consecutive games. Those aren't all on Maye, but it's the responsibility of the quarterback to protect the ball. If this was a sign of things to come for the Allen vs. Maye matchup, you'll take this for the next decade or more. 3. Patriots Defense Man's Up on Bills Receivers to Limit Allen and Company to 17 Points Moving over to the defense, the Patriots did a nice job holding the high-powered Bills passing attack to 154 passing yards on 29 attempts. In the advanced metrics, Allen ranked in the 50th percentile for this game by adding +0.07 expected points on 34 drop-backs. Buffalo didn't have a single explosive play through the air, while Pats defenders registered five pass breakups to go along with an interception. New England's plan was to play a 64.7% man coverage rate against Allen, challenging his receivers to win their routes vs. the Pats cover corners. Without star WR Stefon Diggs, the Bills receivers aren't quite as scary. Buffalo still has good wideouts, but Diggs was always the Bills trump card when New England would play man coverage vs. Buffalo in the past. The other key to the Pats defensive game plan was using a mush rush to keep Allen in the pocket. New England's defensive line didn't have many chances to rush the passer in this one, with the coaching staff harping on compressing the pocket around Allen to prevent him from extending plays and scrambling, which often leads to big plays for the Bills offense. New England had some nifty blitz designs when the Patriots had their chances to come after Allen. On their lone sack of the game, the Pats showed pressure with S Kyle Dugger lined up in-line over the interior offensive line. At the snap, Dugger dropped out all the way to post-safety, with safety Marte Mapu blitzing off the edge instead. The pressure scheme got a free runner to the quarterback (Mapu), and Jeremiah Pharms closed the pocket to record the sack. Along with excellent man coverage in the backend, the Patriots game plan takes great discipline from the defensive line to keep Allen contained in the pocket. New England's plan held the Bills to nearly 15 points under their season average, with Allen producing his fourth-lowest EPA per play output of what has been an MVP-caliber season for the Bills QB. My hope was that we'd see something positive from defensive coordinator DeMarcus Covington and Coach Mayo against the current king of the division. It was a nice bounce-back from the defensive brain trust. 4. Patriots Run Defense Struggles Continue in Loss to the Bills Although the results were positive for the pass defense, the Patriots run defense continues to be the defense's Achilles heel, with Buffalo rushing for 172 yards on 28 attempts on Sunday. On top of the traditional box-score stats, Buffalo added +0.11 expected points per rush and had a 52 percent rushing success rate, both above the 90th percentile. The Pats biggest issues stem from the second level struggling to get off blocks and compress space, opening cutback lanes for explosive ball carriers like Bills RB James Cooks. Catch Jimbo if you can! 📺: @paramountplus & @NFLonCBS@thegreat__4 | #ProBowlVote pic.twitter.com/WzdsrIsesS After the Pats took a 14-point lead, the Bills answered right back with a 46-yard touchdown by Cook. It was a simple wide zone lead scheme by Buffalo out of a two-back formation. The Bills blockers eclipsed Pats linebackers Jahlani Tavai and Sione Takitaki, a common occurrence this season, and safety Marte Mapu over-ran the play as the deep safety. Cook saw the huge cutback lane, and with Mapu out of position, there's nobody there to make a play. The Patriots two-gapping system is all about building a wall with great gap discipline and physicality at the point of attack. This season, the Pats linebackers are getting blocked too easily on the second level, and their entire defense hasn't been taking great angles to the ball. As a result, the open-field tackling at the second and third levels has been inconsistent. New England must address the run defense with personnel upgrades in the front seven this offseason. Although they have needs on offense, they're too soft in the middle of the defense. It's among the biggest weaknesses on the team. 5. With Man Coverage Plan, a Look at the Patriots Matchups in the Seoncdary With the Patriots playing over 64 percent of the game in man coverage, this was a matchup game for some on New England's defense. Mainly, veteran Jonathan Jones had the tough task of shadowing Bills leading receiver Khalil Shakir. In 16 routes covering Shakir, Jones was excellent, allowing two catches for 22 yards on five targets with a pass breakup. Other than Jones on Shakir, the other matchups were determined mainly by sides, with CB Christian Gonzalez mostly lining up across from rookie Keon Coleman (11 routes). Gonzo covered Bills wideout Amari Cooper on six routes, allowing one catch for 10 yards. Based on my live viewing, this was an outstanding game for the Patriots corners vs. the Bills receivers. 6. Patriots Stick With Same Five Along the Offensive Line in Week 16 Despite having former first-rounder Cole Strange active for the first time, the Patriots opted for continuity along the offensive line. The group that played the whole game was LT Vederian Lowe, LG Layden Robinson, C Ben Brown, RG Mike Onwenu, and RT Trey Jacobs. On initial viewing, this was a down game for RT Trey Jacobs, who had 16 reps vs. future Hall of Fame pass-rusher Von Miller. Jacobs allowed a team-high five pressures, had two false starts, and missed the cut block on Rousseau, which led to the fumble-six. The other pressure point was at left guard, where rookie Layden Robinson allowed three pressures. In all, Maye was under pressure on 37.2% of his drop-backs. But some of that was the Bills sending the house on several low red zone plays late in the fourth quarter that Maye took responsibility for post-game. As always, we'll watch the film to properly grade the offensive line, but the pressure rate was a tad high this week, especially when the Patriots needed to throw the ball in the fourth quarter. 7. RB Rhamondre Stevenson in the Middle of Two Turnovers as Pats Lose TO Battle Speaking after the game, head coach Jerod Mayo pointed to his team's three turnovers to Buffalo's one giveaway as a key to the game that went in the Bills favor. The Pats lead-back was in the mix on two of those three turnovers. It's tough to put the backward pass on Stevenson, as it was mainly on Maye for throwing it and Jacobs for missing his block. However, Rhamondre fumbled for an NFL-high seventh time on Sunday, setting up a Bills field goal. Stevenson now has as many fumbles this season as his first years combined. He has been grinding out difficult yards with bodies flying around him all year, but Stevenson has to clean up his fumbling issues as we look ahead. Stevenson signed a four-year extension with the Patriots this past offseason, so his ball security must improve. 8. Patriots Execute a Fake Punt and Kickoff the Game with 42-Yard Return Despite being down stud punt returner Marcus Jones, the Patriots had a strong showing on special teams. Pats running back Antonio Gibson opened the game with a 42-yard kickoff return that set up the offense with great field position. Then, New England extended a drive by converting a fake punt on a 4th-and-1, an example of their aggressiveness. On the fake punt, the Patriots snapped the ball directly to personal protector Dell Pettus. Buffalo actually played the fake punt well, but the Pats got a good push on the interior to make the line to gain. Unfortunately, the offense couldn't take advantage of the successful fake punt, but it was a good moment for special teams coordinator Jermey Springer's unit. Lastly, recently signed WR Alex Erickson replaced Jones (punts) and Hasty (kickoffs) as a primary returner.

Here's everything that went down in Buffalo on Sunday. Sunday, December 22, 4:25 p.m. ET | Highmark Stadium, Orchard Park, NY | Inactives | Game day roster | Broadcast information After losing the coin toss, the Patriots started with the football and started with strong field position after a 42-yard kick return by Antonio Gibson. New England got on the move with a pretty third-down conversion to Hunter Henry — with Maye calm against pressure — and then a DPI to Rhamondre Stevenson that netted 14 yards. Facing the next third-down, Maye dropped a ball perfectly in the bucket to Kayshon Boutte for a 28-yard touchdown. [Patriots 7 : 0 Bills] That toss was INCREDIBLE @DrakeMaye2 | @KayshonBoutte1 : CBS pic.twitter.com/gZogJ4XTwh New England’s defense continued the strong start on Buffalo’s first possession. After Josh Allen picked up one first-down, strong coverage by Kyle Dugger on second-down and a pass breakup by Alex Austin on third-down forced a punt. Starting their next drive inside the 10 after Alex Erickson’s punt return went nowhere, Stevenson found some running room while Maye connected with both of his tight ends to march across midfield. Maye’s legs then moved the chains on a third-and-long situation to help overcome an earlier penalty before going back to Henry to convert the following third-down after another negative play. Buffalo’s defense then drew a pair of penalties as Maye’s cadence converted a third-down before Pop Douglas drew a DPI. New England then had a penalty of their own on a designed QB run, but Stevenson quickly got the yardage back as he rumbled through defenders for a 14-yard touchdown. [Patriots 14 : 0 Bills] .@dreeday32 bringing the HAMMER : CBS pic.twitter.com/T7NvLF04Hi Buffalo’s offense picked up a pair of first downs on their next drive to move across midfield. James Cook then struck as he took a handoff 46 yards to the house — with more of the usual problems surfacing for the Patriots run defense — to get the Bills on the board. [Patriots 14 : 7 Bills] New England’s offense could not continue their earlier momentum on their third drive. Maye had a rare miss over the middle to an open Boutte on first-down while his third-down pass was then complete but just short of the sticks to Kendrick Bourne. Buffalo went back to James Cook to start their next drive as the speedy back took a swing pass 16 yards on the first play from scrimmage. After a Kyle Dugger TFL and false start set Buffalo back into a 3rd-and-16, Allen uncorked a deep bomb to the end zone which was intercepted by Marte Mapu, who then tried to return it and was tackled at the one-yard line. A QB sneak and pair of short completions picked up a first-down to get New England off their own goal line. Then facing a third-and-short, a run to Gibson was stuffed for no gain. Lined up to punt on fourth-down, Jerod Mayo dialed up the aggressiveness with a fake with the snap going to personal protector Dell Pettus who powered through to move the chains. New England was not able to take advantage of the new set of downs, as Maye’s third-down pass was complete but a yard short of the line to gain. Bryce Baringer then punted away following the two-minute warning. Buffalo’s drive started by Marte Mapu driving on a crosser to breakup, and almost intercept, Allen’s pass. Two completions to Mack Hollins then picked up a pair of first downs before Brenden Schooler’s longhorn package helped slow their momentum. Facing 3rd-and-10, Allen’s long ball to Khalil Shakir fell incomplete with Jon Jones in coverage. With 13 seconds left, Maye hit Douglas on a 13-yard catch-and-run and came back to Hooper over the middle for 11 yards. Using their last timeout with two seconds left at their own 44, a short pass to Boutte saw the receiver take it 31 yards before running into a wall of Bills defenders and laterally it to Gibson, who took it out of bounds. Starting the second half with the ball, Buffalo turned back to James Cook who took his first handoff 25 yards to the right sideline. After another handoff to Cook, Allen found his rookie receiver, Keon Coleman, for 17 yards over the middle. Two more carries for Cook moved Buffalo inside the red area and setup a third-down, where Allen quickly beat a cover-zero blitz to find Dalton Kincaid. Then facing 3rd-and-goal, Allen lofted one to Cook out of the backfield for a touchdown. [Patriots 14 : 14 Bills] Back tied, New England turned to the ground game. That came with poor results, as Stevenson fumbled on his second straight handoff which Buffalo recovered. Taking over at the Patriots 42 following the fumble, Buffalo went back to the ground game to pick up a first-down. After a strong PBU by Jon Jones in the end zone and a run stuff by Christian Elliss, Buffalo faced a 3rd-and-10 where pressure got home to sack Josh Allen — which was credited to Jeremiah Pharms. Tyler Bass’ 50-yard field goal was good. [Patriots 14 : 17 Bills] Trailing for the first time, New England turned to the ground game with Antonio Gibson before the back helped in pass protection to create time for Maye to hit Boutte off-platform for 22 yards. Then facing 3rd-and-8 over midfield, a screen to Stevenson saw the back pick up 13 yards. The next play, Maye went to the end zone for Austin Hooper, who got beat in traffic as the pass was intercepted. Back with the ball, Buffalo got on the move as Allen picked up first downs with his legs and arm. Buffalo then put two footballs on the ground but were able to recover both as they marched into New England territory. Facing a 3rd-and-9 after a false start, Allen’s pass slipped out of his hand and fell incomplete. Buffalo then punted. Starting inside their own 10-yard line, disaster continued to strike for the Patriots. A backwards pass to Stevenson saw the ball go off the backs hands and roll into the end zone which the Bills recovered for a touchdown. [Patriots 14 : 24 Bills] Trailing by 10, Maye got New England’s offense back on the move with his arm and legs. Facing a 3rd-and-6 by midfield following a delay of game, Maye’s pass to Henry was incomplete. With 8:26 remaining New England then punted away. Backed up inside their 10-yard line, New England got Buffalo into a 3rd-and-1 but gave up a 17-yard catch-and-run to Ray Davis out of the backfield. Setting them into a 3rd-and-10, Allen tired to escape Keion White but was brought down for just three yards. Buffalo then punted. Needing two scores with 4:29 left in the game, a short completion to Bourne and then a DPI penalty got things started for the offense. A read-option keeper picked up 14 yards by Maye on 4th-and-1 before Maye hit Hooper up the seam for 25 yards — which drew an unnecessary roughness penalty as well. Inside the five, Boutte drew a DPI in the end zone on 3rd-and-goal. Following the two-minute, Maye’s next 3rd-and-goal pass to Bourne drew another DPI flag. At the one, Maye rolled to his left and hit Pop Douglas for a score but the play was overturned upon review. After a dropped snap led to an eight-yard loss, Maye bounced back to hit Hunter Henry for a touchdown. [Patriots 21 : 24 Bills] Joey Slye’s onside kick saw a good bounce be recovered by Buffalo. With three timeouts remaining, Buffalo ran the ball picking up 12 yards on first-down. Out of timeouts facing 3rd-and-1, a pitch to Johnson was stopped short. On 4th-and-1, a sneak picked up the first to end the game. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here. GamblingHelpLineMA.org or call (800) 327-5050 for 24/7 support (MA).

After posting only seven points in the first half for the first time since Week 11 of last season, the Bills held the Patriots to a single touchdown and got their offense clicking in the second half en route to a 24-21 victory on Sunday night at Highmark Stadium. A rather pedestrian night by MVP candidate Josh Allen by his own standards was mitigated by a two touchdown day by James Cook and a defensive touchdown on a fumble recovery by Taron Johnson. Allen ended the contest with 154 passing yards for one touchdown and an interception to go along with 30 yards rushing. A fall on his throwing elbow in the fourth quarter handicapped him to a degree, but he managed to stay in for the duration of the game. The first half was by and large dominated by the Patriots. They played keep away with the football, possessing it for over 20 minutes of the half. New England made Buffalo pay in each quarter. First was a 28-yard touchdown pass from Drake Maye to Kayshon Boutte. Maye would finish the contest with 261 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. On the following drive, Rhamondre Stevenson would break free for a 14-yard rush to the end-zone. The Bills would eventually get on the board courtesy of Cook who found the crease in the inside and scored a touchdown on a 46-yard run. Buffalo would find themselves in a 14-7 hole at the half. For a team that has scored 30 or more points in eight straight contests, New England has stifled them defensively. Coming out of the half, the Bills would score on a short pass to Cook for the touchdown to tie the game. A 50-yard field goal would give them their first lead of the night. But it would be another kick that put Buffalo firmly in the drivers seat. The Bills punt put the Patriots at their own 10-yard line. Maye threw a lateral pass to Stevenson that got blown up. The ball tumbled into the end-zone and Johnson recovered the fumble and scored the touchdown. Maye would find Hunter Henry for a late touchdown to cut the lead to three with just over a minute to play, but it was too little, too late for the Patriots. Bills drive starts 1:11 at Patriots 48-yard line Bills get a pair of first downs to run out the clock and secure the victory. SCORE UPDATE: Bills 24, Patriots 21 with 1:13 remaining fourth quarter Patriots drive starts 4:29 at own 25-yard line Maye uses his wheels on 4th and 1 to pick up the late first down as the Pats try to get a quick score down ten. A touchdown pass to cut the score to three was called back after it was ruled an incomplete catch. Maye finds Henry in the end-zone for a without a doubt touchdown for the Patriots. An onside-kick by New England ends up in the hands of Buffalo at the Pats 48 yard line. Bills drive starts 8:26 at own 9-yard line An Allen pass to Ray Davis breaks for almost 30 yards before the line judge ruled him out around halfway through the run. Ended up being a 17-yard gain. Linebacker Keion White tackles Allen on the scramble before the line to gain. Out comes the Bills punt unit. Patriots drive starts 10:10 at own 30-yard line A third down delay of game turns a short run situation into a passing one. Maye is unable to hook up with Hunter for the first down. Bryce Baringer punts the ball to the Buffalo 9-yard line. SCORE UPDATE: Bills 24, Patriots 14 with 10:10 remaining fourth quarter Patriots drive starts 11:00 at own 10-yard line A lateral throw to Stevenson goes awry as the ball is loose and Taron Johnson falls on it in the end-zone for the touchdown. Second turnover tonight for Maye. Bills drive starts 1:52 (third quarter) at own 20-yard line A couple plays saw New England punch the ball loose from Buffalo players this drive. The Bills were able to recover the ball both times, but the nine degree weather in Buffalo seems to be having an impact on ball carriers. Buffalo has to punt away after an errant Allen pass that was uncharacteristically off-target. Alex Erickson with the fair-catch at the Patriots 10-yard line. Bills drive starts 1:52 at own 20-yard line An Allen scramble and pass gets the Bills offense to their own 46-yard line as the quarter expires. Patriots drive starts 6:02 at own 30-yard line Maye drops back to avoid the Pats blitz to find a diving Boutte for a 22-yard reception. Boutte is up to 96 yards on the day along with the early touchdown. A shot towards the end-zone by Maye gets picked off by Cam Lewis. Bills will regain possession at their own 20-yard line. SCORE UPDATE: Bills 17, Patriots 14 with 6:02 remaining third quarter Bills drive starts 9:04 at Patriots 42-yard line The New England frontline forces a tackle for no gain and then a sack on Allen in back-to-back plays. Tyler Bass converts on the 50-yard field goal attempt to give Buffalo its first lead of the night. Patriots drive starts 9:41 at own 30-yard line Bills defender Greg Rousseau punches the ball loose on a Stevenson drive, resulting in a fumble and the Bills takeover at the New England 42-yard line. SCORE UPDATE: Patriots 14, Bills 14 with 9:41 remaining third quarter Bills drive starts 15:00 at own 32-yard line Bills go into a wildcat formation, snapping the ball directly to Cook before picking up a handful of yards on the ground. On the next play, Allen finds Cook for a short 4-yard reception as he finds his way into the end-zone. Bills tie it up on the first drive of the second half. Through one half, New England has managed to cool down one of the hottest offenses in the league in Buffalo as they lead the home team 14-7. The last time the Bills scored seven points in a half was back in Week 11 of 2023 against the Miami Dolphins. Coming into the contest, the Bills have scored 30 plus points in eight straight games - a streak that’s tied for the longest in NFL history. New England’s solution to stopping a historically great offense? Don’t give them the ball. The Patriots held possession of the football for nearly 2/3 of the entire half. They made it count with a score in each quarter. First was a touchdown pass to Kayshon Boutte on the first drive of the game. The next came early in the second half on a 14-yard run by Rhamondre Stevenson. Buffalo managed to get on the board halfway through the second quarter on a 46-yard rush by James Cook. That marked his 14th TD of the year. Coming out of the half, the Bills will need to find that spark offensively that has them firmly in the NFL contender conversation. Patriots drive starts 0:13 at own 20-yard line New England ultimately makes it down to the Buffalo 25 yard line before running out of time in the half. Bills drive starts 2:00 at own 20-yard line Three straight incompletions forces the Bills to punt again. Patriots defense has managed to keep one of the best offenses in the league in check going into the half. Patriots drive starts 8:01 at own 1-yard line After the Patriots escaped its own end zone, they found themselves in a 4th and 1 situation and looked as if they were ready to punt. But New England coach Jerod Mayo called for a fake punt and the direct snap to Dell Pettus resulted in a 2-yard gain, enough for a first down. Not looking to to catch lightning in a bottle twice, the Pats go for an actual punt on another 4th and 1. Bills take over at their own 20 yard line. Bills drive starts 10:58 at own 32-yard line A short pass to Cook breaks for 16-yards as he gets pushed out of bounds before he could get anymore. Back-to-back penalties slowed down a Bills offensive that was on the move. Facing a 3rd and 16, Allen launches a deep pass that was intended for rookie Keon Coleman, but it was off target and was picked off in the end-zone by Marte Mapu. Mapu tries to run out of the end-zone but gets tackled at the New England 1-yard line. Patriots drive starts 11:52 at own 22-yard line On a 3rd and long, Maye finds Kendrick Bourne for the 9-yard conversion, but it was a yard short of the sticks. Pats bring out the punting unit for the first time today. An illegal block above the waist by a New England defender adds ten yards to where the play was whistled. SCORE UPDATE: Patriots 14, Bills 7 with 11:56 remaining second quarter Bills drive starts 14:16 at own 25-yard line Bills offense finally defrosts as James Cooks finds the hole on an inside run and breaks free for a 46-yard rush to the end-zone. That rushing touchdown is number 14 on the year for Cook. He came into the game second in the league in rushing TD’s. SCORE UPDATE: Patriots 14, Bills 0 with 14:16 remaining second quarter Patriots drive starts 9:13 (first quarter) at own 9-yard line After a holding penalty sets the Pats back to the Bills 14-yard line, Rhamondre Stevenson gets it back and then some as he makes his way to the end-zone for his seventh touchdown of the year. END OF FIRST QUARTER: Patriots 7, Bills 0 Patriots drive starts 9:13 at own 9-yard line Rhamondre Stevenson has been taking advantage of the Bills nickel defensive set. Three straight runs totaling just under 25 runs. Maye breaks out the pocket, pass fakes a few defenders and spins between two others to pick up the first on 3rd and 9. Another third down conversion to Hunter Henry sets up New England right outside the red-zone. The tight end is first in targets, receptions and receiving for the squad this season Bills drive starts 11:54 at own 32-yard line A pair of incomplete Josh Allen throws and a run for no gain forces the Bills to punt on its opening possession. The kick landed at the Pats nine yard line. SCORE UPDATE: Patriots 7, Bills 0 with 12:01 remaining first quarter Patriots drive starts 15:00 at own 42-yard line Antonio Gibson gets loose on the punt-return to set up New England at their own 42 yard line. A pass interference call on Baylon Spector gives the Patriots 14 yards and an automatic first down. Drake Maye throws a deep pass down to Kayshon Boutte who corrals it in the end zone while keepying his feet in bounds. First touchdown goes to the visiting Pats. Week 16 of the NFL season is here, and the Bills (11-3) begin their three-game finishing kick against AFC East foes beginning with Sunday’s game against the Patriots (3-11). Buffalo stays home next week against the Jets before wrapping up the regular season in Foxborough. The Bills' chances at earning the AFC’s No. 1 seed are dwindling after the Chiefs moved to 14-1 on Saturday. Kansas City can clinch home-field advantage throughout the NFL Playoffs with a victory at either the Steelers or Broncos, or if the Bills drop any of their remaining games. Buffalo remains the odds-on favorite to be the No. 2 seed in the AFC. The Bills listed the following players as being inactive for today’s game. Linebackers Dorian Williams and Baylon Spector were listed as questionable on the team’s Friday afternoon injury report, though it appears both will give it a go Sunday. The Bills have given up 42 points in back-to-back weeks against the Rams and Lions, but have withstood those defensive struggles in large part because of the MVP-worthy play of franchise quarterback Josh Allen. The Patriots, led by rookie quarterback Drake Maye, are next-to-last in the NFL averaging just 17 points per game.

                "title": "A sweet & simple guide to cardinal & ordinal numbers in English",
                "content": "June 27, 2023AuthorMarco Monroy Author Marco Monroy While you might already be able to count in English with no problem, it can sometimes be tricky to figure out when to use cardinal numbers and when to use ordinal numbers. In other words, sometimes we say “one,” while sometimes we say “first,” so how do we know which is the right one? In this handy guide, we’ll go over the definition of both cardinal and ordinal numbers and provide you with plenty of examples and linguistic tidbits to help you use all English numbers expertly. Oh, and we’ll also provide you with massive lists of cardinal and ordinal numbers along with their pronunciation so you can start using them in your everyday conversations right away. Without further ado, let’s get started! First things first, we’ve got to cover the basics: cardinal numbers. These are the numbers that you likely think of when you think of numbers: one, two, three, etc. These help us discuss things when their order doesn’t really matter. For example, if you want three apples, it doesn’t really make a difference what order they come in. In English, we use Arabic numerals to write them in almost all cases. Cardinal numbers are used for counting, so use them any time you need to count how many siblings and cousins you have, how many fruits and vegetables you want to buy, and how many cups of coffee you want to order. Here’s a big list with dozens of cardinal numbers and their pronunciation in English: Let’s review some sample sentences of cardinal numbers in English now that you know what cardinal numbers are: Another common way of counting things is by using numerical sequence words like “once,” “twice” or “thrice.” These words mean one time, two times, and three times, respectively, and they can be used any time you want to mention something that happened between one and three times. Unfortunately, thrice is the highest that these words will go, so you won’t be to use these numerical sequence words for things that happened four or more times! Here are some examples of how these words are used: You learned about cardinal numbers first, so now we’re going to learn about ordinal numbers second. No less important than cardinal numbers, these types of numbers help us discuss things when their order does matter. For example, even though winning isn’t everything, we all want to place first in any contest or competition, right? Placing second or third is also okay, but there’s nothing like placing first! Ordinal numbers help us in situations like these where the order does actually matter. Ordinal numbers are used to order items in a sequence, such as first, second, third, and so on. Think of the word order when you think of ordinal and you’ll surely never forget these numbers. After the first three numbers, ordinal numbers are usually made by adding -th at the end of the cardinal number. For example, four becomes fourth, six becomes sixth, and ten becomes tenth. However, this rule isn’t infallible, and there are a few exceptions that don’t obey this rule, like fifth, ninth, and twelfth. Here’s a list of dozens of the most important ordinal numbers along with their pronunciation in English: Now that you’re familiar with all the key ordinal numbers in English, let’s take a look at some example sentences so you know how to use them like a true native: While reviewing ordinal numbers, there’s one more “number” that you should keep in mind: umpteenth. While this isn’t a number, it is commonly used in sentences in place of a normal ordinal number. It simply means a very large and undefined number in a succession, generally used to emphasize the enormity of the number. For example: In the example sentence above, it doesn’t matter how many times the person had to water the plants that month — the use of umpteenth simply emphasizes that it’s an unreasonably high number. This is an informal word that you may use in everyday conversations, but it’s probably best to keep it away from academic or formal settings. Ordinal numbers can be expressed in numerals just like cardinal numbers. To do this, simply add the last two letters of the ordinal number to the Arabic numeral, such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. Informally, you can use these any time you want to save time and space, like when planning out your calendar or writing to-do lists. Formally, you’ll want to write out the names of the ordinal numbers from one to nine and use the contraction for ten and above. Now that you’re familiar with the broad differences between ordinal and cardinal numbers, let’s take a deep dive into what makes them different from each other. Perhaps paradoxically, numbers aren’t always used to express quantity. As you now know, ordinal numbers denote the order within a sequence, but they don’t really tell us any information about quantity. Take a look at the following examples: In the first sentence, we know exactly how many cars the train has: ten. However, in the second sentence, we don’t really know how many cars the train has. There could be four, six, eight or even just two cars in that train, but that doesn’t matter. The most important thing is to help the other person locate you in relation to the other cars of the train. That’s one thing to keep in mind when dealing with ordinal numbers. The missing context can sometimes be deceiving, since you don’t really know the total quantity of the nouns you’re referring to. Take this from someone who once placed third in a three-person singing contest! Ordinal numbers are typically formed by adding the suffix “-th” to the corresponding cardinal number. For example, four becomes fourth and ten becomes tenth. However, there are a few irregular forms that you should keep in mind. The following ordinal numbers have irregular spellings: Also, keep in mind that numbers ending in one, two, or three, will also have the same ordinal ending as the corresponding single-digit number. For example: Although we’ve already taken a look at the general use of each of the types of numbers, let’s go into more detail about when you’re supposed to use ordinal vs. cardinal numbers in English: In general, you’ll want to use cardinal numbers when the quantity of the noun in question is important. Here are some concrete examples: Although cardinal numbers are more common than ordinal numbers, these last ones have a far wider variety of uses. Here are some of the most common: The best way to make sure that you’ve really nailed the difference between cardinal and ordinal numbers in English is to test yourself with a little quiz! Even if nobody’s going to come and grade your results, testing yourself can be an incredibly effective study strategy. Here are ten practical exercises for you to try: Answer: You’re the first person to compliment my new sunglasses! Answer: Can I get two paper bags, please? Answer: This is the third time I come to this store and it’s closed! Answer: I bought four pairs of shoes last weekend. Someone take my credit card away! Answer: She’s the fifth person to ask me about you this week. Answer: I have to go to sleep because I have to catch a flight at six in the morning tomorrow. Answer: She qualified for the Olympics, but she didn’t win a medal because she placed seventh in the competition. Answer: Remember to always drink at least eight glasses of water each day. Answer: Wait, you’re coming to San Francisco on the ninth? Answer: If I could have it my way, I would have adopted at least ten kittens by now. Although it may seem trivial, the difference between cardinal and ordinal numbers is quite monumental in the English language.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. CINCINNATI (AP) Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase keep putting up extraordinary numbers, but the Cincinnati Bengals still need help to reach the playoffs. Burrow threw three touchdown passes, including one as he was falling to the turf, and the Bengals kept their slim postseason hopes alive with a 24-6 victory over the Cleveland Browns on Sunday. “This one just keeps us in the race,” Burrow said. “It feels good to play in big games. It's exciting to still be in it.” The Bengals (7-8) have won three straight. They need to win their last two games and get some help to earn a playoff spot. Burrow finished 23 of 30 for 252 yards and became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for three or more TDs and 250 or more yards in seven straight games, surpassing the record of six set by Tom Brady in New England's undefeated 2007 season. Chase had six catches for 97 yards and a garbage-time touchdown for Cincinnati to reach 1,510 yards this season and break his own franchise record of 1,455 yards set in 2021. “It feels good, something I wanted to do,” said Chase, who leads the NFL in receptions (108), receiving yards and TD catches (16). “Me being competitive, I wanted to compete with myself.” Burrow leads the league with 4,229 yards passing and 39 touchdowns. With Dorian Thompson-Robinson replacing Jameis Winston at quarterback, Cleveland (3-12) missed some chances in the red zone. Jerome Ford had a 66-yard run on the first play from scrimmage. But D'Onta Foreman fumbled on first-and-goal and Vonn Bell recovered. “It's a 14-point swing,” Bengals coach Zac Taylor said. “Not only did it take the life out of them a little bit, getting the stop on the 1-yard line then going 99 (yards) gave us a lot of confidence and set the tone.” In the third quarter, a holding penalty negated a TD run by Thompson-Robinson, who also had a pass intercepted in the end zone by Jordan Battle. “Obviously, you turn the ball over in the red zone, especially the first one, you're not going to put yourself in position to get a win on the road,” Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said. “Not a lack of effort. It's a lack of protecting the ball.” The Bengals cashed in on Foreman's fumble when Burrow, as he was falling, threw a 2-yard TD pass to Tee Higgins to cap an eight-play, 99-yard drive. The Bengals' defense, which has struggled for most of the season, has forced nine turnovers in the past two games. “The guys have done a great job on that side of the ball getting us extra possessions on offense,” Taylor said Thompson-Robinson passed for 157 yards and two interceptions after being named the starter this week ahead of Winston, who was inactive with a shoulder injury. He had 49 yards rushing and was sacked five times. Ford rushed for 93 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries. Burrow threw a 32-yard touchdown pass to Chase with 1:44 left when the Bengals only needed to run out the clock. Cincinnati’s Cade York, a former Browns draft pick, tied a franchise record with a 59-yard field goal on the final play of the first half to make it 17-0. It matched Evan McPherson's 59-yarder on Sept. 11, 2022. McPherson is on injured reserve with a groin injury. “There was no ill will,” York said about the Browns. “I really enjoyed my time over there. It was nice to beat them, though.” Myles Garrett, who said this week the Browns franchise should be focused on winning and not rebuilding, recorded the 100th sack of his career in the second quarter. “It made my dad proud,\" Garrett said. \"He’s been telling me through my last three weeks. I’m happy to get it done. There is no quitting in my blood.” Garrett has 12 sacks, joining Lawrence Taylor as the only players with 12 or more in five straight seasons.

                "content": "CINCINNATI — It was Dorian Thompson-Robinson's opportunity to audition for the full-time job next season. It was the Browns' opportunity to get the Cincinnati Bengals thinking about next season. It wasn't good for either of those things. Thompson-Robinson was given his first start of the season as the Browns traveled to Cincinnati for their rematch against the Bengals, who still had a pulse in the AFC playoff chase. The second-year pro had his moments, but had his mistakes as well. Those mistakes, including a pair of fourth-quarter interceptions, paved the way for Cincinnati to stay alive in the playoff chase with a 24-6 win over the Browns. It's the Bengals first sweep of the season series against Cleveland since the Browns' winless 2017 season. The Browns' worst season since that season saw their record fall to 3-12. They will host to the Miami Dolphins next Sunday afternoon at 4:05 p.m. Thompson-Robinson's flashes couldn't overcome the mistakes. He was 20-of-34 for 157 yards with two interceptions and a 47.4 passer rating, while being sacked five times. The first interception came in the end zone five plays into the fourth quarter. That was one of two Browns turnovers at or near the goal line, the other being a D'Onta Foreman fumble at the Bengals 1 on the first possession of the game. Browns defensive end Myles Garrett did get a sack of Cincinnati quarterback Joe Burrow in the game, pushing his career total to 100.5. However, Burrow was 23-of-30 for 252 yards with three touchdowns and a 134.3 passer rating. Cincinnati, which is 7-8, still needs to win out to give itself a chance to go to the playoffs. The Bengals were one of three 6-8 teams in the AFC entering play Sunday. Here's how the 103rd installment of the Battle of Ohio was waged on the banks of the Ohio River: After the Bengals stopped the Browns on fourth and 27 play from the Browns 36, they looked to add one more score to their total. On the second play of the possession, quarterback Joe Burrow threw a 36-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase for a 24-6 Cincinnati lead with 1:44 remaining. The Browns defense made a play while Cincinnati was trying to ice the game away. On third and goal from the Cleveland 1, defensive end Isaiah McGuire was able to knock the ball out of quarterback Joe Burrow's hand and defensive tackle Jowon Briggs recovered at the Browns 21. Dorian Thompson-Robinson has ended the last two Browns possessions with interceptions. The quarterback was trying to force a pass downfield to tight end David Njoku that Cincinnati's D.J. Ivey tipped and Geno Stone intercepted at the Bengals 33 with 8:20 remaining. The Browns' scoring chance to start the fourth was turned away when quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw an interception in the end zone to Cincinnati's Jordan Battle. It's the Browns second turnover in or near the end zone in the game. The Browns looked like they were going to get a touchdown on a quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson keeper. However, tight end Jordan Akins was flagged for holding, one of two holding calls in a three-play span to start the fourth quarter. The Browns are threatening as they enter the final 15 minutes of the regulation. They have marched to the Cincinnati 12, where they will have a first down to open the fourth quarter. One of the Bengals' top wide receivers left the game for at least a moment. Tee Higgins walked off the field gingerly after being tackled by cornerback Denzel Ward following a 3-yard gain with less than five minutes remaining in the third quarter. Ward got Higgins by his left foot to make the tackle. Higgins appeared to injure the ankle. Browns running back Jerome Ford capped an impressive Cleveland drive with a 4-yard touchdown run with 5:50 remaining in the third quarter. Dustin Hopkins, in his first kick after not being active last week, pushed the point-after kick wide right to keep the Bengals lead at 17-6. Ford has 77 rushing yards on six carries. Of those, 66 came on the first play of the game. Browns quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson had three completions in the first half. He matched that on his first three throws of the second half, gaining 21 net yards on those throws. Thompson-Robinson, with a 5-yard scramble, moved the Browns to the Cincinnati 48. It's pretty much been a disaster for the Browns through two quarters. They're down 17 points, they've been outgained 229-86 and the sack-adjusted passing yard totals are 141-0 in favor of Cincinnati. Cade York ended the half with a career-long 59-yard field goal to give the Bengals a 17-0 lead at halftime over the Browns. York's previous career-long was his 58-yard game-winner in his rookie debut at the Carolina Panthers in the 2022 season opener. It also tied Evan McPherson's franchise-record for Cincinnati. When the Browns defensive end sacked Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow with 1:22 remaining in the second quarter of Sunday's game, it pushed him over the 100-sack mark for his career. He now has 100.5 for his career. Garrett ripped off the right end, blowing through the blocks of Cincinnati wide receiver Andrei Iosvias and left tackle Cody Ford. He quickly got to Burrow and dropped him for an eight-yard loss. The fact the sack involved Burrow and the Bengals seems fitting, considering the amount of success Garrett has had against his fellow No. 1 overall pick and the other Ohio football team. He's now sacked Burrow nine times and Cincinnati quarterbacks 13 times, the most he's sacked any individual quarterback or sacks against one team in his career. The Bengals have opened up a 14-0 lead with 7:32 remaining in the second quarter. Quarterback Joe Burrow hit wide receiver Andrei Iosivas for a 6-yard touchdown. Burrow is now 14 of 18 for 133 yards and two touchdown. His passer rating is 134.5. It's not gone well for Browns quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson so far. He's 1 of 4 for 8 yards passing and has been sacked twice already with 11:34 remaining in the second quarter. The Bengals have a 7-0 lead after one quarter, and have only been stopped by themselves over their first two drives. Cincinnati has a 139-77 edge in total yards. The Browns were familiar with the Bengals' kicker on Sunday, as Cade York was originally a 2022 fourth-round pick for the team. He also spent most of training camp in Cleveland this seas after having been cut a year ago. York was signed by Cincinnati to replace the injured Evan McPherson. His first attempt against his former team, with 1:17 left in the first quarter, was a 47-yard field goal from the right hash that he pushed wide left. Joe Burrow threw a 1-yard touchdown pass for the Cincinnati Bengals with 7:14 remaining in the first quarter to Tee Higgins. Burrow managed to get the throw off just milliseconds before his knee hit the ground, avoiding a sack. The score gave the Bengals a 7-0 lead. Here's the first 11 on defense for the Browns: Quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson went to the medical tent during the replay review of D'Onta Foreman's fumble. Bailey Zappe, elevated as the No. 2 this week, warmed up for a moment. There's been no official word on Thompson-Robinson, who was back on the bench with the rest of the offense shortly after the Bengals' offensive drive began. The Browns had less than a yard to get a touchdown. They gave the ball to D'Onta Foreman, who had the ball knocked out by Cincinnati's Vonn Bell, who also recovered at the Bengals 1. Foreman was originally given a touchdown. Replay, though, overturned that call. Jerome Ford helped the Browns get off to a good start. The running back who played at the University of Cincinnati ripped off a 66-yard run on the first play of the game, putting the Browns at the Bengals 11. Here's the first 11 on the field for the Browns on offense: The Browns will start with the football after the Bengals won the toss and deferred. The Browns are making Jameis Winston the No. 3 emergency quarterback for the game against the Bengals. He's been dealing with a shoulder injury sustained during last week's loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. While Winston went from questionable to inactive, the Browns will have two starter in the lineup who were listed as questionable. Cornerback Martin Emerson Jr. (concussion/back) was active following a pre-game workout nearly two hours before kickoff, while tight end David Njoku will be in the starting lineup after missing a game with a hamstring injury. Rookie Mike Hall Jr. will start at defensive tackle in place of the injured Shelby Harris (elbow). Cornerbacks Kahlef Hailassie and Chigozie Anusiem, as well as the recently-signed tight end Brendan Bates, are inactive due to Emerson and Njoku being active. Wide receiver Cedric Tillman (concussion) and defensive end Cameron Thomas are both inactive. Defensive end James Houston will also be active for the first time since signing with the Browns in November. Bailey Zappe wasn't even on the Browns' roster the first time they played the Cincinnati Bengals. He'll be the backup quarterback behind Dorian Thompson-Robinson today when they meet again in Cincinnati, a league source confirmed for the Beacon Journal. The Browns are making Jameis Winston the No. 3 emergency quarterback for the game against the Bengals. He's been dealing with a shoulder injury sustained during last week's loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. The official inactive announcement for the 1 p.m. kickoff comes at 11:30 a.m. Kickoff is at 1 p.m. Tickets for Sunday's game on StubHub can be purchased on StubHub from $45 before fees. It's a sunny but chilly December afternoon in Cincinnati, with the temperature at kickoff expected to be a high near 34, according to the National Weather Service. Calm wind. Cleveland fell to 3-11 on the season with a 21-7 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs last Sunday afternoon in Cleveland. The Browns turned the football over six times in the game, including three interceptions by Jameis Winston. The Bengals improved to 6-8 by beating the Tennessee Titans 37-27 last Sunday in Nashville. The Bengals, despite turning the ball over four times, used six Titans turnovers and a 24-0 run in the second and third quarters to go from down 14-7 to up 31-14. So what should we expect from the Browns this afternoon against the Bengals? Click here to see what our writers project as the score of today's game. Today is the 103rd all-time regular-season or playoff meeting between the Browns and the Bengals, which dates back to 1970, and the 52nd since the rebirth of the Cleveland franchise in 1999.

                "content": "GoldDerby The Kennedy Center Honors 2024 will air tonight on CBS and Paramount+. The ceremony, which was recorded on Sunday, Dec. 8, in Washington, D.C., was hosted by previous honoree Queen Latifah (who began the show with a medley of honoree hits). Honorees were Oscar-winning director Francis Ford Coppola, Grammy-winning jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, Grammy-winning singer and songwriter Bonnie Raitt, legendary rock and roll band Grateful Dead, and New York City’s Apollo Theater (the first time an institution has been selected). Based on various online reports we discovered on Sunday night, here is the complete list of performers and presenters to be seen on the program. Producers might alter the order as presented to the in-person audience. APOLLO THEATER: Remarks by Dave Chappelle Remarks by Queen Latifah Performance by Savion Glover (dance tribute) Performance by The War and Treaty (Marvin Gaye/Tammi Terrell medley) Performance by Kamasi Washington Performance by Raye (“Cry Me a River”) Performance by Doug E. Fresh BONNIE RAITT: Remarks by Julia Louis-Dreyfus Performance by Sheryl Crow and Brandi Carlile (“I Can’t Make You Love Me”) Performance by Emmylou Harris and Dave Matthews (“Angel from Montgomery”) Performance by Keb’ Mo and Susan Tedeschi (“Walking Blues”) Performance by Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Arnold McCuller, and Sheryl Crow (“Nick of Time”) ARTURO SANDOVAL: Remarks by Andy Garcia Performance by Chris Botti Performance by Trombone Shorty Performance by Chucho Valdez Performance by Timo Nunez FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA: Remarks by George Lucas Remarks by Robert De Niro Remarks by Al Pacino Remarks by Martin Scorsese Remarks by Laurence Fishburne Remarks by Talia Shire Remarks by Jason Schwartzman Remarks by Gia Coppola GRATEFUL DEAD (Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, Bob Weir): Video remarks by Nancy Pelosi, John Mayer, Norah Jones, Ben and Jerry Remarks by David Letterman Remarks by Miles Teller Remarks by Chloe Sevigny Performance by Dave Matthews, Maggie Rogers, Derek Trucks, Leon Bridges, Sturgill Simpson, Don Was, and Susan Tedeschi (including “Friend of the Devil,” “Ripple,” “Sugaree,” and “Not Fade Away”) I’d like to see Wynton Marsalis receive a KC honor -it’s about time I agree, he deserves one, but I feel they will wait until he is a little older, typically they don’t consider you until you’re 60, rare exceptions have occurred, and since he is just now 63, I would say his is coming in 2026. Wynton is 63, but what about Doc Severinsen? Next year’s honorees should be Herb Alpert, Randy Newman, Whoopi Goldberg, Ron Howard and Fleetwood Mac 👍👍👍👍 totally agree! How about Tom Waits? Hes too cool for that. And hes an outsider. And TRUE WAITS FANS dont want him at the kennedy center honors or grammies. Hes a sacred world unto himself. Goldberg? For what her mouth? Magabillies gonna magabilly How about Johnny Mathis? Unless I am wrong he has never gotten the Kennedy Center Honor which is hard to believe! I think Karen and Richard Carpenter should receive a Kennedy Center Honor. Richard is still with us. Karen was a legend and the voice of an Angel when she sang. Absolutely! How can Led Zeppelin, the remaining Beatles, Billy Joel, Bonnie Raitt, Elton John receive a Kennedy Center Award but NOT THE ROLLING STONES. Are they waiting until Mic and Keith are dead?? This is unjust!! I couldn’t agree more. The recognition by the Kennedy Center should be expressed while the artists are alive. Please give the the Stones the respect they deserve while they are here to receive it. Does the Kennedy Center honor Americans only? Or performers from all over? Just wondering if that is why RS have not been honored. Elton John, Led Zepplin, ALL THE Beatles r BRITISH. You should think a minute before u post stuff. Wow! Angry much. You, too, should think before you post stuff, grouch. They have to accept and agree to attend. That has not happened so far. Jane Fonda, Johnny Mathis, The Rolling Stones, Maria Nieves, and George Strait should be the 2025 Kennedy Center Honorees Johnny Mathis should definitely receive this award Bonnie’s tribute made very emotional as I was remembering attending concerts back in the 70’s with Bonnie, Linda R and Jackson for approx. $10-15-!! Really great memories so far only half way through the show. The war and Treaty doing the Marvin Gaye Tammy Terrell tribute were great. Without them there’s no show. Brandy Carlisle was fantastic tonight. And Raye Reminds me of Amy Winehouse. Everyone else was boring or stunk, especially the girl who is not listed above who sang the impossible dream. I love James Taylor and Jackson Browne, but they were boring Your email address will not be published.

        "Panama Canal": [
            {
                "title": "Panama Canal - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Panama Canal (Spanish: Canal de Panamá) is an artificial 82-kilometer (51-mile) waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean, cutting across the Isthmus of Panama, and is a conduit for maritime trade. Locks at each end lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial fresh water lake 26 meters (85 ft) above sea level, created by damming up the Chagres River and Lake Alajuela to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal. Locks then lower the ships at the other end. An average of 200,000,000 L (52,000,000 US gal) of fresh water is used in a single passing of a ship.[1] The canal is threatened by low water levels during droughts. The Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduces the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage, the Strait of Magellan or the Beagle Channel. It is one of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken. Colombia, France, and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction. France began work on the canal in 1881, but stopped in 1889 because of lack of investors' confidence due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate. The US took over the project in 1904 and opened the canal in 1914. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the Torrijos–Carter Treaties provided for its handover to Panama in 1977. After a period of joint American–Panamanian control, the Panamanian government took control in 1999. It is now managed and operated by the Panamanian government-owned Panama Canal Authority. The original locks are 33.5 meters (110 ft) wide and allow the passage of Panamax ships. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded waterway began commercial operation on 26 June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Neopanamax ships. Annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, for a total of 333.7 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons. By 2012, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal.[2] In 2017, it took ships an average of 11.38 hours to pass between the canal's two outer locks. The American Society of Civil Engineers has ranked the Panama Canal one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.[3] The earliest record regarding a canal across the Isthmus of Panama was in 1534, when Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain, ordered a survey for a route through the Americas in order to ease the voyage for ships traveling between Spain and Peru. The Spanish were seeking to gain a military advantage over the Portuguese.[4] In 1668, the English physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne speculated in his encyclopedic work, Pseudodoxia Epidemica, that \"some Isthmus have been eaten through by the Sea, and others cut by the spade: And if the policy would permit, that of Panama in America were most worthy the attempt: it being but few miles over, and would open a shorter cut unto the East Indies and China\".[5] Given the strategic location of Panama, and the potential of its narrow isthmus separating two great oceans, other trade links in the area were attempted over the years. One early example of this was ill-fated Darien scheme, launched by the Kingdom of Scotland in 1698 to set up an overland trade route. Generally inhospitable conditions thwarted the effort, and it was abandoned in April 1700.[6] In 1788, Americans suggested that the Spanish should build the canal, since they controlled the colonies where it would be built. They said that this would be a less treacherous route for ships than going around the southern tip of South America, and that tropical ocean currents would naturally widen the canal after construction.[7] During an expedition from 1788 to 1793, Alessandro Malaspina outlined plans for construction of a canal.[8] Numerous canals were built in other countries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The success of the Erie Canal through central New York in the United States in the 1820s and the collapse of the Spanish Empire in Latin America resulted in growing American interest in building an inter-oceanic canal. Beginning in 1826, US officials began negotiations with Gran Colombia (present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama), hoping to gain a concession to build a canal. Jealous of their newly gained independence and fearing domination by the more powerful United States, president Simón Bolívar and New Granada officials declined American offers. After the collapse of Gran Colombia, New Granada remained unstable under constant government intrigue.[citation needed] Great Britain attempted to develop a canal in 1843. According to the New-York Daily Tribune, 24 August 1843, Barings Bank of London and the Republic of New Granada entered into a contract for the construction of a canal across the Isthmus of Darien (Isthmus of Panama). They referred to it as the Atlantic and Pacific Canal, and it was a wholly British endeavor. Projected for completion in five years, the plan was never carried out. At nearly the same time, other ideas were floated, including a canal (and/or a railroad) across Mexico's Isthmus of Tehuantepec. That did not develop, either.[9] In 1846, the Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty, negotiated between the US and New Granada, granted the United States transit rights and the right to intervene militarily in the isthmus. In 1848, the discovery of gold in California, on the West Coast of the United States, generated renewed interest in a canal crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. William Henry Aspinwall, who had won the federal subsidy to build and operate the Pacific mail steamships at around the same time, benefited from the gold discovery. Aspinwall's route included steamship legs from New York City to Panama, and from Panama to California, with an overland portage through Panama. This route with an overland leg in Panama was soon frequently traveled, as it provided one of the fastest connections between San Francisco, California, and the East Coast cities, about 40 days' transit in total. Nearly all the gold that was shipped out of California went by the fast Panama route. Several new and larger paddle steamers were soon plying this new route, including private steamship lines owned by American entrepreneur Cornelius Vanderbilt that made use of an overland route through Nicaragua, and the unfortunate SS Central America.[10][11] In 1850, the United States began construction of the Panama Railroad (now called the Panama Railway) to cross the isthmus; it opened in 1855. This overland link became a vital piece of Western Hemisphere infrastructure, greatly facilitating trade. The later canal route was constructed parallel to it, as it had helped clear dense forests.[citation needed] An all-water route between the oceans was still the goal. In 1855, William Kennish, a Manx-born engineer working for the United States government, surveyed the isthmus and issued a report on a route for a proposed Panama Canal.[12] His report was published as a book entitled The Practicability and Importance of a Ship Canal to Connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.[13][page needed] In 1876, Lucien Napoléon Bonaparte Wyse and his chief assistant Armand Réclus, both officers and engineers of the French Navy, explored several routes in the Darien-Atrato regions and made proposals including the construction of tunnels and locks.[14][page needed] A second Isthmian exploratory visit began on 6 December 1877, where two routes were explored in Panama, the San Blas route and a route from Bahía Limón to Panama City, the current Canal route. The French had achieved success in building the Suez Canal in the Middle East. While it was a lengthy project, they were encouraged to plan for a canal to cross the Panamanian isthmus.[15] Wyse went to Bogotá and on 20 March 1878, signed a treaty, in the name of the Société civile internationale du Canal interocéanique par l'isthme du Darien headed by general Étienne Türr, with the Colombian government, known as the Wyse concession, to build an interoceanic canal through Panama. The first attempt to construct a canal through what was then Colombia's province of Panama began on 1 January 1881. The project was inspired by the diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps, who was able to raise considerable funds in France as a result of the huge profits generated by his successful construction of the Suez Canal.[16] Although the Panama Canal needed to be only 40 percent as long as the Suez Canal, it was much more of an engineering challenge because of the combination of tropical rain forests, debilitating climate, the need for canal locks, and the lack of any ancient route to follow. Lesseps wanted a sea-level canal (like the Suez), but he visited the site only a few times, during the dry season which lasts only four months of the year.[17] His men were unprepared for the rainy season, during which the Chagres River, where the canal started, became a raging torrent, rising up to 10 m (33 ft). The dense jungle was alive with venomous snakes, insects, and spiders, but the worst challenges were yellow fever, malaria, and other tropical diseases, which killed thousands of workers; by 1884, the death rate was over 200 per month.[18] Public health measures were ineffective because the role of the mosquito as a disease vector was then unknown. Conditions were downplayed in France to avoid recruitment problems,[19] but the high mortality rate made it difficult to maintain an experienced workforce. Workers had to continually widen the main cut through the mountain at Culebra and reduce the angles of the slopes to minimize landslides into the canal.[20] Steam shovels were used in the construction of the canal, purchased from Bay City Industrial Works, a business owned by William L. Clements in Bay City, Michigan.[21] Bucket chain excavators manufactured by both Alphonse Couvreux and Wehyer & Richemond and Buette were also used.[22] Other mechanical and electrical equipment was limited in capabilities, and steel equipment rusted rapidly in the rainy climate.[23] In France, Lesseps kept the investment and supply of workers flowing long after it was obvious that the targets were not being met, but eventually the money ran out. The French effort went bankrupt in 1889 after reportedly spending US$287,000,000; an estimated 22,000 men died from disease and accidents, and the savings of 800,000 investors were lost.[19][24] Work was suspended on May 15, and in the ensuing scandal, known as the Panama affair, some of those deemed responsible were prosecuted, including Gustave Eiffel.[25] Lesseps and his son Charles were found guilty of misappropriation of funds and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. This sentence was later overturned, and the father, at age 88, was never imprisoned.[19] In 1894, a second French company, the Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama, was created to take over the project. A minimal workforce of a few thousand people was employed primarily to comply with the terms of the Colombian Panama Canal concession, to run the Panama Railroad, and to maintain the existing excavation and equipment in salable condition. The company sought a buyer for these assets, with an asking price of US$109,000,000. In the meantime, they continued with enough activity to maintain their franchise. Phillipe Bunau-Varilla, the French manager of the New Panama Canal Company, eventually managed to persuade Lesseps that a lock-and-lake canal was more realistic than a sea-level canal.[26] The Comité Technique, a high level technical committee, was formed by the Compagnie Nouvelle to review the studies and work—that already finished and that still ongoing—and come up with the best plan for completing the canal. The committee arrived on the Isthmus in February 1896 and went immediately, quietly and efficiently about their work of devising the best possible canal plan, which they presented on 16 November 1898. Many aspects of the plan were similar in principle to the canal that was finally built by the Americans in 1914.[27] It was a lock canal with two high level lakes to lift ships up and over the Continental Divide. Double locks would be 738 feet long and about 30 feet deep (225 m × 9 m); one chamber of each pair would be 82 feet (25 m) wide, the other 59 ft (18 m). There would be eight sets of locks, two at Bohio Soldado and two at Obispo on the Atlantic side; one at Paraiso, two at Pedro Miguel, and one at Miraflores on the Pacific. Artificial lakes would be formed by damming the Chagres River at Bohio and Alhajuela, providing both flood control and electric power. At this time, US President Theodore Roosevelt and the United States Senate were interested in establishing a canal across the isthmus, with some favoring a canal across Nicaragua and others advocating the purchase of the French interests in Panama. Bunau-Varilla, who was seeking American involvement, asked for $100 million, but accepted $40 million in the face of the Nicaraguan option. In June 1902, the US Senate voted in favor of the Spooner Act, to pursue the Panamanian option, provided the necessary rights could be obtained.[28] On 22 January 1903, the Hay–Herrán Treaty was signed by United States Secretary of State John M. Hay and Colombian Chargé Tomás Herrán. For $10 million and an annual payment, it would have granted the United States a renewable lease in perpetuity from Colombia on the land proposed for the canal.[29] The treaty was ratified by the US Senate on 14 March 1903, but the Senate of Colombia unanimously rejected the treaty since it had become significantly unpopular in Bogotá due to concerns over insufficient compensation, threat to sovereignty, and perpetuity.[30] Roosevelt changed tactics, based in part on the Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty of 1846, and actively supported the separation of Panama from Colombia. Shortly after recognizing Panama, he signed a treaty with the new Panamanian government under terms similar to the Hay–Herrán Treaty.[31] On 2 November 1903, US warships blocked sea lanes against possible Colombian troop movements en route to put down the Panama rebellion. Panama declared independence on 3 November 1903. The United States quickly recognized the new nation.[32] This happened so quickly that by the time the Colombian government in Bogotá launched a response to the Panamanian uprising US troops had already entered the rebelling province. The Colombian troops dispatched to Panama were hastily assembled conscripts with little training. While these conscripts may have been able to defeat the Panamanian rebels, they would not have been able to defeat the US army troops that were supporting the Panamanian rebels. The reason an army of conscripts was sent was that it was the best response the Colombians could muster, as Colombia still was recovering from a civil war between Liberals and Conservatives from October 1899, to November 1902, known as the \"Thousand Days War\". The US was fully aware of these conditions and even incorporated them into the planning of the Panama intervention as the US acted as an arbitrator between the two sides. The peace treaty that ended the \"Thousand Days War\" was signed on the USS Wisconsin on 21 November 1902. While in port, the US also brought engineering teams to Panama with the peace delegation to begin planning the canal's construction before the US had even gained the rights to build the canal. All these factors would result in the Colombians being unable to put down the Panamanian rebellion and expel the United States troops occupying what today is the independent nation of Panama.[33] On 6 November 1903, Philippe Bunau-Varilla, as Panama's ambassador to the United States, signed the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty, granting rights to the United States to build and indefinitely administer the Panama Canal Zone and its defenses. This is sometimes misinterpreted as the \"99-year lease\" because of misleading wording included in article 22 of the agreement.[34] Almost immediately, the treaty was condemned by many Panamanians as an infringement on their country's new national sovereignty.[35][36] This would later become a contentious diplomatic issue among Colombia, Panama, and the United States. President Roosevelt famously stated, \"I took the Isthmus, started the canal and then left Congress not to debate the canal, but to debate me.\" Several parties in the United States called this an act of war on Colombia: The New York Times described the support given by the United States to Bunau-Varilla as an \"act of sordid conquest\".[37][38] The New York Evening Post called it a \"vulgar and mercenary venture\".[39] The US maneuvers are often cited as the classic example of US gunboat diplomacy in Latin America, and the best illustration of what Roosevelt meant by the old African adage, \"Speak softly and carry a big stick [and] you will go far.\" After the revolution in 1903, the Republic of Panama became a US protectorate until 1939.[40] In 1904, the United States purchased the French equipment and excavations, including the Panama Railroad, for US$40 million, of which $30 million related to excavations completed, primarily in the Culebra Cut, valued at about $1.00 per cubic yard.[41] The United States also paid the new country of Panama $10 million and a $250,000 payment each following year. In 1921, Colombia and the United States entered into the Thomson–Urrutia Treaty, in which the United States agreed to pay Colombia $25 million: $5 million upon ratification, and four $5 million annual payments, and grant Colombia special privileges in the Canal Zone. In return, Colombia recognized Panama as an independent nation.[42] The US formally took control of the canal property on 4 May 1904, inheriting from the French a depleted workforce and a vast jumble of buildings, infrastructure, and equipment, much of it in poor condition. A US government commission, the Isthmian Canal Commission (ICC), was established to oversee construction; it was given control of the Panama Canal Zone, over which the United States exercised sovereignty.[43] The commission reported directly to Secretary of War William Howard Taft and was directed to avoid the inefficiency and corruption that had plagued the French 15 years earlier. On 6 May 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed John Findley Wallace, formerly chief engineer and finally general manager of the Illinois Central Railroad, as chief engineer of the Panama Canal Project. Overwhelmed by the disease-plagued country and forced to use often dilapidated French infrastructure and equipment,[44] as well as being frustrated by the overly bureaucratic ICC, Wallace resigned abruptly in June 1905.[45] The ICC brought on a new chairman, Theodore P. Shonts, and a new chief engineer was appointed, John Frank Stevens, a self-educated engineer who had built the Great Northern Railroad.[46] Stevens was not a member of the ICC; he increasingly viewed its bureaucracy as a serious hindrance, bypassing the commission and sending requests and demands directly to the Roosevelt administration in Washington, DC. One of Stevens' first achievements in Panama was in building and rebuilding the housing, cafeterias, hotels, water systems, repair shops, warehouses, and other infrastructure needed by the thousands of incoming workers. Stevens began the recruitment effort to entice thousands of workers from the United States and other areas to come to the Canal Zone to work. Workers from the Caribbean—called \"Afro-Panamanians\"—came in large numbers and many settled permanently. Stevens tried to provide accommodation in which the workers could work and live in reasonable safety and comfort. He also re-established and enlarged the railway, which was to prove crucial in transporting millions of tons of soil from the cut through the mountains to the dam across the Chagres River. Colonel William C. Gorgas had been appointed chief sanitation officer of the canal construction project in 1904. Gorgas implemented a range of measures to minimize the spread of deadly diseases, particularly yellow fever and malaria, which had recently been shown to be mosquito-borne following the work of Cuban epidemiologist, Carlos Finlay and American pathologist, Walter Reed.[47] Investment was made in extensive sanitation projects, including city water systems, fumigation of buildings, spraying of insect-breeding areas with oil and larvicide, installation of mosquito netting and window screens, and elimination of stagnant water. Despite opposition from the commission (one member said his ideas were barmy), Gorgas persisted, and when Stevens arrived, he threw his weight behind the project. After two years of extensive work, the mosquito-spread diseases were nearly eliminated.[48] Despite the monumental effort, about 5,600 workers died from disease and accidents during the US construction phase of the canal. Besides healthier and far better living conditions for the workers, another benefit given to American citizens working on the Canal was a medal for two years of service. Additional bars were added for each two-year period after that. Designed by Victor D. Brenner and featuring the then-current president they were popularly known as The Roosevelt Medal. A total of 7189 were ultimately issued, with a few people receiving as many as four bars.[49] Certificates are available today.[50] In 1905, a US engineering panel was commissioned to review the canal design, which had not been finalized. In January 1906 the panel, in a majority of eight to five, recommended to President Roosevelt a sea-level canal,[51] as had been attempted by the French and temporarily abandoned by them in 1887 for a ten locks system designed by Philippe Bunau-Varilla, and definitively in 1898 for a lock-and-lake canal designed by the Comité Technique of the Compagnie Nouvelle de Canal de Panama as conceptualized by Adolphe Godin de Lépinay in 1879.[52] But in 1906 Stevens, who had seen the Chagres in full flood, was summoned to Washington; he declared a sea-level approach to be \"an entirely untenable proposition\". He argued in favor of a canal using a lock system to raise and lower ships from a large reservoir 85 ft (26 m) above sea level. This would create both the largest dam (Gatun Dam) and the largest human-made lake (Gatun Lake) in the world at that time. The water to refill the locks would be taken from Gatun Lake by opening and closing enormous gates and valves and letting gravity propel the water from the lake. Gatun Lake would connect to the Pacific through the mountains at the Gaillard (Culebra) Cut. Unlike Godin de Lépinay with the Congrès International d'Etudes du Canal Interocéanique, Stevens successfully convinced Roosevelt of the necessity and feasibility of this alternative scheme.[53] The construction of a canal with locks required the excavation of more than 17 million cu yd (13 million m3) of material over and above the 30 million cu yd (23 million m3) excavated by the French. As quickly as possible, the Americans replaced or upgraded the old, unusable French equipment with new construction equipment that was designed for a much larger and faster scale of work. 102 large, railroad-mounted steam shovels were purchased, 77 from Bucyrus-Erie, and 25 from the Marion Power Shovel Company. These were joined by enormous steam-powered cranes, giant hydraulic rock crushers, concrete mixers, dredges, and pneumatic power drills, nearly all of which were manufactured by new, extensive machine-building technology developed and built in the United States. The railroad also had to be comprehensively upgraded with heavy-duty, double-tracked rails over most of the line to accommodate new rolling stock. In many places, the new Gatun Lake flooded over the original rail line, and a new line had to be constructed above Gatun Lake's waterline. Between 1912 and 1914 there was a controversy about the tolls for the canal.[54] In 1907, Stevens resigned as chief engineer.[55] His replacement, appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt, was US Army Major George Washington Goethals of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Soon to be promoted to lieutenant colonel and later to general, he was a strong, West Point-trained leader and civil engineer with experience in canals (unlike Stevens). Goethals directed the work in Panama to a successful conclusion in 1914, two years ahead of the target date of 10 June 1916.[56] Goethals divided the engineering and excavation work into three divisions: Atlantic, Central, and Pacific. The Atlantic Division, under Major William L. Sibert, was responsible for construction of the massive breakwater at the entrance to Bahía Limón, the Gatun locks, and their 3+1⁄2-mile (5.6 km) approach channel, and the immense Gatun Dam. The Pacific Division, under Sydney B. Williamson (the only civilian member of this high-level team), was similarly responsible for the Pacific 3-mile (4.8 km) breakwater in Panama Bay, the approach channel to the locks, and the Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks and their associated dams and reservoirs.[57] The Central Division, under Major David du Bose Gaillard of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, was assigned one of the most difficult parts: excavating the Culebra Cut through the continental divide to connect Gatun Lake to the Pacific Panama Canal locks.[58] On 10 October 1913, President Woodrow Wilson sent a signal from the White House by telegraph which triggered the explosion that destroyed the Gamboa Dike. This flooded the Culebra Cut, thereby joining the Atlantic and Pacific oceans via the Panama Canal.[59] Alexandre La Valley (a floating crane built by Lobnitz & Company and launched in 1887) was the first self-propelled vessel to transit the canal from ocean to ocean. This vessel crossed the canal from the Atlantic in stages during construction, finally reaching the Pacific on 7 January 1914.[60] SS Cristobal (a cargo and passenger ship built by Maryland Steel, and launched in 1902 as SS Tremont) on 3 August 1914, was the first ship to transit the canal from ocean to ocean.[61] The construction of the canal was completed in 1914, 401 years after Panama was first crossed overland by the Europeans in Vasco Núñez de Balboa's party of conquistadores. The United States spent almost $500 million (roughly equivalent to $15.2 billion in 2023)[62] to finish the project. This was by far the largest American engineering project to date. The canal was formally opened on 15 August 1914, with the passage of the cargo ship SS Ancon.[63] The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 caused a severe drop in traffic along Chilean ports due to shifts in maritime trade routes,[64][65][66] despite the closure of the canal for nearly seven months after a landslide in the Culebra Cut on 18 September 1915.[67] The burgeoning sheep farming business in southern Patagonia suffered a significant setback by the change in trade routes,[68] as did the economy of the Falkland Islands.[69] Throughout this time, Ernest \"Red\" Hallen was hired by the Isthmian Canal Commission to document the progress of the work. In 1914, steam shovels from the Panama Canal were purchased and put to use in Chuquicamata copper mine of northern Chile.[70] By the 1930s, water supply became an issue for the canal, prompting construction of the Madden Dam across the Chagres River above Gatun Lake. Completed in 1935, the dam created Madden Lake (later Alajuela Lake), which provides additional water storage for the canal.[71] In 1939, construction began on a further major improvement: a new set of locks large enough to carry the larger warships that the United States was building at the time and planned to continue building. The work proceeded for several years, and significant excavation was carried out on the new approach channels, but the project was canceled after World War II.[72][73] After World War II, US control of the canal and the Canal Zone surrounding it became contentious; relations between Panama and the United States became increasingly tense. Many Panamanians felt that the Zone rightfully belonged to Panama; student protests were met by the fencing-in of the zone and an increased military presence there.[74] Demands for the United States to hand over the canal to Panama increased after the Suez Crisis in 1956, when the United States used financial and diplomatic pressure to force France and the UK to abandon their attempt to retake control of the Suez Canal, previously nationalized by the Nasser regime in Egypt. Panamanian unrest culminated in riots on Martyr's Day, 9 January 1964, when about 20 Panamanians and 3–5 US soldiers were killed.[75] A decade later, in 1974, negotiations toward a settlement began and resulted in the Torrijos–Carter Treaties. On 7 September 1977, the treaty was signed by President of the United States Jimmy Carter and Omar Torrijos, de facto leader of Panama. This mobilized the process of granting the Panamanians free control of the canal so long as Panama signed a treaty guaranteeing the permanent neutrality of the canal. The treaty led to full Panamanian control effective at noon on 31 December 1999, and the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) assumed command of the waterway. The Panama Canal remains one of the chief revenue sources for Panama.[76][77] Before this handover, the government of Panama held an international bid to negotiate a 25-year contract for operation of the container shipping ports located at the canal's Atlantic and Pacific outlets. The contract was not affiliated with the ACP or Panama Canal operations and was won by the firm Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong–based shipping interest owned by Li Ka-shing.[78] On 21 December 2024, President-elect Donald Trump threatened that the United States would retake control of the Panama Canal from Panama, claiming that the rates Panama was charging American ships were \"exorbitant\" and in violation of the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.[79] The following day, Trump claimed that the canal was \"falling into the wrong hands\" and brought up China. Shortly afterwards, Panamanian president José Raúl Mulino responded, denying that the United States was being unfairly charged, that anyone besides Panama was in full control of the canal, and that the canal was part of the country's \"inalienable patrimony\".[80] While globally the Atlantic Ocean is east of the isthmus and the Pacific is west, the general direction of the canal passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific is from northwest to southeast, because of the shape of the isthmus at the point the canal occupies. The Bridge of the Americas (Spanish: Puente de las Américas) at the Pacific side is about a third of a degree east of the Colón end on the Atlantic side.[82] Still, in formal nautical communications, the simplified directions \"southbound\" and \"northbound\" are used. The canal consists of artificial lakes, several improved and artificial channels, and three sets of locks. An additional artificial lake, Alajuela Lake (known during the American era as Madden Lake), acts as a reservoir for the canal. The layout of the canal as seen by a ship passing from the Atlantic to the Pacific is:[83] Thus, the total length of the canal is 80 km (50 mi). In 2017 it took ships an average of 11.38 hours to pass between the canal's two outer locks.[84] Download coordinates as: Created in 1913 by damming the Chagres River, the Gatun Lake is a key part of the Panama Canal, providing the millions of liters of water necessary to operate its locks each time a ship passes through. At time of formation, Gatun Lake was the largest human-made lake in the world. Because of the importance of the canal to international trade, many ships are built to the maximum size allowed. For its first century, the width and length of ships that may transit the canal was limited by the Pedro Miguel Locks; their draft by the canal's minimum 12.6 m (41.2 ft) depth; and their height by the main span of the Bridge of the Americas at Balboa. Ships built to those limits are known as Panamax vessels. A Panamax cargo ship typically has a deadweight tonnage (DWT) of 65,000–80,000 tons, but its actual cargo is restricted to about 52,500 tons because of the canal's draft restrictions within the canal.[85] The longest ship ever to transit the canal was the San Juan Prospector (now Marcona Prospector), an ore-bulk-oil carrier that is 296.57 m (973 ft) long with a beam of 32.31 m (106 ft).[86] Initially the locks at Gatun were designed to be 28.5 m (94 ft) wide. In 1908, the United States Navy requested that the width be increased to at least 36 m (118 ft) to allow the passage of large warships. A compromise was made and the locks were built 33.53 m (110.0 ft) wide. Each lock is 320 m (1,050 ft) long, with the walls ranging in thickness from 15 m (49 ft) at the base to 3 m (9.8 ft) at the top. The central wall between the parallel locks at Gatun is 18 m (59 ft) thick and over 24 m (79 ft) high. The steel lock gates measure an average of 2 m (6.6 ft) thick, 19.5 m (64 ft) wide, and 20 m (66 ft) high.[87] Panama Canal pilots were initially unprepared to handle the flight decks of aircraft carriers, which protrude beyond the hull on either side of the ship. When USS Saratoga made her first trip through the Gatun Locks in 1928, the ship knocked over all the concrete lamp posts along the canal.[88] In 2016, a decade-long expansion project created larger locks, allowing bigger ships to transit through deeper and wider channels.[89] The allowed dimensions of ships using these locks increased by 25 percent in length, 51 percent in beam, and 26 percent in draft, as defined by Neopanamax metrics.[90] As with a toll road, vessels transiting the canal must pay tolls. Tolls for the canal are set by the Panama Canal Authority and are based on vessel type, size, and the type of cargo.[91] For container ships, the toll is assessed on the ship's capacity expressed in twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), one TEU being the size of a standard intermodal shipping container. Effective 1 April 2016, this toll went from US$74 per loaded container to $60 per TEU capacity plus $30 per loaded container for a potential $90 per TEU when the ship is full. A Panamax container ship may carry up to 4,400 TEU. The toll is calculated differently for passenger ships and for container ships carrying no cargo (\"in ballast\"). As of April 1, 2016[update], the ballast rate is US$60, down from US$65.60 per TEU. Passenger vessels in excess of 30,000 tons (PC/UMS) pay a rate based on the number of berths, that is, the number of passengers that can be accommodated in permanent beds. Since 1 April 2016, the per-berth charge is $111 for unoccupied berths and $138 for occupied berths in the Panamax locks. Starting in 2007, this fee has greatly increased the tolls for such ships.[92] Passenger vessels of less than 30,000 tons or less than 33 tons per passenger are charged according to the same per-ton schedule as are freighters. Almost all major cruise ships have more than 33 tons per passenger; the rule of thumb for cruise line comfort is generally given as a minimum of 40 tons per passenger. Most other types of vessels pay a toll per PC/UMS net ton, in which one \"ton\" is actually a volume of 100 cubic feet (2.83 m3). (The calculation of tonnage for commercial vessels is quite complex.) As of fiscal year 2016[update], this toll is US$5.25 per ton for the first 10,000 tons, US$5.14 per ton for the next 10,000 tons, and US$5.06 per ton thereafter. As with container ships, reduced tolls are charged for freight ships \"in ballast\", $4.19, $4.12, $4.05 respectively. On 1 April 2016, a more complicated toll system was introduced, having the neopanamax locks at a higher rate in some cases, natural gas transport as a new separate category and other changes.[93] As of 1 October 2017, there are modified tolls and categories of tolls in effect.[94] Small (less than 125 ft) vessels up to 583 PC/UMS net tons when carrying passengers or cargo, or up to 735 PC/UMS net tons when in ballast, or up to 1,048 fully loaded displacement tons, are assessed minimum tolls based upon their length overall, according to the following table (as of 29 April 2015): Morgan Adams of Los Angeles, California, holds the distinction of paying the first toll received by the U.S. government for the use of the Panama Canal by a pleasure boat. His boat Lasata passed through the Zone on 14 August 1914. The crossing occurred during a 10,000-kilometer (6,000-mile) sea voyage from Jacksonville, Florida, to Los Angeles in 1914.[95] The most expensive regular toll for canal passage to date was charged on 14 April 2010, to the cruise ship Norwegian Pearl, which paid US$375,600.[96][97] The average toll is around US$54,000. The highest fee for priority passage charged through the Transit Slot Auction System was US$220,300, paid on 24 August 2006, by the Panamax tanker Erikoussa,[98] bypassing a 90-ship queue waiting for the end of maintenance work on the Gatun Locks, and thus avoiding a seven-day delay. The normal fee would have been just US$13,430.[99] The lowest toll ever paid was 36 cents (equivalent to $6.39 in 2023), by American Richard Halliburton who swam the Panama Canal in 1928.[100] Opponents to the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties feared that efficiency and maintenance would suffer following the U.S. withdrawal from the Panama Canal Zone; however, this has been proven not to be the case. In 2004, it was reported that canal operations, capitalizing on practices developed during the American administration, were improving under Panamanian control.[101] Canal Waters Time (CWT), the average time it takes a vessel to navigate the canal, including waiting time, is a key measure of efficiency; in the first decade of the 2000s, it ranged between 20 and 30 hours, according to the ACP. The accident rate has also not changed appreciably in the past decade, varying between 10 and 30 accidents each year from about 14,000 total annual transits.[102][103][104] An official accident is one in which a formal investigation is requested and conducted. Increasing volumes of imports from Asia, which previously landed on US West Coast ports, are now passing through the canal to the American East Coast.[105] The total number of ocean-going transits increased from 11,725 in 2003 to 13,233 in 2007, falling to 12,855 in 2009. (The canal's fiscal year runs from October through September.)[106] This has been coupled with a steady rise in average ship size and in the numbers of Panamax vessels passing through the canal, so that the total tonnage carried rose from 227.9 million PC/UMS tons in fiscal year 1999 to a then record high of 312.9 million tons in 2007, and falling to 299.1 million tons in 2009.[82][106] Tonnage for fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015 was 320.6, 326.8 and 340.8 million PC/UMS tons carried on 13,660, 13,481 and 13,874 transits respectively.[107] In the first decade after the transfer to Panamanian control, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) invested nearly US$1 billion in widening and modernizing the canal, with the aim of increasing capacity by 20 percent.[108] The ACP cites a number of major improvements, including the widening and straightening of the Culebra Cut to reduce restrictions on passing vessels, the deepening of the navigational channel in Gatun Lake to reduce draft restrictions and improve water supply, and the deepening of the Atlantic and Pacific entrances to the canal. This is supported by new equipment, such as a new drill barge and suction dredger, and an increase of the tug boat fleet by 20 percent. In addition, improvements have been made to the canal's operating machinery, including an increased and improved tug locomotive fleet, the replacement of more than 16 km (10 mi) of locomotive track, and new lock machinery controls. Improvements have been made to the traffic management system to allow more efficient control over ships in the canal.[109] In December 2010, record-breaking rains caused a 17-hour closure of the canal; this was the first closure since the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989.[110][111] The rains also caused an access road to the Centenario Bridge to collapse.[112][113][114][115] The canal handles more vessel traffic than had ever been envisioned by its builders. In 1934 it was estimated that the maximum capacity of the canal would be around 80 million tons per year;[116] as noted above, canal traffic in 2015 reached 340.8 million tons of shipping. To improve capacity, a number of improvements have been made to maximize the use of the locking system:[117] These improvements enlarged the capacity from 300 million PCUMS (2008) to 340 PCUMS (2012). These improvements were started before the new locks project, and are complementary to it. The canal faces increasing competition from other quarters. Because canal tolls have risen as ships have become larger, some critics[119] have suggested that the Suez Canal is now a viable alternative for cargo between Asia and the US East Coast.[120] The Panama Canal, however, continues to serve more than 144 of the world's trade routes and the majority of canal traffic comes from the \"all-water route\" from Asia to the US East and Gulf Coasts.[121] An alternative route through Nicaragua and Lake Nicaragua has been proposed. On 15 June 2013, Nicaragua awarded the Hong Kong-based HKND Group a 50-year concession to develop a canal through the country.[122] In February 2018, analysts widely viewed the project as defunct,[123][124][125] though the head of the project insisted work was on-going. In April 2018 HKND Group closed its offices, leaving no forwarding address or telephone numbers to be reached.[126] The increasing rate of melting of ice in the Arctic Ocean has led to speculation that the Northwest Passage or Arctic Bridge may become viable for commercial shipping. This route would save 9,300 km (5,800 mi) on the route from Asia to Europe compared with the Panama Canal, possibly leading to a diversion of some traffic to that route. However, such a route is beset by unresolved territorial issues and would still hold significant problems owing to ice.[127] Gatun Lake is filled with rainwater, and the lake accumulates excess water during wet months. For the old locks, water is lost to the oceans at a rate of 101,000 m3 (26.7 million US gal; 81.9 acre⋅ft) per downward lock movement.[128] The ship's submerged volume is not relevant to this amount of water. During the dry season, when there is less rainfall, there is also a shortage of water in Gatun Lake.[129] As a signatory to the 2000 United Nations Global Compact and member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the ACP developed an environmentally and socially sustainable program for expansion, which protects the aquatic and terrestrial resources of the canal watershed. The expansion uses three water-saving basins at each new lock, diminishing water loss. It also preserves freshwater resources along the waterway by reusing 60 percent of water from the basins in the locks in each transit.[130] The mean sea level at the Pacific side is about 20 cm (8 in) higher than that of the Atlantic side due to differences in ocean conditions such as water density and weather.[131] The 2015-16 fiscal year was one of the driest periods on record, restricting ships passage;[132] 2019 was the fifth driest year for 70 years. Temperature rise has also caused an increase in evaporation.[133] In normal times, 36 ships can transit the canal each day, but in early December 2023, ships were backing up because only 22 ships per day could transit due to low water levels.[134] In January 2024, 24 ships per day were allowed to transit.[135] As demand is rising for efficient global shipping of goods, the canal is positioned to be a significant feature of world shipping for the foreseeable future. However, changes in shipping patterns—particularly the increasing numbers of larger-than-Panamax ships—necessitated changes to the canal for it to retain a significant market share. In 2006 it was anticipated that by 2011, 37 percent of the world's container ships would be too large for the present canal, and hence a failure to expand would result in a significant loss of market share. The maximum sustainable capacity of the original canal, given some relatively minor improvement work, was estimated at 340 million PC/UMS tons per year; it was anticipated that this capacity would be reached between 2009 and 2012. Close to 50 percent of transiting vessels were already using the full width of the locks.[136] An enlargement scheme to allow for a greater number of transits and the ability to handle larger ships, similar to the Third Lock Scheme of 1939, had been under consideration for some time,[137] and by 2006 Panama's government canal authority was recommending such a plan.[138][139] The expansion proposal, with a cost estimate of US$5.25 billion, was expected to double the canal's shipping capacity by allowing both the passage of longer and wider Post-Panamax ships and an increase in overall traffic. This proposal was approved in a national referendum by about 80 percent on 22 October 2006.[140] The canal expansion was built between 2007 and 2016.[89] The expansion plan had two new flights of locks built parallel to, and operated in addition to, the old locks: one east of the existing Gatun locks, and one southwest of the Miraflores locks, each supported by approach channels. Each flight ascends from sea level directly to the level of Gatun Lake; the existing two-stage ascent at Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks was not replicated. The new lock chambers feature sliding gates, doubled for safety, and are 427 m (1,400 ft) long, 55 m (180 ft) wide, and 18.3 m (60 ft) deep. This allows the transit of vessels with a beam of up to 49 m (160 ft), an overall length of up to 366 m (1,200 ft) and a draft of up to 15 m (49 ft), equivalent to a container ship carrying around 12,000 containers, each 6.1 m (20 ft) in length (TEU). The new locks are supported by new approach channels, including a 6.2 km (3.9 mi) channel at Miraflores from the locks to the Gaillard Cut, skirting Miraflores Lake. Each of these channels are 218 m (720 ft) wide, which will require post-Panamax vessels to navigate the channels in one direction at a time. The Gaillard Cut and the channel through Gatun Lake were widened to at least 280 m (920 ft) on the straight portions and at least 366 m (1,200 ft) on the bends. The maximum level of Gatun Lake was raised from 26.7 to 27.1 m (88 to 89 ft). Each flight of locks is accompanied by nine water reuse basins (three per lock chamber), each basin being about 70 m (230 ft) wide, 430 m (1,400 ft) long and 5.50 m (18 ft) deep. These gravity-fed basins allow 60 percent of the water used in each transit to be reused; the new locks consequently use 7 percent less water per transit than each of the existing lock lanes. The deepening of Gatun Lake and the raising of its maximum water level also provide capacity for significantly more water storage. These measures are intended to allow the expanded canal to operate without constructing new reservoirs. The estimated cost of the project is US$5.25 billion. The project was designed to allow for an anticipated growth in traffic from 280 million PC/UMS tons in 2005 to nearly 510 million PC/UMS tons in 2025. The expanded canal will have a maximum sustainable capacity of about 600 million PC/UMS tons per year. Tolls will continue to be calculated based on vessel tonnage, and in some cases depend on the locks used. An article in the February 2007 issue of Popular Mechanics magazine described the engineering aspects of the expansion project.[141] There is also a follow-up article in the February 2010 issue of Popular Mechanics.[142] On 3 September 2007, thousands of Panamanians stood across from Paraíso Hill in Panama to witness a huge initial explosion and launch of the Expansion Program. The first phase of the project was the dry excavations of the 218 meters (715 feet) wide trench connecting the Gaillard Cut with the Pacific coast, removing 47 million cubic meters of earth and rock.[143] By June 2012, a 30 m reinforced concrete monolith had been completed, the first of 46 such monoliths which will line the new Pacific-side lock walls.[144] By early July 2012, however, it was announced that the canal expansion project had fallen six months behind schedule, leading expectations for the expansion to open in April 2015 rather than October 2014, as originally planned.[145] By September 2014, the new gates were projected to be open for transit at the \"beginning of 2016\".[146][147][148][149] It was announced in July 2009 that the Belgian dredging company Jan De Nul, together with a consortium of contractors consisting of the Spanish Sacyr Vallehermoso, the Italian Impregilo, and the Panamanian company Grupo Cusa, had been awarded the contract to build the six new locks for US$3.1 billion, which was one billion less than the next highest competing bid due to having a concrete budget 71 percent smaller than that of the next bidder and allotted roughly 25 percent less for steel to reinforce that concrete. The contract resulted in $100 million in dredging works over the next few years for the Belgian company and a great deal of work for its construction division. The design of the locks is a carbon copy of the Berendrecht Lock, which is 68 m wide and 500 m long, making it the second largest lock in the world after the Kieldrecht lock in the port of Antwerp, Belgium. Completed in 1989 by the Port of Antwerp, which De Nul helped build, the company still has engineers and specialists who were part of that project.[150] In January 2014, a contract dispute threatened the progress of the project.[151][152] There was a delay of less than two months however, with work by the consortium members reaching goals by June 2014.[153][154] In June 2015, flooding of the new locks began: first on the Atlantic side, then on the Pacific; by then, the canal's re-inauguration was slated for April 2016.[155][156][157] On 23 March 2016, the expansion inauguration was set for 26 June 2016.[158] The new locks opened for commercial traffic on 26 June 2016, and the first ship to cross the canal using the third set of locks was a modern Neopanamax vessel, the Chinese-owned container ship Cosco Shipping Panama.[89] The original locks, now over 100 years old, allow engineers greater access for maintenance, and are projected to continue operating indefinitely.[136] After the construction of the new locks, in addition to the already existing ones, to date the ship with the largest dimensions transiting the \"Panama Canal new sideway\", had the following dimensions: 366.47 meters in length, 48.23 meters in width and 15 meters draft.[citation needed] The total cost is unknown since the expansion's contractors are seeking at least an additional US$3.4 billion from the canal authority due to excess expenses.[159] The Panama Canal, one of the most important chokepoints in global trade, has caused many environmental and ecological problems since it was built and expanded. These problems include deforestation, the spread of invasive species and water and air pollution, and water shortage. Deforestation in the Panama Canal watershed has been a problem for decades. In 1978, researchers said that \"clearing the forest in the watershed might kill the canal.\"[160] By 1985, the forested area had dropped to 30%.[161] As of 2000, deforestation from human population growth, land degradation, and erosion continued to harm the ecosystem.[160] Deforestation causes erosion, which raises the bottoms of the Gatún and Alajuela Lakes and lowers their ability to hold water.[161] These lakes are very important for both canal operations and the local water supply. The Panama Canal has made it easier for invasive species to move between oceans. When the canal was expanded in 2016 with the third set of locks, global trade increased, and so did the spread of invasive species. These species cling to the ship and move from one place to another, something that without the boats they would not have been able to do[162]. One example is the Asian green mussel, first found in Caribbean waters in the late 1990s, which has spread through the canal.[163] These invasive species can harm local ecosystems and compete with native species. Ships passing through the canal regularly pollute the water. For example, in 1986, a crude oil spill east of the Caribbean entrance to the canal killed plants and invertebrates in the area.[164] The shipping industry also releases emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. The Panama Canal, as a chokepoint, has a lot of heavy traffic and delays, which leads to burning more fuel and producing more emissions than needed. These emissions are a big concern because they contribute to climate change and increase environmental problems. The Panama Canal uses a lot of fresh water from the Gatún Lake, which is Panama City's, primary source of potable water. For each ship that passes through, about 200 million liters (52 million gallons) of freshwater are needed.[1] This water use has serious environmental and social impacts. During a drought in 2019, Gatún Lake's water levels dropped to historic lows because so much water was being used for the canal.[165] On 7 July 2014, Wang Jing, chairman of the HK Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Co. Ltd. (HKND Group) advised that a route for Nicaragua's proposed canal had been approved. The construction work was projected by HKND to begin in 2014 and take 5 years,[166] although there had been little progress before the project's abandonment.[167] The Nicaraguan parliament approved plans for the 280 km (174 mi) canal through Nicaragua and according to the deal, the company would have been responsible for operating and maintaining the canal for a 50-year period. By May 2017, no concrete action had been reportedly taken constructing the canal and further doubts were expressed about its financing.[168] In February 2018, analysts widely viewed the project as defunct, though the head of the project insisted work was on-going and HKND retained the legal rights to the concession for the canal as well as side projects. Despite HKND vanishing in April 2018,[169] the Nicaraguan government indicates that it will continue with the 908 km2 (351 sq mi) dry land expropriations within Nicaragua, under land expropriation Canal Law 840. In 2011, Colombia's then-president Juan Manuel Santos announced a proposal for a 220 km (137 mi) railway between Colombia's Pacific and Caribbean coasts.[170][171] However, in 2015 the director of the Colombia-China Chamber of Commerce said the proposal \"was mentioned in 2011 and subsequently had minimal relevance\".[172] Climate change has thinned much of the ice that in the past made this route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans impassable. Satellite navigation can help monitor location of the ice which remains, further easing transit. A few ships have successfully crossed the previously impossible route since 2000.[173] Since 2019, Mexico has been building a corridor of its own, known as the Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (CIIT, by its initials in Spanish), which will use primarily a railway, the Tren Interoceánico, to transport cargo and passengers from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic.[174] It is planned to open on 22 December 2023, and for all the works related to it to have begun operation by July 2024.[175][176] This idea is older than the Panama Canal itself, with the original Tehuantepec Railway, which is being rehabilitated for the CIIT, being inaugurated in 1907 to initial success, but falling out of use due to the Mexican Revolution and the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. The current Corridor is expected to have certain advantages over the Panama Canal, such as its speed, being able to transport cargo from one ocean to the other in about six hours,[177] and its location, being closer to the United States than Panama, in addition to the creation of ten industrial parks in the Isthmus with various tax benefits to encourage private investment.[178] However, despite being often described as a potential alternative/competitor to the Panama Canal, the ambassador of Panama in Mexico, Alfredo Oranges, and the former director of the CIIT, Rafael Marín Mollinedo, have stated that they do not see the CIIT in this way, and that they prefer to see it as a \"complement\" to the Panama Canal, which could relieve the intense traffic the Canal has to cope with. The ambassador even proposed collaborating with the Mexican government to make the Corridor more efficient.[179][180] Individuals, companies, and governments have explored the possibility of constructing deep water ports and rail links connecting coasts as a \"dry canal\" in Guatemala, Costa Rica, and El Salvador/Honduras. However, plans to construct these sea-rail-sea links have yet to materialize.[181] During the last one hundred years, the Panama Canal Authority has granted membership in the \"Esteemed Order of Bearers of the Master Key of the Panama Canal\" and appointed a few \"Honorary Lead Pilots\" to employees, captains and dignitaries.[182] One of the most recent was U.S. Federal Maritime Commissioner Louis Sola, who was awarded for his work for supporting seafarers during the COVID-19 pandemic and previously transiting the canal more than 100 times.[183] On the date of 25 April 2006, was awarded the title of Panama Canal Honorary Pilot the Senior Captain Raffaele Minotauro, an Unlimited Oceangoing Shipmaster Senior Grade, of the former Italian governmental navigation company known as the \"Italian Line\".[184] Another of the said important award was given to the Commodore Ronald Warwick in 2014,[185] a former Master of the Cunard Liners Queen Elizabeth 2 and RMS Queen Mary 2, who has traversed the Canal more than 50 times.

The Panama Canal is a constructed waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans across the Isthmus of Panama. It is owned and administered by Panama, and it is 40 miles long from shoreline to shoreline. Ships can cross going in either direction, and it takes about 10 hours to get from one side to the other. Ships from any country are treated equally with respect to conditions of passage and tolls. Before the Panama Canal was built, ships traveling between the east and west coasts of the American continents had to go around Cape Horn in South America, a voyage that was some 8,000 nautical miles longer then going through the canal and that took about two months to complete. All journeys between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans are shortened by thousands of nautical miles by going through the canal. The Panama Canal was made by building dams on the Chagres River to create Gatun Lake and Lake Madden, digging the Gaillard Cut from the river between the two lakes and over the Continental Divide, building locks between the Atlantic Ocean and Gatun Lake to lift boats to the lake and another set of locks at the end of the Gaillard Cut to lower ships, and digging a channel to the Pacific Ocean. A mountain range runs the length of Panama, including through the Canal Zone, though it is lower there. In addition, the tidal levels of the oceans on either side of the Panama Canal differ. Locks raise ships to the level of the lakes (which account for about half the distance of the canal) and then lower them to sea level. A French company headed by Ferdinand, viscount de Lesseps, started to build a canal in 1881 but failed by 1889. The United States, led by Pres. Theodore Roosevelt, negotiated the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty, giving the U.S. control of the Canal Zone. Work under U.S. supervision began in 1904, and the Panama Canal was completed in 1914. Tens of thousands of people, mostly labourers from Barbados, Martinique, and Guadeloupe, worked on the project. Panama Canal, lock-type canal, owned and administered by the Republic of Panama, that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the narrow Isthmus of Panama. The length of the Panama Canal from shoreline to shoreline is about 40 miles (65 km) and from deep water in the Atlantic (more specifically, the Caribbean Sea) to deep water in the Pacific about 50 miles (82 km). The canal, which was completed in August 1914, is one of the two most strategic artificial waterways in the world, the other being the Suez Canal. Ships sailing between the east and west coasts of the United States, which otherwise would be obliged to round Cape Horn in South America, shorten their voyage by about 8,000 nautical miles (15,000 km) by using the canal. Savings of up to 3,500 nautical miles (6,500 km) are also made on voyages between one coast of North America and ports on the other side of South America. Ships sailing between Europe and East Asia or Australia can save as much as 2,000 nautical miles (3,700 km) by using the canal. From its opening in 1914 until 1979, the Panama Canal was controlled solely by the United States, which built it. In 1979, however, control of the canal passed to the Panama Canal Commission, a joint agency of the United States and the Republic of Panama, and complete control passed to Panama at noon on December 31, 1999. Administration of the canal is the responsibility of the Panama Canal Authority (Spanish: Autoridad del Canal de Panamá [ACP]), which answers solely to the government of Panama. The Panama Canal lies at a latitude of 9° N, at a point where the North American Continental Divide dips to one of its lowest points. The canal does not, as is generally supposed, cross the isthmus from east to west. It runs due south from its entrance at Colón on the Atlantic side through the Gatún Locks to a point in the widest portion of Gatún Lake; it then turns sharply toward the east and follows a course generally to the southeast until it reaches the Bay of Panama, on the Pacific side. Its terminus near Balboa is some 25 miles (40 km) east of its terminus near Colón. Parallel to the canal are the Panama Canal Railway and the Boyd-Roosevelt Highway. In passing from the Atlantic to the Pacific, vessels enter the approach channel in Limón Bay, which extends a distance of about 7 miles (11 km) to the Gatún Locks. At Gatún a series of three locks lifts vessels 85 feet (26 metres) to Gatún Lake. The lake, formed by Gatún Dam on the Chagres River and supplemented by waters from Alajuela Lake (Lake Madden; formed by the Madden Dam), covers an area of 166 square miles (430 square km). The channel through the lake varies in depth from 46 to 85 feet (14 to 26 metres) and extends for about 23 miles (37 km) to Gamboa. Gaillard (Culebra) Cut begins at Gamboa and passes through the Continental Divide. The channel through the cut has an average depth of about 43 feet (13 metres) and extends some 8 miles (13 km) to the Pedro Miguel Locks. The locks lower vessels 30 feet (9 metres) to Miraflores Lake, at an elevation of 52 feet (16 metres) above sea level. Vessels then pass through a channel almost 1.2 miles (2 km) long to the two-stepped locks at Miraflores, where they are lowered to sea level. The final segment of the canal is a dredged approach passage 7 miles long through which ships pass into the Pacific. Throughout its length the canal has a minimum bottom width of 500 feet (150 metres); in Gatún Lake the width of the channel varies between 500 and 1,000 feet (150 and 300 metres), and in Miraflores Lake the width is 740 feet (225 metres).",

Built in one of the narrowest areas of the continent, the interoceanic highway links North America with South America. The Canal uses a system of locks – compartments with entrance and exit doors. The locks function as water lifts: they raise the ships from sea level (either Pacific or Atlantic) to the level of Gatun Lake (26 meters above sea level); thus, ships navigate through the channel of the Canal, in the Central Cordillera of Panama. Each set of locks bears the name of the town where it was built: Gatún (on the Atlantic side), Pedro Miguel and Miraflores (on the Pacific). The chambers – steps – of the locks are 33.53 meters wide by 304.8 meters long. The maximum dimensions for ships that wish to transit through the Canal are: 32.3 meters wide; draft – depth that reaches 12 meters of tropical fresh water; and 294.1 meters long (depending on the type of ship). The water used to raise and lower the vessels in each set of locks is obtained from Gatun Lake by gravity: it is discharged into the locks through a main sewer system, which extends below the lock chambers from the lateral walls and the central wall. The Culebra Cut is the narrowest part of the Canal. It extends from the northern end of the Pedro Miguel Locks to the southern end of Gatún Lake, in Gamboa. This segment, approximately 13.7 kilometers long, was excavated through rock and limestone from the Cordillera Central. Ships from all over the world transit through the Panama Canal daily. Between 13,000 and 14,000 ships use the Canal each year. In fact, we proudly serve more than 180 maritime routes, connecting 1,920 ports across 170 countries. With the work of approximately 9 thousand workers, the Canal operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, offering transit service to ships from all nations without any discrimination. Our live cameras will allow you to observe the operation of the Canal in real time. The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) is an autonomous legal person of Public Law created by Title XIV of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Panama, and which is exclusively responsible for the administration, operation, conservation, maintenance and modernization of the Canal. of Panama, as well as its related and complementary activities, in accordance with the constitutional and legal norms in force, in order for it to function in a safe, continuous, efficient and profitable manner. The Organic Law of the ACP, of June 11, 1997 establishes the norms for its organization and operation. Due to its importance and nature, the ACP enjoys financial autonomy, its own assets and the right to administer it. The regime contained in Title XIV may only be developed by laws that establish general rules. And the Board of Directors has among its constitutional powers the exclusive approval of the regulations that develop the general rules, on the contracting, purchasing and all matters necessary for the better operation, maintenance, conservation and modernization of the Canal. The ACP is directed by an Administrator and a Deputy Administrator, under the supervision of a Board of Directors made up of 11 members. The Administrator is the highest-ranking executive officer, legal representative of the entity and responsible for its administration and for the execution of the policies and decisions of the Board of Directors. The appointment of the Administrator is for a period of seven years, after which he may be re-elected for an additional period. The 11 members of the Board of Directors are appointed as follows: The appointment of the first Board of Directors was made for staggered periods to guarantee its independence from the governments of the day. The Panama Canal constitutes an inalienable patrimony of the Panamanian nation, therefore it cannot be sold, assigned, or mortgaged, or, in any other way, encumbered or disposed of. The legal regime that was established for the Panama Canal Authority has the fundamental objective of preserving the conditions that make the Canal a company at the peaceful and uninterrupted service of the maritime community, international trade and Panama. The Republic of Panama made various efforts to ensure the imperceptible transfer of the Canal. The first step was taken in 1994 when Panama modified its National Constitution to include a title on the Panama Canal. The second occurred on May 14, 1997, when the Legislative Assembly approved the organic law of the Panama Canal Authority, which served as the basis for the final regulations governing the daily activities and operations of the waterway. Both the Constitutional Title and the Organic Law establish that the Canal must be an efficient, profitable company and a pillar of the human and socioeconomic development of the country.

                "content": "President Theodore Roosevelt oversaw the realization of a long-term United States goal—a trans-isthmian canal. Throughout the 1800s, American and British leaders and businessmen wanted to ship goods quickly and cheaply between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. To that end, in 1850 the United States and Great Britain negotiated the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty to rein in rivalry over a proposed canal through the Central American Republic of Nicaragua. The Anglo-American canal, however, never went beyond the planning stages. French attempts to build a canal through Panama (province of Colombia) advanced further. Led by Ferdinand de Lesseps—the builder of the Suez Canal in Egypt—the French began excavating in 1880. Malaria, yellow fever, and other tropical diseases conspired against the de Lesseps campaign and after 9 years and a loss of approximately 20,000 lives, the French attempt went bankrupt. In spite of such setbacks, American interest in a canal continued unabated. The Hay-Pauncefote Treaty of 1901 abrogated the earlier Clayton-Bulwer Treaty and licensed the United States to build and manage its own canal. Following heated debate over the location of the proposed canal, on June 19, 1902, the U.S. Senate voted in favor of building the canal through Panama. Within 6 months, Secretary of State John Hay signed a treaty with Colombian Foreign Minister Tomás Herrán to build the new canal. The financial terms were unacceptable to Colombia’s congress, and it rejected the offer. President Roosevelt responded by dispatching U.S. warships to Panama City (on the Pacific) and Colón (on the Atlantic) in support of Panamanian independence. Colombian troops were unable to negotiate the jungles of the Darien Strait and Panama declared independence on November 3, 1903. The newly declared Republic of Panama immediately named Philippe Bunau-Varilla (a French engineer who had been involved in the earlier de Lesseps canal attempt) as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. In his new role, Bunau-Varilla negotiated the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903, which provided the United States with a 10-mile wide strip of land for the canal, a one-time $10 million payment to Panama, and an annual annuity of $250,000. The United States also agreed to guarantee the independence of Panama. Completed in 1914, the Panama Canal symbolized U.S. technological prowess and economic power. Although U.S. control of the canal eventually became an irritant to U.S.-Panamanian relations, at the time it was heralded as a major foreign policy achievement. history@state.gov Phone: 202-955-0200 Fax: 202-955-0268 Report an issue on this page",

Because of the way Panama twists, the entrance to the Pacific Ocean is farther east than the entrance to the Atlantic Ocean. This is the opposite of what one would expect. The Panama Canal is 77 km (48 miles) long and cuts across the Isthmus of Panama. At each end it uses three pairs of locks for lifting and lowering ships on different water levels. This saves ships 15,000 km (10,000 miles) compared to going around South America. Each year, about 14,000 ships come through the canal. By 2002, around 800,000 ships came through. The old locks are 110 ft (33.53 m) wide by 1,050 ft (320 m) long and 41.2 feet (12.6 m) deep, with a usable length of 1,000 ft (305 m). The biggest ships that can go through the Panama Canal are called Panamax. New locks opened in 2016 to allow ships more than twice as big, called New Panamax. They are 55 m (180 ft) wide by 427 m (1,400 ft) long, and 18.3 m (60.0 ft) deep. New channels connect to the new locks. Ferdinand de Lesseps tried building a Panama Canal in 1880, but could not finish it. The project was started again in 1904 by the United States, under the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, who spent ten years and 375 million dollars building it. The Panama Canal was finally finished in 1914, at the cost of approximately 25,000 lives. Most deaths were from disease, and before United States construction of the canal began. The US government owned and operated the canal until 1999 when the Panamanian government started controlling it.",

                "content": "Drake Lee Maye (born August 30, 2002) is an American professional football quarterback for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the North Carolina Tar Heels, where he was named the ACC Football Player of the Year in 2022 after leading the NCAA in total yards and setting single-season school records in passing yards and touchdowns. Maye was selected third overall by the Patriots in the 2024 NFL draft. Maye was born on August 30, 2002, in Huntersville, North Carolina.[1][2] He attended William A. Hough High School in Cornelius, North Carolina, and transferred after his freshman year to Myers Park High School in Charlotte, where he played football and basketball.[3] He has three brothers, who also played football—two of his brothers won national championships playing collegiate sports. Maye proved to have a competitive nature with them regarding sports.[4] As a junior in high school, he received All-Conference and All-District honors in basketball and was named The Charlotte Observer's 2019 male athlete of the year after throwing for a school-record 3,512 yards and 50 touchdowns en route to a conference championship appearance.[1][5][6] Maye was named a Under Armour All-American in 2020 despite being unable to play his senior season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[1] Rated a four-star prospect, Maye committed to play college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide in July 2019 before flipping to North Carolina in March 2020.[7] As a redshirt in his freshman season for the North Carolina Tar Heels, Maye appeared in four games behind starter Sam Howell in 2021.[8] With Howell leaving for the NFL in 2022, Maye was named the starter prior to the season.[9] In the opening game against Florida A&M, Maye threw five touchdowns and became the first UNC quarterback to do so in his debut.[10] Maye would also record games with four or more total touchdowns against Appalachian State,[11] Notre Dame,[12] Virginia Tech,[13] Pittsburgh,[14] and Wake Forest.[15] He led the team to appearances in the 2022 ACC Championship Game and Holiday Bowl and was named the ACC Player of the Year after leading the NCAA in total offense with 5,019,[16] passing for school-records 4,321 yards and 38 touchdowns while rushing for 698 yards and 7 touchdowns.[17] In the 2023 season, Maye threw for over 400 yards against Syracuse,[18] Miami,[19] and Campbell.[20] Maye was named second-team All-ACC after passing for 3,608 yards and 24 touchdowns while rushing for 449 yards and nine touchdowns.[21] Maye declared for the 2024 NFL draft following the season.[22] He finished his career fifth in passing yards (8,018) and fourth in passing touchdowns (63) in UNC history.[23] Maye was selected by the New England Patriots as the third overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft.[26] He was the third of a record-tying six quarterbacks taken in the first round (tied with the 1983 draft).[27] Maye signed a four-year fully-guaranteed contract worth $36.64 million on May 28, 2024.[28] Maye was the second consecutive Patriots first round rookie quarterback to choose the number 10, following Mac Jones.[29] Despite a strong preseason, Maye was named a backup to veteran Jacoby Brissett to begin his rookie season.[30] Maye made his regular season debut in Week 3, entering in the fourth quarter of the Patriots' 24–3 road loss to the New York Jets. Maye finished the game, completing four of eight passes for 22 yards and rushing for 12 yards.[31] On October 8, 2024, after the Patriots fell to 1–4 and continued struggles from Brissett, Maye was named the starting quarterback.[32] In his first start against the Houston Texans, Maye completed 20 of 33 passes for 243 yards with 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions in the 41–21 loss; he also led the team with 38 rushing yards.[33] Maye's three touchdowns were one more than Brissett had thrown in his five 2024 starts,[34] and Maye became the first quarterback since at least 1950 to throw three touchdown passes and lead his team in rushing in his first start.[35] In Week 8 against the Jets, Maye recorded a rushing touchdown before exiting the game in the second quarter with a head injury, later diagnosed as a concussion. The Patriots would go on to win 25–22.[36][37] Maye's first ten passing touchdowns went to ten different receivers, making him the first NFL quarterback to accomplish that feat since Steve Ramsey did so in 1973.[38] Maye is the youngest of four brothers: Luke and Beau played basketball at UNC, with the former landing a buzzer beater in the Elite Eight en route to winning the 2017 national championship.[39] Another brother, Cole, was a pitcher on the Florida Gators baseball team that won the 2017 College World Series.[1] Maye grew up family friends with quarterback Mason Rudolph, as their fathers played together at UNC.[40] Maye's father Mark played quarterback at North Carolina (UNC) in the 1980s prior to playing briefly with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Raleigh–Durham Skyhawks.[1] Maye is good friends with Sam Howell, who preceded him as starting quarterback at UNC.[41]",

Sometimes that produces remarkable results. The latest case there comes from New England Patriots’ recently-anointed starting QB Drake Maye’s response to a press conference question from a British reporter on why fans there should root for his team ahead of their clash with the Jacksonville Jaguars at London’s Wembley Stadium Sunday: “Yeah I think it just starts with the name New England” — Drake Maye on why British people should cheer for a team named the Patriots pic.twitter.com/8E0G61NzTU — Chives (@jarrett_daveler) October 18, 2024 “First off, I think it comes with the team name, New England. I think it’s easy for UK fans to be attracted to that. Our colors are pretty sweet, they represent a lot of different things. And from there, I’m excited for the team, we’re going to come up, and we’ve got a lot of great seasons ahead. So shoutout to the fans that are already Patriots’ fans over here, and look forward to having some more.” It should very much be noted that “New England” was one of the most prominent regions in the 18th-century American Revolution against English rule. And the “Patriots” name directly pays homage to that. Indeed, the team history (dating back to a 1959 founding in the old AFL and the 1960 hiring of Lou Saban as their first head coach) is quite clear on their revolutionary connections, and on their “pretty sweet” colors’ connections to that movement. From a Wikipedia summary of the team history on its webpage: The most popular choice – and the one that [team owner Billy] Sullivan selected – was the “Boston Patriots,” with “Patriots” referring to the colonists of the Thirteen Colonies who rebelled against British control during the American Revolution and in July 1776 declared the United States of America an independent nation, which heavily involved the then-colony of Massachusetts. Immediately thereafter, artist Phil Bissell of The Boston Globe developed the “Pat Patriot” logo. So, yeah, “New England” is not a statement of connection with England, especially with many of the colonists there being early firebrands against Britain. And the team continues to embrace that history of rebellion against Britain, including with the “Militia” reenactors they often showcase. So somewhere, King George III is rolling in his grave after these comments from Maye. (While he’s not talking to trees.) Now, the Patriots playing in England is not Maye’s fault or their team’s fault. Rather, it’s a reflection of the NFL’s focus on growing international games. But still, Maye did not have to try to connect “New England” to “England.” And in doing so, he cast aspersions on his degree from UNC-Chapel Hill in the process. At least he studied “business administration, operations, and management” there, not history. [@Jarrett_Daveler on X] Andrew Bucholtz has been covering sports media for Awful Announcing since 2012.
