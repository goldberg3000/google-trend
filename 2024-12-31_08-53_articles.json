                "content": "LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/;[1] lə-BRON; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed “King James,” he is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in basketball history and is frequently compared to Michael Jordan in debates about the sport’s all-time best.[a] James has won four NBA championships from 10 NBA Finals appearances, having made eight consecutive appearances between 2011 and 2018.[2] He also won the inaugural NBA Cup in 2023 with the Lakers, three Olympic gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team, and the Olympics MVP in the 2024 Summer Olympics. In addition to being the NBA's all-time leading scorer and ranking fourth in NBA career assists and eighth in NBA career steals, James holds several individual honors: four NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, four NBA Finals MVP Awards, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, three NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards, and the inaugural NBA Cup MVP award. He has been named an NBA All-Star a record 20 times, selected to the All-NBA Team a record 20 times (including a record 13 First Team selections)[3][4] and the All-Defensive Team six times (including five First Team selections), and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice in his career.[5][6] The oldest active player in the NBA, he is tied with Vince Carter for the record for the most seasons played in NBA history, with 22, and holds the record for the most minutes played in NBA history. [7] James grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities.[8] A prep-to-pro, James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year,[9] he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010.[5] James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat;[10] this was announced in a nationally televised special titled The Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history. James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he additionally earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse and won his third Finals MVP.[11] In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP.[12] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the leading scorer in league history, and the following year, he became part of the first father-son teammate duo in NBA history, playing alongside his son Bronny with the Lakers. Off the court, James has earned further wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.[13] James has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2005, 2013, 2017, and 2019 – the most selections for a professional athlete. James has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). He has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron, Ohio.[14][15] James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was only 16 at the time of his birth.[16]: 22 His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life.[17][18][19] When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.[20] Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.[16]: 23 James began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.[21] He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[20] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[16]: 24 The group dubbed themselves the \"Fab Four\" and promised each other that they would attend high school together.[16]: 27 In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.[22] As a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall freshman, James averaged 18 points and 6.2 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team.[23] The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated.[24] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.3 points and 7.4 rebounds, along with 5.5 assists and 3.7 steals per game.[25] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[26] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions.[23] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[23] In 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in Slam magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), as \"[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now\".[27] During the season, James also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[16]: 104 With averages of 28 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,[23] and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[16]: 117 St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[16]: 114 Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft.[28][29] During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[30] Throughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[16]: 142 Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to Ohio-based subscribers for $7.95 per game on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season, but ended up not being profitable.[16]: 143 [31] For the year, James averaged 30.4 points, 9.7 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 2.9 steals per game,[23] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[16]: 178 and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[23] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[32] Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, James skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player.[33] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[32] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[32] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[34] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[35] St. Vincent–St. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.[36] As an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent–St. Mary's football team.[16]: 51 He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[37] At the end of his second year, James was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[25] James did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game.[38] Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, as well as former and current professional players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League (NFL).[b] James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[43] In his first regular season game, James scored 25 points in a 106–92 loss to the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[44] At the conclusion of the 2003–2004 season, James became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[9] With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game,[45] he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, five rebounds, and five assists per game as a rookie.[46] Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[47] In the 2004–2005 season, James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.[48] Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets coach George Karl told Sports Illustrated: \"It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule.\"[49] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record.[50] With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team.[25] Despite a 30–20 record to start the year,[50] the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.[51] At the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.[52] Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game,[5] he also finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve Nash.[53] Under James' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998.[54] In his postseason debut, James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort over the Washington Wizards.[55] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, and made another in Game 5.[56] Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round.[57] In the 2006–2007 season, James finished the regular season averaging 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[25] With a starting five featuring James, Larry Hughes, Drew Gooden, Aleksandar Pavlović, and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the #2-seed in the Eastern Conference.[60] In the first two rounds of the playoffs, LeBron led the team to wins over the Washington Wizards and New Jersey Nets. The Cavaliers then faced the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals, he logged 48 points with nine rebounds and seven assists. His performance is considered one of the greatest playoff performances of all time as he scored 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including 25 straight, and the game-winning layup with two seconds left. The Cavaliers won 109–107 double-overtime victory over the Detroit Pistons.[61] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \"Jordan-esque\".[62] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[63] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.[64] The Spurs at the time were coached by Gregg Popovich and featured a prime Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Bruce Bowen. With no other significant scoring threats, the Spurs built its defense around stopping James from getting into the paint. As James did not have a reliable jump shot yet nor another offensive weapon on his team, he struggled against the Spurs' zone defense.[65] He averaged 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting,[66] as Cleveland was eliminated in a four-game sweep.[67] In February of the 2007–2008 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, eight-rebound, and nine-assist performance.[68] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Toronto Raptors, doing so in over 100 fewer games than Daugherty.[69] James' 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his first scoring title.[70] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45–37.[71] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round.[72] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a \"shootout\".[73] At the end of the 2008–2009 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team,[74] posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks.[75] James also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season.[76] Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66–16 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history.[77] With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award.[78] Reflecting on James' performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote: \"He's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it.\"[79] In the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals.[80] In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers.[63] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1–1.[81] Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike.[82][83] For the series, James averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8.0 assists per game,[84] finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.[5] In February of the 2009–10 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series of injuries to players in the Cavaliers' backcourt.[85] Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season.[86] Despite only playing 39 minutes per game, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.0 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award.[87] To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Chicago Bulls to earn a matchup with the Boston Celtics in the second round.[88] James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points.[89] The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd.[90] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, and 10 assists in the losing effort.[88] James became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 a.m. EDT on July 1, 2010.[92] During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers.[93] On July 8, James announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he would sign with the Heat.[94] The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities.[95] The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also announced that they would sign with Miami;[96] reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies.[97] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; James thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[98] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade.[99] James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.[98] Upon leaving the Cavaliers, James drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought that the prolonged wait for James' choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show.[100] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James' actions.[101] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey.[102] Former NBA players, including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for forming a superteam with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship in Cleveland, though Jordan did acknowledge that the options players had at the time were much more expansive than those he and others had in the 1980s and 1990s.[103][104][105] Some commentators did defend James' decision to join the Miami Heat by noting the Cavaliers' inability to build a strong supporting cast around him. They argued that other NBA greats had benefitted from talented teammates: Magic Johnson had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy, Larry Bird had Kevin McHale (basketball) and Robert Parish on the Celtics, and Michael Jordan had Scottie Pippen with the Bulls.[106] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision.[107][108] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, James quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, which marked a radical change from prior years.[109][110] The phrase \"taking my talents to South Beach\" became a punch line for critics.[111][112] In retrospect, James has expressed some regret over his handling of The Decision.[110][113][114] James officially signed a 6-year, $110 million contract with the Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal which sent two second- and two first-round draft picks to the Cavaliers and gave the team the option to swap first round picks with the Heat in 2012.[115][116] As part of the first player-created NBA superteam[117] he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982.[118] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new \"Big Three\" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere.[119] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships.[120][121] Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.[122] Throughout the 2010–11 season, the media and opposing fanbases treated James and the Heat as villains.[123] To begin the year, they struggled to adjust to these new circumstances, going only 9–8 after 17 games.[124] James later admitted that the constant negativity surrounding the team made him play with an angrier demeanor than in years past.[123] On December 2, James faced the Cleveland Cavaliers in Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent.[125] He scored 38 points and led Miami to a victory while being booed every time he touched the ball.[126] The Heat eventually turned their season around and finished as the East's second seed,[127] with James averaging 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7.0 assists per game on 51 percent shooting.[5] In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with the Boston Celtics for the second consecutive year.[128] In Game 5, he scored Miami's last 10 points to help seal a series-clinching win.[129] After the final buzzer, James famously knelt on the court in an emotional moment, later telling reporters that it was an extremely personal victory for him and the team.[130] The Heat eventually advanced to the Finals, where they lost to the Dallas Mavericks in six games.[128] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series and scored just eight points in Game 4, a game Miami lost by just three points.[131] His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.[132] The 2011–2012 season was delayed by a lockout, and during that extended summer, James worked with Hakeem Olajuwon in order to improve his post up game.[133][124][134] Humbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks, the experience inspired James to leave behind the villain role that he had been embracing, which helped James regain a sense of joy on the court.[123] Behind his expanded skillset,[134] Miami began the year with a franchise-best 18–6 record.[135] James was eventually named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.[136] In the second round of the playoffs, Miami temporarily lost Bosh to an abdominal injury and found themselves trailing the Indiana Pacers 2–1.[138] James responded with a 40-point, 18-rebound, and nine-assist outing in Game 4 to help even the series.[139] To compensate for Bosh's absence, the Heat embraced a small-ball lineup with James at power forward, which they retained even after Bosh's return in the conference finals against the Boston Celtics.[140][141] Facing elimination in Game 6, James recorded 45 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Heat to victory in what The New York Times called a \"career-defining performance\".[142] Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder and James' budding rival Kevin Durant.[143] Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps.[144] In Game 5, he registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever championship and James' first championship.[145] James was unanimously voted the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[146] His full postseason run, in which James averaged 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern NBA history by ESPN.[147] In February of the 2012–13 season, James averaged 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records.[148][149] That same month, the Heat also began a 27-game winning streak, which is the third longest in NBA history.[150] Based on these accomplishments, James' performance was described as a \"month for the ages\" by Sports Illustrated.[151] Miami eventually finished the year with a franchise and league best 66–16 record,[152] and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously.[153] His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.[5] In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the Pacers.[154] Throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted James to compare his responsibilities to those of his \"Cleveland days\".[155] Despite these struggles, the Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the San Antonio Spurs,[156] signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier.[157] At the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2–3.[84][156][158] In Game 6, James recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory.[159] In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points.[160] James was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7.0 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.[161] On March 3 of the 2013–14 season, James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats.[162] He converted on his first eight three-point field goal attempts through three quarters, setting a new record for the most three-point field goals made in a 60-point game. James also set the record for most points in a single game while wearing a mask. Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries,[163] finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting.[5] In the second round of the playoffs, James tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets.[164] In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so.[165] In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the San Antonio Spurs take an early series lead.[166] In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate.[167] San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat.[168] For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game.[169] On June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, and on July 1, he officially became an unrestricted free agent.[170] On July 11, James revealed via a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated that he intended to return to the Cavaliers.[171] In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received.[172][173][174] The next day, James officially signed with the team,[175] who had compiled a league-worst 97–215 record in the four seasons following his departure.[176] A month after James' signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.[177] In January of the 2014–2015 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, which at the time represented the longest stretch of missed games in his career.[180] In total, James played a then career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[5] In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Chicago Bulls.[181] In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Atlanta Hawks to advance to the NBA Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[182] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities.[182] Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before losing in six games.[183] Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,[184] averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game.[183] During the 2015–16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' coach David Blatt.[185][186] Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East.[187] James' final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting.[5] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the NBA Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Golden State Warriors,[187] who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season.[188] To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses.[189] James responded by registering back-to-back 41-point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination.[190] In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a chasedown block on Andre Iguodala's go-ahead layup attempt,[191] as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals.[11] James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7,[192] and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game,[189] he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.[193] The 2016–17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers;[194] James later described it as one of the \"strangest\" years of his career.[195] Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, James publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too \"top heavy\", for which he received countercriticism.[196] The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game.[5] In Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Indiana Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history.[197] In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader.[198] The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to the NBA Finals for the third consecutive time against the Golden State Warriors, who had signed James' rival Kevin Durant during the off-season.[199] Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12.0 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games.[200] Prior to the start of the 2017–18 season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by trading Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James.[201] After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December.[202] Their turnaround began with a victory over the Wizards on November 3 where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record.[203] In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort.[204] The next month, James won his third All-Star Game MVP Award, after posting 29 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, and several key plays to help Team LeBron win over Team Curry.[205] Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double digits.[206] James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, and 4.2 turnovers per game.[5] In the playoffs, James guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the Golden State Warriors.[207] Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors, after which a new nickname, \"LeBronto\" was popularized.[208][209] In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland lost 124–114 in overtime.[210] Following the loss, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series.[211] The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James averaging 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game for the Finals.[212] On June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent.[213] Two days later, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers;[214] the deal was officially completed on July 9.[215] In an interview with Sports Illustrated, James's agent Rich Paul explained: \"In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do.\"[216] Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination.[217] The Lakers expected James to immediately transform them into a championship contender after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the Finals since 2010.[218][219] Following his signing, the team rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. To begin the 2018–19 season, the Lakers struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games.[220] In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James's strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers.[221] Four days later, James scored a season-high 51 points in a victory over the Heat.[222] After blowing out the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day, Los Angeles improved their record to 20–14, but James suffered a groin injury,[223] the first major injury of his career.[224] James missed a then career-high 17 consecutive games, and the Lakers fell out of playoff contention without him,[223] marking the first time that James missed the playoffs since 2005.[225] In March, the Lakers announced that James would begin a minutes restriction,[226] and he was later officially ruled out for the rest of the season.[227] James' final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game.[5] Despite his inconsistent campaign, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in twelve years that he did not make the All-NBA First Team.[228] \"Kobe is a brother to me. From the time I was in high school watching him from afar, to getting in this league at 18 and watching him up close, all the battles that we had throughout my career, the one thing that we always shared was that determination to just want to win, to just want to be great. The fact that I'm here now means so much to me. I want to continue, along with my teammates, his legacy. Not only for this year, but for as long as we can play this game of basketball that we love, because that's what Kobe Bryant would want. So in the words of Kobe Bryant, 'Mamba out'. But in the words of us, 'not forgotten' Live on, brother.\" During the offseason, the Lakers hired Frank Vogel as their new head coach, and traded the majority of their young core to the Pelicans for superstar big man Anthony Davis.[230] James immediately embraced the team's much-improved roster by transforming his playing style, moving to full-time point guard, and competing with a more consistent defensive effort.[231] Behind James' leadership, the Lakers opened the 2019–20 season with a 17–2 record, matching the best start in franchise history.[232] On January 25, James scored his 33,644th career point, passing Kobe Bryant for third on the all-time regular season scoring list.[233] The following day, Bryant died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.[234] James delivered an improvised eulogy in honor of Bryant at Staples Center, before a January 31 game against the Portland Trail Blazers.[235] In early March, before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, James led the Lakers to a victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in a matchup of conference leaders, followed by a streak-breaking victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.[236] Regular season play resumed in July and concluded in August within the confined NBA Bubble, where James ended the regular season as the league leader in assists for the first time in his career, averaging 10.2 assists per game.[237] He earned a record 16th All-NBA Team selection as part of the First Team, extending his record First Team selections to 13.[238] The Lakers entered the playoffs as the top seed in the West and advanced to the NBA Finals convincingly, with only three total losses along the way.[239] In Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals against the Denver Nuggets, James helped clinch the conference championship by scoring a game-high 38 points, including 16 in the fourth quarter.[240] In the Finals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with his former team, the Miami Heat, and quickly took control of the series with a 2–0 lead.[241] In Game 5, James had his best statistical performance of the Finals with 40 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists in a memorable duel with Miami's Jimmy Butler, but Los Angeles was ultimately defeated in a three-point game.[242] The Lakers eliminated the Heat in Game 6, which earned James, who averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game during the series,[243] his fourth NBA championship and fourth Finals MVP award.[12] At 35 years and 287 days old, James became the second-oldest player in league history to win the award,[244] and the only player in NBA history to win the award with three different franchises.[245] James and teammate Danny Green also became the third and fourth players in NBA history to win at least one championship with three different teams each.[246] The 2020–2021 season, reduced to 72 games for each team and starting on December 22, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, began after the shortest offseason in NBA history with a 116–109 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[247] On December 31, James became the first player in NBA history to score 10 points or more in 1,000 consecutive games in a 121–107 victory over the San Antonio Spurs.[248] On February 18, 2021, James became the third player in NBA history with 35,000 career points, joining Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone; aged 36 years and 50 days, he was the youngest player to reach the milestone.[249] On March 20, James sprained his ankle against the Atlanta Hawks,[250] but was able to hit a three-point shot afterwards to keep his 10-points streak alive before exiting the game.[251] By March, the Lakers were No. 2, two games behind the Utah Jazz, but they went 14–16 without Davis and 6–10 without James, falling to No. 5.[252] James returned on April 30 after missing 20 games, the longest absence of his career.[253] In May, James was sidelined again after leaving a game against the Toronto Raptors,[254] but he returned for the final two games,[255][256] and finished the season with averages of 25.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.8 assists on 51.3 percent shooting in 45 out of 72 games;[257] this was his 17th consecutive season averaging at least 25 points per game, the most in NBA history.[258] In an injury-laden season, the Lakers ended with a 42–30 record, finishing No. 7 due to tiebreakers and facing the No. 8-seed Warriors in the play-in tournament.[259] The Lakers won 103–100 after James scored the go-ahead, three-point shot in the final minute, posting a triple-double with 22 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, along with two steals and a block.[260] His 34-foot (10 m) shot over Stephen Curry before the shot clock buzzer was his longest basket of the season as well as his longest go-ahead shot in the closing three minutes of a game in his career.[261][262] In the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers faced the No. 2 Phoenix Suns. This marked the first time in James' career that he did not have home court advantage in the opening series.[263][264] They were up 2–1 before Davis suffered a strained groin in Game 4, in which James finished with a game-high 25 points on 10-for-21 shooting, 12 rebounds, and 6 assists.[265] The Lakers lost to the Suns in six games, marking the first time James lost in the first round in his career.[263] James finished the series averaging 23.3 points, his fourth-lowest scoring output for a series over his career and his lowest mark since averaging 22.8 in the 2014 Eastern Conference finals.[266] He made his 17th consecutive All-NBA Team selection,[3] extending the record for most selections in NBA history,[267] being named for the third time to the All-NBA Second Team.[268] For the 2021–22 season, James was joined by Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook.[269] In a game against the Pistons on November 21, James was ejected in the third quarter after getting into a scuffle with Isaiah Stewart during the 121–116 victory. This was the second time in his career that he was ejected from a game,[270] and James was suspended for one game due to his actions.[271] In his next 16 games, James averaged 30.4 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.4 blocks on 54 percent shooting, also achieving his 100th triple-double,[272] while becoming the third player in NBA history to surpass 36,000 career points;[273] during this period, James played 35 percent of his minutes at center.[274][275] From December 19 to February 26, 2022, playing 23 out of 27 games, he had a streak of 23 consecutive 25-point games.[276] In December, James became the second player in NBA history (after Michael Jordan) to post 40 points and no turnovers at age 35 or older.[277] In January, James met the minimum criteria for points per game by playing at least 70 percent of his team's games, averaging 28.6 points, and became the oldest player to average 25+ points per game, having already been the youngest to do so, as James averaged 27.6 points per game in his sophomore season at 20 years old.[278] He also became the oldest player in NBA history to record at least 25 points in ten straight games, doing so at 37 years old.[279] By January 20, James became the fifth player in NBA history to record at least 30,000 career points and 10,000 career rebounds; he is the first player to record at least 30,000 career points, 10,000 career rebounds, and 9,000 career assists.[280][281][282] In the same period, he surpassed Oscar Robertson for 4th all-time free throws made,[283] and Alvin Robertson for 10th all-time in career steals.[284][285] In February, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most points scored in both the regular season and playoffs;[286] by March, he passed Karl Malone for second in the all-time minutes and regular season scoring lists.[287][288][289] At the 2022 NBA All-Star Game held in Cleveland, James was celebrated among the other 74 players for the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[290] James led all players in fan votes with his 18th All-Star selection, tying Bryant and just one behind Abdul-Jabbar;[291] his team achieved its fifth consecutive All-Star victory,[292] defeating Team Durant 163–161,[293] with James hitting the game-winning dagger shot in front of his hometown crowd.[294][295] In March, James recorded two 50-point games, which were also his Lakers' career-high,[296][297] becoming the oldest player to have multiple 50-point games in a season, as well as the first Lakers player since Bryant in 2008 to have back-to-back 50-point home games; it was James' 15th 50-point game in his 19-year career, including the postseason.[298] He also recorded his 10,000th career assist, becoming the only player in NBA history to record at least 10,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists.[299][300] On March 27, James became just the second player in NBA history to score 37,000 points.[301] Due to an ankle injury in late March, he missed out on a close three-players run for the NBA scoring title,[302][303][304] having only played 56 games, two less than the necessary to qualify;[305] aged 37, James would have broken Jordan's record of oldest scoring leader at 34.[306] For The Athletic, Bill Oram wrote that James' ankle injury felt like \"the moment that might signal the end of the Lakers season\".[307][308] On April 5, the Lakers were eliminated from both playoff and play-in contention for the first time since 2019 (James's first season with the Lakers) after a 121–110 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[309] It marked the fourth time in James' career that he missed the playoffs.[310] James was ruled out the rest of the season due to soreness in his left ankle.[311] He finished the season with a 7.6 box plus–minus (first among players in his age group) and averages of 30.3 points (first by 6.9 points among players in his age range), 8.2 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 2.9 threes, 1.3 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game on 52–35–75 shooting ranges.[312] On May 24, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the second time; it was his 18th consecutive All-NBA Team selection, extending the record for most selections in NBA history.[313] On August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Lakers on a two-year, $97.1 million contract.[314][315] The contract extension made him the highest-paid athlete in NBA history at $528.9 million, surpassing Kevin Durant in all-time earnings.[316] On October 20, James made his 2,144th three-pointer in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers, surpassing Paul Pierce for tenth in all-time three-pointers made.[317] On October 28, James posted 28 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and four steals in an 111–102 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

At age 39 years and 319 days, he broke his own record previously set in November 2019 for the oldest player to record a triple-double in three consecutive games.[386] Two days later, he recorded his fourth consecutive triple-double of the season with 15 points, 16 rebounds, and 12 assists, in a 120–115 victory against the San Antonio Spurs, breaking his personal record for the most consecutive triple-doubles made. He also tied the Lakers franchise record for the most consecutive triple-doubles made, joining Magic Johnson (1981, 1987) and Russell Westbrook (2021).[387] On December 1, he reached 15,000 career field goals in a 105–104 victory against the Utah Jazz, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the only players to reach said milestone.[388] On December 19, he passed Abdul-Jabbar for the most career regular season minutes played.[389] As a 19-year-old rookie, James made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece.[390] He spent the Games mostly on the bench,[391] averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points, and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games.[390] Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding active NBA players to their lineup.[392] James felt that his limited playing time was a \"lowlight\" and believed he was not given \"a fair opportunity to play\".[391] At the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain.[393][394] The team finished the tournament with an 8–1 record, winning another bronze medal.[393] James's behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.[395][396] Before naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice.[395][397] At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier.[398] Team USA went 10–0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.[390] James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: \"I don't think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now.\"[399] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000.[400] In the final game, James' statistics were – 14 points, six rebounds, and three assists against Spain.[401] James did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England.[402] He became the leader of the team, with Bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back.[403] James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed.[404] During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds, and 12 assists.[d] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game.[406] James contributed 19 points in the victory, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history.[390][406] He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year.[407] Afterwards, Krzyzewski said: \"[James] is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now.\"[408] After a 12-year gap, James rejoined the national team on the 2024 Olympic squad in Paris as Team Captain at 39 years old.[409] Voted by the entire 592-strong U.S. delegation, James was named as one of the two Team USA flag-bearers for the opening ceremony of the games, becoming the first male basketball player to be so honored.[410][411] James led the team in rebounds and assists. He recorded his second Olympic triple double in a comeback win in the semi-final against Serbia with 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.[412] James became the first player in Olympic history with two triple doubles.[413] Team USA went on to win their fifth straight gold medal, defeating France 98–87 in the final game,[414] with James recording 14 points, 6 rebounds and 10 assists. At the conclusion of the tournament with averages of 14.2 points, 6.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists, James was named the FIBA Men's Olympics MVP and was selected to the FIBA Men's Olympics All-Star Five.[415] James became the third male basketball player to win three gold medals at the Olympics. Standing 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) tall and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg),[416] James has played the majority of his career at the small forward and power forward positions,[5] but he has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary.[417] His playing style, which is athletic and versatile,[134] has drawn comparisons to Basketball Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan.[418][419][420] Through the 2023–24 season, James' career averages are 27.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.5 steals, and 0.7 blocks per game.[5] Throughout the 2010s, he was usually ranked as the best player in the NBA each season by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.[421][422] As an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring.[424] He holds numerous \"youngest to\" distinctions,[425][426] including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points.[427] During his first stint in Cleveland, James was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,[134] he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball.[428][429] His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because James was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones.[430] These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets.[431] Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game.[432] Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.[433] In Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James' role to a more unconventional one.[134] James spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots.[134][434] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \"pass-happy\" offense.[435] Behind these improvements, James' overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels.[436] During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \"average\".[437] Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity,[438] posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016.[5][439] His shooting also temporarily regressed, and James briefly ranked as the NBA's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint.[440] Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.[430] For most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team.[441] His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history.[442] By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention James garners from opposing defenses,[443] he creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists.[444] James executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic.[445] His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.[430] Early in his career, James was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games;[446][447] however, as his career progressed, James' clutch performance was viewed more favorably.[448] At the beginning of his NBA career, James was considered a poor defensive player,[449] but he improved steadily through the years. In 2009, James became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot.[75] In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions.[450] From the years 2012–2016, he was ranked among the top three defenders in the NBA by general managers, earning the vote as the best perimeter defender in the league preceding the 2014–15 NBA season.[451] Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme,[452] with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.[453] Beginning in 2014, some analysts reported a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines.[454][455] During his second stint in Cleveland, James' defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching.[456] James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as \"chill mode\".[457] He eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as \"Playoff LeBron\".[458] James left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in NBA history.[e] Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[464] As of 2024, James has been named to 20 All-NBA Teams, including 13 times to the First Team, which are both NBA records.[3] His four MVP awards are matched only by Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span.[465] James has also won four Finals MVP Awards, which is the second-most all-time,[466] and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014.[5] While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[74][467] His teams have appeared in the Finals ten times and won four championships; his 10 Finals appearances are tied for third all-time.[f] Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have countered that James usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition.[469][470][471] On the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history,[g] and he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.[479] This has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan.[a] In a 2016 interview with Sports Illustrated, James acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing Jordan as the greatest.[480] In February 2018, The Ringer spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Bill Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead.[481] In polls, James has ranked second behind Jordan.[482][483][484] The results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing Jordan.[483][484] Davis et al. of Business Insider stated: \"The data would suggest that younger, more-engaged NBA fans lean toward James, as he's still playing. Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan.\"[484] Referring to James as the best challenger to Jordan's status as the greatest basketball player of all time, Sam Quinn of CBS Sports stated that \"the margin for error where Jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim\" and that \"in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse\", Jordan having more titles and an \"unblemished Finals record holds significant weight\".[480] In addition to praising James' on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted his influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of The Washington Post opined that James' move to the Heat in 2010 \"defined a decade of player movement\", and that he \"fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations.\"[485] James' fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as Warriors forward Draymond Green, who reflected: \"We've taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that ... I think the doors that he's opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment.\"[486] Multiple current and former NBA players have suggested James' free agency decisions catalyzed the leaguewide trend in \"superteams\" in the 21st century.[487][488][489][490][491] In 2022, James voiced his desire to play into his forties potentially alongside or against his sons Bronny and Bryce.[492] This eventually happened when Bronny was selected by the Lakers 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, making them the first father-son duo in NBA history.[493] James married his high school sweetheart, Savannah James, on September 14, 2013, in San Diego, California.[494] They have three children: sons Bronny and Bryce, and daughter Zhuri.[492][495] Bronny was a standout high school basketball player, being named a McDonald's All-American in 2023, 20 years after James's selection.[496] During his stint with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, where he bought a $9 million three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay.[497] In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-foot (870 m2) East Coast-style mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, for about $21 million.[498] He purchased another home in Brentwood in December 2017 for $23 million.[499] In September 2020, he purchased a third home in Los Angeles, this one in Beverly Hills for $36.75 million.[500] James also owns a 30,000 square foot mansion in Akron, Ohio that he custom built in 2003 on his property and spent $2.1 million on it.[501] James's best friends in the NBA are Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and former Heat teammate Dwyane Wade. The four have been referred to as the \"banana boat crew\". During an excursion to the Bahamas, James rescued Anthony from the water when Anthony was carried away from the boat by the current. During an Instagram Live session, Anthony later recounted: \"He saved my life\". When asked about how much danger Anthony was in prior to the rescue, James responded: \"I don't really know what to say, to be honest. I'm just happy he's still here, obviously.\"[502] James also maintains a friendship with fellow NBA player Draymond Green.[503] James invests heavily in his health, reportedly spending $1.5 million a year to pay for personal chefs, athletic trainers, and physical therapies for recovery. Kyle Korver has described James's fitness as being on \"another level\". However, James' routine is not perfectly clean; he drinks wine every night, believing it to be good for his heart,[504] while Tristan Thompson has stated that James eats desserts with every meal.[505] In January 2009, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic discovered a growth in the right side of James's jaw. Biopsy results showed that James developed a benign jaw tumor, specifically in his parotid gland,[506] which required a five-hour surgery to remove on June 2 after the end of the Cavaliers' run in the 2009 playoffs.[507] James is considered by fellow NBA players, media tabloids, and popular culture to be the \"face of the NBA\", often alongside Warriors superstar Stephen Curry.[508][509] His opinions have yielded significant influence on people who make important league decisions; for example, in 2014, James asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season.[510] On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).[511] Throughout his career, James has been ranked by Forbes as one of the world's most influential athletes,[h] and has been listed by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[514] During his first stint with the Cavaliers, James was adored by local fans, and Sherwin-Williams displayed a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters.[515] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he sported a Yankees hat when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games against the New York Yankees.[516] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and The Decision, James was listed as one of the most disliked athletes in the United States.[517] By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career.[518] In 2014, James was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll.[519] He has led the league in jersey sales six times.[520] Memorabilia associated with James is highly sought after; two of James' rookie cards are among the most expensive basketball cards ever sold at auction, and one of those cards also briefly held the record for the most expensive modern-day sports card when it sold for $1.8 million at auction in July 2020.[523] A Mike Trout rookie card broke the record for a modern-day card the following month.[524] All jerseys worn in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game were auctioned by the NBA and NBPA to raise funds for charity; James' jersey sold for $630,000, setting a record for a modern-day sports jersey.[525] In March 2008, James became the first black man, as well as the third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney, to appear on the cover of Vogue, when he posed with Gisele Bündchen.[526] In response, ESPN columnist Jemele Hill considered the cover offensive and \"memorable for the wrong reasons\", describing the demeanor of James and his holding Bündchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his fair-skinned love interest.[521][522] James has maintained close ties to his hometown of Akron, Ohio, which is also where his charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation (LJFF), is based.[527] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon to raise money for various causes.[528] In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021.[529] In 2017, he received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award from the NBA for his \"outstanding service and dedication to the community.\"[530] In November 2017, the Akron School Board approved the I Promise School, a public elementary school created in a partnership with the LJFF to help struggling elementary school students stay in school.[531] The school officially opened on July 30, 2018, with James reflecting that it was his most important professional accomplishment.[532] Other noteworthy public and charitable initiatives undertaken by James in Akron include the I Promise Institute at the University of Akron,[533] I Promise Village (housing complex),[534] House Three-Thirty (community center/retail plaza),[535] and I Promise Health Quarters (medical center).[15] James is also an active supporter of various non-profit organizations, including After-School All-Stars, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and Children's Defense Fund.[536][537][538] In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit on Muhammad Ali.[539] Throughout his career, James has taken public stances on controversial issues, and has mentioned a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status.[540] Those include the War in Darfur,[541] the killing of Trayvon Martin,[542] the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014,[540] the Michael Brown verdict,[543] the death of Eric Garner,[544] the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests,[545] the shooting of Breonna Taylor,[546] the death of Ma'Khia Bryant,[547] Kyle Rittenhouse,[548] and the ruling of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.[549] On August 27, 2020, James and his Lakers teammates, as well as the Bucks, began boycotting the 2020 NBA playoffs to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake.[550] In response, senior White House advisor Jared Kushner stated that he was planning to reach out to James regarding the boycott. Following a players' committee to discuss the boycott, James and others reached out to former president Barack Obama, who reportedly advised them to continue playing and finish that year's NBA season.[551] During the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, a statement James made about a since-deleted tweet by Daryl Morey,[552] in which Morey expressed support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, became the subject of controversy. James said Morey was \"misinformed\".[553] His statement drew backlash from protesters in the movement.[554][555] In February 2022, political commentator Bill Maher called James hypocritical for not taking a critical stance towards the Chinese government's human rights abuses.[556] James had taken various other stands on issues regarding sports, such as the Kaepernick controversy and the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal.[557][558] In October 2023, in response to the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, James voiced his support for Israel on Instagram.[559] His statement drew backlash for its omission of the Palestinians affected by the crisis, including from Palestinian-American leader and activist Omar Suleiman.[560][561][562] In June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee in support of Barack Obama for the 2008 U.S. presidential election.[563] Later that year, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the then-called Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Obama's 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement.[564] The advertisement was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert.[564] In November 2016, James endorsed and campaigned for Hillary Clinton for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[565] Following a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James expressed that \"being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.\"[566] Later on that year, in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, James questioned the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan and said: \"It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh? Our youth deserve better!!\"[567] James also called President Donald Trump a \"bum\" after the president rescinded a White House invitation to Stephen Curry.[568] During a 2018 interview with CNN journalist Don Lemon, James then accused Trump of attempting to divide the country with sports, suggesting that \"sports has never been something that divides people it's always been something that brings someone together.\" He declared that he would \"never sit across from him. I'd sit across from Obama though.\"[569][570] In response, Trump tweeted: \"LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart, which isn't easy to do.\"[571] On August 19, 2020, James announced his intentions to support the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign and that of his running-mate Kamala Harris in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[572] James spoke in support of the More Than a Vote movement and encouraged members of the African-American community to vote,[573] saying, \"People in our community have been just lied to for so many years. We have people that have had convictions in the past, that've been told they cannot vote because they got a conviction. That is voter suppression.\"[574] On October 31, 2024, James announced his support for the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.[575] According to Forbes, in May 2023, James became the first active NBA player to become a billionaire,[576] making him one of the richest celebrities. James' biography LeBron was published on April 11, 2023, by Jeff Benedict. The biography is based on three years of research and more than 250 interviews.[577] James has signed numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies that he has done business with are AT&T,[578] Audemars Piguet,[579] Beats by Dre,[580] Blaze Pizza,[581] Coca-Cola,[582] Dunkin' Brands,[583] Intel,[584] Kia,[585] McDonald's,[586] Nike,[582]PepsiCo,[587] State Farm,[588] and Taco Bell.[589] Coming out of high school, James was the target of a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas,[590] eventually signing a seven-year deal with Nike in 2003[591] for approximately $90 million.[592] His signature shoes have performed well for Nike.[593] In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, James was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool,[594] who he has claimed his support for.[595] As a result of his endorsement money and NBA salary, James has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes.[596] In 2013, he surpassed Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million.[597] In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones.[598] In 2015, James was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson,[599] and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi).[600] James has stated that he would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a hands-off capacity.[601] In 2011, James co-founded the designer retail store UNKNWN in Miami, Florida.[602] During Super Bowl LVI in 2022, James appeared in a Crypto.com advertisement, where he conversed with a CGI version of his younger self, offering advice about the future. The commercial, produced by James' SpringHill Company and directed by Calmatic, did not directly promote the service, sparked social media buzz, and inspired a series of memes centered on the advice he could have offered.[603] Subsequently, Crypto.com launched an NFT airdrop campaign, distributing 5,550 tokens featuring the NBA champion. Participants were chosen randomly from those who scanned a QR code in the Super Bowl ad.[604] Also, in 2022, James' charity LeBron James Family Foundation, partnered with Crypto.com to educate underserved Akron communities with blockchain-related knowledge and Web3 tools, aiming to ensure inclusive advancement in the digital age.[605][606] James and comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards.[607] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live.[608] James has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage.[609] In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck,[610] receiving positive reviews for his performance.[611] That same year, James' digital video company Uninterrupted raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company's efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski and cornerback Richard Sherman.[612] James and his business partner Maverick Carter own production company SpringHill Entertainment,[613] whose first work was the Lions Gate documentary More Than a Game, which was released in 2009 and chronicled James' high school years.[614] Series produced by SpringHill include the NBC game show The Wall,[615] the Disney XD sports documentary show Becoming,[616] the Starz sitcom Survivor's Remorse,[617] and the animated web series The LeBrons.[618] In 2016, CNBC aired an unscripted series hosted by James called Cleveland Hustles, where four up-and-coming Northern Ohio entrepreneurs will be financed on the condition of revitalizing a neighborhood in Cleveland.[619] In the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, a 60-minute Vince Carter documentary entitled The Carter Effect was executive produced by James and Maverick Carter along with rapper Drake and Future the Prince.[620][621] In February 2018, it was announced that James' production company will produce a new film in the House Party series with James expected to make a cameo.[622] Later that month, Fox News host Laura Ingraham told James to \"shut up and dribble\" as a response to his political agendas.[623] This largely contributed to James creating a documentary film series looking at the changing role of athletes in the current political and cultural climate, aptly named, Shut Up and Dribble on Showtime.[624] James partnered with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2018 to found Ladder, a company that developed nutritional supplements to help athletes with severe cramps after dealing with that issue during the 2014 Finals.[625] In February 2019, it was revealed that James would executive produce rapper 2 Chainz's new album Rap or Go to the League.[626] A Def Jam press release said the intent of the album is \"celebrating black excellence and focusing on the power of education and entrepreneurship.\" The press release also says the title \"challenges the notion that the only way out of the inner city is either to become a rapper or a ball player.\"[627] As of June 2023, James is the most followed basketball player on Instagram, with over 155 million followers.[628] In June 2022, it was announced James was launching a media company in partnership with professional tennis player Naomi Osaka and Maverick Carter. The production and content creation company will be named Hana Kuma, which means \"flower\" and \"bear\" in Japanese.[629] In March 2024, James and JJ Redick launched a podcast called Mind the Game, where the two have \"pure conversations about basketball.\"[630][631][632] In 2012, James, Carter and Paul Wachter made an investment of less than $1 million in the Pasadena-based fast casual chain Blaze Pizza; their investment had grown to $25 million by 2017.[633] James later became a spokesman for the company and began appearing in advertisements after ending his contract with McDonald's.[633] During the 2019 offseason, James filed for a trademark through a shell company on the term \"Taco Tuesday\" for use in downloadable audio/visual works, podcasts, social media, online marketing, and entertainment services.[634] This was related to James's use of the term on Instagram for his family's taco dinners. The request was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, stating that Taco Tuesday was \"a commonplace term, message or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment.\"[635] In November 2020, James became an angel investor of the tequila and mezcal company Lobos 1707.[636] After personal frustration with comments on the Black Lives Matter movement made by Republican U.S. senator Kelly Loeffler, who at the time was the owner of the WNBA's Atlanta Dream, James assisted Dream player Renee Montgomery in her ultimately successful bid to buy the team in March 2021.[637] That same year, James joined Fenway Sports Group as a partner, making him a part-owner of the Boston Red Sox, New England Sports Network, RFK Racing, and Liverpool F.C., the latter of which he already owned a two-percent share in individually.[638] The investment made James and Carter the company's first black partners.[638] James has expressed his interest in owning an NBA team once he finishes playing basketball, specifically a team located in Las Vegas, Nevada, either through expansion or relocation.[639] In August 2022, James, alongside Canadian musician Drake, became part owners of the Italian football club A.C. Milan.[640] James is also a part owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL).[641] James is represented by agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports.[642] His first agent was Aaron Goodwin, whom he left in 2005 for Leon Rose. Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012.[643] James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mims—all childhood friends—formed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James's marketing, including the marketing of The Decision, for which it was criticized.[644][645] Throughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his NBA contracts, usually opting to sign shorter-term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility;[116][646][647] in 2006, James and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season.[648] This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign together with the Heat.[649] During the 2011 NBA lockout, James received contract offers to play professional football from the Dallas Cowboys and Seattle Seahawks,[650] which he gave serious consideration to and even began training with it in mind.[651] During his second stint in Cleveland, based on a negotiation strategy devised by NBA agent Mark Termini, who worked with Paul and specialized in contract negotiation and construction,[652] James began re-signing[653][654] on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap.[175] In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal,[655] becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career.[656]",

                "content": "LeBron Raymone James Sr. (born December 30, 1984[2]) is an American professional basketball player who plays in the National Basketball Association (NBA) on the Los Angeles Lakers with 17 titles. He is married with Savannah Brinson James and has 3 children. They are Bronny James, Bryce James, and Zhuri James. He is also a film producer and a business man. Among the best basketball players of the twenty-first century, he has a lot of experience. Both Space Jam: A New Legacy and Trainwreck featured him as himself. He is the proprietor of the SpringHill Company. The Cleveland Cavaliers picked him in the 2003 NBA Draft with the first pick in the draft, not only for his athletics ability but for the revenue he could bring to the team and city. James did not play college basketball, and entered the NBA Draft immediately after high school. He went to high school in Akron, Ohio. James played with the Cavaliers for his first seven seasons. During that time, he was one of the NBA's top scorers. He was selected as an All-Star several times. In 2007, he led Cleveland to the NBA Finals. He was the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the NBA for the 2008-09 NBA season and 2009-10 NBA season. On July 8, 2010, on a show in ESPN called \"The Decision\" LeBron said that he would next play for the Miami Heat.[3] On December 2, 2010, James played in Cleveland for the first time since leaving, scoring 38 points for the Heat as they beat the Cavaliers, 118-90. Many fans angry at James for leaving Cleveland booed him throughout the game and held up signs with negative statements against James.[4] In the 2011 season the Miami Heat came in second place right behind the Chicago Bulls lead by Derrick Rose in the NBA. They made it to the finals of the NBA and lost in six games to the Dallas Mavericks [5] This caused celebration in Cleveland because they hated LeBron for what he did to them.[6] In the 2012 Finals, LeBron James won his first championship after the Miami Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 4-1 games, after battling with the Boston Celtics 4-3 games the previous round. The next year, LeBron James won his second title when the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in seven games. In both years he won the MVP title of finals and of regular season. In 2014, James competed a good season but he wasn't the MVP. In the 2014 Finals, the Heat's Finals streak ended after being defeated by the San Antonio Spurs in five games (4-1).[7] Shortly after those Finals had ended, LeBron James said he would use an early termination option in his contract, leaving the Miami Heat and becoming a free agent. He said this on June 24, 2014.[8] Then, on June 25, 2014, in a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated, he said he would return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. On July 12, 2014, James signed a two-year, $42.1 million contract to return to the Cavaliers. The deal also contains an option to become a free agent again after the 2014–15 NBA season.[9] LeBron now plays on the Los Angeles Lakers. In 2015, he took the Cleveland Cavaliers to the NBA Finals, without Kevin Love but lost to the Golden State Warriors in 6 games after losing Kyrie Irving after he had an ankle injury. He led the Cleveland Cavaliers to an NBA championship after being down 3-1 games to their first-ever title in 2016 and later played a crucial role in bringing glory to the Los Angeles Lakers.[10] No team had ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals before. He had a historic moment where he blocked Andre Iguodala on possibly the game winning layup. The Cavaliers went on to lose to the Golden State Warriors the following season. Now with the Lakers he passed Kobe Bryant. On August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Los Angeles Lakers on a two-year, $97.1M deal.[11][12] The contract extension made James the highest-paid athlete in NBA history at $528.9M, surpassing Kevin Durant in all-time earnings.[13] In 2021, James starred in Space Jam: A New Legacy where he played a version of himself. LeBron is widely considered to be the greatest basketball player of all time, as well as one of the most influential athletes and sports players in the world.[14] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 38,387-point total during a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Currently, LeBron is staying at 40,474, which is 2087 higher than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He was the youngest player to reach this point. He is also well known for his assists, and with 10,759, he is now the player with the fourth-most assistances. James and Michael Jordan are the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA title, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same calendar year. The USA would go on to win the Olympics twice.[15] Since even before he made his NBA debut, James has been associated with Nike. They In 2003, he agreed to a seven-year contract with the business that was worth little under $90 million. Many people at the time questioned whether Nike put a little too much faith in an 18-year-old who had never played a professional game. LeBron became one of the biggest players in the NBA and a four-time MVP as a result of the risk, which paid off brilliantly. James has been a success for Nike off the court as well, in addition to on it. Until now the sales of his signature sneaker reached $340 million between February 2014 and January 2015, making him the highest-paid employee at the company.[16]",

LeBron James is an American professional basketball player who is widely considered one of the greatest all-around basketball players of all time. James has won four National Basketball Association championships with three different teams, and he has been named NBA MVP four times. In 2023 he became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, and in 2024 he became the first NBA player to score 40,000 points. James has also won gold medals at the Olympics, in 2008 and 2012. LeBron James, who was born in 1984 in Akron, Ohio, became a locally known basketball prodigy while in elementary school. James led Akron’s St. Vincent–St. Mary High School to three state championships in four years. He was named Ohio’s Mr. Basketball—the high-school player of the year—three times during 2001–03. LeBron James was selected first overall in the 2003 National Basketball Association draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He played for the Cavaliers through the end of the 2009–10 season. He then signed with the Miami Heat but returned to the Cavaliers in 2014. James joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018. He won NBA championships with all three teams. LeBron James has won four National Basketball Association championships. He won his first two championships with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013. He won a third championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. His fourth championship came with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020. LeBron James (born December 30, 1984, Akron, Ohio, U.S.) is an American professional basketball player who is widely considered one of the greatest all-around players of all time and who won National Basketball Association (NBA) championships with the Miami Heat (2012 and 2013), the Cleveland Cavaliers (2016), and the Los Angeles Lakers (2020). In 2023 he became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, breaking the record (38,387) previously held by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. His dominance continued when in 2024, he recorded his 40,000 point scored. Find out where he ranks in our list of the greatest basketball players. A locally known basketball prodigy since elementary school, James was named Ohio’s Mr. Basketball (high-school player of the year) three times while leading Akron’s St. Vincent–St. Mary High School to three Ohio state championships in his four years on the team. He became a national media sensation in his junior year after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated, where he was billed by the magazine as “The Chosen One.” James was the consensus national high-school player of the year in his senior season, and he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall selection of the 2003 NBA draft. Additionally, he signed an unprecedented $90 million endorsement contract with the Nike shoe company before he ever played a professional game. Despite the pressures brought on by these singular circumstances, James led the Cavaliers in scoring, steals, and minutes played over the course of the 2003–04 season, winning the league’s Rookie of the Year award in the process. A 6-foot 9-inch (2.06-meter) “point forward” who was as adept at bringing the ball down the court as at playing near the basket, James presented a unique challenge for opposing teams; his unmatched athleticism and well-muscled body would not have been out of place in the National Football League. His game progressed over the following years. He was voted one of the starting forwards on the Eastern Conference All-Star team during his second season, and in his third season he led the Cavaliers to their first playoff berth in nine years. These accomplishments were exceeded during the 2006–07 season, when James guided Cleveland to the franchise’s first berth in the NBA finals. After the Cavaliers upset the favored Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals, the Cavaliers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA finals, but James’s impressive postseason play led many observers to place him among the very best players in the league. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2007–08 season and earned first team All-NBA honors, but the Cavaliers lost to the eventual champion Boston Celtics in a dramatic seven-game series in the Eastern Conference semifinals. James piloted the Cavaliers to a team-record 66 wins during the 2008–09 season, which helped to earn him the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. The following season James averaged nearly 30 points per game as he was again named MVP. At the end of the 2009–10 season, James became arguably the most sought-after free agent in NBA history when his contract with the Cavaliers expired, and he began a prolonged courtship process with a number of teams that had in some cases been planning for his free agency for over two years. In an unprecedented hour-long television special, criticized by many for its undue grandiosity, James announced that he was signing with the Heat. He helped Miami reach the NBA finals in his first year with the team, but the Heat lost the championship to the Dallas Mavericks. In the 2011–12 season James averaged 27.1 points per game and won his third MVP award while helping Miami advance to its second consecutive NBA finals appearance. Backed by his stellar play—James was named the finals MVP—the Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder to win the championship. He had arguably his greatest individual season in 2012–13, as he averaged 26.8 points, 7.3 assists, and a career-high 8.0 rebounds per game while posting a .565 field-goal percentage, a remarkable rate of made shots for someone who so frequently played away from the basket. James also helped Miami win 27 consecutive games that season (the second longest such streak in NBA history), and he was rewarded with his fourth league MVP award. In the following postseason, the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in a seven-game series to win the NBA championship, and James was again named the finals MVP. He continued his stellar play in the following season, even increasing his shooting percentage by .002, and he again led the Heat to an appearance in the NBA finals. However, Miami lost that rematch with the Spurs in a five-game series. After that finals loss, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, leaving an aging Miami roster, and—after a week of frenzied speculation among fans and media—he decided to return to Cleveland. Although his 25.3 points per game was James’s lowest scoring average since his rookie season, he nevertheless guided a young and inexperienced Cavaliers roster to the second best record in the Eastern Conference in 2014–15. In the following postseason he led an injury-laden Cleveland team to just two playoff losses en route to a berth in the NBA finals. There James had one of the greatest individual performances in finals history, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game while leading the undermanned Cavaliers to the franchise’s first two finals victories before ultimately losing a six-game series to the Golden State Warriors. James had another strong regular season in 2015–16 but, once again, truly shined in the playoffs. He led the Cavaliers to a rematch against the Warriors, who had set a league record with 73 wins during the regular season, in the NBA finals. There the Cavaliers became the first team to come back from a 3–1 finals deficit to capture the first title in franchise history and end a 52-year title drought for Cleveland professional sports teams. James averaged 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.6 steals, and 2.3 blocks per game in the finals—becoming the first person to lead all five statistical categories for players on both teams in the finals—and was unanimously named finals MVP. In 2016–17 James had arguably his best regular season by setting career highs with averages of 8.7 assists and 8.6 rebounds per game while still scoring 26.4 points per game. He sustained his excellence in the Eastern Conference playoffs, scoring 32.5 points per game (which included his 5,988th career postseason point, breaking Michael Jordan’s all-time NBA playoff scoring record) while leading the Cavaliers to a third consecutive match-up against the Warriors in the NBA finals. There Cleveland could not overcome the team James referred to as a “juggernaut,” losing to the Warriors in five games despite James becoming the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double over the course of the finals (with 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game). In 2017–18 he played a full 82-game regular season for the first time in his career and led the NBA in minutes played per game (36.9) while averaging 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, and a new career-high 9.1 assists per game. James again excelled in the following playoffs, scoring more than 40 points seven times in the team’s 18 Eastern Conference postseason games (which included two seven-game series) to lead the Cavaliers to their fourth straight NBA finals series against the Warriors. He continued his strong individual play in the finals, but it was not enough to overcome Golden State’s overwhelming talent advantage, and the Warriors swept the series. In the following off-season, James, a free agent, joined the Los Angeles Lakers. He continued to play at a high level, averaging 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game, but he missed significant playing time because of an injury (a strained groin) for the first time in his career. The Lakers struggled in his absence and ultimately finished the 2018–19 season with a 37–45 record, ending James’s personal playoff streak at 13 seasons. The following season was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a four-month suspension. Play resumed in July 2020 with a shortened schedule, and the Lakers ultimately defeated the Miami Heat to claim the franchise’s 17th NBA title. James’s dominating performance—he averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game—earned him his fourth finals MVP award. In addition to his achievements in the NBA, James was a member of the U.S. men’s Olympic basketball teams that won the bronze medal at the 2004 Games, the gold medal at the 2008 Games, and the gold at the 2012 Games. James did not return to Olympic competition until the 2024 Paris Games, and there he led the U.S. team to a fifth consecutive gold medal and was named the tournament’s MVP. Off the court, James occasionally acted, notably appearing as himself in Judd Apatow’s comedy Trainwreck (2015). In 2021 he appeared in the live-action/animated Space Jam: A New Legacy. James also published a memoir, Shooting Stars (2009; cowritten with Buzz Bissinger), that chronicles his years as a high-school standout.",

James earned an additional honor at the Games: leading the U.S. delegation as the male flag bearer in the opening ceremony along the Seine River on July 26. “It’s special to get an opportunity to represent your country in another fashion. I understand how prestigious this moment is,” James said. Joining him as the female flag bearer is tennis player Coco Gauff. Basketball player LeBron James is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer who currently plays for the Los Angeles Lakers. James first garnered national attention as the top high school basketball player in the country before being drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003. With his unique combination of size, athleticism, and court vision, he became a four-time NBA MVP. After leading the Miami Heat to titles in 2012 and 2013, James returned to the Cavaliers and helped the franchise claim its first championship in 2016. Since joining Los Angeles in 2018, he has won an additional NBA championship and became the all-time leading scorer in league history. FULL NAME: LeBron Raymone JamesBORN: December 30, 1984BIRTHPLACE: Akron, OhioSPOUSE: Savannah James (2013-present)CHILDREN: LeBron Jr., Bryce, and ZhuriASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Capricorn LeBron Raymone James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio. At an early age, he showed a natural talent for basketball. James was recruited by St. Vincent-St. Mary High School to join their basketball team in 1999. As a freshman, James averaged 18 points per game. He helped the team to a Division III state title by scoring 25 points in the championship game. Word of his advanced basketball skills spread, and James received several honors for his performance. As a high school sophomore, James was chosen for the USA Today All-USA First Team. He was the first sophomore ever selected for this award. His team also won the Division III state title for the second year in a row. The following school year, James was named Parade magazine’s High School Boys Basketball Player of the Year and Gatorade Player of the Year. Following the end of his junior year, James was such a strong player that he contemplated going pro. Deciding to finish his education, James had a tremendous senior year on the court. He averaged 31.6 points per game, helping his team clinch their third state title. The St. Vincent-St. Mary High School team also earned the top national ranking that year. Throughout his high school playing career, James totaled 2,657 points, 892 rebounds, and 523 assists. He would soon emerged as one of the NBA’s leading players. With his impressive record, it was no surprise that James was the first player picked in the 2003 NBA Draft straight out of high school. The Cleveland Cavaliers signed the powerful young forward, and he proved to be a valuable addition to the then-struggling franchise. The team had ended the previous season in eighth place in the Eastern Conference. During the 2003-04 season, James made history when he became the first member of the Cavalier franchise to win the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. At only 20 years old, he also became the youngest player to receive this honor. Additionally, James averaged 20 points per game at this time and became one of only three rookies to accomplish this feat, putting him in the same company as Michael Jordan and Oscar Robertson. James continued to excel professionally in the NBA the following season, upping his average points per game to 27.2. He made NBA history again in 2005 when he became the youngest player to score more than 50 points in one game. In 2006, James helped the Cleveland Cavaliers defeat the Washington Wizards in the first round of playoff action. From there, his team took on the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference semifinals. James scored an average of 26.6 per game in this postseason matchup, but it wasn’t enough to secure victory. While the Cavaliers weren’t at the top of the rankings, James continued to receive special recognition for his individual abilities. Also that year, James reached a new contract agreement with the Cavaliers. The team proved to be stronger competitors the following season, defeating Detroit to win the Eastern Conference. In the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, however, the Cavaliers lost their championship bid in four consecutive games. During the 2007-08 season, James continued to help the Cavaliers improve their standing in the Eastern Conference. The team made it to the semifinals, where they were defeated by the Boston Celtics in seven games. In terms of individual performance, James had a stellar year, outperforming such rival players as Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson, by scoring an average of 30 points per game, the highest average in the NBA regular season. Early in the 2008-09 season, sports journalists and fans began talking about James’ future in the sport. He had the option to become a free agent in 2010, and there was much discussion as to where James would end up. Some journalists identified the New York Knicks as a potential suitor for the rising player. James made several references to his impending free-agent status, but he was sure to downplay the matter. “I am focused on the team that I am on right now and winning a championship... I don’t think about making a change at this point,” James told reporters. Shortly after becoming a free agent, James announced that he would be joining the Miami Heat for the 2010-11 season. His fans in Cleveland were less than pleased, and many considered his departure a betrayal to his hometown. Soon after James’ announcement, Cleveland Cavaliers majority owner Dan Gilbert wrote an open letter declaring James’ decision as “selfish,” “heartless” and a “cowardly betrayal.” Unfazed, James finished second in the league during his first season with the Heat, scoring 26.7 points per game. The 2011-12 season saw major success for James and the Miami Heat. With his team’s victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Finals, the superstar forward finally earned his first title. In the clinching Game 5, James scored 26 points and had 11 rebounds and 13 assists. “I made a difficult decision to leave Cleveland, but I understood what my future was about,” James told Fox Sports following the game. “I knew we had a bright future [in Miami].” During the 2012-13 season, James made NBA history yet again: On January 16, 2013, at age 28, he became the youngest player to score 20,000 points, succeeding Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers—who accomplished this feat when he was 29—and becoming only the 38th player in NBA history to achieve this distinction. James made a jump shot the final seconds of the game, bringing his scoring total 20,001 and leading the Heat to a 92-75 victory over the Golden State Warriors. Success followed the Heat to the end of the 2012-13 season: Following a hard-fought, six-game series against the Indiana Pacers to win the Eastern Conference, Miami outlasted the San Antonio Spurs in seven games to win its second consecutive NBA championship. At the culmination of the 2013-14 season, Miami returned to the NBA Finals to face off against the Spurs again, this time losing to San Antonio after five games. In July 2014, after opting out of his contract with the Heat and considering other teams, James announced that he was returning to the Cavaliers. Hampered by back and knee problems, James missed 13 of 82 regular-season games in 2014-15. However, he was as dominant as ever when healthy, averaging 25.3 points and 7.4 assists per game. James led the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals, becoming the first player in nearly 50 years to reach the championship round in five consecutive seasons. However, injuries to star teammates Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving damaged his hopes of claiming a third title, and the Cavaliers lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games. Over the course of 2015-16, the Cavs overcame the distraction of a mid-season coaching change and breezed through the playoffs to earn a rematch with the Warriors, marking the sixth straight NBA Finals appearance for “King James.” In perhaps the crowning achievement of his career, he led his team back from a 3-1 deficit, scoring 41 points in both Games 5 and 6, before recording a triple-double in Game 7 to give the Cavs their first championship in franchise history. Voted Finals MVP, James said: “I came back to bring a championship to our city. I knew what I was capable of doing. I knew what I learned in the last couple years that I was gone, and I knew if I had to—when I came back—I knew I had the right ingredients and the right blueprint to help this franchise get back to a place that we’ve never been. That’s what it was all about.” The following year, James again paced himself and took charge when necessary, driving the Cavs through the Eastern Conference to make an incredible seventh consecutive appearance in the NBA Finals. This time, with former MVP Kevin Durant added to the mix, the Warriors proved too formidable for James and his teammates, who lost the championship in five games. For all his accomplishments, James achieved another first early in the 2017-18 NBA season: After yelling at a referee during a late November win over the Heat, he was ejected for the first time in 1,082 career games. The superstar likely felt like yelling often during the course of a frustrating campaign, as an offseason trade that sent Irving to Boston for Isaiah Thomas failed to bear fruit and forced the Cavs to make another major deal before the All-Star break. After averaging a career-best 9.1 assists in the regular season, James had to dig deep just to get the team out of the first round of the playoffs, delivering a brilliant 45-point effort to sink the Pacers in Game 7. The Cavs were again pushed to the limit two rounds later by the scrappy Boston Celtics, but James scored 81 points over the last two games to pull out the series win and make his eighth straight NBA Finals appearance. Game 1 of the rematch against Golden State went down to the wire, thanks to James’ 51-point outburst, but Cleveland guard J.R. Smith inexplicably dribbled out the clock with the game tied in regulation before the Warriors pulled away for the win in overtime. That represented the Cavs’ best chance to get a leg up on their opponents, as the Warriors won the next three games handily to claim their third title in four years. Afterward, with questions swirling about his future with the team, James revealed that he had played out the series with a broken right hand after punching a whiteboard in the aftermath of the Game 1 loss. On July 1, 2018, James announced that he was moving on to the next chapter of his career by signing a four-year, $153.3 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, a storied franchise that counted Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Magic Johnson among its all-time greats. The good vibes had worn off by midseason, as the Lakers sputtered through a 17-game stretch without their injured star. With the team still struggling in late February 2019, James accused his teammates of losing focus over trade rumors, saying, “If you’re still allowing distractions to affect the way you play, this is the wrong franchise to be a part of and you should just come in and be like, ‘Listen, I can’t do this.’” When the Lakers were officially eliminated from playoff contention in March 2019, it snapped James’ personal marks of 13 consecutive postseasons and eight straight NBA Finals appearances. Capping a difficult first season in Los Angeles, the Lakers announced that their star would miss the final six games because of his lingering groin injury. Things got off to a much better start the following season, thanks in large part to the addition of athletic big man Anthony Davis to the roster. Spearheading the Lakers’ rise to the top of the standings was James, who became the first player to record a triple-double against all 30 NBA teams in November 2019. The following month, James added another accolade to his ever-growing list by earning AP Male Athlete of the Decade honors. James won his fourth championship in 2020, when the Lakers defeated the Miami Heat in a special playoff tournament held at the Walt Disney World resort following the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. James was selected for the NBA All-Star Game for the first time in 2005 and has earned a spot in the annual showcase in each of the next 19 seasons—an NBA record streak. In January 2018, the league announced James and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry had topped the ballots and would serve as captains for that year’s All-Star Game. In 2006, James was named MVP in the NBA All-Star Game, a feat he repeated in 2008 and 2018. James has also been named NBA MVP in four seasons: 2008-09, 2009-10, 2011-12, and 2012-13. In January 2018, at age 33, James surpassed Kobe Bryant as the youngest player to accumulate 30,000 career points and became the seventh player in NBA history to achieve that milestone. The feat put him just more than 8,000 points shy of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s all-time record of 38,387 points. James continued to surpass other legends in ensuing seasons, topping Michael Jordan’s career tally of 32,292 points in 2019 to move into fourth place all-time. In January 2020, he eclipsed Bryant’s total of 33,643 points to move into third place, one night before his predecessor’s shocking death in a helicopter accident. Then, on February 7, 2023, James scored 38 points in a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder—setting the all-time mark with Abdul-Jabbar sitting courtside. “I didn’t set this as a goal, so that’s probably why it’s so surreal and so weird to me,” James said. “I never talked about being the all-time scorer in NBA history… until my numbers started getting closer and closer, and I was like, ‘Oh wow, this is crazy. This is weird, but I guess I’m doing it.’” As of July 2024, James is also fourth in league history in assists (11,009) and eighth in steals (2,275). After 21 NBA seasons, James’ stats include regular season per-game averages of: James has competed on the U.S. Olympic basketball team during four Summer Olympic Games: in 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2024. He made his Olympic debut at the 2004 Summer Games in Athens, Greece. He and his teammates won bronze medals after defeating Lithuania. Argentina took home the gold after beating Italy in the finals. In the summer of 2008, James traveled to Beijing to play with the likes of Kobe Bryant, Jason Kidd, and Dwyane Wade on Team USA. This time around the Americans brought home the gold after defeating Spain in the final round. James competed at his third Olympic Games in 2012, at the Summer Olympics in London, along with Kevin Durant, Bryant, Carmelo Anthony, and several other top players. The U.S. basketball team took the gold medal again, marking James’ second consecutive Olympic gold. After sitting out the 2016 and 2020 Games, James is competing for his third gold medal at the Paris Olympics this year. He was also selected to serve as the male flag bearer for the entire U.S. delegation at the opening ceremony. As of July 2024, Celebrity Net Worth estimates James’ total fortune at around $800 million. According to ESPN, he is currently the sixth-highest paid player in the NBA, earning just under $50 million for the upcoming season. James’ fortune largely stems from his playing salary and a series of lucrative endorsements. The NBA superstar previously signed a four-year, $153.3 million contract with the Lakers in July 2018. Off the court, James has inked several partnerships since turning pro, including a deal with Nike for $90 million that could net him over $1 billion over his lifetime. Some of his other endorsements have included Intel, Verizon, Coca-Cola, Beats by Dre, and Kia Motors. James is also an investor in Blaze Pizza. On January 1, 2012, James proposed to his high school sweetheart, Savannah Brinson. The couple married in a private ceremony with about 200 guests in San Diego on September 14, 2013. LeBron and Savannah have two sons and one daughter together. In October 2004, they welcomed their first son, LeBron Jr., nicknamed “Bronny.” On June 14, 2007, Savannah gave birth to their second son, Bryce. Their daughter, Zhuri, was born on October 22, 2014. Like his father, Bronny became a basketball phenom as a teenager and one of the most sought-after recruits in the country while attending the Sierra Canyon School. He played collegiately at the University of Southern California during the 2023-24 season before entering the NBA draft. The Lakers selected Bronny with the 55th overall pick, pairing him with his father in Los Angeles. “I’m going to hold him accountable, and he should hold me accountable when I do things not right. I can separate dad from teammate,” LeBron told Today. “And, I think, as he continues to grow, and as he continues to learn, I hope he’s able to separate son from teammate, as well.” Outside of the NBA, James has worked to help others. He established the LeBron James Family Foundation in 2004, along with his mother, Gloria, to help out children and single-parent families in need. Among its many programs, the organization builds playgrounds in economically disadvantaged areas and hosts an annual bike-a-thon. One of the world’s most recognizable athletes, James hasn’t been shy about expressing his views on social media. Among other issues, he displayed his support for Trayvon Martin after the teen’s death in 2012, and he has clashed with President Donald Trump. James waded into delicate territory in October 2019, after Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey posted a tweet in support of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters that ignited a Chinese media boycott of NBA preseason games in the country. James said he believed Morey was “misinformed” about the situation, though he later tweeted that he mainly took issue with the executive posting comments that could have exposed traveling players to danger. The basketball superstar has also shown a playful side on social media, such as when he posted a picture of cartoon character Arthur clenching his first during the Cavaliers’ slow start to the 2017-18 season. Like many pro athletes before him, James parlayed his popularity into opportunities on the big and small screen. On television, James has had guest roles on the popular cartoons The Simpsons (2005), SpongeBob SquarePants (2009), and The Cleveland Show (2011), and appeared as himself on the HBO drama Entourage in 2009. James made his major movie with a supporting role in 2015’s Trainwreck, a comedy starring Amy Schumer and Bill Hader. He later starred in Space Jam 2, the 2021 sequel to the hit 1996 live-action and cartoon hybrid starring Michael Jordan. “The Space Jam collaboration is so much more than just me and the Looney Tunes getting together and doing this movie,” James told The Hollywood Reporter. “It’s so much bigger. I’d just love for kids to understand how empowered they can feel and how empowered they can be if they don’t just give up on their dreams.” In 2020, the basketball great co-founded a production company called SpringHill Entertainment.

                "title": "Iowa Hawkeyes football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Iowa Hawkeyes football program represents the University of Iowa in college football. The Hawkeyes compete in the Big Ten Conference. Iowa joined the Conference (then known as the Western Conference or Big Nine) in 1899 and played their first Conference football season in 1900. They are a Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The Hawkeyes play their home games in Iowa City, Iowa, at Kinnick Stadium, with a capacity of 69,250. The Hawkeyes are coached by Kirk Ferentz, who is in his 26th season as the head coach and is the longest current tenured head coach in NCAA Division I FBS. The Hawkeyes have won 13 conference championships (including 11 in the Big Ten). Iowa has been ranked #1 in the AP and Coaches Poll 15 times. Football was first played as a club sport at Iowa in 1872, with intramural games against other colleges played as early as 1882, but it was not until 1889 that the University of Iowa first officially recognized a varsity football team. Beginning in 1892, Iowa played for six seasons as a member of the Western Interstate University Football Association against three other Midwestern flagship state universities. In 1899, again playing as an independent, Iowa completed its first undefeated football season, which led to an invitation to join the Western Conference, now known as the Big Ten Conference. In 1900, the Hawkeyes finished another undefeated season and won a share of the Western Conference title in their first year of conference play. In 1907, Iowa helped form the new Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association with the other three university members of the former WIUFA and participated in football in the new league, while retaining its existing membership in the Western Conference. Iowa tied for the league championship in the first season of competition, but would leave the conference soon thereafter to return to sole competition in the Western Conference.[4] Iowa claimed consecutive Big Ten titles in 1921 and 1922, and were recognized as national champions in those years. The Hawkeyes won 20 straight games in the early 1920s under the guidance of Hall of Fame coach Howard Jones. But Jones soon left Iowa and established a powerhouse at Southern California, and the Hawkeyes were abysmal for most of the 1930s. Iowa was expelled from the Big Ten on May 25, 1929. The reasons were officially unstated and university president Walter Jessup professed not to know why the faculty committee voted to expel the university. Suspicions of player compensation and Iowa's inaction to address alleged ethics violations appear to have been the main cause.[5] Following the 1929 season, the Big Ten faculty committee unanimously voted to reinstate Iowa to the conference on February 1, 1930. On December 11, 1929, Iowa had disqualified 27 players, presumably due to compensation issues, and was advised not to seek reinstatement of any of those players.[6] Little was expected of Iowa's 1939 team based upon its overall record in the decade, but led by their new coach Eddie Anderson the team exceeded expectations and had a glorious run. Nicknamed the \"Ironmen\" because a small number of players shouldered the brunt of the time played, the 1939 Hawkeyes scored several upset victories and vaulted into the national rankings. Though Iowa fell a game short of winning the Big Ten title, team MVP Nile Kinnick won almost every major national award, including the 1939 Heisman Trophy. Forest Evashevski was hired as Iowa's head coach in 1952. He lured Calvin Jones to Iowa, where Jones became the first Hawkeye – and the first African-American – to win the Outland Trophy in 1955. From 1956 to 1960, Evashevski led Iowa to four finishes in the top five of the national rankings, three Big Ten Conference titles, two Rose Bowl victories (in 1957 and 1959), and the 1958 FWAA national championship. After the 1960 season, Evashevski left coaching to become Iowa's athletic director. In 1960 the Hawkeyes held on to the No. 1 ranking for much of the season. The Hawkeyes defeated No. 8 Ohio State, No. 15 Michigan State, and No. 10 Purdue. Iowa lost to rival No. 3 Minnesota. The game was the only loss of the year for the 1960 Hawkeyes and they shared the Big Ten title with Minnesota. However, at that time, the Big Ten did not allow their teams to go to any bowl except for the Rose Bowl. As such, Minnesota was picked over Iowa to go to Pasadena and Iowa was left out, despite a No. 2 ranking in the Coaches' Poll and a No. 3 ranking in the AP. Minnesota went on to win the National Championship, as the final AP poll was conducted before their Rose Bowl loss to Washington. This season is known as the \"Forgotten Season\",[citation needed] for despite ending the season with a No. 2/3 ranking and a share of the Big Ten title, the Hawks were left out of January play. Evashevski's departure from the sidelines began a two-decade downturn in Iowa's fortunes. Jerry Burns coached from 1961 though 1965. He had a 16–27–2 record. His first team finished 5–4, which would be Iowa's last winning record for 20 years. Ray Nagel followed from 1966 to 1970 with a 16–32–2 record. A 3-3-2 record in 1963 and consecutive 5–5 records in 1968 and 1969 would be the Hawks' only non-losing records from 1962 to 1980. Frank Lauterbur followed, coaching from 1971 to 1973 with a 4–28–1 record, with a 0–11 record in 1973. Bob Commings coached the Hawkeyes from 1974 to 1978. His record was 18 wins and 37 losses. Hall of Fame coach Hayden Fry was hired after the 1978 season[7] to reverse Iowa's fortunes. Considering the awful state of the program upon his arrival, Fry didn't take long to return the Hawkeyes to respectability. In his third year, Fry led the Hawkeyes to their first winning season in 21 years, a share of the Big Ten title, and a berth in the Rose Bowl–only the third bowl appearance in school history. He had vowed to resign if he didn't get the Hawkeyes to a bowl within four years. Fry would go on to lead the Hawkeyes to three Big Ten titles (one outright, two shared) and 14 bowl games (including two more Rose Bowls in 1986 and 1991). His best team was the 1985 unit, which won a then school-record 10 games and garnered Iowa's first outright Big Ten title in 27 years. That team spent most of October ranked No. 1 in both major polls, the highest they had been ranked that far into the season in two decades. Among the legacies that Fry left behind is the now iconic Tiger Hawk logo and a widely reviled pink visitors' locker room (better to \"calm\" the opponents). Fry retired in 1998, turning the program over to his former assistant Kirk Ferentz. Ferentz led Iowa to three consecutive top-10 finishes from 2002 to 2004 and two Big Ten titles. The Hawkeyes have been invited to 21 bowl games in the past 23 seasons, and in 35 bowl games over the last 42 seasons. Kirk Ferentz has been the head coach since Hayden Fry's retirement after the 1998 season, and has led the team to a number of Bowl appearances, including two Orange Bowls (2003, 2010) and the 2016 Rose Bowl. Iowa has cracked the Top 25 at the end of the season eleven times during the Kirk Ferentz era – No. 8 in 2002, 2003, and 2004, No. 20 in 2008, No. 7 in 2009, No. 9 in 2015, No. 25 in 2018, No. 15 in 2019, No.16 in 2020, No. 23 in 2021 and No. 24 in 2023. Under Ferentz, Iowa won the Big Ten West division three times (2015, 2021 & 2023). Iowa has been selected national champion five times by NCAA-designated major selectors, in 1921, 1922, 1956, 1958, and 1960.[8]: 111, 113 Iowa claims national championships for all five seasons.[2] Iowa finished the 1958 regular season with a 7–1–1 record and a No. 2 ranking in the major wire-service polls—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll—and won the 1959 Rose Bowl convincingly over No. 16 and 7–3 California, 38–12, setting or tying six Rose Bowl records. The AP and Coaches' Polls had named 10–0 Louisiana State as national champions at the end of the regular season.[9][10] The Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) awarded the Grantland Rice Trophy and their national championship to Iowa after the bowl games were played.[11] Iowa has never finished a season ranked No. 1 in either the AP or Coaches' Poll.[12] Iowa has won 13 conference championships in school history, eight shared and five outright, winning 11 with the Big Ten and 2 in other conferences.[13] † Co-champions ‡ Iowa was a member of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association from 1907 to 1911 in addition to their membership in the Big Ten. In 1928, the MVIAA split in two: the Big Six (which officially retained the MVIAA name; would become the Big Eight in later years) and the Missouri Valley Conference (which retained the MVIAA administrative team). Since both leagues claim the same history from 1907 until the 1928 split, conference champions during that time are listed as conference champions of the respective leagues. Iowa has three Big Ten division championships. Iowa has appeared in 37 bowl games, including 35 bowl games since 1981. In bowl games, Iowa has a 18–18–1 record.[14] The team also accepted a bid to the 2020 Music City Bowl, which was subsequently canceled due to an outbreak of COVID-19 on the opposing team.[15] ^ Eddie Anderson did not coach during the 1943–1945 seasons to serve in World War II. –Iowa did not hire their first head coach until 1892, even though their football program began in 1889. They have had 25 total head coaches in their program's history. Iowa plays Iowa State annually for the Cy-Hawk Trophy, which began in 1977. The teams' first meeting was in 1894. The teams quit meeting after the 1934 season until they renewed their rivalry in 1977. It was in 1977 that the tradition of the Cy-Hawk Trophy began, when the Des Moines Athletic Club donated a trophy dedicated to the rivalry. It was quickly dubbed the \"Cy-Hawk Trophy\". Iowa leads the trophy series 31–16, and the overall series 47–24 through the 2024 season.[16] The game is currently held in early September near Patriot Day. Iowa plays Minnesota annually for the Floyd of Rosedale, which is Iowa's oldest trophy game that began in 1935. The teams' first meeting was in 1891. Floyd of Rosedale was created in 1935 after Minnesota Governor Floyd Olson bet a prize pig that the Gophers would win the game, a goal which the Gophers would accomplish that year. After the death of the pig, its image was cast in bronze, and the Floyd of Rosedale trophy was created. Iowa leads the trophy series 45–43–2 while Minnesota leads the overall series 63–53–2 through the 2024 season.[17] Iowa plays Nebraska annually for the Heroes Trophy, which began when Nebraska joined the Big Ten Conference in 2011. Since the inauguration of the series as a conference game, the game has been played on the Friday following Thanksgiving. Iowa leads the trophy series 10–4, while Nebraska leads the overall series 30–22–3 through the 2024 season.[18] Iowa has played Wisconsin for the Heartland Trophy since 2004. The teams' first meeting was in 1894. Wisconsin leads the trophy series at 10–9 and the overall series 49–47–2 through the 2024 season.[19] Iowa's home jersey is black with white numerals, with gold and white stripes on the sleeves. The away jersey is white with black numerals, and gold stripes on the sleeves. Players' names are located above the numerals on the back of the jersey. Gold pants with a black stripe are worn with both the home and away jersey. Iowa's helmets are black with a black facemask. They also have a gold stripe and the gold Iowa Hawkeye logo included on both sides of the helmet. In 1979, Hayden Fry helped to create the Tiger Hawk, the logo seen on Iowa's football helmets.[20] Since both teams shared the colors of black and yellow gold, Fry sought and gained permission from the Pittsburgh Steelers, the dominant National Football League (NFL) team of the 1970s, to overhaul Iowa's uniforms in the Steelers' image. Fry's idea was that if the team were going to act like winners, they first needed to dress like winners. Fry had originally asked Steelers defensive tackle \"Mean\" Joe Greene for a replica helmet and home jersey; Greene was able to send Fry to one of the team owners, and three days later, the owners sent Fry reproduction copies of the home and away uniform of Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw, making Iowa one of only a few schools to use the uniform scheme of an NFL team; others include the Blue Devils of Duke University whose football uniforms resemble those of the Indianapolis Colts. Although the uniforms appear substantially the same, there are subtle differences, mainly in the font of the numerals, the scheme of the white away jerseys, and the width of the pants and jersey stripes. The Hawkeyes have removed the Tiger Hawk helmet logo and the single yellow gold stripe from their game helmets on five occasions as a symbolic gesture of mourning. The first instance was on November 2, 1991, in recognition of the six victims of a fatal campus shooting.[21] The second occasion was for a December 29, 1996, appearance in the Alamo Bowl. It served to commemorate the family of linebacker Mark Mitchell, who were involved in a fatal vehicle accident while en route to the game. The accident resulted in the death of Mitchell's mother and severe injuries to his father and two brothers.[22] Third came on Veterans' Day 2011 when they used a red, white, and blue Tiger Hawk on one side and left the other side blank in honor of our fallen heroes against Michigan.[23] Fourth was September 12, 2015, when they honored Tyler Sash, former Iowa Safety and NFL Veteran, who had died on September 8, 2015.[24] To honor Sash, one Tiger Hawk was replaced with a large, gold \"#9\" a tribute to the jersey number Sash wore while he played at Iowa. The Tiger Hawk was removed for a fifth time during the 2019 Holiday Bowl in San Diego, California to honor the passing of former Iowa Hawkeye football coach, Hayden Fry.[21] The Hawkeyes have won all five memorial games. The Iowa Athletic Director has okayed only seven stickers on the helmets from 1985 to the present. The first was in 1985, when a gold disk appeared, with the black letters \"ANF\", which stands for America Needs Farmers. This sticker had remained in place until 1992 when the NCAA required teams to remove 'excessive' decals. However, it was brought back by head coach Kirk Ferentz in 2009 and has remained in place since. The second was a small black sticker on the back of the helmet, with white letters that spelled out \"EVY\", the nickname of legendary Iowa head coach, and athletic director, Forest Evashevski, to commemorate his death in 2009. The third was in memory of Iowa high school football coaching legend Ed Thomas, who was killed in his team's weight room by a former player. A small gold sticker with the black letters \"FFF\" placed near the crown of the helmet represents \"Faith, Family, Football,\" a motto Coach Thomas preached to his players to represent what his players' priorities should be not only through the season, but throughout life. The fourth was a small green sticker, with the number 30 on it to honor former Hawkeye Safety Brett Greenwood, who had recently fallen into a coma while working out at his old high school. Fifth was a small black sticker with a gold \"TS\", worn on the back of the helmet to commemorate the death of former Hawkeye safety Tyler Sash. Another decal was commissioned to honor former Polk County deputy sheriff Ron Stewart died on October 9, 2016, at the age of 76. Stewart volunteered his time providing security for the Iowa Football team at home and road games from 1982 to 2014. For the remainder of the season, the Hawkeyes wore a decal on the back of their helmets bearing his initials \"RS\" within a sheriff's badge in his memory.[25] Most recently, a special helmet decal was worn to honor former Iowa Hawkeye football player Damon Bullock, who died at the age of 25 in March 2019. For the 2019 season opener, the Hawkeyes wore a gold circle with black lettering detailing \"DB5\" on the back of their helmets, a nod to Bullock's playing number from 2011 to 2014, in addition to a gold graduation cap, honoring the team's recent graduates.[26] Nile Kinnick Stadium, formerly known as Iowa Stadium, is the home stadium of the University of Iowa Hawkeyes in Iowa City, Iowa. It opened as Iowa Stadium in 1929; prior to that time, Iowa played its home games at Iowa Field. Iowa Stadium was renamed Nile Kinnick Stadium in 1972 in honor of Nile Kinnick, the 1939 Heisman Trophy winner and the only Heisman winner in university history, who died in service during World War II. It holds 69,250 people,[27] making it the 25th largest college football stadium in America and the 82nd largest sports stadium in the world. On Nov. 21, 1953, an undefeated No. 1 ranked Notre Dame team was set to face the Hawkeyes in South Bend. In the first quarter, Iowa defensive back Dusty Rice intercepted the Irish, which allowed the Hawkeyes to drive the ball 72 yards for an Iowa touchdown and a 7–0 lead. With only 2 seconds left in the first half, Irish tackle Frank Varrichione fell down with an injury which stopped the clock (Notre Dame had no time outs left). Varrichione went in that same play and the Irish scored on a touchdown pass to Dan Shannon, to tie the game 7–7 at the half. With the score still deadlocked late into the fourth quarter, Iowa intercepted a pass on their own 48-yard line. The Hawkeyes then scored on a touchdown pass to end Frank Gilliam to give the Hawkeyes a 14–7 lead with 2:06 left in the game, with Notre Dame having no time outs remaining. With only 6 seconds left and the clock ticking away Frank Varrichione came down with another injury which stopped the clock (again he went back in that very same play). Notre Dame then scored a touchdown to tie the game up and stay unbeaten. After the game, sportswriters such as Grantland Rice and others were infuriated calling it unfair, and the Irish earned the label: \"The Fainting Irish of Notre Dame\". Iowa head coach Forest Evashevski said after the game: \"When the One Great Scorer comes to write against our name, He won't write whether we won or lost, but how come we got gypped at Notre Dame\". The Hawkeyes, who were ranked No. 20 before the game, jumped teams with better records to gain the No. 9 ranking. Varrichione has since admitted that the injuries were fake, in Steve Delsohn's book, Talking Irish: The Oral History Of Notre Dame Football. In addition, Notre Dame Heisman winner Johnny Lattner praised his team's tactics calling it \"Pretty smart thinking, wasn't it?\".[28] Because of this game, the NCAA changed the rules making players sit out at least one down before returning to the game. On November 17, Iowa (ranked No. 7 in the AP Poll) defeated Ohio State (ranked No. 6), 6–0, before a crowd of 57,732 at Iowa Stadium. Ohio State went into the game with the second best rushing attack in the country but were held to 147 rushing yards, their lowest rushing yardage total in two years. The result broke Ohio State's winning streak of 17 games against conference opponents and clinched for Iowa the conference championship and a berth in the Rose Bowl. After time expired, Iowa fans hauled down the goal posts and paraded through Iowa City.[29] Aided by three rushing touchdowns, the Big Ten Champion Iowa Hawkeyes got off to a 21–6 start at the half. After the half, Iowa scored two more touchdowns and beat Oregon State 35–19. With the victory, Iowa won their first Rose Bowl Game in program history. Quarterback Ken Ploen was the game's MVP ending the game with one rushing touchdown and one passing touchdown. This game was lopsided and by the end of the third quarter, with a 22–6 advantage over the California Golden Bears, Iowa could smell victory (eventually winning by a final margin of 38–12). With their win in the Rose Bowl in 1959, the No. 2 Iowa Hawkeyes (8–1–1) won the Grantland Rice Trophy (in recognition of the national champion) as awarded by the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) following the bowl games. No. 1 Louisiana State (11–0) was crowned national champions in both major polls, AP and Coaches', before the bowl games were played. The LSU Tigers went on to claim a shutout victory in the Sugar Bowl over No. 12 Clemson. Official recap—There weren't many among the 60,160 who jammed Iowa's Kinnick Stadium who thought they were watching a matchup of the eventual Midwest entries in the Rose and Orange Bowls. There probably weren't a whole lot more who thought Iowa would avenge a 57–0 slaughter the Hawkeyes had suffered in Lincoln the year before. However, Iowa took advantage of excellent field position to jump to a 10–0 first-half lead, then held on to win a 10–7 stunner over the seventh-ranked Huskers. The Hawkeye defense held the Huskers to their lowest total offense output of the season—234 yards—and stopped the Nebraska offense three straight times in Iowa territory after Roger Craig's one-yard TD had pulled the Huskers within 10–7 early in the final period. NU was stymied in the fourth quarter by a missed 30-yard field goal, a fumble, and Lou King's diving interception, which secured Iowa's victory with 39 seconds remaining. In the first half, the Hawkeyes capitalized on a short punt and an interception to set up a two-yard TD run by Eddie Phillips and a 35-yard field goal by Lon Olejniczak. Meanwhile, the Huskers were held scoreless through three quarters for the first time since 1973 and didn't get out of their own territory until late in the second period, partly because of Iowa punter Reggie Roby's 50-plus yard average. NU quarterbacks Mark Maurer and Nate Mason completed only 8-of-18 passes for 81 yards and rushed 12 times for minus-2 yards. Iowa used its upset win as a launching pad to defeat such teams as UCLA, Michigan and Purdue and post its first winning season since 1961.[30] \"At this minute, this is the greatest victory of my life,\" Iowa coach Hayden Fry said. \"I'm getting to be an old man and I don't want to hurt any of my other teams that pulled off some upsets. But while I've been at Iowa, this is far and away the greatest victory. \"If you stay with this game long enough, the worm is bound to turn. Don't think we didn't earn this one, either. We did it fair and square, plus we showed a lot of character.\"[31] The Hawkeyes trailed 10–9 late in the fourth quarter, in what may be considered the greatest game played at Kinnick Stadium. Iowa got the ball, with 5:27 left, on their own 22-yard line. Led by their All-American Quarterback, Chuck Long, Iowa drove the ball to the Michigan 12-yard line. As the clock expired, kicker Rob Houghtlin sent one through the uprights, to give Iowa the win. The Hawkeyes would go on to accept an invitation to the 1986 Rose Bowl.[32] The game has gone down in Hawkeye history known simply as \"The Catch\". Iowa was set to play the defending National Champion LSU Tigers. Despite leading the entire game, Iowa found itself down 24–25 and got the ball with only 46 seconds left on the clock. With only a few seconds left in the game, Iowa found itself on their own 44-yard line facing a 2nd and 6. Iowa Quarterback Drew Tate threw the ball 56 yards to Warren Holloway for an Iowa touchdown that gave the Hawkeyes a 30–25 victory over Nick Saban's defending champion Tigers. The touchdown was Holloway's first and only career touchdown.[33] The undefeated Penn State Nittany Lions came into the game ranked No. 3 in the country with hopes of a BCS national championship. The Hawkeyes, on the other hand, were 5–4 and coming off a tough loss at Illinois. The Hawkeyes jumped out to an early lead following a Penn State sack-fumble on 3rd down during its first drive, but the Nittany Lions would come back to take a 13–7 lead into halftime. With less than four minutes left in the game, and trailing 23–21, Iowa strong safety Tyler Sash intercepted Penn State quarterback Daryll Clark's pass inside Iowa territory. The Hawkeyes drove to within field goal range where kicker Daniel Murray made a 31-yard field goal with :01 left to play. Iowa would go on to win 24–23 and hand Penn State its only regular season loss of the year. The Hawkeyes would go on to beat South Carolina in the Outback Bowl. The win would be the first in a 13-game winning streak for Iowa stretching into the 2009 season. The game pitted the ACC Champion Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets against No. 10 Iowa. On Iowa's second drive of the game, quarterback Ricky Stanzi drove the Hawkeyes 80 yards, culminating in a 3-yard touchdown pass to Marvin McNutt, putting Iowa on top 7–0. Iowa scored another touchdown on their next drive, following a Georgia Tech punt, with Stanzi hitting Colin Sandeman for 21 yards, extending the Hawkeyes lead to 14–0. On the ensuing drive, GT punted for the third time in a row. On Iowa's next drive, Stanzi was intercepted by Jerrard Tarrant who returned the pick for a touchdown, cutting Iowa's lead to 14–7. Georgia Tech received the ball at the start of the second half. Iowa took over on downs after Georgia Tech missed a 41-yard field goal. On Iowa's next drive, they extended their lead by three thanks to a 33-yard field goal from kicker Daniel Murray. At the start of the 4th Quarter, Iowa had a 17–7 lead. This lead was cut when Georgia Tech drove down the field for its first and only offensive touchdown of the game. The touchdown cut Iowa's lead to 17–14. However, Iowa running back Brandon Wegher sealed the win for the Hawkeyes with his 32-yard rushing touchdown late in the 4th Quarter. Iowa beat Georgia Tech by a final score of 24–14. The win marked the first BCS Bowl win for the Iowa program (Iowa had won two Rose Bowls prior to the formation of the BCS). The win also marked Iowa's first Orange Bowl victory. Iowa is one of only five Big Ten teams to compete in and win an Orange Bowl. Iowa entered this matchup against the 9–0 Wolverines with a 5–4 record, a letdown given the high expectations entering the season. Michigan arrived in Iowa City with the No. 1 scoring defense and the No. 3 scoring offense in the country. A week after being humbled 41–14 at Penn State, in the midst of a three-game home losing streak, and after trailing 10–0 in the second quarter of this game, the Hawkeyes put forth a gritty, spirited effort. Freshman Keith Duncan drilled a 33-yard field goal as time expired to deliver Iowa a much needed win. Akrum Wadley was the offensive standout for the Hawkeyes with 115 yards rushing, and another 52 yards receiving that included a touchdown late in the first half. The Hawkeye defense did their part as well, allowing only 201 total yards and scoring a safety in the 14–13 win. With Clemson and Washington both losing, this marked only the second time No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 fell during the same day in the regular-season. The other time was October 19, 1985, and one of the games that day was No. 1 Iowa's 12–10 win over No. 2 Michigan. Iowa entered this matchup against the 7–1 Buckeyes with a 5–3 record. At kickoff, the Buckeyes were ranked No. 6 in the nation and although the game was being played at Iowa's Kinnick Stadium, Ohio State was a 21-point favorite to win. Early on, it was an even contest as the teams traded scores on their way to a 17–17 midway through the second quarter. However, in the last 3 minutes of the first half, Iowa TE Noah Fant was on the receiving end of two Nate Stanley TD passes, sending Iowa into the locker room with a 31–17 lead. The second half belonged to the Hawkeyes as they sliced through the Ohio State defense on TD drives of 78, 60 and 47 yards on their way to a resounding 55–24 win. Notable performances from the game were five TD passes by Iowa QB Nathan Stanley, Iowa CB Joshua Jackson's 3 interceptions, Iowa RB Akrum Wadley rushing for 118 yards on 20 carries (5.9) and Ohio State QB J. T. Barrett throwing four INT's along with three TD's. On the day Iowa racked up a total of 487 yards against an Ohio State defense that came into the game only allowing 302 yards per contest. Many pundits remarked after the season that the lop-sided loss to Iowa was the reason that Ohio State was excluded from the College Football Playoff, even though the Buckeyes had won the Big Ten championship.[34] The Hawkeyes entered this game following a close road loss (24–22) at Wisconsin. Minnesota, on the other hand, was coming in with an undefeated 9–0 record and just off a home win against then-undefeated Penn State.[35] However, the Gophers' undefeated season would end during this match, as they fell 23–19 to the Hawkeyes, despite a late comeback rally. Iowa kept the Gophers outside the end zone for two quarters, forcing two Gopher field goals. At the end of the half, the Hawkeyes were up 20–6. The Gophers would respond mightily in the second half, both on offense and defense, outscoring their opponent 13–3 with two touchdowns, one in the third and one in the fourth quarter. They forced a turnover late in the fourth quarter with a chance to win the game, but back to back sacks on first and second down sidelined quarterback Tanner Morgan with an injury, and Cole Kramer had to step in on a 3rd down and 21. His hail mary attempt was ultimately intercepted by Riley Moss, clinching the Hawkeyes' upset.[36] Minnesota would clinch the Big Ten West and play Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship if they won this match, even if they were to later fall to Wisconsin in the season finale, since the Badgers had two conference losses. However, this loss opened the door for Wisconsin to regain a shot at winning the West, which they were able to pull off by upsetting the Gophers on the road.[37] This was also the first of four straight wins for Iowa to end the season. Many pundits called them the \"strongest 3-loss team in the country\" prior to the game, as they lost in three road games by a total of 14 points to conference powers Michigan, Penn State and Wisconsin.[38] Since 2008, Iowa is 5–1 against AP-top 10 teams at home, their lone loss coming in 2017 to Penn State on a touchdown pass as the clock expired.[39] Extending from the previous season, Penn State was on a 10-game winning streak and Iowa was on a 12-game winning streak. Both teams were ranked in the Top 5 and Fox's Big Noon Kickoff came to Iowa City for the game. Penn State jumped out to an early 17–3 lead before Iowa closed the gap to 7 by the end of the half. In the 3rd Quarter Penn State would extend the lead to 20–10, but the Nittany Lions would not score again in the game. Iowa would again close the gap to 7 points with a field goal to close out scoring in the 3rd Quarter. Iowa scored another field goal and a touchdown in the 4th Quarter which was enough to give Iowa the 24–20 win. After the game, Iowa extended its season record to 6–0 and obtained its third win over a ranked team in the early season. As a result of Alabama's loss to Texas A&M, Iowa would go on to be ranked #2 in the AP and Coaches Poll the following week. Iowa's official fight song is the \"Iowa Fight Song\" which is sung by the marching band and the fans. Iowa's school song is \"On Iowa\". Iowa also plays a third fight song, entitled \"Roll Along Iowa\". After victories the band plays the Im Himmel gibt's kein Bier Polka, which translates to \"In Heaven There is No Beer\". Before the game (since 2005) the team has exited the tunnel together to \"Back in Black\" by AC/DC before joining hands and running onto the field in unison to \"Enter Sandman\" by Metallica.[40] This became known as \"The Swarm.\" Iowa's mascot is Herky the Hawk, a black and gold caricature of a Hawk. Herky was created as a cartoon in 1948, and first appeared at a sporting event in 1959. Herky was actually named after the Greek God Hercules. The term \"Hawkeye\" originally appeared in the 19th century historical novel The Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper; it was later used in its plural form to describe the people of the state of Iowa. The University of Iowa adopted this as the nickname for its athletic teams. Founded in 1881, the Hawkeye Marching Band now performs at all Iowa Hawkeye home football games. The band also travels with the team to usually one away game per year and any post-season bowl games. In 2017, Hawkeyes fans created what ESPN called \"college football's coolest new tradition\". In February of that year, the university's children's hospital, which has long had a close relationship with the Iowa football program, opened a new 12-story building across the street from Kinnick Stadium, with the top few floors featuring an unobstructed view of the playing field.[41] The top floor of the hospital features the Press Box Café, a lounge area with floor-to-ceiling windows facing the field that is reserved for patients and their families on Hawkeyes game days, with big-screen TVs available when Iowa plays on the road.[41][42] Following a suggestion posted to a Hawkeyes fan page on Facebook, by Iowan Krista Young, fans now face the hospital and wave to the children and their families at the end of the first quarter of every home game. For home night games, the first of which was against Penn State on September 23, 2017, \"The Wave\" features fans waving with their cell phone flashlights turned on.[42] Two weeks after the Penn State game, with the Hawkeyes at home against Illinois, the Hawkeye Marching Band joined in this new tradition, forming a hand moving side-to-side and \"waving\" at the children during its halftime show.[43] The Wave was even seen in the offseason—on February 15, 2018, inspired by a suggestion from nurses at the children's hospital, the stadium's maintenance crew created a pattern of a waving hand in snow that was covering the playing field. At least one patient was reported to have seen the crew creating the design, and upon completion, the crew went into the Press Box Café to see their final product.[44] The tradition has even spread beyond the Iowa fan base. With Iowa playing at Michigan State on September 30, ESPN's College GameDay aired a six-minute feature on The Wave, followed by the feature's reporter, Tom Rinaldi, leading the crowd at the Virginia Tech campus in a wave of their own.[45] A few hours later at the end of the first quarter of the Iowa–Michigan State game, Spartans fans joined in The Wave with visiting Iowa fans.[46] Disney Sports announced it would present the Iowa football program with its Disney's Wide World of Sports Spirit Award, which annually goes to college football's most inspirational figure on November 20, 2017. The award was presented to the University of Iowa for The Wave on ESPN on December 7, 2017.[47] Since the 2023 season, Iowa has been ranked in the final Associated Press poll 26 times and the Coaches 25 times. The Hawkeyes have finished the season ranked in the Top 10 in the Associated Press poll 13 times. The 1940s and 1970s are the only decades that the Iowa Hawkeyes have not had a team finish in the Associated Press poll Top 10 since the poll's inception in 1936. The Hawkeyes have also been ranked in the final College Football Playoff Rankings five times since its inception in 2014. An Iowa player has been selected as a Consensus All-Americans 35 times, with 33 players having been honored as such (two players Cal Jones and Larry Station received the honor twice). A total of 16 Hawkeyes have been named as unanimous All-American. In 2013, Iowa introduced the Kinnick Stadium Wall of Honor. Players inducted into the Kinnick Wall of Honor have their name and number placed on the Kinnick Stadium Press Box. The Hawkeyes have won 17 NCFAA individual player awards. Iowa also won the 2017 Disney's Wide World of Sports Spirit Award, Iowa Head Coach Kirk Ferentz won the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year Award in 2015 and Iowa Defensive Coordinator Phil Parker won the Broyles Award in 2023 bringing Iowa's total NCFAA awards to 20. •Heisman Trophy •Maxwell Award •Davey O'Brien Award •Ray Guy Award •John Mackey Award •Lou Groza Award •Butkus Award •Doak Walker Award •Jim Thorpe Award •Outland Trophy •Dave Rimington Trophy •AP Athlete of the Year •AP Player of the Year •UPI Lineman of the Year •Ozzie Newsome Award •Jack Tatum Trophy •William V.

Both Kinnick and Jones were consensus first team All-Americans, and both men died in separate plane crashes before their 25th birthday. Kinnick won the University of Iowa's only Heisman Trophy in 1939 and is the man for whom Kinnick Stadium is named. Jones was the first African-American to win the Outland Trophy and is one of only two Hawkeyes to be named Consensus All-American two times. Jones also finished 10th in the Heisman Trophy voting, an impressive finish for a lineman. Five Hawkeyes have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[49] Iowa has 16 inductees in the College Football Hall of Fame.[55] The Rose Bowl has inducted four Iowa coaches and players into the Rose Bowl Game Hall of Fame.[58] Iowa has had at least one player drafted in every NFL Draft since 1978. Through the 2020 NFL draft, Iowa has had 294 draft picks. 254 in the NFL, 21 in the AFL, and 7 in the AAFC (the AFC and AAFC both merged with the NFL). and 83 players have gone in the first three rounds of the NFL Draft. Iowa has had 26 first round NFL Draft selections:[60] Announced schedules as of June 28, 2022[61]",

                "content": "The 2023 Iowa Hawkeyes football team represented the University of Iowa as members of the West Division of the Big Ten Conference during the 2023 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Hawkeyes were led by Kirk Ferentz in his 25th year as head coach. The Hawkeyes played their home games at Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City, Iowa, and sold out all seven home contests for the second consecutive season. The Iowa Hawkeyes football team drew an average home attendance of 69,250 in 2023. With a victory over Illinois on Senior Day, Iowa secured the Big Ten West title for the third time. A win over rival Nebraska in the regular season finale completed a 10-win regular season. They competed in the Big Ten Championship Game against the East Division champion No. 2 Michigan, where they were shutout by the eventual national champions 26–0. The Hawkeyes ended the 2023 season with a 35-0 shutout loss to No. 21 Tennessee in the Citrus Bowl. Senior punter Tory Taylor was named First-team All-Big Ten for the third time, Eddleman–Fields Punter of the Year for the second time, a Unanimous First-team All-American, and the 2023 Ray Guy Award winner as the nation's most outstanding punter. Despite missing the final four games due to a season-ending injury, junior cornerback Cooper DeJean was named First-team All-Big Ten for the second time, Tatum–Woodson Defensive Back of the Year, Rodgers–Dwight Return Specialist of the Year, and a Unanimous First-team All-American. Defensive coordinator Phil Parker won the Broyles Award as the nation's top assistant coach in college football. The team became infamous over the course of the season for their great defense being paired with a historically terrible offense, causing some to call them the \"Best Worst Team Ever\".[1][2] The four lowest Over/Unders in college football history were set in games involving the 2023 Hawkeyes, the lowest being an O/U of 24.5 against Nebraska.[3][4] In each of those four games the final combined score was below the line. On October 30, it was announced that offensive coordinator Brian Ferentz would not be retained in 2024, but would be allowed to finish the rest of the 2023 season. At the time of the announcement, the Hawkeyes' offense was averaging 19.5 points per game, ranking 120th out of 133 in the FBS.[5] Iowa lost several players in the transfer portal, including top two wide receivers Keagan Johnson and Arland Bruce IV, backup quarterback Alex Padilla, and running back Gavin Williams. Two top defensive players, cornerback Terry Roberts and linebacker Jestin Jacobs, transferred to Miami and Oregon, respectively. Iowa added players in the transfer portal before the 2023 season, including Michigan quarterback Cade McNamara, Michigan tight end Erick All, and Charleston Southern wide receiver Seth Anderson, son of NFL wide receiver Flipper Anderson. Saginaw Valley State offensive tackle Daijon Parker committed to Iowa after originally committing to Virginia. Iowa was picked second in the West Division by Big Ten media, behind Wisconsin.[6] Roster Last update: September 26, 2023 The Hawkeyes' season opener was the first matchup in the series since a 48–7 win in 2002. It was also the first Iowa career start for Cade McNamara who threw for 191 yards and two touchdowns to start out the year 1–0.[42][43] The Hawks avenged last season's 10–7 defeat by collecting their sixth straight victory at Jack Trice Stadium, earning Kirk Ferentz his 200th collegiate career win.[44][45][46] The Hawkeyes evened the all-time series (2–2), building on the 59–3 victory in 2013. A blocked punt in the third quarter that resulted in a safety proved to be the turning point in cementing Iowa's upper hand. After trailing 10–7 in the second quarter, the Hawks scored the final 34 points of the game.[47][48] In a game played under the lights in Happy Valley between two unbeaten top 25 teams, Iowa was humbled by the Nittany Lions. The Hawkeyes, wearing alternate uniforms, were dominated in every phase of the game.[49][50] Iowa recorded back-to-back victories in series for first time since 2009–2010. The Spartans were looking to avenge a humbling loss from their last visit – 49–7 in 2020 – during a week where there head coach Mel Tucker was fired. With Cade McNamara suffering a season-ending knee injury in the first quarter the offense continued to struggle. Cooper DeJean returned a punt 70 yards to give Iowa the lead for good with under four minutes left. This game marked Kirk Ferentz's 200th Big Ten Conference regular season game as Iowa's head coach (116–84).[51][52][53] Purdue had won two of the last three at Kinnick Stadium, the latter of which spoiled the Hawkeyes' homecoming, unbeaten record, and No. 2 AP ranking. They had a chance to win again but were held on a fourth down. This was the first start for QB Deacon Hill in the 1,300th game in Iowa program history. He struggled in the first half but settled down in the second.[54][55][56] Iowa won at Wisconsin for the first time since 2015 and recorded back-to-back wins in rivalry series for the first time since 2008–2009. This was a defensive struggle with both teams trading punt after punt. The Hawkeyes never trailed in the game and grabbed ahold of the Big Ten West lead.[57][58][59] The Hawkeyes, ranked in the top 25 again after a 3-week absence, had won eight straight and 9 of 10 in the series entering the game. Minnesota won at Kinnick Stadium for the first time since 1999. A controversial penalty upset Iowa fans at the end of the game, negating a potential game-winning touchdown by Cooper DeJean.[60][61] Iowa has won four of five in this series. The game at Wrigley Field was the first time the Hawkeyes have played on a baseball field since the 2017 Pinstripe Bowl. The game was yet another defensive struggle with neither team even scoring in the first half. Hawkeye kicker Drew Stevens nailed a 52-yard field goal with seconds left to defeat the Wildcats.[62][63][64][65] Kirk Ferentz has yet to lose to Rutgers, and this victory tied him with Bo Schembechler in career wins (194) as a Big Ten coach. After struggling to score in the first half, the Hawkeyes found their rhythm in the second. Iowa is now 4–0 against the Scarlet Knights all-time, shutting them out for a second time.[66][67] Illinois broke a long losing streak in the series in previous year, but has not won at Kinnick Stadium since 1999. A victory on Senior Day gave the Hawkeyes the Big Ten West outright, and Kirk Ferentz moved all alone into third place in career wins as a Big Ten head coach.[68][69][70] In this rivalry matchup, No. 17 Iowa racked up its 10th win of the season, its sixth straight win in Lincoln, and kept Nebraska from reaching bowl eligibility for the first time since 2016 as they recaptured the Heroes Trophy. After having two field goals blocked earlier in the game, Iowa kicked a game-winner as time expired to escape with the victory.[71][72][73] Fox's Big Noon Kickoff was on hand for this top 20 match-up. Iowa was attempting to defeat Michigan for the first time since 2016 and earn the program's first outright Big Ten title since 1985, but it wasn't to be. Two years after being humbled by the Wolverines in the Big The Championship Game, the Hawkeyes were unable to pose a scoring threat in this one and were blanked 26–0.[74][75] Iowa made its second Citrus Bowl appearance in three years and third overall. The Hawkeyes, looking to redeem themselves in three phases - being shut out in previous game, a narrow loss in last Citrus Bowl appearance, and being blown out by Tennessee in a bowl game nine years prior, were dominated from start to finish in Brian Ferentz's last game as offensive coordinator.[76][77][78][79]",

                "content": "The Atlanta Falcons are a professional American football team based in Atlanta. The Falcons compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) South division. The Falcons were founded on June 30, 1965, and joined the NFL in 1966[6] as an expansion team, after the NFL offered then-owner Rankin Smith a franchise to keep him from joining the rival American Football League (AFL). In their 57 years of existence, the Falcons have compiled a record of 390–503–6 (380–489–6 in the regular season and 10–14 in the playoffs), winning division championships in 1980, 1998, 2004, 2010, 2012, and 2016. The Falcons have appeared in two Super Bowls, the first during the 1998 season in Super Bowl XXXIII, where they lost to the Denver Broncos 34–19,[7] and the second 18 years later, a 34–28 overtime loss to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI. They are the oldest major professional sports team in America with no championships.[8] The Falcons' current home field is Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which opened for the 2017 season; the team's headquarters and practice facilities are located at a 50-acre (20 ha) site in Flowery Branch,[9] northeast of Atlanta in Hall County. Professional football first came to Atlanta in 1962, when the American Football League (AFL) staged two preseason contests, with one featuring the Denver Broncos vs. the Houston Oilers and the second pitting the Dallas Texans against the Oakland Raiders. Two years later, the AFL held another exhibition, this time with the New York Jets taking on the San Diego Chargers. In 1965, after the Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium (then known simply as Atlanta Stadium) was built, the city of Atlanta felt the time was right to start pursuing professional football.[10] One independent group which had been active in NFL exhibition promotions in Atlanta applied for franchises in both the AFL and NFL, acting entirely on its own with no guarantee of stadium rights. Another group reported it had deposited earnest money for a team in the AFL.[11] With everyone running in different directions, some local businessmen (Cox Broadcasting) worked out a deal and were awarded an AFL franchise on June 8, contingent upon acquiring exclusive stadium rights from city officials.[12][13] NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who had been moving slowly in Atlanta matters, was spurred by the AFL interest and headed on the next plane down to Atlanta to block the rival league's claim on the city of Atlanta.[6][10][13] He forced the city to make a choice between the two leagues;[14] by June 30, the city picked Rankin Smith and the NFL.[10][15] The AFL's original expansion plans in June 1965 were for two new teams in 1966,[16][17] in Atlanta and Philadelphia.[18] It later evolved into the Miami Dolphins in 1966 and the Cincinnati Bengals in 1968. The NFL had planned to add two teams in 1967; the competition with the AFL for Atlanta forced the first to be added a year early in 1966. The odd number of teams (15) resulted in one idle team (bye) each week, with each team playing 14 games over 15 weeks (similar to 1960: 12 games over 13 weeks). The second expansion team, the New Orleans Saints, joined the NFL as planned in 1967 as its sixteenth franchise. The Atlanta Falcons franchise began when it was approved to begin play in 1966 by a unanimous vote of the NFL club owners on June 21, 1965.[19] Rozelle granted ownership nine days later on June 30 to 40-year-old Rankin Smith Sr., an executive vice president of Life Insurance Company of Georgia. He paid $8.5 million, the highest price in NFL history at the time for a franchise.[6] Rozelle and Smith made the deal in about five minutes and the Atlanta Falcons brought the largest and most popular sport to the city of Atlanta. The Atlanta expansion team became the 15th NFL franchise, and they were awarded the first overall pick in the 1966 NFL draft as well as the final pick in each of the first five rounds.[20] They selected consensus All-American linebacker Tommy Nobis from the University of Texas, making him the first-ever Falcon. The league also held the expansion draft six weeks later in which Atlanta selected unprotected players from the 14 existing franchises. Although the Falcons selected many good players in those drafts, they still were not able to win right away.[6] The Atlanta team received its nickname on August 29, 1965. Miss Julia Elliott, a school teacher from Griffin, was singled out from many people who suggested \"Falcons\" as the nickname for the new franchise.[21] She wrote: \"the Falcon is proud and dignified, with great courage and fight. It never drops its prey. It is deadly and has a great sporting tradition.\"[22][23] The Falcons' inaugural season was in 1966, and their first preseason game was on August 1, a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Under head coach Norb Hecker, Atlanta lost their first nine regular-season games in 1966; their first victory came on the road against the struggling New York Giants on November 20 in Yankee Stadium. Two weeks later, Atlanta won at Minnesota, and beat St. Louis in Atlanta the next week for their first home win.[24] The team finished with a 1–12–1 record the next year, with the only win coming in Week 7 in a 21–20 win over the Minnesota Vikings in 1967.[25] After a 0–3 start to the 1968 season, Hecker was dismissed.[26] Norm Van Brocklin finished out the season as head coach with a 2–9 record.[27] Van Brocklin continued to coach the team the next season. The team improved to a 6–8 record in 1969.[28] The Falcons had their first Monday Night Football game in Atlanta during the 1970 season, a 20–7 loss to the Miami Dolphins. The team went 4–8–2 in 1970.[29] The only two winning seasons in their first 12 years were 1971 (7–6–1) and 1973 (9–5). In the 1978 season, the 9–7 Falcons qualified for the playoffs for the first time and won the Wild Card game against the Eagles 14–13.[30][31] The following week, they lost to the Dallas Cowboys 27–20 in the Divisional Playoffs.[32] The 1979 team regressed to a 6–10 record.[33] In the 1980 season, after a nine-game winning streak, the Falcons posted a franchise then-best record of 12–4 and captured their first NFC West division title. The next week, their dream season ended at home with a loss to the Cowboys 30–27 in the divisional playoffs. In the strike-shortened 1982 season, the 5–4 Falcons made the playoffs but lost to the Minnesota Vikings, 30–24.[34] Falcons coach Leeman Bennett was fired after the loss.[35] The team then had losing seasons for the next eight years. Dan Henning was hired prior to the 1983 season.[36] In the 1989 NFL draft, the Falcons selected cornerback Deion Sanders in the first round, who helped them for the next four years, setting many records for the franchise.[37] \"Neon Deion\" (a.k.a. \"Prime Time\") had a flashy appeal and helped bring media attention to one of the league's most anonymous franchises. Sanders was also famous for playing on major league baseball teams (New York Yankees and the Atlanta Braves) while simultaneously playing in the NFL. After defeating the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Wild Card game, the Falcons' 1991 season ended in a divisional playoff loss to the Washington Redskins. In the 1991 NFL draft, the Falcons selected quarterback Brett Favre as the 33rd overall pick. During his rookie season, he played in two games where he amassed a record of four passing attempts with no receptions and two interceptions. The following February, Favre was traded to the Green Bay Packers.[38] In 1992, the Atlanta Falcons opened a new chapter in their history moving into the newly constructed Georgia Dome, where the team has defeated all 31 other NFL teams at least once during its time there.[39] In 1998, under recently acquired head coach Dan Reeves, quarterback Chris Chandler and running back Jamal Anderson the \"Dirty Bird\" Falcons had their greatest season to date.[40][41] On November 8, they beat the New England Patriots 41–10, ending a streak of 22 losses at cold-weather sites. The team finished with a franchise-best 14–2 regular-season record and the NFC West division championship.[42] On January 17, 1999, the Falcons upset the top-seeded Vikings at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in the NFC Championship Game 30–27, in an exciting overtime victory. However, in their first-ever Super Bowl appearance, they lost 34–19 to the defending champion Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII. In the second game of the Falcons 1999 season, running back Jamal Anderson, who had been a key player in the Falcons' 1998 success, suffered a season-ending knee injury. The Falcons finished the season with a very disappointing 5–11 regular-season record.[43] In 2000, the Falcons suffered through another horrendous season finishing 4–12 and once again missing the playoffs.[44] In the 2001 NFL draft, the Falcons orchestrated a trade with the San Diego Chargers, acquiring the first overall pick (which was used on quarterback Michael Vick) in exchange for wide receiver-return specialist Tim Dwight and the fifth overall pick (used on running back LaDainian Tomlinson).[45] The Falcons finished the 2001 season with a record of 7–9 and missed the playoffs.[46] Jessie Tuggle retired following 14 seasons in Atlanta.[47] On December 6, 2001, billionaire Home Depot co-founder Arthur M. Blank reached a preliminary agreement with the Falcons' Taylor Smith to purchase the team for a reported $545 million.[48] In a special meeting prior to Super Bowl XXXVI in New Orleans on February 2, 2002, NFL owners voted unanimously to approve the deal.[49] The 2002 season saw the Falcons return to the playoffs with a regular-season record of 9–6–1, tying the Pittsburgh Steelers.[50] It was Vick's first year as the starter, and the team, with newly acquired running back Warrick Dunn, delivered the Green Bay Packers their first home playoff loss ever with a 27–7 result in the Wild Card Round.[51] A 20–6 loss to the Donovan McNabb-led Philadelphia Eagles the following week, however, ended the Falcons' season.[52] On March 19, 2003, the Falcons presented their new logo.[53][6] During the 2003 preseason Vick broke his leg and missed the first 12 games of the season. After losing 7 straight games, the decision was made to fire head coach Dan Reeves.[54] Wade Phillips acted as interim coach for the final three games.[55] Although the Falcons won 3 of their last 4 games after the return of Vick, they ended up with a 5–11 record that year.[56] In 2004, a new head coach, Jim L. Mora, was hired and Vick returned for the full season. The Falcons went 11–5, winning their third division title and earning a first-round bye into the playoffs. In the divisional playoffs, the Falcons defeated the St. Louis Rams, 47–17, in the Georgia Dome, advancing to the NFC Championship Game, which they lost to the Eagles, 27–10.[57][58][59] The Falcons again fell short of achieving back-to-back winning seasons in 2005, going 8–8.[60] In 2006, Michael Vick became the first quarterback in league history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season, with 1,039.[61] After finishing the season 7–9, however, coach Jim Mora was dismissed.[62] Bobby Petrino, the University of Louisville's football coach, replaced Mora.[63] Before the 2007 season began, Vick was suspended indefinitely by the NFL after pleading guilty to charges involving dog fighting in the state of Virginia.[64] On December 10, 2007, Vick received a 23-month prison sentence and was officially cut from the Atlanta roster.[65] For the 2007 season, the Falcons were forced to start Joey Harrington at quarterback.[66] On December 11, 13 games into his first NFL season as head coach, Bobby Petrino resigned without notice to coach at the University of Arkansas, leaving the beleaguered players only a note in the locker room.[67] Secondary Coach Emmitt Thomas was named interim coach for the final three games of the season on December 12. The Falcons ended the year with a dismal 4–12 record.[68] After the tumultuous and disappointing 2007 season, the Falcons made a number of moves, hiring a new general manager and head coach, drafting a new starting quarterback, and signing a starting running back. On January 13, 2008, the Falcons named former Patriots director of college football scouting Thomas Dimitroff General Manager.[69] On January 23, Jacksonville Jaguars defensive coach and former linebackers coach for the 2000 Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens Mike Smith was named the Falcons' new head coach.[70] Chargers back-up running back Michael Turner agreed to a 6-year, $30 million deal on March 2.[71] On April 26, Matt Ryan (quarterback from Boston College) was drafted third overall in the 2008 NFL draft by the Falcons.[72] The Falcons finished the 2008 regular season with a record of 11–5, and the #5 seed in the playoffs.[73] On December 21, 2008, Atlanta beat the Minnesota Vikings 24–17 to clinch a wild card spot, earning a trip to the playoffs for the first time since 2004. The Falcons would go on to lose in the wild-card round of the 2008 NFL playoffs to the eventual NFC champion Arizona Cardinals, 30–24.[74] Matt Ryan started all 16 games in his rookie season and was named the Associated Press Offensive Rookie of the Year.[75] First-year head coach Mike Smith was named 2008 NFL Coach of the Year.[76] Although they failed to make the playoffs in 2009 the team rallied to win their final three regular-season games to record back-to-back winning seasons for the first time in franchise history. The Falcons defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 20–10 in the final game of the season to improve their record to 9–7.[77] In 2010, with a regular-season record of 13–3, the Falcons secured a third straight winning season, their fourth overall divisional title, and the top overall seed in the NFC playoffs; however, the Falcons were overpowered by the eventual Super Bowl XLV champion Green Bay Packers in the NFC Divisional Playoffs 48–21.[78][79] The Falcons scored 414 points – the fifth-most in franchise history.[7] The team sent an NFL-high and franchise-best nine players to the 2011 Pro Bowl.[80] The Falcons made a surprise trade up with the Cleveland Browns in the 2011 NFL draft to select Alabama wide receiver Julio Jones sixth overall. In exchange, the Falcons gave up their first-, second- and fourth-round draft picks in 2011, and their first and fourth draft picks in 2012.[81] Jones, along with teammates Tony Gonzalez and Roddy White, have since been dubbed Atlanta's \"Big Three\" (based on their total number of reception yards).[82] On August 30, 2011, Sports Illustrated senior writer Peter King, who correctly predicted the 2011 Super Bowl, made his predictions for the 2011 season and picked the Falcons to defeat the San Diego Chargers in the 2012 Super Bowl.[83] The Falcons finished the season at 10–6, securing the fifth seed after a Week 17 beatdown of Tampa Bay in which the Falcons pulled their starters after leading 42–0 just 23 minutes into the game.[84] The Falcons then went on to play the New York Giants in a 2011 NFC Wild Card Game at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The first half was a defensive struggle, with the first points coming off of a safety by the Falcons, giving Atlanta a 2–0 lead. In the second quarter, though, Eli Manning connected with Hakeem Nicks for a short touchdown pass to make it 7–2 Giants heading into the second half. Then the Giants took control, as Manning threw for two more touchdown passes to Mario Manningham and Nicks and the defense completed its shutout of the Falcons to give the New York Giants the win, 24–2, and the Falcons their third straight playoff loss with Matt Ryan and Mike Smith.[85] After the season, defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder accepted a coaching job at Auburn University, and the offensive coordinator Mike Mularkey took the head coaching job in Jacksonville.[86] Atlanta exploded out of the gate, going a franchise-best 8–0 and remaining the last unbeaten team in the NFL that year.[87] Their hopes to get an undefeated season came to an end with a 27–31 loss to the division rival Saints. Julio Jones had a remarkable second year, grabbing 10 touchdowns and 1,198 yards. The Falcons finished the season 13–3, and clinched the number one seed in the NFC playoffs.[88][89] The Falcons played the Seattle Seahawks in their first playoff game. Although they went down 28–27 with only 31 seconds left on the clock, Matt Ryan led the team to their first playoff victory, 30–28.[90] It was the only playoff victory in the Mike Smith era. The Atlanta Falcons then advanced to face the San Francisco 49ers. The Falcons seized control of the game early with a Matt Bryant field goal, a trio of Matt Ryan touchdown passes caught by Julio Jones and Tony Gonzalez coupled with outstanding defensive play. By the end of the half, the score was 24–14. The tides of the game began to shift in the second half as the 49ers rallied back with a pair of Frank Gore touchdown runs. Atlanta's offense attempted to reply but were ultimately shut down by the 49er defense. A few series later, late in the 4th quarter with little time remaining, Atlanta found themselves in a 4th and 4 situation at the 10-yard line. The Falcons needed just 10 more yards to secure victory and advance to their first Super Bowl berth in 14 years. Matt Ryan fired a pass to Roddy White which was ultimately broken up by inside linebacker NaVorro Bowman, resulting in a 28–24 defeat.[91] Following the success of the previous season, the Falcons were an expected Super Bowl contender. However, injuries hampered the team's performance and the team finished the season 4–12.[92] With that, the streak of consecutive winning seasons came to an end and Mike Smith had his first losing season as a head coach. Tony Gonzalez, in his final season in the NFL, was selected to the 2014 Pro Bowl as a starter representing Team Rice. Following the conclusion of the 2012 season, director of player personnel Les Snead departed the team to join the St. Louis Rams and Dave Caldwell, assistant to general manager Thomas Dimitroff, left the team to join the Jacksonville Jaguars. Scott Pioli, former GM of the Kansas City Chiefs, was announced as the Falcons' new assistant GM. Mike Smith was given a one-year extension on his contract as head coach. The Falcons had the 6th overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft with which they selected Jake Matthews, who played as offensive tackle for Texas A&M.[93] Despite having another rough season, the Falcons still had an opportunity to qualify for the playoffs at the end of the regular season. The Falcons hosted the Carolina Panthers in their regular season finale, with the winners clinching the NFC South division. Unfortunately, the Falcons lost in a 34–3 blowout as Matt Ryan threw two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns and got sacked six times. The Falcons finished the season 6–10, marking the second consecutive losing season for the team.[94] The following day, Mike Smith was fired after seven seasons as head coach.[95] The Falcons would soon hire Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator Dan Quinn as the team's 16th head coach.[96] The Falcons had the 8th overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft with which they selected Vic Beasley, a defensive end from Clemson University.[97] In February 2015, the team was investigated by the NFL for alleged use of artificial crowd noise in the Georgia Dome.[98] The Falcons lost a 2016 NFL draft selection as a result of the league's investigation.[99] Dan Quinn's first season saw a 5–0 start, the team's best start in four years. They would then struggle throughout the rest of the season by losing 8 of their last 11 games, resulting in an 8–8 record in the 2015 season.[100] They did, however, give the Panthers their only regular-season loss. The Falcons used their first-round pick in the 2016 NFL draft on safety Keanu Neal from the University of Florida.[101] In the Falcons' 25th and final season in the Georgia Dome, Atlanta lost their week 1 game to the Buccaneers 24–31. The Falcons would then win their next four including one over the Panthers, when the franchise set new records: Matt Ryan threw for 503 yards, and Julio Jones caught 12 passes for 300 yards.[102] Beating the San Francisco 49ers 41–13 in Week 15, the Falcons improved to 9–5 and secured their first winning season since 2012. One week later, the Falcons defeated the Panthers in Charlotte, North Carolina, and clinched their first NFC South division title since 2012. In their last regular-season game at the Georgia Dome, the Falcons defeated the New Orleans Saints, and secured an 11–5 record and a first-round bye.[103] In the divisional round of the playoffs, Atlanta defeated the Seahawks 36–20 in the Georgia Dome, and hosted their last game at the Georgia Dome against the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game on January 22, 2017.[104] The Falcons defeated the Packers 44–21 to advance to Super Bowl LI as the NFC champions.[105] Atlanta was up 28–3 late in the third quarter, and the New England Patriots scored 31 unanswered points, with the last 6 in the first-ever overtime in the Super Bowl. The Patriots' 25-point comeback was the largest in Super Bowl history.[106] In 2016, the Falcons scored 540 points in the regular season, the seventh-most in NFL history, tied with the Greatest Show on Turf (the 2000 St. Louis Rams).[107] However, the Falcons defense gave up 406 points, 27th in the league.[108] The Falcons moved into their new home, the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, this season.[109] Their first game ever played at the new stadium was a preseason loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The first regular-season game at the new stadium was a rematch of the 2016–17 NFC Championship, with Atlanta defeating Green Bay 34–23.[110] Their first loss of the season was a 23–17 home defeat to the Buffalo Bills in week 4.[111] The team returned to the playoffs with a 10–6 record (albeit with a third-place finish in the NFC South). The Falcons defeated the Los Angeles Rams 26–13 in the Wild Card round, but their 2017 season came to an end a week later in the Divisional Playoff round at the hands of the eventual Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles 15–10.[112][113] The 2018 and 2019 seasons saw the Falcons go 7–9 and miss the postseason both years.[114][115] In their first game with new uniforms, the Falcons lost to the Seattle Seahawks at home 38–25.[116] The Falcons then suffered comebacks made by both the Cowboys on the road (39–40) and then back in Atlanta against the Bears (26–30).[117][118] On October 11, after the team suffered a 23–16 loss at home against the Carolina Panthers and fell to 0–5, the Falcons announced the firings of Quinn and Dimitroff.[119] Defensive coordinator Raheem Morris took over for the rest of the season, leading the team to a 4–12 record.[120] Morris was not retained after the season, and soon joined the Los Angeles Rams as their defensive coordinator.[121] On January 15, 2021, the Falcons announced that Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator Arthur Smith had been named the 18th head coach in franchise history.[122] Four days later, New Orleans Saints executive Terry Fontenot was named the Falcons' new general manager.[123] Tight end Kyle Pitts was selected with the 4th pick of the 2021 draft, and longtime star receiver Julio Jones was traded to the Titans, after publicly requesting a trade from Atlanta.[124][125] The Falcons improved on their record from the prior year, finishing the season with a 7–10 record.[126] On March 21, 2022, the Falcons traded longtime star quarterback Matt Ryan to the Indianapolis Colts.[127] During the 2022 season, the team finished last place in the NFC South with a 7–10 record.[128] The Falcons entered the 2023 seasons with heightened expectations after drafting Texas running back Bijan Robinson with the eighth overall pick of the 2023 draft and making significant improvements in free agency, including signing Jessie Bates and Calais Campbell to improve their defense.[129] However, the team finished with a 7–10 record for the third consecutive season, although they had been in contention for a playoff spot until the final day of the season before a 48–17 loss to the New Orleans Saints on January 7, 2024.[130] The following day, Smith was fired after three years as head coach.[131] On January 25, 2024, the Falcons announced Raheem Morris's return to the organization, this time as the 19th head coach in Falcons history.[132] During the early months of his tenure, Morris faced scrutiny and criticism for his questionable player selection decisions.[133] The Falcons have called three stadiums home in their 51 years of existence, and its third home in their history opened in the late summer of 2017. The first was the Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, sharing with the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball team until 1991. In 1992, the Georgia Dome was built, and the Falcons played there from its opening to the 2016 season. The Dome has been frequently used for college football, including Georgia State football and college bowl games such as the Peach Bowl. In an effort to replace the aging Georgia Dome and potentially host a future Super Bowl, team owner Arthur Blank proposed a deal with the city of Atlanta to build a new state-of-the-art stadium not far from where the Georgia Dome is located. Blank will contribute $800 million and the city of Atlanta will contribute an additional $200 million via bonds backed by the city's hotel/motel tax towards the construction of a retractable roof stadium. Blank will contribute additional money for cost overruns if it is needed. The team will provide up to $50 million towards infrastructure costs that weren't included in the construction budget and to retire the remaining debt on the Georgia Dome. In addition, Blank's foundation and the city will each provide $15 million for development in surrounding neighborhoods. Though the total cost of the stadium was initially estimated to be around $1 billion,[134] the total cost was revised to $1.5 billion according to Blank.[135] In March 2013, the Atlanta City Council voted 11–4 in favor of building the stadium.[136] The retractable roof Mercedes-Benz Stadium broke ground in May 2014, and became the third home stadium for the Falcons and the first for the new Atlanta United FC Major League Soccer club upon opening in 2017.[137] The Atlanta Falcons' colors are black, red, silver and white.[138] When the team began play in 1966, the Falcons wore red helmets with a black falcon crest logo. In the center of the helmet was a center black stripe surrounded by two gold stripes and two white stripes. These colors represented the two college rival schools in the state of Georgia; rival schools Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (white and gold) and the Georgia Bulldogs (red and black). Although the gold was removed after several seasons, the white remains to this day. They wore white pants and either black or white jerseys. At first, the falcon crest logo was also put on the jersey sleeves, but it was replaced by a red and white stripe pattern four years later. They switched from black to red jerseys in 1971, and the club began to wear silver pants in 1978. The facemasks on the helmets were initially gray, becoming white in 1978, and then black in 1984; the team wore black face masks until its 2020 redesign. A prototype white helmet was developed for the team prior to the 1974 season, but was never worn. In 1990, the uniform design changed to black helmets, silver pants, and either black or white jerseys.[139] The numbers on the white jerseys were black, but were changed to red in 1997. (The red numerals could be seen on the away jerseys briefly in 1990.) Both the logo and uniforms changed in 2003. The logo was redesigned with red and silver accents to depict a more powerful, aggressive falcon, which now more closely resembles the capital letter F.[53][140] Although the Falcons still wore black helmets, the new uniforms featured jerseys and pants with red trim down the sides. The uniform design consisted of either black or white jerseys, and either black or white pants. During that same year, a red alternate jersey with black trim was also introduced. The Falcons also started wearing black cleats with these uniforms.[141] In 2004, the red jerseys became the primary jerseys, and the black ones became the alternate, both worn with white pants. In select road games, the Falcons wear black pants with white jerseys. The Falcons wore an all-black combination for home games against their archrivals, the New Orleans Saints, winning the first two contests (24–21 in 2004 and 36–17 in 2005), but losing 31–13 in 2006. The Falcons wore the all-black combination against the New Orleans Saints for four straight seasons starting in 2004, With the last time being in 2007, losing 34–14. They wore the combination again in 2006, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 2. The Falcons won that game, 14–3. The Falcons also wore their all-black uniform in 2007 against the New York Giants, and in 2008 against the Carolina Panthers and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (for the second time). After that, the black pants and uniforms were retired and the white pants were now used full-time with the regular uniforms. In the 1980s, the Falcons wore their white uniforms at home most of the time because of the heat. When the Falcons started playing in a dome, the team switched to their dark uniforms for home games but have worn their white uniforms at home a few times since switching to the dome. It was announced at the 2009 state of the franchise meeting that the Falcons would wear 1966 throwback uniforms for a couple games during the 2009 season. The Atlanta Falcons wore 1966 throwback jerseys for two home games in 2009 – against the Carolina Panthers on September 20 and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 29. The Falcons won both of those games. They donned the throwbacks again for 2 games in 2010, against Baltimore and San Francisco, winning both of those games as well. The throwbacks were used twice in 2011 and 2012; both times were against the Panthers and Saints. However, the throwbacks were retired following a 2013 NFL rule requiring only one helmet shell per team. The Falcons unveiled an all-red Color Rush uniform on September 13, 2016; however, due to the fact that the Falcons and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had similar all-red Color Rush uniforms, the Falcons were unable to wear their Color Rush uniform until the 2017 season.[142][143] Also in 2016, the Falcons unveiled a mixed throwback uniform set. The uniform tops, pants and socks closely resembled their 1960s kits. From 2016 to 2021, due to the NFL's one-shell rule, the Falcons wore the black helmets with the original logo decal similar to the design they wore in the 1990s. However, starting in 2022, with the NFL now reinstating the use of alternate helmets, the Falcons brought back the original red helmets to pair with their throwback uniforms.[144] It was revealed in January 2020 that the Falcons will change uniforms for the 2020 NFL season.[145] The ensuing design featured the return to black as the primary home uniform color for the first time since 2003. Both the primary home and road uniforms featured the \"ATL\" abbreviation in red above either white or black numbers with red drop shadows. The white and black tops are usually paired with either white or black pants. The alternate uniform featured a red/black gradient design and also featured the \"ATL\" abbreviation in white above white numbers with black drop shadows. Black pants are only used with this uniform. All three uniforms feature red side stripes. The current throwback uniform was also retained. In addition, the Falcons switched to matte helmets with the enlarged falcon logo and gray facemasks.[146] The red/black gradient alternates only lasted three seasons before it was removed from the uniform rotation in 2023.[147] The Falcons have shared a heated divisional rivalry with the New Orleans Saints (first the NFC West, and now the NFC South). The two teams were often basement-dwellers in the division; but the rivalry grew as a means of pride between the two cities, as they were the only two NFL teams in the Deep South for multiple decades. The series is the oldest and most iconic rivalry in the NFC South as the two teams have long harbored bad blood against one another.[148] The series is currently tied at 55–55, including the most recent loss to the Saints on January 7, 2024, when the Falcons lost 48–17.[149] In addition, the Falcons share a similar, rivalry with the Carolina Panthers, with both teams having been in the NFC West from the Panthers' founding in 1995 to the NFL realignment in 2002. Similar to their rivalry with the Saints, the Falcons have often endured several competitive divisional battles with the Panthers for lead of the NFC South, though the two have yet to meet in the postseason. The series is also known as the \"I-85 Rivalry\"[150] due to Atlanta and Charlotte being only four hours apart on Interstate 85.[151][152] The Falcons lead the series 36–22.[153] The Falcons share a less-intense divisional rivalry with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers since the NFL realignment in 2002. The two had been regional opponents but very little had linked any further animosity towards the two as the Buccaneers played in the former NFC Central before the realignment.[154][155][156] The two teams would find themselves competing over staff and players alike, particularly during the 2000s after the Falcons had lured general manager Rich McKay after winning Super Bowl XXXVII the season prior.[157] McKay's ties with Tampa extend into his family as his father John McKay was head coach of the Buccaneers for nine seasons.[158][159][160][161] The Eagles lead the Falcons 21–15–1, with a 3–1 lead in playoff games.[162] The rivalry first emerged after the Falcons upset the Eagles 14–13 in the 1978 Wild Card Round,[163] and only intensified further in the 2000s thanks to the rivalry between prominent dual-threat quarterbacks Donovan McNabb, and Michael Vick. Recently, the Falcons lost to the Eagles in the 2017 divisional round.[164][165][166] The Falcons have also shared a playoff rivalry with the Green Bay Packers as much of the connections between the two teams stems from Atlanta trading future hall-of-fame quarterback Brett Favre to the Green Bay on February 11, 1992, in exchange for a first-round pick.[167][168] The two teams have met four times in the postseason, most recently during the 2016–17 NFC Championship as it would also be the final game played at the Georgia Dome.[169][170][171] The Packers lead the all-time series 19–16, while both teams are tied in the postseason 2–2.[172] Includes postseason records[173] Source:[174] Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 12 reserve, 15 practice squad (+1 exempt) Humphrey is the only person in the Hall of Fame who spent the majority of his career with the Falcons.

Five coaches have served in interim roles[206][207] → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The Falcons' flagship radio station is WZGC 92.9 The Game.[208] Wes Durham, son of longtime North Carolina Tar Heels voice Woody Durham, is the Falcons' play-by-play announcer, with former Atlanta Falcons quarterback and pro football veteran, Dave Archer serving as color commentator.[209][210] In 2014, The CW affiliate WUPA became the official television station of the Falcons, gaining rights to its preseason games, which are produced by CBS Sports.[211] In the regular season, the team's games are seen on Fox's O&O affiliate WAGA. When the Falcons challenge an AFC team, CBS affiliate WANF will air those games while Sunday night games are televised on WXIA, the local NBC affiliate. Source:[212]",

                "content": "Brown is a color. It can be considered a composite color, but it is mainly a darker shade of orange. In the CMYK color model used in printing and painting, brown is usually made by combining the colors orange and black.[4][5][6] In the RGB color model used to project colors onto television screens and computer monitors, brown combines red and green. The color brown is seen widely in nature, wood, soil, human hair color, eye color and skin pigmentation. Brown is the color of dark wood or rich soil.[7] In the RYB color model, brown is made by mixing the three primary colors, red, yellow, and blue. According to public opinion surveys in Europe and the United States, brown is the least favorite color of the public; it is often associated with plainness, the rustic, although it does also have positive associations, including baking, warmth, wildlife, the autumn and music. The term is from Old English brún, in origin for any dusky or dark shade of color. The first recorded use of brown as a color name in English was in 1000.[8][9] The Common Germanic adjectives *brûnoz and *brûnâ meant both dark colors and a glistening or shining quality, whence burnish. The current meaning developed in Middle English from the 14th century.[10] Words for the color brown around the world often come from foods or beverages; in the eastern Mediterranean, the word for brown often comes from the color of coffee: in Turkish, the word for brown is kahverengi; in Greek, kafé. In Portuguese, Spanish and French, the word for brown or for a specific shade of brown is derived from the word for chestnut (castanea in Latin). In Southeast Asia, the color name often comes from chocolate: coklat in Malay; tsokolate in Filipino. In Japan, the word chairo means the color of tea.[11] Brown has been used in art since prehistoric times. Paintings using umber, a natural clay pigment composed of iron oxide and manganese oxide, have been dated to 40,000 BC.[12] Paintings of brown horses and other animals have been found on the walls of the Lascaux cave dating back about 17,300 years. The female figures in ancient Egyptian tomb paintings have brown skin, painted with umber. Light tan was often used on painted Greek amphorae and vases, either as a background for black figures, or the reverse. The Ancient Greeks and Romans produced a fine reddish-brown ink, of a color called sepia, made from the ink of a variety of cuttlefish. This ink was used by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael and other artists during the Renaissance, and by artists up until the present time. In Ancient Rome, brown clothing was associated with the lower classes or barbarians. The term for the plebeians, or urban poor, was \"pullati\", which meant literally \"those dressed in brown\".[13] In the Middle Ages brown robes were worn by monks of the Franciscan order, as a sign of their humility and poverty. Each social class was expected to wear a color suitable to their station; and grey and brown were the colors of the poor. Russet was a coarse homespun cloth made of wool and dyed with woad and madder to give it a subdued grey or brown shade. By the statute of 1363, poor English people were required to wear russet. The medieval poem Piers Plowman describes the virtuous Christian:[14] And is gladde of a goune of a graye russetAs of a tunicle of Tarse or of trye scarlet. In the Middle Ages, dark brown pigments were rarely used in art; painters and book illuminators artists of that period preferred bright, distinct colors such as red, blue and green rather than dark colors. The umbers were not widely used in Europe before the end of the fifteenth century; The Renaissance painter and writer Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) described them as being rather new in his time.[15] Artists began using far greater use of browns when oil painting arrived in the late fifteenth century. During the Renaissance, artists generally used four different browns; raw umber, the dark brown clay mined from the earth around Umbria, in Italy; raw sienna, a reddish-brown earth mined near Siena, in Tuscany; burnt umber, the Umbrian clay heated until it turned a darker shade, and burnt sienna, heated until it turned a dark reddish brown. In Northern Europe, Jan van Eyck featured rich earth browns in his portraits to set off the brighter colors. The 17th and 18th century saw the greatest use of brown. Caravaggio and Rembrandt Van Rijn used browns to create chiaroscuro effects, where the subject appeared out of the darkness. Rembrandt also added umber to the ground layers of his paintings because it promoted faster drying. Rembrandt also began to use new brown pigment, called Cassel earth or Cologne earth. This was a natural earth color composed of over ninety percent organic matter, such as soil and peat. It was used by Rubens and Anthony van Dyck, and later became commonly known as Van Dyck brown. Brown was generally hated by the French impressionists, who preferred bright, pure colors. The exception among French 19th-century artists was Paul Gauguin, who created luminous brown portraits of the people and landscapes of French Polynesia. In the late 20th century, brown became a common symbol in western culture for simple, inexpensive, natural and healthy. Bag lunches were carried in plain brown paper bags; packages were wrapped in plain brown paper. Brown bread and brown sugar were viewed as more natural and healthy than white bread and white sugar. Brown is a dark orange color, made by combining red, yellow and black.[16] It can be thought of as dark orange, but it can also be made in other ways. In the RGB color model, which uses red, green and blue light in various combinations to make all the colors on computer and television screens, it is made by mixing red and green light. In terms of the visible spectrum, \"brown\" refers to long wavelength hues, yellow, orange, or red, in combination with low luminance or saturation.[17] Since brown may cover a wide range of the visible spectrum, composite adjectives are used such as red brown, yellowish brown, dark brown or light brown. As a color of low intensity, brown is a tertiary color: a mix of the three subtractive primary colors is brown if the cyan content is low. Brown exists as a color perception only in the presence of a brighter color contrast.[18] Yellow, orange, red, or rose objects are still perceived as such if the general illumination level is low, despite reflecting the same amount of red or orange light as a brown object would in normal lighting conditions. With few exceptions, all mammals have brown or darkly-pigmented irises.[25] In humans, brown eyes result from a relatively high concentration of melanin in the stroma of the iris, which causes light of both shorter and longer wavelengths to be absorbed[26][27] and in many parts of the world, it is nearly the only iris color present.[28] Dark pigment of brown eyes is most common in East Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, West Asia, Oceania, Africa, Americas, etc. as well as parts of Eastern Europe and Southern Europe.[29] The majority of people in the world overall have dark brown eyes. Brown irises range from highly pigmented, dark brown (almost black) eyes, to very light, almost amber or hazel irises composed partially of lipochrome. of Light or medium-pigmented brown eyes are common in Europe, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Northern India, as well as some parts of the Middle East, and can also be found in populations in East Asia and Southeast Asia, but are proportionally rare. (See eye color). Brown is the second most common color of human hair, after black. It is caused by higher levels of the natural dark pigment eumelanin, and lower levels of the pale pigment pheomelanin. Brown eumelanin is more common among Europeans, while black eumelanin is more often found in the hair on non-Europeans. A small amount of black eumelanin, in the absence of other pigments, results in grey hair. A small amount of brown eumelanin in the absence of other pigments results in blond hair. A majority of people in the world have skin that is a shade of brown, from a very light honey brown or a golden brown, to a copper or bronze color, to a coffee color or a dark chocolate brown. Skin color and race are not the same; many people classified as \"white\" or \"black\" actually have skin that is a shade of brown. Brown skin is caused by melanin, a natural pigment which is produced within the skin in cells called melanocytes. Skin pigmentation in humans evolved to primarily regulate the amount of ultraviolet radiation penetrating the skin, controlling its biochemical effects.[30] Natural skin color can darken as a result of tanning due to exposure to sunlight. The leading theory is that skin color adapts to intense sunlight irradiation to provide partial protection against the ultraviolet fraction that produces damage and thus mutations in the DNA of the skin cells.[31] There is a correlation between the geographic distribution of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and the distribution of indigenous skin pigmentation around the world. Darker-skinned populations are found in the regions with the most ultraviolet, closer to the equator, while lighter skinned populations live closer to the poles, with less UVR, though immigration has changed these patterns.[32] While white and black are commonly used to describe racial groups, brown is rarely used, because it crosses all racial lines. In Brazil, the Portuguese word pardo, which can mean different shades of brown, is used to refer to multiracial people. The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) asks people to identify themselves as branco (white), pardo (brown), negro (black), or amarelo (yellow). In 2008 43.8 percent of the population identified themselves as pardo.[33] (See human skin color). The thin top layer of the Earth's crust on land is largely made up of soil colored different shades of brown.[34] Good soil is composed of about forty-five percent minerals, twenty-five percent water, twenty-five percent air, and five percent organic material, living and dead. Half the color of soil comes from minerals it contains; soils containing iron turn yellowish or reddish as the iron oxidizes. Manganese, nitrogen and sulfur turn brownish or blackish as they decay naturally. Rich and fertile soils tend to be darker in color; the deeper brown color of fertile soil comes from the decomposing of the organic matter. Dead leaves and roots become black or brown as they decay. Poorer soils are usually paler brown in color, and contain less water or organic matter. A large number of mammals and predatory birds have a brown coloration. This sometimes changes seasonally, and sometimes remains the same year-round. This color is likely related to camouflage, since the backdrop of some environments, such as the forest floor, is often brown, and especially in the spring and summertime when animals like the snowshoe hare get brown fur. Most mammals are dichromats and so do not easily distinguish brown fur from green grass. Surveys in Europe and the United States showed that brown was the least popular color among respondents. It was the favorite color of only one percent of respondents and the least favorite color of twenty percent of people.[35] Brown has been a popular color for military uniforms since the late 18th century, largely because of its wide availability and low visibility. When the Continental Army was established in 1775 at the outbreak of the American Revolution, the first Continental Congress declared that the official uniform color would be brown, but this was not popular with many militias, whose officers were already wearing blue. In 1778 the Congress asked George Washington to design a new uniform, and in 1779 Washington made the official color of all uniforms blue and buff.[36] In 1846 the Indian soldiers of the Corps of Guides in British India began to wear a yellowish shade of tan, which became known as khaki from the Urdu word for dust-colored, taken from an earlier Persian word for soil. The color made an excellent natural camouflage, and was adopted by the British Army for their Abyssian Campaign in 1867–1868, and later in the Boer War. It was adopted by the United States Army during the Spanish–American War (1896), and afterwards by the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. In the 1920s, brown became the uniform color of the Nazi Party in Germany. The Nazi paramilitary organization the Sturmabteilung (SA) wore brown uniforms and were known as the brownshirts. The color brown was used to represent the Nazi vote on maps of electoral districts in Germany. If someone voted for the Nazis, they were said to be \"voting brown\". The national headquarters of the Nazi party, in Munich, was called the Brown House. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 was called the Brown Revolution.[37] At Adolf Hitler's Obersalzberg home, the Berghof, he slept in a \"bed which was usually covered by a brown quilt embroidered with a huge swastika. The swastika also appeared on Hitler's brown satin pajamas, embroidered in black against a red background on the pocket. He had a matching brown silk robe.\"[38] Brown had originally been chosen as a Party color largely for convenience; large numbers of war-surplus brown uniforms from Germany's former colonial forces in Africa were cheaply available in the 1920s. It also suited the working-class and military images that the Party wished to convey. From the 1930s onwards, the Party's brown uniforms were mass-produced by German clothing firms such as Hugo Boss.[39][40] Pullman Brown[41] is the color of the United Parcel Service (UPS) delivery company with their trademark brown trucks and uniforms; it was earlier the color of Pullman rail cars of the Pullman Company, and was adopted by UPS both because brown is easy to keep clean, and due to favorable associations of luxury that Pullman brown evoked. UPS has filed two trademarks on the color brown to prevent other shipping companies (and possibly other companies in general) from using the color if it creates \"market confusion\". In its advertising, UPS refers to itself as \"Brown\" (\"What can Brown do for you?\"). Labrecque, et al. (2012) have hypothesized that brown would be related to competence when used in advertising, as the color is typically associated with reliability and support However, they did not find a link between brown and competence.[42]",

It's the first time United have suffered such a fate since September 1962 and they wrap up 2024 in 14th position in the Premier League, seven points above third-bottom Ipswich Town. In the competition's history, four teams in this position in the standings at the turn of the year have suffered relegation at the end of it. Eddie Howe's visitors were swaggeringly excellent during the first half-hour, irrespective of whether they had to be or not. Alexander Isak continued a rich run of goalscoring form with his eighth goal in his past six Premier League outings when he headed home unchallenged from Lewis Hall's fourth-minute cross. There was more defensive incompetence from Ruben Amorim's three centre-backs when Joelinton powered home Anthony Gordon's delivery. It should have been worse for United as the otherwise excellent Sandro Tonali hit the post from close range after Isak botched a straightforward one-on-one. Joshua Zirkzee, a surprise starter for the Red Devils, was substituted in the 33rd minute to roars, catcalls and boos from the home fans, somewhat encapsulating the unedifying spectacle.

The England midfielder set up Casemiro after Fabian Schar's error in first-half stoppage time, but the Brazilian fluffed his lines. United were better after the break as Harry Maguire headed against the post from Diogo Dalot's cross. Substitute Leny Yoro then passed up a presentable headed chance from a right-wing corner with 16 minutes to play. If the home team's relative improvement to avert the total collapse that appeared on the cards during the first period was to Amorim's credit, then what came before did not reflect well on a man who endured his darkest night yet in one of football's most foreboding jobs. The former Sporting CP coach's signature 3-4-3 formation does favours to some United players and not others. Matthijs de Ligt, Maguire and Lisandro Martinez should all enjoy playing in a defensive three, but they were made to look amateurish by the manner of both Newcastle goals. There were square, old and ill-shaped pegs in the myriad holes in front of them. The suspended Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were badly missed in a midfield. Marcus Rashford was back on the bench, seemingly never with a realistic hope of seeing the field. Even then, there was no need for Zirkzee's gruesome ordeal. After that regrettable moment, the Stretford End buoyantly backed their beleaguered side, booming out \"Ruben Amorim's Red and White Army!\" It was an admirable enough show of defiance but is the cycle so dizzying and unrelenting at Old Trafford that we're already into the siege mentality chapter of the latest new dawn? The storm Amorim correctly forecast doesn't look nearly ready to pass. Manchester United suffer three consecutive home games for the first time since 1962. This looked like being a humiliation and they did at least steady the ship after halftime, with Harry Maguire hitting the post. But the first half an hour was as bad as it get sin terms of abject incompetence. The Newcastle fans have just enjoyed a deserved celebration in front of their raucous travelling fans. They played brilliantly during the the first half and you can be a few rungs below brilliant to have your way with this United side right now. Thanks for joining us. 90 mins: There will be three minutes added. Stick a fork in this one. 85 mins: Barnes and Willock replace Murphy and Gordon who've both been key to this Newcastle performance. 83 mins: Big old load of scrambled nonsense in the Newcastle box. Eriksen pings a volley over but the offside flag is already up. Antony comes on for De Ligt and a chunk of home fans seemingly take that as their cue to leave. 81 mins: Antony is coming on. Marcus Rashford still has a big coat on. So do I and it feels like there's a similar chance of either of us kicking a ball out there at this point. 78 mins: This has become a bit of a listless trudge. Newcastle are happy enough settling in behind the ball against a United team who, without Bruno Fernandes, lack the gumption to find a way through from open play. 74 mins: Chance for United as Yoro gets up to meet a right-wing corner and glances wide of the corner. The young Frenchman probably should have put that away. 71 mins: A poor clearance from Dubravka interrupts a string of Newcastle \"oles\". Amad gets into the area but the excellent Guimaraes is there to block. He tends to be everywhere. 64 mins: Hall's in-swinger is cleared by De Ligt. Double change for United as Garnacho and Yoro replace Casemiro and Martinez. 63 mins: Dalot fouls the waspish Gordon. Newcastle free-kick deep down the United left. 61 mins: Burn is forced to make a meaty tackle on Hojlund. Newcastle needn't be involved in a game anymore but they absolutely are now. They get some respite as Martinez clatters through Isak to earn fairly stupid booking. 59 mins: Head tennis in he Newcastle box after a Dalot long throw. Last-ditch block to deny Mainoo! United come again, Old Trafford cranking up. Now Dalot with the ball at his feet, Maguire heads against the post! 58 mins: Trippier gets back to keep help repel a Dalot cross and that's his last act as Livramento enters the fray. 55 mins: United continue to poke and prod in midfield. They've looked better since Mainoo has given them numerical equality in there. It makes Amorim's wonky starting XI seem all the more curious. Tino Livramento might be coming on soon. Trippier is down. 52 mins: Decent position for Casemiro but he plonks a cross with the outside of his boot into Dubravka's gloves. Not now, mate. 50 mins: Schar clears behind under pressure from Hojlund and this is a decent start to the second half from United. The corner bobbles about a bit but Newcastle can chalk it off as a minor inconvenience. We're back underway. No further changes. Newcastle should be out of sight. Can Man United make them pay? A few boos greet the whistle. Largely mute befuddlement across most of Old Trafford. Then the Stretford End start chanting \"Amorim's Red and White Army!\". All very laudable but are we really at the siege mentality of this new era already? Newcastle should be comfortably further ahead than 2-0 and that Casemiro miss a few moments ago shows they could still pay for playing with their food. See you in a few moments. 45 mins+1: Oh United should have a goal back! Schar gifts away possession, Mainoo bares down on goal, slips a pass to Casemiro... who lifts a shot wide of the far post. The Brazilian looks annoyed that he was given the ball, as if he was expecting Mainoo to shoot. 45 mins: There will be three minutes of added time. 41 mins: Amad has some green grass to run into but Hall closes the door emphatically. 39 mins: Guimares and Isak having their way with United whenever they please. A timely boot from Casemiro interrupts them this time. 34 mins: A Manchester United chance, Martinez lofts a lovely ball forward for Hojlund down the left channel. He fires just wide of the far post. 33 mins: A tactical change from United. Zirkzee is hooked and Mainoo comes on. The Old Trafford crowd rises to huge cheers before booing the Dutchman as he leaves. Ooooofff. Brutal. 31 mins: Guimares scythes through United again, now Gordon. TONALI HITS THE POST FROM CLOSE RANGE! Newcastle should be completely out of sight. 30 mins: Inexplicably they go short, but still end up with loads of room to cross anyway. Dan Burn should make it three! Then the ball breaks to Isak who lashes a delicious finish into the top corner but he's offside. 29 mins: Burn has left Amad in a heap. \"Play on\" says the referee. Guimaraes drives forward and it's another Newcastle corner. 27 mins: The United goalkeeper takes his defence out of the equation and punches Trippier's corner behind. Trippier has a go at an Olimpico this time. My word, it's not far away. Again. Yikes. 26 mins: Newcastle should concede possession but there's no United player in the same postcode as the second ball. Hall unleashes a rasper that Onana holds. Newcastle have the ball straight back. Good heavens. Tonali's shot is deflected behind. Onana was screwed if that was on target. 24 mins: Zirkzee on the edge of the D duffs a pass straight to Hall. Howls of anguish in the stands. The Dutchman has been woeful so far but he's not alone. 19 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLL!!!!!! Joelinton 19' Just preposterously easy. United have three centre-backs and have conceded from two routine crosses. Gordon stands one up from the left and Joelinton powers over Martinez to head home. Available in the US IT'S TWO-NIL TO NEWCASTLE. ⚫️⚪️Joelinton heads home ANOTHER ONE two double the lead.📺 USA Network | #MUNNEW pic.twitter.com/R9gIvu7R5w 17 mins: Eriksen into a promising position approaching the Newcastle box. He's ransacked by Guimaraes... who launches a fabulous ball over the top. Isak is in on goal and completely duffs his chipped finish! Should be 2-0. United look a complete rabble. 14 mins: Murphy in from the right to Gordon, who volleys over with the angle against bim at the far post. At the moment, it feels like the only danger to Newcastle is potentially their own complacency at how staggeringly easy this is. 12 mins: Isak scoots inside past a few watching United defenders before his shot is blocked. Newcastle retain possession inside the attacking third. This could become a complete hosing down at this rate. 11 mins: Here it is! Gordon leaves Mazraoui for dust, De Ligt blocks his cross and Joelinton clatters over. 10 mins: It's men against boys, or men against old men, in that midfield at the moment. Joelinton strides forward, Murphy's cross isn't the best but it feels like the next chance will be along soon. 6 mins: Goal stands. Double joy away to my right in the away end. 4 mins: GOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!! Alexander Isak!!!!!! Newcastle have settled far quicker and been far more authoritative. The upshot is Lewis Hall cross from the left that Isak rises unchallenged to plant home. It is being checked for offside against Hall...

Dalot gets back quickly, if a little untidily, to do the job. Isak gets us off and running. The visitors kicking towards the Stretford End in the first half. 5 mins before kickoff: The teams are in the tunnel. The familiar Old Trafford strains of \"This Is The One\" by The Stone Roses. Here they come... 20 mins before kickoff: There's quite the contrast in the warmups at Old Trafford. Newcastle are going through the usual repertoire of rondos, keep-ball, some sprints and stretches. Manchester United, on the other hand, have been doing some very specific positional work with the defensive line about 30 yards from goal and the attackers trying to play through them. Then, the full complement of players practiced defending wide free-kicks. Corners have been an issue for the Red Devils of late, but it was still a pretty unusual thing to witness. Whole United team practicing set-piece defending as part of the warm-up. Not sure I've ever seen that before. pic.twitter.com/fjCFJ0qFzW 40 mins before kickoff: Amorim is keeping his cards close to his chest regarding Rashford's return, although his exchange with Gary Neville on Sky Sports was hardly Frost/Nixon. \"Selection, and we have a lot of players out,\" he said. \"Like I said, every week, I choose my players, and he was there to be chosen.\" With Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte suspended alongside United's customarily weighty injury list, has Rashford just been picked as a means of filling out the bench? I guess we'll find out over the next couple of hours. 1 hr 10 mins before kickoff: For Newcastle, Eddie Howe resists the urge to make any changes to the side that swatted aside Aston Villa 3-0. Harvey Barnes and Tino Livramento are each among the substitutes. UNITED. 👊 pic.twitter.com/XaDw13RIL8 1 hr 15 mins before kickoff: Here's the United squad. Rashford is indeed on the bench. There are four changes from the team that lost 2-0 at Wolves, with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee each starting in attack. 📋 The team is in!#MUFC || #MUNNEW 1 hr 20 mins before kickoff: It's been a dispiriting couple of weeks for United, who have lost three in a row since their dramatic derby victory over Manchester City on December 15. In his programme notes, Ruben Amorim has doubled down on his conviction that there are brighter days ahead. What I can say for certain is that it will take time, but we will improve. I have no doubt about that. This period will not last forever. When I took this job, I knew that I was signing up for a lot of work. If we are to make the long-term changes that we want to make to Manchester United, then we have to go through that step by step. We are looking to implement a new way of playing at that busiest time of the year, so there are short-term costs. I will say, though, that the players are working hard to take on and use all the new information and instructions they are getting. The longer they do this, the easier it will become for them, and then the comfort and confidence in our game will grow. I have seen enough in the last few weeks to recognise that we have many of the ingredients we need for success and I remain as convinced as I was on my first day here that we will achieve it. In the meantime, it is my responsibility to remain clam and keep everyone together through this period of change. 1 hr 40 mins before kickoff: The main murmurs in the press room at Old Trafford centre on Marcus Rashford. The England forward has arrived at the stadium with the United squad and it is rumoured he will be involved in the matchday squad for the first time since United's Europa League trip to Viktoria Plzen on December 12. 2 hours before kickoff. Hello and welcome to The Sporting News' live coverage of Manchester United vs. Newcastle. Is this the night when Ruben Amorim's forecast storm passes? Well, it's expected to be a rainy night at Old Trafford. This Premier League match kicks off in Manchester at 8 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: Bruno Fernandes' red card at Wolves changed the course of the game and means the United captain is banned for this fixture. Manuel Ugarte is also missing due to a suspension, forcing Amorim to field Casemiro and Christian Eriksen in a central midfield two that appears to lack legs. Mason Mount won't return from his latest injury until at least January, while there is still no word on when Luke Shaw and Victor Lindelof will be available. Matthijs de Ligt has been struggling with illness but completes the back three with Harry Maguire and captain-for-the-night Lisandro Martinez. Arguably the biggest piece of team news comes among the substitutes, where Marcus Rashford features in a United matchday squad for the first time since December 12. Man United (3-4-3, right to left): Onana (GK) — Maguire, De Ligt, Martinez — Mazraoui, Casemiro, Eriksen, Dalot — Amad, Hojlund, Zirkzee Man United subs: Bayindir, Rashford, Malacia, Yoro, Garnacho, Antony, Mainoo, Collyer, Kukonki MORE: Latest news on Marcus Rashford's future at Man United Newcastle are still without goalkeeper Nick Pope and defenders Sven Botman, Jamaal Lascelles and Emil Krafth, but all three are on track to return to action early in the new year. Striker Callum Wilson is also still sidelined. Tino Livramento sat out the win over Villa due to illness but could be back for the trip to Old Trafford. Harvey Barnes and Joe Willock are options to come into Howe's lineup should he want to rotate to keep the team fresh. Newcastle (4-3-3, right to left): Dubravka (GK) — Trippier, Schar, Burn, Hall — Guimaraes, Tonali, Joelinton — Murphy, Isak, Gordon Newcastle subs: Vlachodimos, Barnes, Osula, Livramento, Almiron, Kelly, Willock, Longstaff, Miley Here's how to watch this Premier League match across selected areas of the world's major regions: If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.

Manchester United host Newcastle United in the Premier League this evening, with the home side desperate for three points as they look to rise from 14th in the table. Ruben Amorim’s team has fallen to embarrassing defeats to Bournemouth and Wolves over the last two matches, and the Portuguese has just two wins in the league so far during his tenure. And United face a Newcastle side who have found form in recent weeks, with consecutive 4-0 wins followed by a 3-0 victory over Aston Villa last time out. After a mixed start to the season, the Magpies find themselves in seventh ahead of kick-off, with the potential to move into fifth if they grab three points tonight. And with the recent form of both sides, Newcastle have rarely had a better chance to earn a first league win at Old Trafford since 2013. Follow all the latest updates from Old Trafford below: Tino Livramento makes the bench for Newcastle after recovering from illness, with Eddie Howe’s starting line-up unchanged from the win over Aston Villa. Newcastle XI: Dubravka; Trippier, Schar, Burn, Hall; Tonali, Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton; Murphy, Isak, Gordon. Marcus Rashford is back on the bench for Manchester United, with Ruben Amorim plumping for a midfield combination of Casemiro and Christian Eriksen. Lisandro Martinez captains in the absence of Bruno Fernandes while both Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund start. Manchester United XI: Onana; De Ligt, Maguire, Martinez; Mazraoui, Casemiro, Eriksen, Dalot; Diallo, Zirkzee, Hojlund. Just a matter of minutes now before the line-ups are out at Old Trafford. How will Manchester United assemble themselves without the suspended Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte? And could Tino Livramento make his return from illness in the Newcastle backline? Amad Diallo “wants to make history” with Manchester United as he aims to help Ruben Amorim turn around the club’s fortunes. These remain troubled times for United, who have taken only seven points from Amorim’s first seven Premier League games in charge going into tonight. But Diallo has offered some cause for optimism with his recent form, highlighted by his dramatic late winner in the Manchester derby as United scored two late goals to win 2-1 at City earlier this month. The 22-year-old Ivory Coast international has scored two goals and added six assists in the league this season. Ruben Amorim said he cannot be comfortable in his position as Manchester United head coach but likes the danger as his side’s slump continues. United suffered their third consecutive defeat when they lost 2-0 at Wolves on Boxing Day to leave Amorim with five losses in his last seven games. And he believes that his transfer fee – United paid Sporting CP €11m (£9.1m) to meet his buyout clause and bring him to Old Trafford early – will not protect him from the sack. The Portuguese has endured a testing start to life at Old Trafford and maintains he cannot relax despite club’s significant investment in him Man Utd XI: Onana; Mazraoui, Yoro, Maguire, Martinez, Dalot; Mainoo, Casemiro; Garnacho, Diallo; Hojlund. Newcastle XI: Dubravka; Trippier, Schar, Burn, Hall; Tonali, Guimaraes, Joelinton; Gordon, Murphy, Isak. Bruno Fernandes is suspended after his red card against Wolves, as is Manuel Ugarte after reaching the five yellow card threshold. Victor Lindelof, Luke Shaw and Mason Mount remain absent. Tino Livramento could return after illness for Newcastle but Sven Botman, Emil Krafth, Nick Pope, Jamaal Lascelles and Callum Wilson remain unavailable for Eddie Howe.

                "content": "Chelsea is an English given name derived from the Old English place name ċealc hȳð,[1] or the modern Celcyth, meaning chalk landing place. The name evolved to Chelsea, a location on the River Thames that became a London borough known for its wealthy, socially influential residents. Many locations have been named after the English place name Chelsea.[2] The given name, a transferred use of the place name, was in use for boys in the New England region of the United States by the late 18th century and was first used for American girls in the 1840s.[2] The name was first popularized for girls in larger numbers in the United States by American comedian Chelsea Brown, who was born Lois Brown but chose Chelsea as a stage name. After Brown began appearing on the American television program Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In in 1968, the name quadrupled in use for American girls to 48 uses that year. The name debuted among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 1969, in 702nd place. Chelsea Morning, a 1969 hit song written about mornings in Chelsea, Manhattan by Canadian singer Joni Mitchell and later performed by Judy Collins, further popularized the name for girls with its descriptive lyrics such as \"the light poured in like butterscotch.\"[2] The name of Chelsea Clinton, daughter of American President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, was inspired by the song when she was born in 1980. The name Chelsea increased further in popularity in the 1980s due to its use for film and television characters, such as Chelsea Thayer Wayne, a character played by Jane Fonda in the 1981 American film On Golden Pond and Chelsea Reardon, a character played by Kassie DePaiva on the American soap opera Guiding Light beginning in 1986. In 1992, the name reached peak popularity in the United States and would have been the eighth most popular name for American girls in that year if all spellings of the name were combined. The name dramatically declined in use in 1993, during the first year of Bill Clinton's presidency. At the time, it was out of fashion in the United States to name children after politicians and those who were associated with them. The name has continued to decline in use, but remained among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 2023.[2] Spelling variants in use in the United States include Chelsey, Chelsi, Chelsie, and Chelsy.[2] The name has also been in regular use throughout the Anglosphere, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as well as in Belgium, France and Netherlands.[3]",

It is derived from the French word \"candidus,\" which means \"bright\" or \"shining.\" Artemis, the Greek goddess of the moon, is also associated with the name as she was known for her beauty and radiance.[2] There are many famous people named Chelsea, including Chelsea Clinton (the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton). The name was used most in 1992, when it was at #15 in the United States on the USA Social Security Administration baby naming chart.[3] The name might come from the Old English language and mean \"chalk landing place\".

                "content": "Ameiz XLNC \"Amen\" Thompson (/əˈmɛn ˈɛksələns ˈtɒmsən/ ə-MEN EK-sə-lənss TOM-sən;[1] born January 30, 2003) is an American professional basketball player for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played basketball for Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where he was rated a five-star recruit by ESPN and won a state title. Thompson bypassed his senior year of high school to sign with OTE, where he played for two seasons and helped his team win the league title while earning All-OTE First Team honors in 2023. He was selected 4th overall in the 2023 NBA draft by the Houston Rockets. He is the twin brother of basketball player Ausar Thompson. Thompson was born to Maya Wilson and Troy Thompson and raised in San Leandro, California.[2][3] His identical twin brother, Ausar, was born one minute after him; they share the middle name \"XLNC\" (pronounced \"excellence\").[4] Thompson's older brother, Troy Jr., played college basketball for Prairie View A&M. His uncle, Mark Thompson, represented Jamaica in 400 meter hurdles at the 1992 Summer Olympics. He and Ausar began training for basketball under the guidance of their father by age seven and drew inspiration from LeBron James.[2] The twins were homeschooled in sixth and seventh grades to focus on basketball.[3] Entering eighth grade, Thompson and his family moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida so that he and Ausar could play high school basketball one year early at Pine Crest School.[2][5] The twins immediately started for the team.[6] As a sophomore at Pine Crest, Thompson averaged 16.9 points, 7.3 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game, earning All-County honorable mention. Entering his junior season, he was named to the Broward County Fab Five by the Sun-Sentinel.[7] He averaged 20.5 points, 8.4 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game as a junior, leading his team to the Class 4A state championship in a 90–83 double overtime win over Santa Fe High School.[8] In the title game, Thompson scored 43 points and helped Pine Crest overcome an eight-point deficit with 45 seconds left in overtime.[6] He shared Broward County Class 5A-1A co-player of the year honors from the Sun-Sentinel with Ausar.[8] Thompson was considered a five-star recruit by ESPN and a four-star recruit by Rivals.[9][10] He gained interest from college programs in 2019, receiving a scholarship offer from Alabama.[11] After his junior year, Thompson held offers from Alabama, Arizona, Auburn, Arizona State and Kansas, among other programs, before deciding to not play college basketball.[12] Sources: On May 25, 2021, Thompson signed a two-year contract with Overtime Elite (OTE), a new professional league based in Atlanta with players between ages 16 and 20. He joined the league with his brother Ausar, bypassing his final year of high school and college, because he felt that it would prepare him best for the NBA.[2][13][14] In the 2021–22 season, Thompson played for Team OTE, one of three teams in the league, and averaged 14 points, 6.6 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 2.1 steals per game.[15][16] He competed against other OTE teams, as well as prep school and postgraduate opponents.[17] He helped his team achieve a runner-up finish, scoring 13 points in a 52–45 loss to Team Elite in the decisive third game of the finals.[18] Thompson played for OTE affiliate Team Overtime in The Basketball Tournament in July 2022.[2] His team lost to Omaha Blue Crew, 74–70, in the first round of the tournament.[19] In the 2022–23 OTE season, Thompson played for the City Reapers alongside team captain Ausar, who selected him with the first pick in the league's draft.[20] On January 9, 2023, he was named OTE Player of the Week, three days after recording 22 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists and five steals in a 101–90 win over the Cold Hearts.[21] In the regular season, Thompson averaged 16.4 points, 5.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists and 2.3 steals per game and was named to the All-OTE First Team.[22][23] In game 2 of the OTE Finals, he made a game-winning layup at the buzzer in an 80–78 win over the YNG Dreamerz.[24] Thompson helped the Reapers win the league championship in a 3–0 sweep.[25] On April 21, 2023, he declared for the 2023 NBA draft, where analysts viewed him as a potential top-10 pick.[26] The Houston Rockets selected Thompson with the fourth overall pick in the 2023 NBA draft, one pick ahead of his twin brother Ausar.[27] They were the first brothers in NBA draft history to be selected in the top 5 in the same year.[28] On October 25, 2023, Thompson made his NBA debut, scoring eight points along with five rebounds and two assists in a 116–86 loss to the Orlando Magic.[29] Thompson missed a couple of games from the start of the season after suffering a Grade 2 ankle sprain on his left ankle. He was sent to the G-League on December 5 for development before being recalled from the Rockets four days later.[30] Thompson made his return on the bench after a 15-game absence and recorded two points, five rebounds, and one assist in 10 minutes in the 93–82 win over the San Antonio Spurs. Thompson's minutes and numbers increased while playing full-time in the starting lineup for the remaining 15 games after teammate Alperen Şengün missed the remainder of the season from a knee injury.[31] Thompson recorded his first triple-double in a game win against the Los Angeles Clippers with a total of 18 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists in his final game as a rookie.[32] He was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team and became the fifth Rockets player to receive NBA all-rookie recognition in the past four seasons for the Rockets Rebuild.",

                "content": "On Sunday, things got heated between the Miami Heat's Tyler Herro and Houston Rockets' Amen Thompson. With 35 seconds left in the game, things got physical after Herro bumped into Thompson, who grabbed the Heat star's jersey. While the Rockets forward held Miami's guard by the jersey, the two briefly conversed. Things escalated when Thompson threw the 6-foot-4 guard to the ground. Players and coaches from both teams tried to stop the two players from further hurting themselves. However, Terry Rozier III jumped onto the Rockets forward to defend his teammate. In the end, six people were ejected from the game. For the Rockets, it was Thompson, Jalen Green, coach Ime Udoka and assistant coach Ben Sullivan. Miami's Herro and Rozier were sent to the locker room for their involvement. A YouTube channel, \"LegendZ Productions,\" posted a clip of the fight between Thompson and Herro. The channel looked more closely and analyzed the conversations that occurred during the altercation. The words spoken by the players happened after the Heat star got up from the ground. Explore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team. Herro was laughing and grinning at Thompson across the floor. The Rockets' Tari Eason, who was on the bench due to being listed as out because of left lower leg injury management, talked trash to Herro. The NBA has not released a statement on whether they'll punish the players and coaches involved. In recent times, fights have become more frequent in the league. On Friday, Phoenix Suns' Jusuf Nurkic and Dallas Mavericks' Naji Marshall threw punches at each other. Following the fight, the NBA punished both players with suspensions (three games for Nurkic and four for Marshall). PJ Washington Jr., who pushed the Suns center to the ground, received a one-game suspension. Also read: Tari Eason's mother justifies Amen Thompson's 'violence' against 'victim' Tyler Herro: \"Hate taunting and cockiness\" The NBA hasn't announced punishments for Amen Thompson and Tyler Herro. They will probably be suspended, though, given the way they fought each other. Thompson's actions, however, received praise from former Rockets player Vernon Maxwell. The two-time champion even offered to pay, on X, for the youngster's fine. Whether the former player would pay for the fine Thompson received for getting ejected is not known. But a fine will be imposed as, in the league, an ejection is an automatic ticket to a fine. Also read: Rockets legend offers to pay Amen Thompson's fine after mayhem erupts in Houston Rockets Fan?

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Houston Rockets and Miami Heat are both known for their physicality and attitudes. These are teams that are more than willing to get into a scrap and make things uncomfortable for their opponents, and when two such teams share an NBA floor, things can get testy pretty quickly. That seemed to be the case in the final minute on Sunday, as seven people were ejected as the Heat closed out a 104-100 win in Houston. Things started with 47.1 seconds remaining and Fred VanVleet attempting to inbound the ball for the Rockets. VanVleet tried to call a timeout, but was called for a five-second violation by referee Marc Davis instead. VanVleet argued with Davis, but seemed to accidentally bump into him and was quickly ejected. The Fred VanVleet ejection that seemed to kickoff the ejection-fest in Rockets-Heat. pic.twitter.com/vcyK2DxfkX \"After the correctly assessed five-second violation, Fred VanVleet asked me why he was not granted a timeout,\" Davis explained in the postgame pool report. \"I communicated to him that the five-second count was reached prior to him requesting the timeout. He walks away. Coach Udoka then asks for an explanation. I give it to him and then Fred VanVleet re-engages and intentionally contacts me and is ejected as per rule.\" Mere seconds later, the Heat were attempting to inbound the ball when Amen Thompson and Tyler Herro grappled with one another. Thompson pulled Herro to the ground, and both teams rushed to the aid of their own players. Amen Thompson and Tyler Herro fight 👀 pic.twitter.com/VGp1KBXzJH When the dust settled, six more people were ejected. Four of them were players: Thompson and Jalen Green on the Houston side and Herro and Terry Rozier from the Heat. Two more were coaches, Rockets head coach Ime Udoka and Houston assistant Ben Sullivan. \"During the dead ball, Thompson grabs the jersey and body slams Herro,\" Davis said after the game in the pool report. \"Herro responds and they are both ejected for fighting fouls. Green is ejected as his actions escalated the altercation. Rozier as well is ejected as his actions were escalators to the altercation. Coach Sullivan is assessed a technical foul and ejected for his unsportsmanlike comments directed at me as I was attempting to redirect [Alperen] Sengun.\" Afterward, Herro suggested that his strong performance helped lead to the incident. \"Guess that's what happens when someone's scoring, throwing dimes, doing the whole thing,\" said Herro, who finished with 27 points, nine assists and six rebounds on 10-for-17 shooting. \"So I'd get mad, too.\" \"Guess that's what's happens when someone's scoring, throwing dimes, doing the whole thing. I'd get mad too.\"Tell 'em, Tyler 😏 pic.twitter.com/kVGFiqjE91 Udoka took the opportunity to express the physical superiority he believes Thompson holds over Herro. \"They were in each other's faces, bumping chests a little bit,\" Udoka said. \"One guy is stronger than the other.\" The Heat went on to close out the victory from there, but further discipline is almost certainly coming for both sides in the coming days. On Friday, a fight between the Phoenix Suns and Dallas Mavericks yielded suspensions for three players: Naji Marshall (four games), Jusuf Nurkic (three games) and P.J. Washington (one game). It has been a trying week for both teams. The Rockets have now lost two consecutive games, and their Friday defeat at the hands of the Minnesota Timberwolves came on an Anthony Edwards 3-pointer with less than 30 seconds remaining. The Heat, meanwhile, have dealt with trade rumors involving star wing Jimmy Butler that got so loud team president Pat Riley had to come out and say publicly that the Heat would not move him. Combine that with an extremely physical game on Sunday and tempers simply boiled over. Now the Heat and Rockets are both likely to pay for this with suspensions in the next day or two. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "The Missouri Tigers football program represents the University of Missouri (often referred to as Mizzou) in college football and competes in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Missouri's football program dates back to 1890, and has appeared in 37 bowl games (including 11 New Year's Six bowl appearances: four Orange Bowls, four Cotton Bowls, two Sugar Bowls, and one Fiesta Bowl). Missouri has won 15 conference titles and 5 division titles. Entering the 2024 season, Missouri's all-time record is 711–590–52 (.545).[3] Since 2012, Missouri has been a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC)[4] and competes in the Eastern Division. Home games are played at Faurot Field (\"The Zou\") in Columbia, Missouri, named for hall of fame coach Don Faurot. Hall of famer Gary Pinkel, coach from 2001 to 2015, has the most wins in Missouri football history, setting that mark with his 102nd win in the AT&T Cotton Bowl on January 3, 2014.[5] Pinkel's record with Mizzou after his final game on November 27, 2015, is 118–73 (.618). Since the 2020 football season, the team has been coached by Eliah Drinkwitz. The Missouri Tigers have 15 conference championships and five conference division titles.[6] The Tigers were selected as national champions by NCAA-designated major selectors in 1960 and 2007. Neither championship is claimed by the university.[7][8][9][10] [11] † The 1960 record was 10–1, but was later changed to 11–0 due to Kansas' subsequent forfeit [12] Missouri has won 15 conference championships. † Co-champions ‡ The 1960 Big Eight title was retroactively awarded after a loss to Kansas was reversed due to Kansas' use of a player who was later ruled to be ineligible.[13][14] The Tigers were previously members of the Big 12 North division between its inception in 1996 and the dissolution of conference divisions within the Big 12 in 2011. The Tigers joined the SEC as members of the SEC East starting in 2012. Missouri has won five division championships. † Co-champion Missouri has appeared in 37 bowl games, including 11 New Year's Six bowl appearances: 4 Orange Bowls, 4 Cotton Bowls, 2 Sugar Bowls, and 1 Fiesta Bowl, with an all-time bowl record of 17–20.[15] The team also accepted a bid to the 2020 Music City Bowl against Iowa, which was subsequently canceled due to COVID-19.[16] Missouri's entire bowl history is shown in the table below.[17] Missouri and Arkansas first met in 1906 in Columbia, Missouri, and played each other five times prior to Missouri joining the SEC in 2012, and then becoming Arkansas' permanent cross-division rival in 2014. The annual meeting was dubbed the Battle Line Rivalry. On November 23, 2015, a new rivalry trophy was unveiled for the annual game.[18] Missouri leads the series 11-4 as of the conclusion of the 2023 season, which saw the Tigers beat Arkansas 48-14 in Fayetteville.[19] Oklahoma leads the series 67-25–5 through the 2024 season.[20] From 1940 through 1974, the teams played for the Tiger-Sooner Peace Pipe trophy. The rivalry was renewed in 2024, as the teams are members of the same conference again. Missouri won the 2024 matchup 30-23. [21] A new rivalry was started in 2012 when Missouri joined the SEC East. With both schools located in cities named Columbia (Columbia, Missouri, and Columbia, South Carolina), the mayors of the cities commemorate the winner with the \"Mayor's Cup\" trophy for the annual game.[22][23] Missouri leads the series 9-6 as of the conclusion of the 2024 edition of the rivalry.[24][25] The rivalry between Missouri and Illinois is modeled after the two schools' longstanding basketball rivalry, and it garners the most interest around St. Louis, with both schools having alumni and fans in the area. It has not been played annually, with 24 matchups occurring from 1896 to 2010, with Missouri leading the series 17–7.[26] Between 2000 and 2010, the schools met in St. Louis six times, with Missouri winning each time. In 2026, the series will be renewed for a four-year period, to be played on campus sites.[27] Missouri and Iowa State first met in 1896 and the regional rivalry was born. Before the 1959 match-up between the two schools, which took place in Ames, Iowa, field testing showed that the telephones the two schools used to communicate with their coaches in the coaches' box were wired so that either school could hear what was happening on the other sideline. The problem was fixed before the game, but neither of the two coaches knew that. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company of Ames then decided to have a trophy made to commemorate the incident, thus the Telephone Trophy was born.[28][29] When Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC, the rivalry was essentially ended. Missouri leads the series with Iowa State 61–34–9 through the 2022 season.[30] Missouri leads the series with Kansas 57–54–9 through the 2021 season.[31] With history dating back to Bleeding Kansas in the 1850s, the \"Border War\" rivalry was well-known as one of the longest-lasting and fiercest rivalries in college sports. The teams met annually, traditionally for the final game of the regular season, from 1891 through 2011 when Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC.[32] The series is set to renew in 2025.[33] Nebraska leads the series 65–36–3 through the 2022 season.[34] From 1892 through 2010, the teams played for the Victory Bell trophy. Missouri has 38 first-team All-American selections as of 2017, 14 of whom were consensus selections.[35]: 121–126 † Consensus selection Missouri has retired six jersey numbers representing seven players as of 2017.[35]: 119–120 Missouri has 15 inductees into the College Football Hall of Fame.[37] Two Missouri players have been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame:[38] Truman the Tiger was introduced as the school's mascot against the Utah State Aggies in 1986, receiving his name from former president Harry S Truman. Truman has been named the \"Nation's Best Mascot\" three times since 1986, most recently in 2014.[39] The NCAA[40] as well as Jeopardy! and Trivial Pursuit[41] recognize the University of Missouri as the birthplace of Homecoming, an event which became a national tradition in college football. The history of the University of Missouri Homecoming can be traced back to the 1911 Kansas vs. Missouri football game, when the Missouri Tigers faced off against the Kansas Jayhawks in the first installment of the Border War rivalry series.[42][43] Now the Tigers nearly sell out Memorial Stadium every Homecoming, which is usually a home game in October. From 2012 to 2023, Missouri played in the East Division of the SEC and played each opponent in the division each year along with several teams from the West Division. The SEC will expand the conference to 16 teams and will eliminate its two divisions in 2024, causing a new scheduling format for the Tigers to play against the other members of the conference.[44] On March 20, 2024, the SEC announced that they would continue with 8 conference games for the 2025 season, and that each team would play their same conference opponents from the 2024 schedule, only with the host locations switched.[45] Announced schedules as of August 4, 2024.[46] Aug 30",

The declaration grants police additional powers as they seek to tamp down on reprisal killings and other gang-related activity. “The declaration and calling of a public state of emergency is something that is not taken lightly,” said acting Attorney General Stuart Young at a news conference on Monday. He explained that information from the Trinidad and Tobago police service “dictated and mandated the necessity of this extreme action that we took this morning”. The state of emergency empowers the country’s police to arrest people “on suspicion of involvement in illegal activities”. It will also allow law enforcement to “search and enter both public and private premises” and suspend bail. A government statement specified that no curfew would be imposed, and the freedom to meet publicly or demonstrate in marches would not be impeded. Young indicated that an uptick in violence over the weekend in the capital, Port of Spain, helped prompt the emergency announcement in the early hours of Monday. “You will recall that on Saturday, just after 3 o’clock in the afternoon outside the Besson Street police station, there was a shooting with the use of a high-calibre automatic weapon,” Young explained. Local media described the shooting as an ambush. A suspected gang leader, Calvin Lee, had arrived at the police station to sign the bail book, but as he and his entourage left, The Daily Express reported that gunmen emerged from a nearby van and began to fire. One person was killed. Lee himself managed to flee. But Young explained that the shooting led to reprisal killings between local gangs. Within 24 hours, he said, six people were fired upon in Laventille, a suburb of Port of Spain. Five of them were killed. Young said further reprisal attacks are still anticipated. “There can be expected heightened reprisal activities by the criminal elements in and around certain places in Trinidad and Tobago that immediately warranted and took us out of what we can consider the norm,” he explained. He declined to name specific locations where gang activity may be concentrated. “But I can say, throughout Trinidad and possibly Tobago, [criminal gangs] are likely to immediately increase their brazen acts of violence in reprisal shootings on a scale so extensive that it threatens persons and will endanger public safety.” Young added that the decision to invoke a state of emergency was in part a result of the high-calibre weapons being used in the attacks, which elevated the possibility of bystander deaths. He noted the involvement of AK-47 and AR-15 guns. “Over the last month or so, and in fact building up to this, the government has been concerned about the use of high-powered, illegal firearms — high-calibre firearms including automatic weapons that unfortunately are a scourge throughout the whole Caribbean region,” Young said. Caribbean countries do not manufacture firearms themselves, and many of the guns used in gang violence have been illegally imported. One source in particular stands out: the United States. It is the largest weapons exporter in the world. In March, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute found that the US was the source of approximately 42 percent of global arms exports. A 2017 analysis from the Small Arms Survey also found that the US had the largest number of private guns per capita, with US civilians holding 40 percent of the world’s firearms. Guns from the US have been connected to crimes across the Caribbean, from Haiti and Jamaica to Trinidad and Tobago. The US has collaborated with 13 Caribbean countries to help disrupt the illegal firearms trade. Between 2018 and 2022, an estimated 7,399 firearms collected from crimes in the region have been sent to the US for origin tracing. In October, the US Government Accountability Office published a report with its findings. Of all the firearms retrieved and traced during that four-year period, a total of 5,399 — or 73 percent — originated from the US. A couple hundred more had ambiguous origins. The proliferation of illegal firearms has been linked to increased violence in the Caribbean. Trinidad and Tobago, for example, has been struggling with a record homicide rate. In December alone, there were 61 homicides, according to the government. The country tallied 623 homicides total so far for 2024. “Gangs accounted for 263 of them,” MP Fitzgerald Hinds, the minister of national security, said during Monday’s news conference. “So as a result, we consider that this declaration of a public emergency is to confront the criminals and to allow law enforcement easier access than ordinary to them, in light of the crises they have presented to this country.” Follow Al Jazeera English:",

Issued on: 31/12/2024 - 01:32 Trinidad and Tobago on Monday declared a state of emergency due to a spike in murders by criminal groups, a move which grants police the ability to conduct searches and arrests without a warrant over the next two days. \"The circumstances warranting the declaration of the public emergency are based on the advice of the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service to the National Security Council of heightened criminal activity which endangers the public safety,\" Prime Minister Keith Rowley's office said in a statement. Attorney General Stuart Young said the country recorded 61 murders in December, bringing the year's total up to 623 homicides, an increase from 577 homicides recorded in 2023 and 599 in 2022. Young, speaking at a press conference in the capital Port of Spain, said the public emergency would not include a curfew or restrict people's movements, to minimize the economic impact of the declaration. The authorization for police to carry out searches and arrests without a warrant may be extended up to seven days by a judge, Young said. At the same press conference, Minister of National Security Fitzgerald Hinds called the spike in violent murders \"an epidemic\" for the country of 1.4 million residents, with 551 shootings recorded this year, as of December 26. Recent incidents of violence included a man shot and killed after leaving a police station in Port of Spain on Saturday, and a shooting in Laventille, Trinidad, on Sunday that killed five. A state of emergency had previously been declared for the same reason in 2011, but the application was limited to \"hotspots\" of crime. (AFP) © 2024 Copyright France 24 - All rights reserved.

                "content": "Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Trinidad and Tobago declared a state of emergency on Monday as the government braced for reprisal shootings after an attempt on a gang leader’s life, officials said. The dual-island Caribbean nation off the coast of Venezuela will use the emergency to launch an anti-gang crackdown, authorities said. Though there will be no curfew, the declaration will come with increased police and military action. Defense forces will become de facto police officers and both are allowed to conduct searches without a warrant, Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister Stuart Young said at a news conference. Bail will be suspended and those suspected of committing a crime can be held for 48 hours without a charge. That could be extended another seven days by court approval, Young said. On Saturday, armed gunmen shot at a known gang leader who was leaving the police station, killing a member of his crew, according to Trinidad and Tobago Newsday. The report did not name the gang leader. On Sunday evening, five men were shot dead in what is believed to be an act of retaliation, Newsday reported. “There is no doubt in my mind that we are dealing with an epidemic,” National Security Minister Fitzgerald Hinds told reporters at a news onference. Trinidad and Tobago has seen a record number of murders this year. The island republic has recorded an unprecedented 623 homicides for the year to date and, according to Hinds, gang-related activities have accounted for 263 of them.

                "content": "Taking a look at the standings in the NFC we see the Lions at the top of the table while the Niners are way down there at the bottom of their division. The Lions need to win out to get the one seed, but that is going to depend on their game tonight and their game next week against the 14-2 Minnesota Vikings who also control their own destiny on the way to the one seed. Next week could be monumental, but this week’s game in San Fran is just as important for the Lions. With all of the injuries that have hindered the Niners offense this year, we are seeing what a lot of people questioned play out in the Bay. Brock Purdy put up great numbers in his first few seasons as the Niners QB, but people said that was because he was surrounded by weapons. This year, he hasn’t been surrounded by as many weapons, In his second full season as the starter, Purdy’s numbers have dipped from his 4,000 yard, 30 TD season last year but he still has 3,487 yards ad 17 TDs which isn’t spectacular, but it isn’t enough for all the nay sayers to go around gloating that they were right. If the Lions are going to have success despite all of their injuries it’s going to come down to one man. Jahmyr Gibbs was part of the most dynamic RB duo in the league, making up half of the Sonic and Knuckles partnership in the Detroit backfield. Both him and David Montgomery shared snaps and carries and weren’t just productive, they were buddies. Montgomery was on track to a 1,000 yard season and Gibbs is already there with 1,156 yards and 12 TDs. Since Montgomery’s knee injury that will keep him out the rest of the year, it’s going to be all up to Gibbs. In his first game without Knuckles, Gibbs had 100 yards and two TDs, and that’s the kind of production that he is going to need to continue if the Lions are going to keep winning. The Niners problems started before the first snap was even taken. Brandon Aiyuk had a messy hold out in the offseason and Christian McCaffery missed the first eight games of the season with an achilles injury. While McCaffery was sidelined, Aiyuk would sign a contact and suffer a season ending injury himself. They were hanging on until the middle of November at .500 but they have lost four of five after losing McCaffery again, this time for the remainder of the year. They are now out of the playoff picture and many are wondering if the Super Bowl window has closed after years of being so close but so far. Everyone knew the Lions were going to be the team to beat in the NFC this season. They have taken everyone’s best shot and still looked like the best team. They lost in Week 2 to the Bucs after beating the Rams in an overtime game to start the season. They would win their next 11 games, most of those in dominating fashion before the injury bug hit them hard and complicated things in the final stretch of the season. They beat the Bears and Packers by just six total points and then lost to the Bills but bounced back last week against Chicago. They have a chance to get the one seed and host the playoffs for the first time in history, and they are hoping that will be enough to get them to the franchise’s first Super Bowl. The Niners went to Miami knowing that their playoff chances had disappeared and they played like it. On a night that they had to use their fifth string running back, the ground game never got going, but Brock Purdy’s 300 yard game was enough to keep the Niners in the game against the Dolphins. It was a one possess game in the final minutes of the fourth quarter, but De’Von Achane broke off a 50 yard run with 1:36 to go and closed the door on the Niners. Detroit bounced back after losing to the Bills with a blowout with over the Chicago Bears to set up tonight’s big game in San Fran a a potentially big game next week against the Vikings. DET went up 20-0 thanks to a couple of Jake Bates field goals, a Jared Goff TD pass and a Jahmyr Gibbs rushing TD. Chicago would cut into the lead before half, making it 27-14 at the break but Goff’s third TD pass of the game would put an end to the Bears comeback chances. Goff passed for 336 yards and 3 TDs while Gibbs had 109 yards and 1 TD in his first game without David Montgomery. Hello everyone and welcome to San Francisco where the Niners know their playoff chances are out the window, but they can play spoiler to a team that almost beat them in the NFC Championship last year. It’s been a nightmare season for the Niners, who have dealt with preseason holdouts, injuries and more injuries as they have slumped to the bottom of the NFC West and missed the playoffs for the first time since the 2019 season. The injury ravaged Lions are at the top of the NFC and need to win out to stay there. They have a huge Week 18 matchup with the Minnesota Vikings which could decide who gets the one seed, but they have to focus on tonight’s game first. It’s the final Monday Night Football game of the regular season and the top team in the NFC go into the defending NFC Champions’ house losing to hold on to the one seed for another week. The Detroit Lions have been the best team in the conference all season long, and have two more weeks to hold off the Vikings and wrap up a first round BYE and home field advantage. It’s the Lions heading to San Francisco for a primetime showdown with the Niners and AS English will be with you all night providing live coverage, stats, highlights and analysis from Levi’s Stadium.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. In the final game of Week 17, the San Francisco 49ers will play host to the Detroit Lions on \"Monday Night Football.\" San Francisco has been eliminated from the playoffs, but still has a chance to at least leave an impression on the Lions that they still hold an edge in the matchup. The Niners knocked the Lions out in last year's NFL title game, and being able to capture another win on Monday night could be a reminder heading into next year that they're still a force to be reckoned with in the conference. Detroit, meanwhile, can maintain its hold on first place in both the NFC North and the conference as a whole by winning this matchup. The ultimate determination of those spots will come down to the big showdown with the Vikings next Sunday night, but there is still the revenge factor motivation, plus a potential narrower path to the NFC's top seed that could point toward the Lions being more interested in going all out for this game than it might appear on the surface. Will the Lions get their revenge, or will the Niners capture another victory? We'll find out soon enough. Before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game. Date: Monday, Dec. 30 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: ABC | Stream: fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports App Betting odds: Lions -3.5, O/U 50.5 (via Caesars Sportsbook) As we have all seen throughout this season, Detroit's offense is essentially a machine that grinds through any wrench that might get stuck in its gears. Despite having played fewer games than all but one other team, Detroit comes into this game ranked second in the NFL in yards and first in points. The Lions are first in points per drive, first in the share of drives ending in a touchdown or field goal and first in offensive success rate, via Tru Media. They can do anything. They're second in EPA per pass and fifth in EPA per rush, second in passing success rate (by a mere 0.2%) and third in rushing success rate (by 0.1%). The 49ers enter this game banged up on defense, with Javon Hargrave and Kevin Givens still on injured reserve, Drake Jackson still on PUP, De'Vondre Campbell still suspended and Dre Greenlaw listed as out after returning just two weeks ago. Their best defensive lineman, Nick Bosa, will spend the game rushing against arguably the NFL's best tackle duo in Penei Sewell and Taylor Decker. Their best overall defender, Fred Warner, will be tested as much as he has been all year, as nobody attacks the middle of the field better than the Lions. Detroit is still without David Montgomery, but we have seen what Jahmyr Gibbs is capable of when Montgomery is out. It's not fun for defenses to chase that guy around all game. Throw in his sheer explosiveness with the consistent reliability of Amon-Ra St. Brown, the threats posed by Sam LaPorta and the other complementary passing-game options and Ben Johnson scheming up some of the wildest stuff imaginable, and it's hard to see how anybody ever stops this unit -- let alone a Niners defense that is not operating near peak condition. Of course, we may not see the Lions operating at peak condition, either. This game isn't quite meaningless for the Lions -- a win over San Francisco opens up the possibility of a Week 18 tie against the Vikings also landing Detroit the NFC North title and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. But the season will come down to that game either way, and it's easy to justify not necessarily throwing every single thing you've got into this one. Then again, the Lions are coached by Dan Campbell. And they've been very intentional about \"revenge games\" this season, from blasting Dallas to making sure Montgomery had a huge day in the first game against the Bears. So, it's also pretty easy to envision them coming out and trying to lay the wood on the team that defeated them in last year's NFC title game. The San Francisco offense is another unit that has not been operating near its peak this year. Christian McCaffrey has missed almost the entire season. The same is true of Brandon Aiyuk. George Kittle missed a few games. Jauan Jennings missed a few. Trent Williams has missed a bunch and won't play this week or next. Even the backup running backs who have excelled in McCaffrey's place -- Elijah Mitchell, Jordan Mason, Isaac Guerendo -- have missed a game or much more. Deebo Samuel may as well have been absent for much of the year, given his level of contribution up until last week. That would be more concerning if they were facing a defense other than this Lions group, which may be the only playoff-caliber unit in the league that has dealt with more injury issues than the Niners offense. Alex Anzalone, Marcus Davenport, John Cominsky, Derrick Barnes, Khalil Dorsey, Malcom Rodriguez, Ennis Rakestraw Jr., Carlton Davis, Aidan Hutchinson, Alim McNeill and Kyle Peko are all on injured reserve. Jalen Reeves-Maybin has been designated to return but has not yet gotten back on the field. The only expected starters left on the field are DJ Reader, Jack Campbell, Terrion Arnold, Kerby Joseph and Brian Branch. That is insane. San Francisco should be able to get some things going offensively on Monday night, provided the offensive line can hold its own. Brock Purdy has generally been more aggressive this year than in years past; Kittle, Jennings and Samuel are available and healthy, and Guerendo should be back. Given the condition of the Lions defense, there will be openings for all of them to make plays. The question is whether they can make enough plays to keep up with the Lions ... and that's hard to envision. Detroit is going on the road and playing against the team that ended its playoff run a year ago. If we know anything about Dan Campbell teams, it's that they want to win that type of game perhaps even more than any other. And the Lions offense is just too efficient, they'll be too explosive to keep down. Pick: Lions 33, 49ers 23 © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Overtime victories by the Bengals and Commanders bookended a dramatic week for those hovering around the postseason places. This week's iteration of \"Monday Night Football\" could carry similar tidings. The Lions (14-2) are the cream of the crop, as capable of outpacing the world's gashing opposition teams on offense than shutting them now on the other end of the field. That reputation has taken a hit over the past few months, though. Detroit's defensive metrics fade under scrutiny, especially when compared to some of the season's best. Perhaps injuries can harbor some of the blame. Even when dueling with the lowly 49ers (6-9), the Lions will have their work cut out for them. Brock Purdy is back under center for Kyle Shanahan's squad, and Deebo Samuel, George Kittle and Ricky Pearsall still represent one of the league's most prolific receiving rooms.

                "title": "Boston Celtics - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Boston Celtics (/ˈsɛltɪks/ SEL-tiks[a]) are an American professional basketball team based in Boston. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. Founded in 1946 as one of the league's original eight teams, the Celtics play their home games at TD Garden, a shared arena with the NHL's Boston Bruins. The Celtics are commonly regarded as the most successful team in NBA history and hold the records for most NBA championships won, with 18, and most recorded wins of any NBA franchise.[11][12] The Celtics' rise to dominance began in the late 1950s, after the team, led by coach Red Auerbach, acquired Bill Russell in 1956, later becoming the cornerstone of the Celtics dynasty. Led by Russell, Bob Cousy, and Tom Heinsohn, the Celtics won their first NBA championship in 1957. Russell, along with a talented supporting cast of future Hall of Famers including Heinsohn, Don Nelson, K. C. Jones, John Havlicek, Sam Jones, Satch Sanders, and Bill Sharman, would usher the Celtics into the greatest period in franchise history, winning eight consecutive NBA championships from 1959 to 1966. After Russell became the team's player-coach, as well as the first African American head coach in any United States sport, they won back-to-back titles in 1968 and 1969. The Celtics entered a period of rebuilding after Russell retired in 1969. In the mid-1970s, the Celtics became contenders once again, winning championships in 1974 and 1976 under the leadership of head coach Tom Heinsohn with Dave Cowens, Havlicek, and Jo Jo White. In the 1980s, the Celtics returned to dominance. Anchored by the \"Big Three\" of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish, the team experienced a renewed rivalry with the \"Showtime\" Lakers and won championships in 1981, 1984, and 1986, the latter two with head coach K. C. Jones against the Lakers. After the retirements of Bird and McHale, the departure of Parish, and the untimely deaths of 1986 draft pick Len Bias and star player Reggie Lewis, the Celtics struggled through the 1990s and much of the early 2000s. After another period of rebuilding, the Celtics assembled a new \"Big Three\" around team captain Paul Pierce by acquiring Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett in the 2007 offseason. Under the leadership of head coach Doc Rivers, the team defeated the Lakers to win their 17th championship in 2008, while also losing to the Lakers in the 2010 Finals. Allen, Garnett, and Pierce were no longer with the team by the start of the 2013–14 season, with Garnett and Pierce being traded to the Brooklyn Nets for four total future first round picks. With two of these first round picks, the team drafted Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Led by \"The Jays\", the team returned to the NBA Finals in 2022, losing to the Golden State Warriors, and defeated the Dallas Mavericks in 2024 to secure their 18th championship. The \"Celtics\" nickname and the team's mascot \"Lucky the Leprechaun\" are nods to Boston's historically large Irish population, and also to the Original Celtics, a barnstorming basketball team that played in the early 20th century.[13] The Celtics have a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, who are second in NBA history with 17 championships. The teams' rivalry was especially pronounced in the 1960s and 1980s. The Celtics have played the Lakers a record 12 times in the NBA Finals and have defeated them nine times. 41 members of Basketball Hall of Fame have played for the Celtics at least once in their careers. Four Celtics players (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird) have won the NBA Most Valuable Player award; overall, Celtics players have won an NBA-record 10 MVP awards.[14] The Boston Celtics were formed on June 6, 1946, by Boston Garden-Arena Corporation president Walter A. Brown as a team in the Basketball Association of America. In 1948, the team earned its first playoff appearance, only to lose to the Chicago Stags 4–1. In 1949, the team missed the playoffs, fifth in the Eastern Division. Then, on August 3, 1949, the team became part of the National Basketball Association following the merger of the BAA and rival National Basketball League.[15][16] In 1950, the Celtics signed Chuck Cooper, becoming the first NBA franchise to draft a black player.[17] Chuck Connors of The Rifleman fame was an original member of the Celtics in 1946.[18] The Celtics struggled during their early years, until the hiring of coach Red Auerbach.[19] In the franchise's early days, Auerbach had no assistants, ran all the practices, did all the scouting—both of opposing teams and college draft prospects—and scheduled all road trips. One of the first great players to join the Celtics was Bob Cousy, whom Auerbach initially refused to draft out of nearby Holy Cross because he was \"too flashy\".[20] Cousy's contract eventually became the property of the Chicago Stags,[21] but when that franchise went bankrupt, Cousy went to the Celtics in a dispersal draft. After the 1955–56 season, Auerbach made a stunning trade, sending perennial All-Star Ed Macauley to the St. Louis Hawks along with the draft rights to Cliff Hagan for the second overall pick in the draft.[22] After negotiating with the Rochester Royals—a negotiation that included a promise that the Celtics owner would send the highly sought-after Ice Capades to Rochester if the Royals would let Russell slide to No. 2—Auerbach used the pick to select University of San Francisco center Bill Russell.[23] Auerbach also acquired Holy Cross standout, and 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year, Tom Heinsohn.[24] Both Russell and Heinsohn worked extraordinarily well with Cousy, and they were the players around whom Auerbach would build the champion Celtics for more than a decade.[24] With Bill Russell, the Celtics advanced to the 1957 NBA Finals and defeated the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, earning their first NBA title.[25] In 1958, the Celtics again advanced to the NBA Finals, this time losing to the Hawks in 6 games.[26] Following the acquisition of K.C. Jones in 1958, the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for more than a decade.[27] In 1959, the Celtics won the NBA championship after sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers, the first of their record eight consecutive championships.[28] During that time, the Celtics met the Lakers in the Finals five times, starting an intense and often bitter rivalry that has spanned generations. In 1964, the Celtics became the first NBA team to have an all African-American starting lineup. On December 26, 1964, Willie Naulls replaced an injured Tom Heinsohn, joining Tom 'Satch' Sanders, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, and Bill Russell in the starting lineup. The Celtics defeated St. Louis 97–84. Boston won its next 11 games with Naulls starting in place of Heinsohn.[29] The Celtics of the late 1950s–1960s are widely considered one of the most dominant teams of all time.[30] Auerbach retired as coach after the 1965–66 season and Russell took over as player-coach, which was Auerbach's ploy to keep Russell interested.[31] With his appointment Russell became the first African-American coach in any U.S. pro sport. Auerbach would remain the general manager, a position he would hold well into the 1980s. However, the Celtics' string of NBA titles ended when they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1967 Eastern Conference Finals. The aging team managed two more championships in 1968 and 1969, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers each time.[32] Russell retired after the 1969 season, effectively ending a Celtics dynasty that had garnered an unrivaled 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons.[33] The team's run of 8 consecutive is the longest championship streak in U.S. professional sports history,[34] with Russell's 11 titles being the most won by an NBA player. The 1969–70 season was a rebuilding year, as the Celtics had their first losing record since the 1949–50 season. However, with the acquisition of Paul Silas and future Hall of Famers Dave Cowens[35] and Jo Jo White,[36] the Celtics soon became dominant again. After losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1972, the Celtics regrouped and came out determined in 1973 and posted an excellent 68–14 regular season record. But the season ended in disappointment, as they were upset in seven games by the New York Knicks in the Conference Finals. John Havlicek injured his right shoulder in game six and was forced to play game seven shooting left-handed.[37] The Celtics returned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1974 NBA Finals for their 12th NBA championship.[38] Boston took a 3–2 series lead and had a chance to claim the title on their home court. The Bucks won Game Six in Boston when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar nestled in a hook shot with 3 seconds left in the game's second overtime, and the series returned to Milwaukee. Cowens was the hero in Game 7, scoring 28 points, as the Celtics brought the title back to Boston for the first time in five years. In 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in six games. The Finals featured one of the greatest games in NBA history. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Suns trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force overtime. In double overtime, a Gar Heard turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at which point the Celtics prevailed.[39] After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977, Boston went into another rebuilding phase. In the 1977 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted a young forward from UNC Charlotte named Cedric Maxwell.[40] \"Cornbread\" Maxwell did not contribute much in his rookie season, but he showed promise. Auerbach's job became even tougher following the 1977–78 season in which they went 32–50 as Havlicek, the Celtics' all-time leading scorer, retired after 16 seasons.[41] The Celtics owned two of the top eight picks in the 1978 NBA draft.[42] Auerbach took a risk by selecting junior Larry Bird of Indiana State with the sixth overall pick, knowing that Bird would stay in college for his senior year but believing that his potential would make him worth the wait. The team retained Bird's rights for one year and signed him soon after he led Indiana State to the NCAA championship game. In 1978, Celtics owner Irv Levin traded franchises with Buffalo Braves owner John Y. Brown Jr.[43] Two weeks before the swap of franchises was made official, details of a six-player trade between the two teams were reported. Boston sent Freeman Williams, Kevin Kunnert, and Kermit Washington to the Braves for \"Tiny\" Archibald, Billy Knight, and Marvin Barnes.[44] The move turned Boston fans against Brown, both because Kunnert and Washington were seen as key pieces of the team's future and because Auerbach publicly stated that he was not consulted about the trade.[44] The relationship between Brown and Auerbach worsened with Brown's decision to acquire Bob McAdoo in February 1979,[45] in exchange for three first-round draft picks that Auerbach had planned to use to rebuild the franchise.[46] Again, Brown made the trade without consulting Auerbach.[47] Auerbach almost left Boston to take a job with the New York Knicks as a result.[46] With public support strongly behind Auerbach, Brown sold the team to Harry Mangurian in 1979 rather than run the risk of losing his famed general manager.[48][49] The Celtics would struggle through the season, going 29–53.[50] Newcomers Chris Ford, Rick Robey, Cedric Maxwell and Nate Archibald failed to reverse the team's momentum.[51] Larry Bird debuted for the Celtics during the 1979–80 season.[52] With a new owner in place, Auerbach made a number of moves that would bring the team back to prominence. He almost immediately traded McAdoo,[53] a former NBA scoring champion, to the Detroit Pistons for guard M. L. Carr, a defensive specialist, and two first-round picks in the 1980 NBA draft.[49] He also picked up point guard Gerald Henderson from the CBA. Carr, Archibald, Henderson and Ford formed a highly competent backcourt, blending in well with the talented frontcourt of Cowens, Maxwell and Bird. With Bird winning NBA Rookie of the Year honors[54] the team went 61–21, a 32-game improvement from the previous season. Playing strong in the playoffs, the Celtics fell to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals.[55] After the season, Auerbach completed one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, garnering a pair of future Hall of Famers for a pair of first-round draft picks. Seeking to improve the team immediately, Auerbach sent the team's two first-round draft picks to the Golden State Warriors for both center Robert Parish[56] and the Warriors' first-round pick. He then used the pick the Celtics obtained from Golden State to select University of Minnesota power forward Kevin McHale.[57] The \"Big Three\" of Bird, McHale and Parish played together for the Celtics until 1992, won three NBA championships together,[58] and were later described as the best NBA frontcourt of all time.[59][60][61][62] Despite losing center Dave Cowens to retirement late in training camp, the Celtics went 62–20 under coach Bill Fitch in 1980–81.[63] Once again, the Celtics faced the 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals, falling behind 3–1 before coming back to win Game Seven, 91–90. The Celtics went on to win the 1981 NBA championship over the Houston Rockets,[64] with Maxwell being named NBA Finals MVP.[65] Following the 1981–82 season, the Celtics once again met the 76ers in the playoffs. This time, they lost in seven games.[66] In 1983 the Celtics were swept in the playoffs (a first for the franchise) by the Milwaukee Bucks;[67] afterwards, Fitch resigned and the team was sold to new owners led by Don Gaston.[68] In 1983–84, the Celtics under new coach K. C. Jones would go 62–20 and return to the NBA Finals after a three-year hiatus.[69] Boston came back from a 2–1 deficit to defeat the Lakers for their 15th championship.[70] Bird renewed his college rivalry with Lakers star Magic Johnson during this series. After the season, Auerbach officially retired as general manager, but maintained the position of team president.[71] He was succeeded by Jan Volk.[71] In 1985, the Lakers and Celtics met again in the Finals, with the Lakers winning.[72] This was the first time the Lakers had defeated the Celtics in the Finals and the only time the team had won a championship at Boston Garden. During the following off-season, the Celtics acquired Bill Walton from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Cedric Maxwell.[73] Walton had been an All-Star and league MVP while leading the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1977 NBA championship, but injuries had hobbled him since. Considered the best passing center in NBA history, he stayed healthy and was a big part of the Celtics' success in 1986. The Celtics won the second pick in the 1986 NBA draft and drafted University of Maryland star Len Bias, one of the most heralded prospects of his era.[74] Bias died 36 hours later of an accidental cocaine overdose.[75] Despite the tragedy, the Celtics remained competitive in 1986–87, going 59–23 and again winning the Eastern Conference Championship.[76] They were defeated in the Finals by the Lakers in six games. In 1988, the Celtics lost in six games to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals.[77] Following the season, head coach K.C. Jones retired and was replaced by assistant Jimmy Rodgers. Boston's hopes for 1988–89 faded when Bird underwent a procedure to remove bone spurs in his feet early in the season, and the Celtics won just 42 games before a first-round playoff defeat to the Pistons. Bird returned in 1989–90 and led the Celtics to a 52–30 record. In the playoffs, the Celtics collapsed after winning the first two games in a best-of-five series against the New York Knicks, losing three straight games and the series. After the playoffs, Rodgers was fired and replaced by assistant coach and former Celtics player Chris Ford. Under Ford's leadership, the Celtics improved to 56–26 in 1990–91, recapturing the Atlantic Division title even though Bird missed 22 games with several injuries. The Celtics again lost to the Pistons in the playoffs. In 1992, a late-season rally allowed a 51–31 Celtics team to catch the New York Knicks and repeat as Atlantic Division champions. After sweeping the Indiana Pacers in the first round, the Celtics lost a seven-game Eastern Conference Semifinals series to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Back injuries limited Bird to only 45 regular season games, and just four of ten in the playoffs. After thirteen NBA seasons and a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics with the Dream Team, continued back trouble led Bird to retire in 1992. The loss of Bird and the aging of the team's other veteran stars forced coach Chris Ford into rebuilding mode.[78] Hopes centered on 26-year-old Reggie Lewis, a small forward out of Boston's Northeastern University. In the first round of the 1993 playoffs Lewis fainted during Boston's four-game series loss by the Charlotte Hornets.[79] An examination revealed heart problems,[80] but Lewis was able to get doctors to clear him for a comeback. Before he could make it he died of a heart attack while shooting baskets at Brandeis University during the off-season.[81] The Celtics honored his memory by retiring his number 35.[82] With McHale having retired after the Celtics' playoff loss to the Hornets, Boston's original Big 3 era came to an end in 1994 upon Robert Parish's signing with Charlotte.[56] The team collapsed, finishing out of the playoffs with a 32–50 mark. In 1994, the Celtics hired former player and legendary towel-waving cheerleader M. L. Carr as the team's new vice president of basketball operations. Working alongside general manager Jan Volk, Carr selected University of North Carolina star Eric Montross with Boston's first-round pick in the 1994 NBA draft. Montross became the new heir apparent in the paint, but failed to develop and was eventually traded. 1994–95 was the Celtics' final season in the Boston Garden. The Celtics signed aging Dominique Wilkins as a free agent, who led the team in scoring with 17.8 PPG. Second-year player Dino Rađa, a power forward from Croatia, added an interior presence the team had been lacking in 1993–94. The Celtics made the playoffs, losing to the heavily favored Orlando Magic in four games. In 1995, the Celtics moved from the Boston Garden to the Fleet Center (later TD BankNorth, then TD Garden). Carr fired Chris Ford and took the coaching reins himself. After drafting Providence College star Eric Williams, the Celtics struggled to a 33–49 record. Things got worse in 1996–97 as the Celtics lost a franchise-record 67 games, setting an unwanted NBA record winning only once against other Atlantic Division teams and just fifteen victories overall. In spite of the emergence of 1st-round draft pick Antoine Walker, Carr resigned after the season ended, while Rick Pitino was hired to join the franchise as the team's president, director of basketball operations, and head coach, reportedly on a $70 million ten-year contract. Volk resigned on May 7, 1997.[83][84] Pitino's appointment as team president was controversial as Auerbach, the incumbent who had filled that role for more than 25 years, first heard about the change from local media. Unfortunately for the franchise, Pitino was not the savior everyone hoped he would be. Auerbach bore the insult of being elbowed out with dignity, even as the team failed to improve. The Celtics received the third and sixth draft picks in the 1997 NBA draft,[85] and used the picks to select a brand new backcourt through Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer. The young team that lost 67 games the year before was dismantled, with David Wesley, Dino Rađa and Rick Fox being let go, and Williams traded to the Denver Nuggets for a pair of second round draft picks (Williams would return to the Celtics in 1999 and played for four years). Walter McCarty was also acquired in a trade with the Knicks. With a promising start, upsetting the defending champions Chicago Bulls at home on opening night,[86] and hard play from the youngsters that led to leaderships in turnovers and steals, the team improved its victories from 15 to 36 despite many losing streaks.[87][88] Billups was subsequently traded to the Raptors during his rookie year,[89] and Mercer was traded to the Nuggets during his third season.[90] The following year in the 1998 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted Paul Pierce,[91] a college star who had been expected to be drafted much earlier than the Celtics' 10th overall pick. Pierce had an immediate impact during the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, averaging 19.5 points and being named Rookie of The Month in February as he led the league in steals.[92] However, the Celtics continued to struggle as Pitino failed to achieve meaningful success. After Boston lost to the Toronto Raptors on March 1, 2000, on a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter, Pitino delivered the memorable \"walking through that door\" speech, invoking Bird, McHale and Parish, which has been frequently cited over the years as a reality check for organizations wrestling with bygone glory.[93] He resigned in January 2001.[94] Following the resignation of Rick Pitino, the Celtics saw modest improvement under coach Jim O'Brien. Paul Pierce matured into an NBA star and was ably complemented by Antoine Walker and the other players acquired over the years. While the team was 12–21 when Pitino left, O'Brien's record to finish the season was 24–24.[95] Following the 2000–01 season O'Brien was given the job of head coach on a permanent basis. As a result of numerous trades, the Celtics had three picks in the 2001 NBA draft. They selected Joe Johnson, Joe Forte, and Kedrick Brown. Only Johnson managed to succeed in the NBA, becoming a perennial All-Star after leaving the Celtics. The Celtics entered the 2001–02 season with low expectations. The team's success in the latter stages of 2000–01 was largely forgotten, and critics were surprised when the team, along with the New Jersey Nets, surged to the top of the Atlantic Division ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers, who were fresh off a trip to the NBA Finals. The Celtics won a hard-fought 5-game series with the 76ers in the first round, 3–2. Pierce scored 46 points in the series-clinching game at the Fleet Center. In the Conference Semifinals, the Celtics defeated the favored Detroit Pistons 4–1. In their first trip to the Eastern Conference Finals since 1988, the Celtics jumped out to a 2–1 series lead over the Nets, after rallying from 21 points down in the fourth quarter to win Game 3, but would lose the next three games to fall 4–2.[96] In 2003, the Celtics were sold by owner Paul Gaston to Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C.,[97] led by H. Irving Grousbeck, Wycliffe Grousbeck and Steve Pagliuca. The team made it back to the playoffs but were swept by the Nets in the second round, despite bringing Game 4 to double overtime.[98] Before their elimination, the team hired former Celtics' guard Danny Ainge as general manager, moving Chris Wallace to another position in the organization. Ainge believed the team had reached its peak and promptly sent Antoine Walker to the Dallas Mavericks (along with Tony Delk).[99] In return, the Celtics received the often-injured Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills, Jiří Welsch,[100] and a first-round pick in 2004. The Celtics made the playoffs, only to be swept in the first round by the Indiana Pacers, losing all four games.[101] The Celtics were a young team under new coach Doc Rivers during the 2004–05 season,[102] having drafted youngsters Al Jefferson, Delonte West and Tony Allen in the 2004 Draft. Yet they seemed to have a core of good young players, led by Pierce and rookie Al Jefferson, to go along with a group of able veterans. The Celtics went 45–37 and won their first Atlantic Division title since 1991–92, receiving a boost from returning star Antoine Walker in mid-season. The Pacers defeated them in the first round yet again, with the series culminating in an embarrassing 27-point loss in Game 7 at the Fleet Center. After the season Walker was traded again, this time to the Miami Heat. Despite Pierce's career season, in which he averaged career-highs in points (26.8), the Celtics missed the playoffs with a 33–49 record, owing largely to a young roster and constant roster shuffling, which saw the likes of Marcus Banks, Ricky Davis and Mark Blount traded for underachieving former first-overall pick Michael Olowokandi and former all-star Wally Szczerbiak. The Celtics continued to rebuild in the 2006 NBA draft. The Celtics selected Kentucky point guard Rajon Rondo, who was to become a key piece in the team's revival. In the second round the Celtics added center Leon Powe.[103] The 2006–07 season was a gloomy one for the franchise, starting with the death of Red Auerbach at 89. Auerbach was one of the few remaining people who had been a part of the NBA since its inception in 1946.[104] The Celtics went 2–22 from late December 2006 through early February 2007 after losing Pierce to injury, the result of a stress reaction in his left foot. At first, the Celtics received a much-needed boost from guard Tony Allen but he tore his ACL and MCL on a needless dunk attempt after the whistle.[105] The Celtics compiled a record of 24–58, second-worst in the NBA, including a franchise-record 18-game losing streak.[106] At the end of the season, the Celtics, with the second-worst record in the NBA, were at least hopeful that they could secure a high draft pick and select either Greg Oden or Kevin Durant to help rebuild the franchise, but the Celtics fell to fifth in the Draft Lottery. In the summer of 2007, general manager Danny Ainge made a series of moves that returned the Celtics to prominence. On draft night, he traded No. 5 pick Jeff Green, Wally Szczerbiak and Delonte West to Seattle for perennial All-Star Ray Allen and Seattle's second-round pick, which the team used to select LSU's Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis.[107] The Celtics then traded Ryan Gomes, Gerald Green, Al Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Sebastian Telfair, and a first-round draft pick to the Timberwolves in exchange for superstar power forward Kevin Garnett.[108] These moves created a new \"Big Three\" of Pierce, Allen, and Garnett. In the 2007–08 season, Celtics completed the largest single-season turnaround in NBA history. The team went 66–16 in the regular season, a 42-game improvement over its 2006–07 record. However, the team struggled in the early rounds of the playoffs, needing seven games to defeat the Atlanta Hawks in the first round and another seven to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the conference semifinals. The Celtics then beat the Detroit Pistons in six games in the Eastern Conference Finals, winning two road games.[109] For the 11th time in league history, and for the first time since 1987, the Celtics and the Lakers faced off in the NBA Finals. The Celtics won Game One at home 98–88, fueled by strong play by Garnett and Pierce's dramatic comeback from a second-half knee injury. They won Game Two 108–102 despite nearly blowing a 24-point lead in the fourth quarter. As the series shifted to Los Angeles, the Lakers stifled Pierce and Garnett in Game Three and won 87–81. However, the Celtics would overcome a 24-point deficit in Game 4 to win 97–91, making the largest in-game comeback in NBA Finals history. After again blowing a large lead, the Lakers hung on to win Game 5 103–98, sending the series back to Boston. In Game 6, the Celtics overpowered the Lakers, winning 131–92 and clinching their 17th NBA title. Paul Pierce was named Finals MVP.[110] With the win the Celtics set a record for most games a team had ever played in a postseason with 26.[111] The 2008–09 Celtics started off the season at 27–2, the then-best starting record in NBA history.[112] They also had a franchise-record 19-game streak.[113] After the All-Star Break, Kevin Garnett was injured in a loss against the Utah Jazz and missed the last 25 games of the season. Garnett was eventually shelved for the playoffs. The 2009 Celtics still finished with 62 victories, but their playoff run would end against the Magic in the second round.[114] In 2009, with the return of Garnett from injury and the additions of Rasheed Wallace and Marquis Daniels, the Celtics started the season 23–5 and at one point had the best record in the NBA. However, Doc Rivers decided to lessen his aging stars' minutes to keep them fresh for the playoffs. As a result, the Celtics sputtered to an even 27–27 record the rest of the way and finished the 2009–10 regular season with a 50–32 record.[115] Despite being the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, the Celtics managed to make the NBA Finals. Rajon Rondo emerged as a star during postseason play.[116] For the 12th time, the Celtics faced the Lakers in the Finals. After taking a 3–2 lead heading into Los Angeles for Game Six, the Celtics appeared poised to win their 18th title. However, starting center Kendrick Perkins suffered a severe knee injury early in Game Six,[117] and the Celtics went on to lose the series in seven games. During the 2010 off-season, with Perkins expected to be out until February 2011, the Celtics signed two former All-Star centers, Shaquille O'Neal and Jermaine O'Neal. Shaquille O'Neal's presence wound up leading to Perkins' departure: the Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury[118] and had a 19–3 record in games when O'Neal played over 20 minutes.[119] Consequently, Perkins was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in February, when the Celtics were 41–14 and led the Eastern Conference despite another rash of injuries. Following the trade, however, they proceeded to win only 15 of their final 27 games. They finished with a 56–26 record, sliding to the third seed.[118][120] The 2010–11 season still provided three landmarks: The Celtics became the second team to reach 3,000 victories, Paul Pierce became the third Celtic to score 20,000 points (the others are Larry Bird and John Havlicek), and Ray Allen broke the NBA record for most career three-pointers. The 2011 NBA playoffs started with the Celtics sweeping the New York Knicks 4–0 in the opening round. In the second round, they were ousted by eventual Eastern Conference champions Miami Heat in five games. Shaquille O'Neal, limited to 12 minutes in two games of the second round, retired at the end of the season.[121] The Celtics started the lockout-shortened season 0–3, as Pierce was out with a heel injury. At the All-Star break, the Celtics were below .500 with a 15–17 record. However, they were one of the hottest teams in the league after the break, going 24–10 the rest of the year and winning their fifth division title in a row. The Celtics made the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, the Celtics faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, beating them in six games led by strong play from Pierce and Garnett. In the conference semifinals, the Celtics defeated the 76ers in seven games. The Celtics faced the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, losing in seven games to the eventual NBA champions. The 2012 off-season started with the Celtics having only six players under contract. While Kevin Garnett was signed to a new contract, Ray Allen signed with the Miami Heat for less money than the Celtics offered; this move brought the five-year \"Big Three\" era to a somewhat acrimonious end. The Celtics finished the season with 41 wins.[122] The Celtics trailed the New York Knicks 3–0 in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs before losing the series in six games. In Game Six, the Celtics nearly completed a comeback when they went on a 20–0 run to cut the lead to four.[123] During the off-season, head coach Doc Rivers was allowed to terminate his contract. He departed the Celtics to coach the Los Angeles Clippers, and the Celtics received a 2015 unprotected first-round pick as compensation. A few days later, Pierce, Garnett (who waived a no-trade clause), Jason Terry, and D. J. White, were traded to the Brooklyn Nets for Keith Bogans, MarShon Brooks, Kris Humphries, Kris Joseph, Gerald Wallace, and three future first-round draft picks (2014, 2016, 2018), together with the right to swap 2017 first-round picks with Brooklyn.[124] The deal marked the start of a youth movement for the team.[125] On July 3, 2013, the Celtics announced that Brad Stevens, the head coach of Butler University, would replace Doc Rivers as head coach.[126] Halfway through the season, in January, Rajon Rondo made his return and was named the 15th Team Captain in team history, and the team furthered the youth movement by acquiring two draft picks in a three-team trade that sent Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks to the Golden State Warriors while the Celtics received the Heat center Joel Anthony. The 2013–14 season marked the Celtics' first missed playoffs since the \"Big Three\".[127] The next off-season, the Celtics drafted Marcus Smart with the 6th overall pick and James Young with the 17th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft,[128] and signed Evan Turner. The 2014–15 season had several roster moves, the most prominent being Rondo and rookie Dwight Powell traded to the Dallas Mavericks for center Brandan Wright, forward Jae Crowder, veteran point guard Jameer Nelson, and future picks.[129] A total of 22 players spent time with the Celtics,[130] leading scorer and rebounder Sullinger suffered a season-ending left metatarsal stress fracture,[131] and the team was only tenth in the East with 28 games remaining.[132] However, midseason acquisition Isaiah Thomas helped the team win 22 of their last 34 games, finishing the season with a 40–42 record, enough for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.[133] The Celtics were swept by the second seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round. In the 2015 NBA draft Boston selected Terry Rozier, R.J. Hunter, Jordan Mickey, and Marcus Thornton with the 16th, 28th, 33rd, and 45th selections respectively. During the off-season, the Celtics signed forward Amir Johnson and traded Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb in exchange for Warriors forward David Lee. The Celtics finished the 2015–16 NBA season with a 48–34 record, earning the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. They played the fourth seed Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs. After leading by 3 points in the fourth quarter of Game 1, guard Avery Bradley went down with a hamstring injury, making him sit out for the rest of the series. The Celtics lost the series 4–2 to the Hawks, ending their season. In the 2016 NBA draft, the Celtics selected Jaylen Brown with the third pick. On July 8, 2016, the team signed four-time All-Star Al Horford.[134] The Celtics finished the 2016–17 season with a 53–29 record and clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference.[135] After a hip injury ended Thomas' playoff run in game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals,[136] the Celtics eventually lost to the Cavaliers in five games. Isaiah Thomas was selected for his second straight All-Star game and first All-NBA selection, finishing third in the league in scoring and fifth in MVP voting. For the 2017 NBA draft, the Celtics won the draft lottery, earning them the first pick.[b] They were projected to select freshman guard Markelle Fultz, but the pick was subsequently traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for the third pick in the 2017 draft and future picks.[137] The 76ers would go on to draft Fultz, while the Celtics used the third pick to select freshman forward Jayson Tatum. During the off-season, the team signed Gordon Hayward.[138] On August 22, 2017, the Celtics agreed to a deal that sent Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Žižić, and the Brooklyn Nets' 2018 first-round draft pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kyrie Irving.[139] By the end of the off-season, only four Celtics' players remained from the 2016–17 team,[140] with Marcus Smart being the longest-tenured Celtic from the 2014 NBA draft. On the team's opening night game in the first quarter against the Cavaliers, Hayward suffered a fractured tibia and dislocated ankle in his left leg,[141] causing him to be ruled out for the rest of the regular season.[142] Despite the loss, the Celtics went on a 16-game winning streak, which also went down as the fourth-longest winning streak in the teams' history.[143] The Celtics finished the year with a 55–27 record, good enough for second place in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round in seven games, and continued the feat in the Conference Semifinals by defeating the Philadelphia 76ers in five games before losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games in the Conference Finals. The Celtics finished the 2018–19 season with a 49–33 record. Analysts started questioning the team's performance and chances for the championship when the Celtics had a 10–10 record after the first 20 games on November 24, 2018.[144] The Celtics then won the next eight games improving their record to 18–10.[145] During the eight-game win streak, the Celtics defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 128–95, the New York Knicks 128–100, and also defeated the Chicago Bulls by 56 points (133–77), setting a record for the largest margin in a victory in franchise history, while also tying the record for largest victory margin by an away team.[146] The Celtics finished the regular season in fourth place in the Eastern Conference. During an April 7 game, Marcus Smart injured his hip and was ruled out for the rest of the regular season and the first round of the playoffs.[147] In the 2019 playoffs, the Celtics swept the Indiana Pacers in the first round, and then lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in five games.[148] [149] The Celtics held four picks in the 2019 NBA draft. Following a series of transactions, the team landed Romeo Langford with the 14th pick and also added Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards, and Tremont Waters (2020 G-league Rookie of the year).[150] During the 2019 off-season, Irving and Horford signed with the Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers, respectively. Irving left, despite promising to stay in Boston.[151] On June 30, 2019, the Celtics and point guard Kemba Walker agreed to a four-year maximum contract worth $141 million. On July 6, 2019, the Celtics officially acquired Walker in a sign and trade with the Charlotte Hornets; the Celtics sent guard Terry Rozier and a protected 2020 second-round draft pick to Charlotte in exchange for Walker and a 2020 second-round draft pick.[152] On July 1, 2019, the Celtics agreed to a two-year contract with center Enes Kanter.[153] Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Celtics were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season.[154] In the 2020 playoffs, the Celtics swept the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, beat the Toronto Raptors in a seven-game series, and fell to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games.[155] Boston struggled with injuries in the 2020–21 season, with Walker, Tatum and Brown all missing games at different points in the season due to injury and COVID-19. Boston could not automatically qualify for the playoffs and were sent to the play-in tournament, where they defeated the Washington Wizards 119–100. In the playoffs, they lost to the Brooklyn Nets in five games.[156] On June 2, 2021, the Celtics named head coach Brad Stevens as president of basketball operations replacing Danny Ainge after he announced his retirement.[157] On June 18, Stevens made his first transaction in his new position trading away Kemba Walker, the 16th pick in the 2021 NBA draft, and a 2025 second-round pick in exchange for former Celtic Horford, Moses Brown, and a 2023 second-round pick.[158] On June 23, 2021, it was reported that Stevens had made the decision to hire Ime Udoka as his own replacement as head coach of the Celtics.[159][160] Tatum made his third All-Star appearance off the bench at the 2022 NBA All-Star Game in Cleveland. In April 2022, the Celtics qualified for the 2022 NBA playoffs as the second seed in the Eastern Conference, having a 51–31 record; they swept the Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the postseason.[161] They next faced the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals and the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating both teams in seven-game series, earning the Celtics their first Finals appearance since 2010. The Celtics took a 2–1 series lead, but lost the next three games to lose to the Golden State Warriors 4–2.[162] In September, the Celtics suspended Udoka for the whole 2022–23 season for engaging in an improper intimate relationship with a female staffer.[163] Assistant coach Joe Mazzulla replaced Udoka as the interim head coach.[164] On February 16, 2023, Mazzulla was named the team's permanent head coach after leading the Celtics to a league-best 42–17 record at the NBA All-Star break.[165] After overcoming a 3–2 deficit against the Philadelphia 76ers to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics fell behind 3–0 in a rematch against the Heat. They battled their way back to Game 7 thanks to a Derrick White buzzer-beater in Game 6, but the Heat ultimately prevented the first 3–0 comeback in NBA history with a decisive win in Boston. During the 2023 off-season, the Celtics acquired Kristaps Porziņģis from the Wizards. In the trade, they sent Marcus Smart to the Memphis Grizzlies in a three-team deal,[166] and also traded Grant Williams to the Dallas Mavericks.[167] On October 1, 2023, the Celtics acquired Jrue Holiday in exchange for Malcolm Brogdon, Robert Williams III and two draft picks.[168] On February 7, 2024, before the trade deadline, the Celtics acquired Xavier Tillman from the Grizzlies.[169] The Celtics finished the 2023–24 regular season with the best record in the NBA, securing a 64–18 record.[170] After the regular season's close, the Celtics entered the 2024 NBA playoffs, defeating the Miami Heat in the first round, moving on to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the East Semifinals, and moving on again to defeat the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals.[171][172][173] The Celtics' victory in the Eastern Conference Finals on May 27, 2024, was accompanied by the announcement that Jaylen Brown had been selected as the NBA Eastern Conference Finals MVP, and Brown was presented with the Larry Bird trophy, the first of his career.[174][175] The Celtics would go on to defeat the Dallas Mavericks in five games to win the NBA Finals, their record-setting 18th championship and breaking the tie with the Lakers (who have 17).[176] The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers involves the two most storied franchises in NBA history. It has been called the NBA's best rivalry.[177] The two teams have met a record twelve times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s, three times in the 1980s, in 2008, and in 2010. The Celtics have won the first eight finals meetings, while the Lakers won three of last four. The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series in six games. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals which the Lakers won in seven games. The two teams are first and second for the highest number of championships, with the Celtics leading the Lakers, 18 titles to 17; together, their 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history. The Celtics–Hawks rivalry is a rivalry in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association that has lasted for over five decades, although the two teams have played each other since the 1949–50 season, when the then-Tri-Cities Blackhawks joined the NBA as part of the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America merger. However, the Blackhawks could not field a truly competitive team until they moved to St. Louis as the St. Louis Hawks after a four-year stopover at Milwaukee. The two teams have faced each other eleven times in the NBA Playoffs, four times in the NBA Finals, with the Celtics winning ten of twelve series against the Hawks, including three out of four NBA Finals.[178] While the Hawks have only defeated the Celtics twice out of eleven series in the NBA Playoffs, they still often managed to make their series with the Celtics memorable. The rivalry intensified in 2016 with Hawks All-Star Center Al Horford spurning the team and joining the Celtics. The Boston Celtics were once rivals of the New Jersey Nets during the early 2000s due to their respective locations and their burgeoning stars. The Nets were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, while the Celtics were experiencing newfound success behind Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker. The rivalry began to heat up in the 2002 Eastern Conference Finals, which was preceded by trash-talking from the Celtics[179] who claimed Martin was a \"fake\" tough guy. Things progressed as the series started, and on-court tensions seemed to spill into the stands. Celtics' fans berated Kidd and his family with chants of \"Wife Beater!\"[180] in response to Kidd's 2001 domestic abuse charge. When asked about the fan barbs being traded, Kenyon Martin stated, \"Our fans hate them, their fans hate us.\" Bill Walton said at the time that Nets-Celtics was the \"beginning of the next great NBA rivalry\" during the Eastern Conference Finals in 2002 with the Nets advancing to the NBA Finals, though New Jersey would go on to sweep Boston in the 2003 playoffs. In 2012, the year the Nets returned to New York in the borough of Brooklyn, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court on November 28, resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo, Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined.[181] The story was revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett's shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike. However, the rivalry between the Nets and the Celtics appeared significantly cooled off by the June 2013 blockbuster trade that dealt Celtics stars Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Nets in exchange for Wallace, Humphries, and others. This move was billed as a merger of the two Atlantic Division teams.[182] The rivalry between the Celtics and the Detroit Pistons peaked in the 1980s, featuring players such as Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Isiah Thomas, Bill Laimbeer, Dennis Rodman, and Joe Dumars. These teams met in the NBA playoffs five times in 7 seasons from 1985 to 1991, with the Celtics winning in 1985 and 1987, and the Pistons coming out on top en route to back-to-back Finals appearances in 1988 and their championship seasons of 1989 and 1990. Led by Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals the Celtics defeated the Pistons in 6 games to advance to the NBA Finals where they went on to beat the Lakers also in 6 games.[183] The rivalry between the Celtics and the New York Knicks stems from the location of the teams, both of which are in the NBA's Atlantic division. It is one of many rivalries between Boston and New York teams, most notably the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox in Major League Baseball. Boston and New York are also the only two original NBA franchises that have remained in the same city for the duration of their existence. The teams have played 512 games against each other during the regular season, with the Celtics winning 276 times. The two teams have also faced each other 61 times during the playoffs, with the Celtics winning 34 times.[184] The Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers are the two teams who have the most meetings in the NBA playoffs, playing each other in 22 series, of which the Celtics have won 15.[185] The 76ers are considered the Celtics' biggest rival in the Eastern Conference. The rivalry reached its peak when players Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain of the 76ers played each other from 1965 to 1968. Their play would result in the Celtics not winning every NBA Finals series in the 1960s when the 76ers won in 1967.[186] One of the most recent and unexpected rivalries that has been created between the Celtics is with the Washington Wizards. Although both teams had engaged in a fight in 1984,[187] the rivalry intensified during the 2015–16 season in a January regular season game after Jae Crowder was given a technical foul. Crowder then began to exchange words with then Wizards coach Randy Wittman. It began to escalate that off-season when the Celtics were trying to sign Al Horford. It was publicly reported that Jae Crowder emphasized that the Celtics beat the Wizards in all of their meetings that season and should sign with them rather than Washington. In their first meeting of the 2016–17 season, Wall hit Marcus Smart in the back-court when they were up by 20 late in the 4th quarter. Wall was hit with a Flagrant 2 foul and was promptly ejected. Smart immediately got back up and began to scuffle with Wall. Their words continued even after being separated with Wall telling Smart to meet him out back after the game. No incident was reported between the two following the game. In their next meeting, the Celtics won 117–108. However, after the game Wall and Crowder exchanged words in front of the Wizards bench. Crowder ended up trying to jab his finger at Wall's nose and Wall tried to fight back with a slap. Teammates and coaches from both sides had to step in and separate the two teams but the players continued to yell while entering their respective locker rooms. Police officers had to be on guard between the two locker rooms to ensure no further confrontation. Otto Porter is quoted as calling the Celtics as dirty. Isaiah Thomas replied \"If playing hard is dirty, then I guess we are a dirty team.\"[188] In their next game in January, the Wizards wore all black to enter the game. The notion was that it is similar to the attire of a funeral. Their decision worked as they defeated the Celtics 123–108. The two teams would go on to meet in the Conference Semifinals in the 2017 Playoffs. In Game 1, Markieff Morris landed on Horford's ankle after shooting a jumpshot. Morris sprained his ankle and had to miss the rest of the game which was a 123–111 loss. Morris believed that Horford did this intentionally. In Game 2, Morris retaliated by grabbing Horford by the waist and pushed him into the seats.[189] In Game 3, Kelly Olynyk set a hard screen on Kelly Oubre. Olynyk's shoulder hit Oubre in the chin causing him to drop to the floor. Oubre angrily rose and pushed Olynyk down onto the floor. Oubre was then assessed a flagrant 2 foul and was ejected while also being suspended for Game 4.[190] No significant altercations erupted in the rest of the seven-game series in which the Celtics would go on to win. The rivalry has since dissipated as the Celtics have retooled their roster but their match-ups are still seen as significant as they played on Christmas in 2017. The Boston Celtics and the Miami Heat developed an intense rivalry during the 2010s. The two teams were highlighted by their star trios in Boston's Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce whereas Miami had LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. They first met in the 2010 NBA Playoffs where Boston won the series in 5 games. They would then meet the following year where Miami would end up winning in 5 games. The teams would meet for the third straight year in the 2012 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite Boston holding a 3–2 lead, Miami would win the next 2 games to advance to the NBA Finals where they defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the 2020 NBA Bubble, the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics met in the 2020 Eastern Conference Finals where Miami won in 6 games and advanced to the NBA Finals where they were prevented Boston from meeting their longtime rival Los Angeles Lakers. Unfortunately, Miami lost in 6 games to the Los Angeles Lakers. They would meet in the 2022 Eastern Conference Finals where Boston finally beat the Miami Heat in 7 games. It was their first win against Miami since 2010. In the following year, the two met in the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite Miami taking a commanding a 3–0 lead, Boston won the next three games to send the series to 7 games. However, Miami won to avoid earning the distinction of blowing a 3–0 lead. They then met in the 2024 first round where Boston beat Miami in 5 games. List of the last five seasons completed by the Celtics. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Boston Celtics seasons. Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage The Celtics have won an NBA-record 18 championships.[191] Forty-eight members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame are connected to the Celtics,[192] and the franchise has retired 23 jersey numbers, more than any other American sports team.[193] As of December 2023, the Celtics have won more NBA regular season games than any other team.[194] 37 people were inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as players, 6 – as coaches, 6 – as contributors.[195] Additionally, Johnny Most and Mike Gorman were honored with the Hall of Fame's Curt Gowdy Media Award. Most was awarded in 1993 for his 37-year career as the Celtics radio announcer, while Gorman was awarded in 2021 for his 40-year career as the Celtics television announcer. Notes: FIBA, the body which governs international basketball, has selected two players associated with the Celtics to the FIBA Hall of Fame for contributions to international basketball. Roster Last transaction: December 26, 2024 The Celtics hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player is ostensibly either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[196] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. Bold denotes still active with the team. Italic denotes still active but not with the team. Points scored (regular season) (as of the end of the 2023–24 season)[217] Other statistics (regular season) (as of the end of the 2023–24 season)[217] There have been 18 head coaches in Celtics' history. Red Auerbach is the most successful franchise's head coach having won 9 NBA championships with the team. Celtics' legend Bill Russell took coaching duties from Auerbach and led them to 2 NBA championships while playing and coaching at the same time. The other two coaches that won 2 NBA titles with the team are Tom Heinsohn and K. C. Jones. Bill Fitch and Doc Rivers led the Celtics to 1 NBA championship apiece, as has current head coach Joe Mazzulla.[218] The Boston Celtics logo features a leprechaun spinning a basketball, named Lucky, originally depicted with a large basketball for a background. It was originally designed by Zang Auerbach, the brother of Celtics head coach Red Auerbach.[219] Through the 1995–96 season, the logo's only colors were green, white and black.[220] Then for the 1996–97 season, celebrating the club's 50th anniversary, the logo got a full-color treatment. Lucky's face and hands were both painted tan, while gold was included on the vest, bow tie and hat, as well as brown on the ball and shillelagh, and black on its pants and shoes.[221] The Celtics also have various alternative logos, with the most popular being a white shamrock with the letters \"Celtics\" above it, wrapped in a green circle, which has been used since the 1998–99 season. The alternate logo is based on logos used by the Celtics before they used the Zang Auerbach leprechaun. For much of its history, the shamrock was trimmed in gold, as seen in the old team warmup jackets. A new secondary logo, unveiled in 2014, featured a variation of the leprechaun logo, in silhouette form.[5][222] For much of their history, the Celtics wore green uniforms on the road and white uniforms at home. The basic template of the current Celtics' uniforms was formalized in the team's early years, and along the way they made a few adjustments in the lettering and stripes.[223] Among the more notable changes in the uniforms were the switch from serifed to sans-serif block lettering in 1968, the addition of names in 1972, and the incorporation of the three-leaf shamrock logo in 1998. While the white uniforms remained largely intact, the green uniforms have featured either the city name (1950s–1965; 2014–present) or the team name (1965–2014).[224] When Nike became the NBA's uniform provider in 2017, they decided to eliminate the \"home\" and \"away\" uniform designations. Thus the white Celtics uniforms became known as the \"Association\" uniforms while the green uniforms became the \"Icon\" uniforms. Both sets are now used regardless of home and road games.[4] In January 2017, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with General Electric where they became the \"exclusive Data and Analytics partner\" for the team. As part of the deal, GE agreed to pay the Celtics more than $7 million per year[225] to have the uniforms with a GE logo prominently placed on the left shoulder of jerseys in green and white. This was the first time a corporate logo were placed on the game uniforms.[226][227] Along with the GE logo, the Nike logo now emblazons the right shoulder of the Celtics' uniforms. In November 2020, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with Vistaprint who became the main jersey sponsor of the team.[228] In July 2024, Amica Mutual Insurance signed on as the team's jersey sponsor.[7] From 2005 to 2017, the Celtics wore alternate green uniforms with black lettering and trim featuring the word \"Boston\" on the front side. One noticeable difference in the alternate uniforms was the black panels with a green shamrock, reminiscent of the original Celtics uniforms worn in the late 1940s.[229] A gray uniform set was also used from 2014 to 2017. Dubbed \"Parquet Pride\", the uniforms featured sleeves (a prominent figure in Adidas' NBA uniforms), white letters with green trim, the silhouetted leprechaun logo on the shorts, the shamrock logo on the left leg, and a parquet-like pattern on the sides.[230] For 2017 and beyond, the Celtics will wear black \"Statement\" uniforms (labeled by Nike in reference to the league's third jerseys). The uniform features a black base with \"Celtics\" in green lettering and white trim, and other than a few changes in the striping scheme, the uniform remained essentially the same. Starting in 2020, the \"Statement\" uniform would feature the Air Jordan brand logo, a feature previously exclusive to the Charlotte Hornets uniforms.[231] Between 2006 and 2017, the Celtics wore special St. Patrick's Day uniforms. The initial uniforms were worn from 2006 to 2013 and it strongly resembled their regular green uniforms save for gold and white trim and the city name in front.[232] For 2014 and 2015, the uniforms were sleeved, replaced the city name in front in favor of the team name, and now resembled their green/black alternates.[233] In 2016 and 2017, the uniforms were again sleeveless and featured the city name in front, but kept the previous striping. During the NBA Europe Live Tour prior to the 2007–08 season, the Celtics used the alternate road jerseys in their game against the Toronto Raptors in Rome, except that the words \"Boston\" on the front side of the jersey and the shamrock on the shorts and on the reverse side of the jersey contained the green, white and red tricolors of the Italian flag. In the second game in London, the regular road jerseys featured a patch containing the Union Jack. At the 2008–09 season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Celtics wore a modified version of their home uniforms, accented with gold, to commemorate last season's championship team. The Celtics have also worn special edition Christmas Day uniforms since the 2008–09 season. For the first four games, they wore their regular green uniforms modified with the NBA logo inside a snowflake. Then in the 2012–13 season, they wore monochrome uniforms with green lettering trimmed in white. For the 2016–17 season, the Celtics wore a special green uniform with a more ornate script lettering, but without the additional striping. Starting with the 2017–18 season, the Celtics wore special edition \"City\" uniforms designed by Nike. Their first \"City\" uniforms were in gray and featured a pattern of the parquet floor throughout, a green shamrock with white trim on the left leg, green letters with white trim, Red Auerbach's signature near the uniform tag, and a portion of the 2008 championship banner on the beltline.[234] For the 2018–19 season, the Celtics wore white \"City\" uniforms with green letters and shamrocks trimmed in gold. It also has Red Auerbach's signature near the uniform tag and a gold-trimmed alternate Celtics logo on the beltline.[235][236] In addition, the Celtics wore an \"Earned\" edition uniform exclusive only to the 16 teams that made the 2018 NBA playoffs. Their rendition is a palette swap of the \"City\" uniforms with a green base and gold letters and shamrocks with white trim. Both uniforms were inspired by the team's warmup jackets they wore from the 1950s until 1998, which contained a brighter gold trim.[237] The Celtics' \"City\" uniform for the 2019–20 season featured a green base and a stylized \"Boston\" wordmark and numbers in gold with black trim. A Celtic knot in the shape of a shamrock adorn the beltline.[238] The 2020–21 Celtics' \"City\" uniform was patterned after the 17 championship banners that adorn the TD Garden rafters. The uniform, which is white with thick green stripes, features the full name in Futura Condensed stacked in front, and Red Auerbach's signature and quote \"The Boston Celtics are not a basketball team. They're a way of life.\" appears above the manufacturer's tag.[239] The Celtics also released a second \"Earned\" uniform after qualifying in the 2020 NBA playoffs; this design features a dark green base with Celtic and lime green striping, and the letters were rendered in Celtic green with white trim.[240] The Celtics' green \"City\" uniform for the 2021–22 season was a mix of previous uniform designs. The neck and arm striping was taken from their current uniforms. The green lettering with white drop shadows was a nod to the 1949 uniform design. The gray triangles on the shorts represented the franchise's initial uniforms; the left side contained the team's 75th anniversary emblem, while the right side contained a green-and-white version of the Red Auerbach memorial shamrock used in the 2006–07 season. Contrasting nameplates on the back were inspired by the warmup jackets the team used for much of its history, and the original \"jumping leprechaun\" logo from the 1960s was added to the waist. Retired numbers, the Auerbach signature and quotation (see 2021 \"City\" uniform), and 17 shamrocks representing each championship season, surrounded the jock tag.[241] The 2022–23 \"City\" uniform served as a memorial to Bill Russell, who died on July 31. The uniform is dark green with metallic gold and black accents, and has the \"Celtics\" wordmark inspired by the Slade's Bar & Grill restaurant once owned by Russell. The black stripes contained 11 gold diamonds on each side, commemorating each of Russell's championships, and also featured a grayscale pattern of the parquet floor. The waistband contained Russell's jersey no. 6 surrounded by the 11 gold diamonds.[242] The \"City\" uniform in the 2023–24 season featured a nod to the origins of the game of basketball. The white-based design featured dark green letters and brown trim in reference to traditional maker's marks from Boston's history of furniture makers, along with wood grain accents to reference the peach baskets first used in the game.[243] In another first, the Celtics unveiled an alternate court specific to the 2023 NBA in-season tournament. The design, which is based on the \"City\" uniform, featured a mostly green-painted maple court with a brown strip along the free throw lanes. The silhouette of the NBA Cup is situated along the free throw lanes, and the actual trophy is painted at center court along with the \"BOSTON\" wordmark.[244] For the 2024–25 \"City\" uniform, the Celtics built upon last season's \"City\" uniform and focused on continuous evolution of the game of basketball. The black-based uniform featured \"Action green\" (neon green) letters and striping, along with futuristic-style numbers. [245] During the 2006–07 season, the Celtics wore a commemorative patch of a black shamrock with the nickname \"Red\" in green letters on the right top of the jersey in remembrance of Red Auerbach, who died shortly prior to the beginning of the season.[246] The team has honored deceased members of the Celtics family with a commemorative black band on the left shoulder strap of the jersey. It has been featured thirteen times to date: Walter Brown (1964–65), Bob Schmertz (1975–76), Joan Cohen (1989–90), Johnny Most (1992–93), Reggie Lewis (1993–94), Dorothy Auerbach (2000–01), Dennis Johnson (2006–07),[246] Jim Loscutoff (2015–16), Jo Jo White (2017–18), John Havlicek (2018–19), Tom Heinsohn, and K. C. Jones (both 2020–21), Sam Jones (2021–22), and Bill Walton (2023–24). During the 2019–20 season, the Celtics wore a black band in honor of two people who had never been part of the Celtics organization; former NBA commissioner David Stern and former Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant. The Celtics have also worn a black band for reasons not directly related to the franchise, such as the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, and the death of Isaiah Thomas' younger sister during the 2017 NBA playoffs. In the 2022–23 season, the Celtics joined the rest of the NBA in wearing the black no. 6 patch in memory of Bill Russell.[247] The team also had the tradition of wearing black sneakers through most of their history. According to legend, Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach had a problem with the white sneakers, claiming that the white sneakers can easily get dirty; hence starting a long tradition with the black sneakers. In the early 1970s, the Celtics changed their sneaker color to green, but by 1985, returned to the customary black due to the difficulty of producing the right shade of Celtic green.[248] Prior to the 2003–04 season, then-Celtics general manager Danny Ainge and captain Paul Pierce suggested wearing white sneakers, in due part to a growing number of teams wearing black sneakers. Ainge gladly accepted and the white sneakers have remained since on home games. They still wore the black sneakers on away games, and brought them back for all home games during the 2004 NBA playoffs, and in one home game during the 2005 NBA playoffs. In the 2008–09 season, they wore white sneakers with green and gold accents while wearing their St. Patrick's Day jerseys on the road. Most recently, when the Celtics play on Christmas Day, they wore white or green sneakers with red and gold accents.[249] Since the 2009–10 season, the NBA relaxed its rules on specified sneaker colors, and Celtics players are now seen wearing custom-made and personalized sneakers at home and on the road, although for the most part they wear either green, white or black sneakers. The Celtics were the only team to wear warmup jackets with the player names on the back. During the 1980s, this style was dominant in most NBA warmup jackets, but by the late 1990s, this style gradually declined. The Celtics, however, kept the design in keeping with tradition, before discontinuing the practice after the 2011–12 season in favor of a templated jacket design common to all 30 teams. NBC Sports Boston is the Boston Celtics' main television outlet, having aired its games since 1981 when the station was known as PRISM New England. In 1983, it rebranded as SportsChannel New England. Like all the other SportsChannel networks, the New England channel was rebranded as Fox Sports New England when former owner Cablevision entered into a partnership with Liberty Media and News Corporation in 1998. Comcast purchased Cablevision's original network stake in 2001, then acquired the remaining stake in what was now FSN New England in 2007 and rebranded the network as Comcast SportsNet New England. In 2017, all CSN networks (including CSN New England) were renamed as NBC Sports Regional Networks in reference to Comcast's current ownership of NBCUniversal. As of the 2024–25 season, Drew Carter serves as the television play-by-play announcer with Brian Scalabrine as an analyst. All Celtics games are heard on radio through Beasley Broadcast Group's WBZ-FM (98.5, otherwise branded as \"The Sports Hub\"), with play-by-play from Sean Grande and color commentary from Cedric Maxwell, a deal in place since the 2013–14 season.[250] It is carried on stations in 5 of the 6 New England States via the Boston Celtics Radio Network. Long-time announcers Johnny Most and Mike Gorman have won the Curt Gowdy Media Award for their outstanding work as broadcasters. Most was the team's radio announcer from 1953 to 1990, and Gorman served as the television announcer from 1981 to 2024. *Sale not approved by NBA[254]",

                "title": "Why don't we pronounce the Boston Celtics with a hard 'C'?",
                "content": "By Conor Ryan Bostonians have a notorious track record of forging their own path when it comes to pronunciations and labels. The accent sure doesn’t do us any favors, most notably when adding R’s that shouldn’t be there onto the end of words. And we’re also at the epicenter of a region that has christened new terms such as “bubblah,” “frappe,” “jimmies,” “packie,” and “parlor.” Thankfully, though, our trademark drawl doesn’t severely reshuffle our pronunciation of the Red Sox, Patriots, Bruins, or Celtics. But what about the start of the word “Celtics”? Since Walter A. Brown first founded the Celtics in 1946, we’ve always referred to them as the “Sel-tics,” following a similar script as another sports franchise in Celtic F.C. in Glasgow. The avenue of pronunciation has been ingrained in Bostonians since the days of Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, and Tommy Heinsohn. But anyone familiar with the culture rooted in the Emerald Isle knows that the “Seltic” diction more or less stands as an outlier, especially beyond the realm of sports. So why is there a discrepancy in terms of the pronunciation of “Celtic” — and are the Boston “Seltics” just another example of Bostonians (and Glasgow residents) taking an established linguistic practice and tossing it out the window? To seek some clarity on which pronunciation is correct, we spoke with professor Catherine McKenna, the Margaret Brooks Robinson Professor of Celtic Languages and Literatures at Harvard University. The verdict? “It’s just a distinction,” she said. “You could say in a sense that the K- sound is more correct. But it’s not a big deal.” In terms of basic English phonology, the “Keltic” method stands as a deviation from the standard pronunciation of other English words that begin with “ce” — with words like ceiling, cereal, and cement all beginning with that “soft” C sound. But the origins of the word “Celtic” were set in the ground long before English took hold, as McKenna notes. “In academia, we say ‘Keltic,’ because we first get the word — it first occurs in Greek, and it’s spelled with a Kappa, with a K,” she said. “So we know they said Keltoi, and then we get it from Julius Caesar, spelled with a C, but we know that Latin at that point would have said Celtae (with a hard C pronunciation). “So that’s the way it is. That’s the name. We also know that the Celtic languages always use C to spell the ‘Kuh’ sound, not a ‘Sa’ sound. So that takes care of, yes, technically, ‘Keltic’ is correct.” Even though both the Greek Keltoi and Latin Celtae might appear different, Merriam-Webster notes in their breakdown on the differences between the “Celtic” pronunciation that it wasn’t until the Middle Ages that the letter C in Latin started to be pronounced before vowels as the combination \\ts\\. Before that, they stuck with that hard C sound. However, things started to change when the Celts resurfaced in history, especially as other languages started to take hold across the globe. “But what happens is, we know about Celts in ancient times from the fifth century BC, right through sort of the second or third century,” McKenna explained. “And then they kind of disappear from history until the 18th century. And when the idea of ‘Keltic’ or ‘Seltic’ comes back, it comes back strong, first of all, in France. So they write C-E-L-T-I-Q-U-E, because that’s how you would pronounce it in French. “So then that gets picked up in English — in England and Ireland and Scotland — and everybody is saying ‘Seltic,’ right? So that’s what gets picked up in Glasgow. Celtic (F.C.) goes back to the late 19th century … And then there’s a New York Celtics team that dies out and then Boston sort of picks up that name because of the Irish heritage and so on. And by that time, ‘Seltic’ is really common.” That resurfacing of the “Celtic” word in French offered up the deviation that we now find in basketball and soccer. As is the case with the pronunciation of French painter Paul Cézanne (say-ZAN) or the classic phrase “c’est la vie,” those start with the soft C, rather than the hard “Kuh” sound. At one point, the “Seltic” pronunciation was viewed as the established pronunciation, as noted by Merriam-Webster. This shift in the pronunciation of Celt is fully evinced when comparing H. W. Fowler’s 1926 Dictionary of Modern English with Robert Burchfield’s 1996 revised edition. Here’s what Fowler had to say about Celt(ic): “The spelling C-, & the pronunciation s-, are the established ones, & no useful purpose seems to be served by the substitution of k-.” Decades later, Burchfield observes a different trend: “Except for the football club Celtic (in Glasgow), which is pronounced [SEL-tik], both Celt and Celtic are pronounced with initial \\k\\ in standard English.” Ultimately, the “Keltic” pronunciation has resurfaced in recent times as language historians opted for the word to better reflect its origins in Greek and Classical Latin. But there is no major gaffe or faux pas found in opting for the French-based, “Seltic” pronunciation that was commonly accepted for centuries. As McKenna notes, “it’s not a big deal.” So we’ve broken down the origin of the word “Celtic” and its different pronunciations. But what about the origin of the Boston Celtics’ name itself? Referencing former Boston Herald Traveler sportswriter George Sullivan’s comprehensive account of the Celtics’ first 50 years, Richard Johnson — curator of The Sports Museum — revealed that Walter Brown didn’t exactly need to delve very deep for inspiration. “[Sullivan] talked to Howie McHugh, who was the first publicist of the team. And the quote from Howie, who was there at the time — Walter Brown said, ‘Wait, I’ve got it: The Celtics. We’ll call them the Boston Celtics. The name has a great basketball tradition. And Boston is full of Irishmen. Yes, that’s it. We’ll put them in green uniforms and call them the Boston Celtics.’” It shouldn’t come as much surprise that Brown honed in on the Irish-American populace in Boston. But as McKenna noted earlier, the Celtics also paid homage to another basketball club when it came to their appointed moniker. “Celtics also refers to the team, the Original Celtics, who were a team that played out of New York City in the barnstorming days of professional basketball,” Johnson noted. “So for once, we appropriated something from New York from a sporting standpoint instead of it being the other way around. “So they named their team both as a practical measure — because of this being a very Irish-American hotbed, and then the fact that there was a team not too long before that, probably 20 years before the founding of the Celtics, that were the Original Celtics. So it worked.” Well, that answers that. As for why Boston’s baseball team is called the “Red Sox” instead of the “Red Socks”? Well, that’s a Wickedpedia piece for another day.

I'll give you a moment. Paige announced the news during Monday's episode of her and Hannah Berner's podcast Giggly Squad (via Page Six), saying “Craig and I have decided to no longer be together.” She added that talking about the situation was “weird,” and said “I love him, I think he loves me. I think we will remain friends. No one did anything. It wasn’t a bad thing. I think we both were just being really mature and saying what we want and what we didn’t want, and I think that’s extremely powerful to be able to voice how you’re feeling in real time and what you want for your future.” “I have so much love and respect for Craig,” she continued. “I think he is one of the best people I’ve met in my entire life. I will remain the biggest fan for him and want the best for him, and he truly will get the best, because he is the best. But, with that said, I think it is the right decision for both of us.” Paige said the breakup was “very sad” and “awkward” and shut down speculation that it was for ratings, saying “The network has power, but they don’t have that much power. So, that was not a real thing. Rumors of us breaking up months ago again, also, not a real thing.” She added, “He’s definitely the best boyfriend I’ve ever had, like, I can truly say that. He was a great boyfriend, and he did everything correct, and he never made me feel insecure or anything like that, so it almost is harder when no one’s done anything to be mad about, and that’s hard.” Denzel Washington's Net Worth?

                "title": "Why Did Paige DeSorbo & Craig Conover Breakup? Details - Betches",
                "content": "Folks, it looks like where there’s a little Summer House smoke, there might also be a fire. Remember those relentless Paige and Craig break-up rumors that were swirling all summer? The ones saying their long-distance relaysh was causing secret fighting?? To be fair to Paige, if I was paying $8,500 in rent every single month, I’d consider that a pretty good reason to stay in my NYC apartment 24/7 and get my money’s worth, too. The breakup rumors also said that Paige wasn’t ready to be a wife right now, but Craig pretty quickly clapped back in the press that he was okay with that since he was focusing on his own businesses, too (sorry, Kyle, Spritz Society is still happening). The trailer for season 9 of Summer House certainly did not help things when Ciara was seen talking with Paige about her boyfriend’s concerning “hater energy” and Paige was later pictured crying in bed about losing “everything.” But here’s the kicker: at Fan Fest this fall, Amanda and Kyle swore up and down Paige and Craig were solid as ever, and they were definitely not secretly on the rocks this whole time, only waiting to spill the tea until closer to the season aired to keep views up. Now it kind of seems like…that’s exactly what happened?!? Because, color me shocked, Paige and Craig broke up?! Let’s unpack. Image Credit: Getty Images “Craig and I have decided to no longer be together.” Um, wow, so I guess it’s as simple as that? Paige elaborated she “started dating Craig when [she] was 29, [she’s] 32 now, and your 30s for women really are transformative. And you change a lot and you grow a lot.” Apparently, the last few years have been big years for growth for Craig as well and unfortunately “the direction that [their] lives are going in that we didn’t foresee or whatever” isn’t aligned, though Paige will remain Craig’s “biggest fan” as he “gets the best” out of life, now without her. If you’re worried Craig did something “fucked up” (Hannah’s words), that’s far from the truth. Paige has “so much love and respect” for Craig, who is “one of the best people [she] met in her entire life” who “truly helped her grow” and mature into a more “confident” person. Paige even crowned Craig “the best boyfriend [she] ever had.” Essentially, this is the classic nobody did anything wrong, nothing to see here, move along nosey nellies vibe. Perhaps Paige will get more vulnerable on Summer House in bed with her besties? Still, even though this is the “right decision for both of [them],” Paige admits it’s a very sad one. Image Credit: Getty Images According to Paige, absolutely not, because “no one can tell [her] what do. The network has power, but not that much power.” Alright, then! But the timeline here may, in fact, cause some conspiracy theorist fans (such as myself) to get their tin hats on about whether there was some slight misleading going on in the media. Amanda and Kyle addressed the rumor that Paige and Craig were barely hanging for the sake of the show at Fan Fest on November 23, 2024, literally laughing off the notion that there were any issues between the couple. Also in November 2024, Craig reinforced their healthy relationship status regardless of the distance. On December 9, Craig doubled down that he had “no idea” where the breakup rumors were coming from because they were “together like every week.” I know, I know, things can change quickly, but how did they go from right as rain to a total dealbreaker that quickly? As Paige tells it, this sad conclusion has been brewing for at least a little bit of time now, since they decided to give their “family and friends” “private time” to digest the news before sharing it publicly. I guess if Paige says managing their relationship to please the press wasn’t “a real thing,” the Gigglers kinda just have to take her word for it. © 2024 Betches All rights reserved.",

Paige DeSorbo and Craig Conover have broken up after three years of dating. The Summer House star announced their shocking split on this morning’s episode of her Giggly Squad podcast, which she shares with her former co-star Hannah Berner. “Craig and I have decided to no longer be together,” DeSorbo shared at the start of the podcast episode. “And I know I said I would never cry on the internet but I know it’s OK if I cry on the pod. I feel like that’s OK.” DeSorbo said the situation was “weird,” but promised there was no smoking gun that led to the end of their relationship. “I love him. I think he loves me. I think we will remain friends. No one did anything. I don’t think it was a bad thing,” she said. “I think we both were being really mature and saying what we want and what we didn’t want. I think that’s extremely powerful to be able to voice how you’re feeling in real time and what you want for your future.” DeSorbo also shut down rumors claiming Bravo forced them to keep their split quiet until their respective shows began airing, noting that they simply wanted time to deal with things in private with their friends and family. “No one can tell me what to do,” she insisted. “The network has power but they don’t have that much power. So that was not a real thing. Rumors of us breaking up months ago, again, also not a real thing.” The podcast host — who said Conover was “the best boyfriend I’ve ever had” — felt that now was an “appropriate” time to let everyone know they had broken things off. “I have so much love and respect for Craig. I think he is one of the best people I’ve ever met in my entire life. I will remain the biggest fan of him and want the best for him and he truly will get the best because he is the best,” she said. “But with that said, I think it was just the right decision for both of us moving forward in our lives and the direction our lives are going in that we didn’t foresee.” DeSorbo and Conover began dating in 2021 after meeting in Season 1 of Winter House, and their relationship has since aired in both Southern Charm and Summer House. Questions surrounding their future often came up with DeSorbo living in New York City and Conover living in Charleston. However, Conover told DECIDER earlier this month that they were doing “great” and that they liked “representing long distance relationships on television.” “I think, in TV, people have short memories, so they’re like, ‘They’re just happy now. It must be easy.’ It’s like, ‘Well, no, we’re just like any other couple out there,'” Conover said at the time. “And I think that’s why sometimes fans and viewers are a little disappointed that they don’t get that next chapter right away. But it’s because we’re trying to make it, you know, last and work.” This story has been shared 2,402 times. 2,402 This story has been shared 2,083 times. 2,083 This story has been shared 1,882 times. 1,882 This story has been shared 515 times. 515 This story has been shared 473 times. 473 This story has been shared 417 times. 417 This story has been shared 392 times. 392 This story has been shared 365 times. 365 This story has been shared 313 times. 313 This story has been shared 311 times. 311 This story has been shared 305 times. 305 This story has been shared 303 times. 303 This story has been shared 242 times. 242 This story has been shared 242 times. 242 This story has been shared 238 times. 238",

                "content": "James Earl Carter Jr. (October 1, 1924 – December 29, 2024) was an American politician and humanitarian who served as the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. A member of the Democratic Party, Carter previously served in the Georgia State Senate from 1963 to 1967 and as the 76th governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975. He was the longest-lived president in U.S. history and the first to live to 100 years. Born and raised in Plains, Georgia, Carter graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946 and joined the U.S. Navy's submarine service. He returned home after his military service and revived his family's peanut-growing business. Carter opposed racial segregation, supported the growing civil rights movement, and became an activist within the Democratic Party. Carter served in the Georgia State Senate from 1963 to 1967 and then as Governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975. As a dark-horse candidate not well known outside Georgia, he won the Democratic nomination and narrowly defeated the incumbent president, Gerald Ford of the Republican Party, in the 1976 presidential election. Carter was the first president elected to represent a state from the Deep South since Zachary Taylor in 1848. Carter pardoned all Vietnam War draft evaders on his second day in office. He created a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. Carter successfully pursued the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, and the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. He also confronted stagflation. His administration established the U.S. Department of Energy and the Department of Education. He was the only president to serve a full term without appointing a justice to the Supreme Court. The end of his presidency was marked by the Iran hostage crisis, an energy crisis, the Three Mile Island accident, the Nicaraguan Revolution, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In response to the invasion, Carter escalated the Cold War by ending détente, imposing a grain embargo against the Soviets, enunciating the Carter Doctrine, and leading the multinational boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Carter defeated challenger Ted Kennedy in the 1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries but lost the general election in a landslide to Ronald Reagan, the Republican nominee. After leaving the presidency, Carter established the Carter Center to promote and expand human rights, and received a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work in relation to it. He traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections, and further the eradication of infectious diseases. Carter was a key figure in the nonprofit housing organization Habitat for Humanity. He also wrote numerous books, ranging from political memoirs to poetry, while continuing to comment on global affairs, with two of his books being on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Polls of historians and political scientists generally rank Carter as a below-average president. Scholars and the public more favorably view his post-presidency, which was the longest in U.S. history. James Earl Carter Jr. was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, at the Wise Sanitarium, where his mother worked as a registered nurse.[1] Carter thus became the first American president born in a hospital.[2] He was the eldest child of Bessie Lillian Gordy and James Earl Carter Sr., and a descendant of English immigrant Thomas Carter, who settled in the Colony of Virginia in 1635.[3][4] In Georgia, numerous generations of Carters worked as cotton farmers.[5] Plains was a boomtown of 600 people at the time of Carter's birth. His father was a successful local businessman who ran a general store and was an investor in farmland.[6] Carter's father had previously served as a reserve second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps during World War I.[6] During Carter's infancy, his family moved several times, settling on a dirt road in nearby Archery, which was almost entirely populated by impoverished African American families.[2][7] His family eventually had three more children, Gloria, Ruth, and Billy.[8] Carter got along well with his parents, even though his mother was often absent during his childhood, since she worked long hours, and although his father was staunchly pro-segregation, he allowed Jimmy to befriend the black farmhands' children.[9] Carter was an enterprising teenager who was given his own acre of Earl's farmland, where he grew, packaged, and sold peanuts.[10] Carter also rented out a section of tenant housing that he had purchased.[2] Carter attended Plains High School from 1937 to 1941, graduating from the eleventh grade, since the school did not have a twelfth grade.[11] By that time, Archery and Plains had been impoverished by the Great Depression, but the family benefited from New Deal farming subsidies, and Carter's father took a position as a community leader.[10][12] Carter was a diligent student with a fondness for reading.[13] A popular anecdote holds that he was passed over for valedictorian after he and his friends skipped school to venture downtown in a hot rod. Carter's truancy was mentioned in a local newspaper, although it is not clear he would have otherwise been valedictorian.[14] As an adolescent, Carter played on the Plains High School basketball team, and also joined Future Farmers of America, which helped him develop a lifelong interest in woodworking.[14] Carter had long dreamed of attending the United States Naval Academy.[10] In 1941, he started undergraduate coursework in engineering at Georgia Southwestern College in nearby Americus, Georgia.[15] The next year, Carter transferred to the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, where civil rights icon Blake Van Leer was president.[16] While at Georgia Tech, Carter took part in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps.[17] In 1943, he received an appointment to the Naval Academy from U.S. Representative Stephen Pace, and Carter graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1946.[18][17] He was a good student, but was seen as reserved and quiet, in contrast to the academy's culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen.[19] While at the Academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith, a friend of his sister Ruth.[20] The two wed shortly after his graduation in 1946, and were married until her death on November 19, 2023.[21][22] Carter was a sprint football player for the Navy Midshipmen.[23] He graduated 60th out of 821 midshipmen in the class of 1947[a] with a Bachelor of Science degree and was commissioned as an ensign.[25] From 1946 to 1953, the Carters lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York, and California, during his deployments in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.[26] In 1948, Carter began officer training for submarine duty and served aboard USS Pomfret.[27] Carter was promoted to lieutenant junior grade in 1949, and his service aboard Pomfret included a simulated war patrol to the western Pacific and Chinese coast from January to March of that year.[28] In 1951, Carter was assigned to the diesel/electric USS K-1 (SSK-1), qualified for command, and served in several positions, to include executive officer.[29] In 1952, Carter began an association with the Navy's fledgling nuclear submarine program, led by then-Captain Hyman G. Rickover.[30] Rickover had high standards and demands for his men and machines, and Carter later said that, next to his parents, Rickover had the greatest influence on his life.[31] Carter was sent to the Naval Reactors Branch of the Atomic Energy Commission in Washington, D.C., for three-month temporary duty, while Rosalynn moved with their children to Schenectady, New York.[32] On December 12, 1952, an accident with the experimental NRX reactor at Atomic Energy of Canada's Chalk River Laboratories caused a partial meltdown, resulting in millions of liters of radioactive water flooding the reactor building's basement. This left the reactor's core ruined.[33] Carter was ordered to Chalk River to lead a U.S. maintenance crew that joined other American and Canadian service personnel to assist in the shutdown of the reactor.[34] The painstaking process required each team member to don protective gear and be lowered individually into the reactor for 90 seconds at a time, limiting their exposure to radioactivity while they disassembled the crippled reactor. When Carter was lowered in, his job was simply to turn a single screw.[35] During and after his presidency, Carter said that his experience at Chalk River had shaped his views on atomic energy and led him to cease the development of a neutron bomb.[36] In March 1953, Carter began a six-month course in nuclear power plant operation at Union College in Schenectady.[26] His intent was to eventually work aboard USS Seawolf, which was intended to be the second U.S. nuclear submarine.[37] His plans changed when his father died of pancreatic cancer in July, two months before construction of Seawolf began, and Carter obtained a release from active duty so he could take over the family peanut business.[38][39] Deciding to leave Schenectady proved difficult, as Rosalynn had grown comfortable with their life there.[40][41] She later said that returning to small-town life in Plains seemed \"a monumental step backward.\"[42] Carter left active duty on October 9, 1953.[43][44] He served in the inactive Navy Reserve until 1961 and left the service with the rank of lieutenant.[45] Carter's awards include the American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, China Service Medal, and National Defense Service Medal.[46] As a submarine officer, he also earned the \"dolphin\" badge.[47] After debt settlements and division of his father's estate among its heirs, Jimmy inherited comparatively little.[48] For a year, he, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in public housing in Plains.[b] Carter was knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, and he set out to expand the family's peanut-growing business.[50] Transitioning from the Navy to farming was difficult as his first-year harvest failed due to a drought, and Carter had to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat.[51] Meanwhile, he took classes and studied agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business's books.[52] Though they barely broke even the first year, the Carters grew the business and became quite successful.[49][52] As racial tension inflamed in Plains by the 1954 Supreme Court of the United States ruling in Brown v. Board of Education,[53] Carter favored racial tolerance and integration but often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies. By 1961, Carter began to speak more prominently of integration as a member of the Baptist Church and chairman of the Sumter County school board.[54][55] In 1962, he announced his campaign for an open Georgia State Senate seat 15 days before the election.[56] Rosalynn, who had an instinct for politics and organization, was instrumental to his campaign. While early counting of the ballots showed Carter trailing his opponent, Homer Moore, this was later proven to be the result of fraudulent voting. The fraud was found to have been orchestrated by Joe Hurst, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Quitman County.[56] Carter challenged the election result, which was confirmed fraudulent in an investigation. Following this, another election was held, in which Carter won against Moore as the sole Democratic candidate, with a vote margin of 3,013 to 2,182.[57] The civil rights movement was well underway when Carter took office. He and his family had become staunch John F. Kennedy supporters. Carter remained relatively quiet on the issue at first, even as it polarized much of the county, to avoid alienating his segregationist colleagues. Carter did speak up on a few divisive issues, giving speeches against literacy tests and against an amendment to the Georgia Constitution that he felt implied a compulsion to practice religion.[58] Carter entered the state Democratic Executive Committee two years into office, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules. He became the chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission, which oversaw the disbursement of federal and state grants for projects such as historic site restoration.[59] When Bo Callaway was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1964, Carter immediately began planning to challenge him. The two had previously clashed over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college program by the state, and Carter saw Callaway—who had switched to the Republican Party—as a rival who represented aspects of politics he despised.[60] Carter was reelected to a second two-year term in the state Senate,[61] where he chaired its Education Committee and sat on the Appropriations Committee toward the end of the term. He contributed to a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern State University a four-year program. He leveraged his regional planning work, giving speeches around the district to make himself more visible to potential voters. On the last day of the term, Carter announced his candidacy for the House of Representatives.[62] Callaway decided to run for governor instead;[63] Carter changed his mind, deciding to run for governor too.[64] In the 1966 gubernatorial election, Carter ran against liberal former governor Ellis Arnall and conservative segregationist Lester Maddox in the Democratic primary. In a press conference, he described his ideology as \"Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road ... I believe I am a more complicated person than that.\"[65] He lost the primary but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force Arnall into a runoff election with Maddox, who defeated Arnall.[66] In the general election, Republican nominee Callaway won a plurality of the vote but less than a majority, allowing the Democratic-majority Georgia House of Representatives to elect Maddox as governor.[66] This resulted in a victorious Maddox, whose victory—due to his segregationist stance—was seen as the worst outcome for the indebted Carter.[66] Carter returned to his agriculture business, carefully planning his next campaign. This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter; he declared himself a born again Christian, and his last child, Amy, was born during this time.[67][68] In the 1970 gubernatorial election, liberal former governor Carl Sanders became Carter's main opponent in the Democratic primary. Carter ran a more modern campaign, employing printed graphics and statistical analysis. Responding to polls, he leaned more conservative than before, positioning himself as a populist and criticizing Sanders for both his wealth and perceived links to the national Democratic Party. He also accused Sanders of corruption, but when pressed by the media, he did not provide evidence.[69][70] Throughout his campaign, Carter sought both the black vote and the votes of those who had supported prominent Alabama segregationist George Wallace. While he met with black figures such as Martin Luther King Sr. and Andrew Young and visited many black-owned businesses, he also praised Wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in Georgia. Carter's appeal to racism became more blatant over time, with his senior campaign aides handing out a photograph of Sanders celebrating with Black basketball players.[69][70] Carter came ahead of Sanders in the first ballot by 49 percent to 38 percent in September, leading to a runoff election. The subsequent campaign was even more bitter; despite his early support for civil rights, Carter's appeal to racism grew, and he criticized Sanders for supporting Martin Luther King Jr. Carter won the runoff election with 60 percent of the vote and won the general election against Republican nominee Hal Suit. Once elected, Carter changed his tone and began to speak against Georgia's racist politics. Leroy Johnson, a black state senator, voiced his support for Carter: \"I understand why he ran that kind of ultra-conservative campaign. I don't believe you can win this state without being a racist.\"[69] Carter was sworn in as the 76th governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971. In his inaugural speech, he declared that \"the time for racial discrimination is over\",[71] shocking the crowd and causing many of the segregationists who had supported him during the race to feel betrayed. Carter was reluctant to engage with his fellow politicians, making him unpopular with the legislature.[72][73] He expanded the governor's authority by introducing a reorganization plan submitted in January 1972. Despite initially having a cool reception in the legislature, the plan passed at midnight on the last day of the session.[74] Carter merged about 300 state agencies into 22, although it is disputed whether that saved the state money.[75] On July 8, 1971, during an appearance in Columbus, Georgia, he stated his intention to establish a Georgia Human Rights Council to help solve issues ahead of any potential violence.[76] In a news conference on July 13, 1971, Carter announced that he had ordered department heads to reduce spending to prevent a $57 million deficit by the end of the 1972 fiscal year, specifying that each state department would be affected and estimating that 5 percent over government revenue would be lost if state departments continued to fully use allocated funds.[77] On January 13, 1972, he requested that the state legislature fund an early childhood development program along with prison reform programs and $48 million (equivalent to $270 million in 2023) in paid taxes for nearly all state employees.[78] On March 1, 1972, Carter said he might call a special session of the general assembly if the Justice Department opted to turn down any reapportionment plans by either the House or Senate.[79] He pushed several reforms through the legislature, providing equal state aid to schools in Georgia's wealthy and poor areas, setting up community centers for mentally disabled children, and increasing educational programs for convicts. Under this program, all such appointments were based on merit rather than political influence.[80][81] In one of his more controversial decisions, he vetoed a plan to build a dam on Georgia's Flint River, which attracted the attention of environmentalists nationwide.[82][83] Civil rights were a high priority for Carter, who added black state employees and portraits of three prominent black Georgians to the capitol building: Martin Luther King Jr., Lucy Craft Laney, and Henry McNeal Turner. This angered the Ku Klux Klan.[83] He favored a constitutional amendment to ban busing for the purpose of expediting integration in schools on a televised joint appearance with Florida governor Reubin Askew on January 31, 1973,[84] and co-sponsored an anti-busing resolution with Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference.[85][86] After the U.S. Supreme Court threw out Georgia's death penalty statute in Furman v. Georgia (1972), Carter signed a revised death-penalty statute that addressed the court's objections, thus reintroducing the practice in the state. He later regretted endorsing the death penalty, saying, \"I didn't see the injustice of it as I do now.\"[87] Ineligible for reelection, Carter looked toward a potential presidential run and engaged in national politics. He was named to several southern planning commissions and was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, where liberal U.S. Senator George McGovern was the likely nominee. Carter tried to ingratiate himself with the conservative and anti-McGovern voters. He was fairly obscure at the time, and his attempt at triangulation failed; the 1972 Democratic ticket was McGovern and senator Thomas Eagleton.[88][c] On August 3, Carter met with Wallace in Birmingham, Alabama, to discuss preventing the Democrats from losing in a landslide,[90] but they did.[91] Carter regularly met with his fledgling campaign staff and decided to begin putting a presidential bid for 1976 together. He tried unsuccessfully to become chairman of the National Governors Association to boost his visibility. On David Rockefeller's endorsement, he was named to the Trilateral Commission in April 1973. The next year, he was named chairman of both the Democratic National Committee's congressional and gubernatorial campaigns.[92] In May 1973, Carter warned his party against politicizing the Watergate scandal,[93] which he attributed to president Richard Nixon's isolation from Americans and secretive decision-making.[94] On December 12, 1974, Carter announced his presidential campaign at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. His speech contained themes of domestic inequality, optimism, and change.[95][96] Upon his entrance in the Democratic primaries, he was competing against sixteen other candidates, and was considered to have little chance against the more nationally known politicians such as Wallace.[97] His name recognition was very low, and his opponents derisively asked \"Jimmy Who?\".[98] In response to this, Carter began to emphasize his name and what he stood for, stating \"My name is Jimmy Carter, and I'm running for president.\"[99] This strategy proved successful. By mid-March 1976, Carter was not only far ahead of the active contenders for the presidential nomination, but led incumbent Republican president Gerald Ford by a few percentage points.[100] As the Watergate scandal was still fresh in the voters' minds, Carter's position as an outsider, distant from Washington, D.C. proved helpful. He promoted government reorganization. In June, Carter published a memoir titled Why Not the Best? to help introduce himself to the American public.[101] Carter became the front-runner early on by winning the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. His strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there, traveling over 50,000 miles (80,000 kilometres), visiting 37 states, and delivering over 200 speeches before any other candidate had entered the race.[102] In the South, he tacitly conceded certain areas to Wallace and swept them as a moderate when it became clear Wallace could not win the region. In the North, Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters. While he did not achieve a majority in most Northern states, he won several by building the largest singular support base. Although Carter was initially dismissed as a regional candidate, he would clinch the Democratic nomination.[103] In 1980, Lawrence Shoup noted that the national news media discovered and promoted Carter, and stated: What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media. It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge, propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls. This helped Carter win key primary election victories, enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President-elect in the short space of 9 months.[104] During an interview in April 1976, Carter said, \"I have nothing against a community that is... trying to maintain the ethnic purity of their neighborhoods.\"[105] His remark was intended as supportive of open housing laws, but specifying opposition to government efforts to \"inject black families into a white neighborhood just to create some sort of integration\".[105] Carter's stated positions during his campaign included public financing of congressional campaigns,[106] his support for the creation of a federal consumer protection agency,[107] creating a separate cabinet-level department for education,[108] signing a peace treaty with the Soviet Union to limit nuclear weapons,[109] reducing the defense budget,[110] a tax proposal implementing \"a substantial increase toward those who have the higher incomes\" alongside a levy reduction on taxpayers with lower and middle incomes,[111] making multiple amendments to the Social Security Act,[112] and having a balanced budget by the end of his first term of office.[113] On July 15, 1976, Carter chose U.S. senator Walter Mondale as his running mate.[114] Carter and Ford faced off in three televised debates,[115] the first United States presidential debates since 1960.[115][116] For the November 1976 issue of Playboy, which hit newsstands a couple of weeks before the election, Robert Scheer interviewed Carter. While discussing his religion's view of pride, Carter said: \"I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times.\"[117][118] This response and his admission in another interview that he did not mind if people uttered the word \"fuck\" led to a media feeding frenzy and critics lamenting the erosion of boundary between politicians and their private intimate lives.[119] Carter once had a sizable lead over Ford in national polling, but by late September his lead had narrowed to only several points.[120][121] In the final days before the election, several polls showed that Ford had tied Carter, and one Gallup poll found that he was now slightly ahead.[122] Most analysts agreed that Carter was going to win the popular vote, but some argued Ford had an opportunity to win the electoral college and thus the election.[123][124] Carter ultimately won, receiving 297 electoral votes and 50.1% of the popular vote to Ford's 240 electoral votes and 48.0% of the popular vote.[125] Carter's victory was attributed in part[126] to his overwhelming support among black voters in states decided by close margins, such as Louisiana, Texas, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Mississippi, Wisconsin, and Ohio.[127] In Ohio and Wisconsin, where the margin between Carter and Ford was under two points, the black vote was crucial for Carter; if he had not won both states, Ford would have won the election.[127][128] Ford phoned Carter to congratulate him shortly after the race was called. He was unable to concede in front of television cameras due to bad hoarse voice, and so First Lady Betty did so for him.[129] Vice President Nelson Rockefeller oversaw the certification of election results on January 6, 1977. Although Ford carried Washington, Mike Padden, an elector from there, cast his vote for Ronald Reagan, the then-governor of California and Carter's eventual successor.[130] Preliminary planning for Carter's presidential transition had already been underway for months before his election.[131][132] Carter had been the first presidential candidate to allot significant funds and a significant number of personnel to a pre-election transition planning effort, which then became standard practice.[133] He set a mold that influenced all future transitions to be larger, more methodical and more formal than they were.[133][132] On November 22, 1976, Carter conducted his first visit to Washington, D.C. after being elected, meeting with director of the Office of Management James Lynn and United States secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld at the Blair House, and holding an afternoon meeting with President Ford at the White House.[134] The next day, he conferred with congressional leaders, saying that his meetings with cabinet members had been \"very helpful\" and that Ford had offered his assistance if he needed anything.[135] Relations between Ford and Carter were relatively cold during the transition.[136] During his transition, Carter announced the selection of numerous designees for positions in his administration.[137] A few weeks before his inauguration, Carter moved his peanut business into the hands of trustees to avoid a potential conflict of interest.[138] He also asked incoming members of his administration to divest themselves of assets through blind trusts.[139] Carter was inaugurated as the 39th president on January 20, 1977.[140] One of Carter's first acts was the fulfillment of a campaign promise by issuing an executive order declaring unconditional amnesty for Vietnam War-era draft evaders, Proclamation 4483.[141][142] Carter's tenure in office was marked by an economic malaise, a time of continuing inflation and recession and a 1979 energy crisis. Under Carter, the U.S. experienced its first ever government shutdown in May 1980, though it affected only the Federal Trade Commission.[143] Carter attempted to calm various conflicts around the world, most visibly in the Middle East with the signing of the Camp David Accords;[144] giving back the Panama Canal to Panama; and signing the SALT II nuclear arms reduction treaty with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. His final year was marred by the Iran hostage crisis, which contributed to his losing the 1980 election to Ronald Reagan.[145] Whistleblowers have alleged, most recently in 2023, that people working on the Reagan campaign's behalf convinced Iran to prolong the crisis to reduce Carter's chance of reelection.[146] Carter's presidency had a troubled economic history of two roughly equal periods. The first two years were a time of intense stagflation, primarily due to recovery from a previous recession that had left fixed investment at extreme lows and unemployment at 9%.[147] Under Carter, the unemployment rate declined from 8.1% when he took office to 5.7% by July 1978,[148][149] but during the early 1980s recession it returned to its pre-1977 level.[150] The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measured a 6.6% unemployment rate average during the Carter administration.[151] His last two years were marked by double-digit inflation, very high interest rates,[152] oil shortages, and slow economic growth.[153] Due to economic stimulus legislation, such as the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, proposed by Carter and passed by Congress, real household median income had grown by 5.2%, with a projection of 6.4% for the next quarter.[154] The 1979 energy crisis ended this period of growth, and as inflation and interest rates rose, economic growth, job creation and consumer confidence declined sharply.[152] Federal Reserve Board chairman G. William Miller's relatively loose monetary policy had already contributed to somewhat higher inflation,[155] rising from 5.8% in 1976 to 7.7% in 1978. The sudden doubling of crude oil prices by OPEC, the world's leading oil exporting cartel,[156] forced inflation to double-digit levels, averaging 11.3% in 1979 and 13.5% in 1980.[147] The sudden shortage of gasoline as the 1979 summer vacation season began exacerbated the problem and came to symbolize the crisis to the general public;[152] the acute shortage, originating in the shutdown of Amerada Hess refining facilities, led the federal government to sue the company that year.[157] In 1978, Carter declared a federal emergency in the neighborhood of Love Canal in the city of Niagara Falls, New York. More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which had been built on top of a toxic waste landfill. The Superfund law was created in response to the situation.[158] Federal disaster money was appropriated to demolish the approximately 500 houses, the 99th Street School, and the 93rd Street School, which had been built on top of the dump; and to remediate the dump and construct a containment area for the hazardous wastes. This was the first time that such a process had been undertaken. Carter acknowledged that several more \"Love Canals\" existed across the country, and that discovering such hazardous dumpsites was \"one of the grimmest discoveries of our modern era\".[159] Moralism typified much of Carter's action.[160] On April 18, 1977, he delivered a televised speech declaring that the current energy crisis was the \"moral equivalent of war\". He encouraged energy conservation and installed solar water heating panels on the White House.[161][162] He wore sweaters to offset turning down the heat in the White House.[163] On August 4, 1977, Carter signed the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, forming the Department of Energy, the first new cabinet position in eleven years.[164] Carter emphasized that the House of Representatives had \"adopted almost all\" of the energy proposal he had made five months earlier and called the compromise \"a turning point in establishing a comprehensive energy program.\"[165] The following month, on October 13, Carter stated he believed in the Senate's ability to pass the energy reform bill and identified energy as \"the most important domestic issue that we will face while I am in office.\"[166] On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said the continued discussions about his energy reform proposal had been \"long and divisive and arduous\" as well as hindering to national issues that needed to be addressed with the implementation of the law.[167] In an April 11, 1978, news conference, Carter said his biggest surprise \"in the nature of a disappointment\" since becoming president was the difficulty Congress had in passing legislation, citing the energy reform bill in particular: \"I never dreamed a year ago in April when I proposed this matter to the Congress that a year later it still would not be resolved.\"[168] The Carter energy legislation was approved by Congress after much deliberation and modification on October 15, 1978. The measure deregulated the sale of natural gas, dropped a longstanding pricing disparity between intra- and interstate gas, and created tax credits to encourage energy conservation and the use of non-fossil fuels.[169] On March 1, 1979, Carter submitted a standby gasoline rationing plan per the request of Congress.[170] On April 5, he delivered an address in which he stressed the urgency of energy conservation and increasing domestic production of energy sources such as coal and solar.[171] During an April 30 news conference, he said it was imperative that the House commerce committee approve the standby gasoline rationing plan and called on Congress to pass the several other standby energy conservation plans he had proposed.[172] On July 15, 1979, Carter delivered a nationally televised address in which he identified what he believed to be a \"crisis of confidence\" among American people,[173] under the advisement of pollster Pat Caddell who believed Americans faced a crisis in confidence from events of the 1960s and 1970s, before his presidency.[174] Some later called this his \"malaise speech\",[173] memorable for mixed reactions[175][176] and his use of rhetoric.[174] The speech's negative reception centered on a view that he did not emphasize his own efforts to address the energy crisis and seemed too reliant on Americans.[177] Carter typically refused to conform to Washington's rules.[178] He avoided phone calls from members of Congress and verbally insulted them. He was unwilling to return political favors. His negativity led to frustration in passing legislation.[179] During a press conference on February 23, 1977, Carter stated that it was \"inevitable\" that he would come into conflict with Congress and added that he had found \"a growing sense of cooperation\" with Congress and met in the past with congressional members of both parties.[180] Carter developed a bitter feeling following an unsuccessful attempt at having Congress enact the scrapping of several water projects,[181] which he had requested during his first 100 days in office and received opposition from members of his party.[182] As a rift ensued between the White House and Congress afterward, Carter noted that the Democratic Party's liberal wing opposed his policies the most ardently, attributing this to Ted Kennedy's wanting the presidency.[183] Thinking he had support from 74 Congressmen, Carter issued a \"hit list\" of 19 projects that he claimed were \"pork barrel\" spending that he said he would veto if they were included in legislation.[184] He found himself again at odds with Congressional Democrats, as House Speaker Tip O'Neill found it inappropriate for a president to pursue what had traditionally been the role of Congress. Carter was also weakened by signing a bill that contained many of the \"hit list\" projects he had intended to veto.[185] In an address to a fundraising dinner for the Democratic National Committee on June 23, 1977, Carter said, \"I think it's good to point out tonight, too, that we have evolved a good working relationship with the Congress. For eight years we had government by partisanship. Now we have government by partnership.\"[186] At a July 28 news conference, assessing the first six months of his presidency, Carter spoke of his improved understanding of Congress: \"I have learned to respect the Congress more in an individual basis. I've been favorably impressed at the high degree of concentrated experience and knowledge that individual members of Congress can bring on a specific subject, where they've been the chairman of a subcommittee or committee for many years and have focused their attention on this particular aspect of government life which I will never be able to do.\"[187] On May 10, 1979, the House voted against giving Carter authority to produce a standby gas rationing plan.[188] The following day, Carter delivered remarks in the Oval Office describing himself as shocked and embarrassed for the American government by the vote and concluding \"the majority of the House Members are unwilling to take the responsibility, the political responsibility for dealing with a potential, serious threat to our Nation.\" He furthered that a majority of House members were placing higher importance on \"local or parochial interests\" and challenged the lower chamber of Congress with composing their own rationing plan in the next 90 days.[189] Carter's remarks were met with criticism by House Republicans, who accused his comments of not befitting the formality a president should have in their public remarks. Others pointed to 106 Democrats voting against his proposal and the bipartisan criticism potentially coming back to haunt him.[190] At the start of a news conference on July 25, 1979, Carter called on believers in the future of the U.S. and his proposed energy program to speak with Congress as it bore the responsibility to impose his proposals.[191] Amid the energy proposal opposition, The New York Times commented that \"as the comments flying up and down Pennsylvania Avenue illustrate, there is also a crisis of confidence between Congress and the President, sense of doubt and distrust that threatens to undermine the President's legislative program and become an important issue in next year's campaign.\"[192] In 1977, Carter appointed Alfred E. Kahn to lead the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). He was part of a push for deregulation of the industry, supported by leading economists, leading think tanks in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the Carter administration, and even some in the airline industry. This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978.[193] Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act into law on October 24, 1978. The main purpose of the act was to remove government control over fares, routes and market entry (of new airlines) from commercial aviation. The Civil Aeronautics Board's powers of regulation were to be phased out, eventually allowing market forces to determine routes and fares. The Act did not remove or diminish the FAA's regulatory powers over all aspects of airline safety.[194] In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell malt, hops, and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the effective 1920 beginning of prohibition in the United States.[195] This deregulation led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s had developed into a strong craft microbrew culture in the United States, with 9,118 microbreweries, brewpubs, and regional craft breweries in the United States by the end of 2021.[196] In the late 1970s, the Chrysler Cooperation—one of the \"Big Three\" automobile manufacturers in the U.S.—faced near-certain bankruptcy as it projected a loss of $1 billion.[197] Carter proposed that the company forgo salary increases and bonuses, implying that it would be done \"without decimating the company or putting it on its knees\", but the company had already frozen wage increases and bonuses months before, to no avail.[198] In December 1979, Congress passed H.R. 5860, the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979, to bail Chrysler out with $3.5 billion (equivalent to $10.9 billion in 2023) in aid.[199] The bill turned over $162 million in stock to Chrysler's workers, eliminated around $125 million in wage increases, and gave Chrysler $500 million in bank loans.[197] Carter signed it into law in January, saying that the bill saved thousands of jobs.[197] During his presidential campaign, Carter embraced healthcare reform akin to the Ted Kennedy-sponsored bipartisan universal national health insurance.[200] Carter's proposals on healthcare while in office included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal,[201] and a June 1979 proposal that provided private health insurance coverage.[202] Carter saw the June 1979 proposal as a continuation of progress in American health coverage. President Harry S. Truman proposed a designation of health care as a basic right of Americans and Medicare and Medicaid were introduced under President Lyndon B. Johnson.[203][204] The April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal was passed in the Senate,[205] but later defeated in the House.[206] During 1978, he met with Kennedy over a compromise healthcare law that proved unsuccessful.[207] He later said Kennedy's disagreements thwarted his plan to provide a comprehensive American health care system.[208] In 1980, Carter signed into law the Mental Health Systems (MHSA) Act, which allocated block grants to states to bolster the establishment and growth of community health services and provided funding to states to create and implement community-based health services. The MHSA was considered landmark legislation in mental health care.[209] By September 1981, the Reagan administration had repealed most of the law.[210] Early into his term, Carter collaborated with Congress to fulfill his campaign promise to create a cabinet level education department. In an address from the White House on February 28, 1978, Carter argued \"Education is far too important a matter to be scattered piecemeal among various government departments and agencies, which are often busy with sometimes dominant concerns.\"[211] On February 8, 1979, the Carter administration released an outline of its plan to establish an education department and asserted enough support for the enactment to occur by June.[212] On October 17, the same year, Carter signed the Department of Education Organization Act into law,[213] establishing the United States Department of Education.[214] Carter expanded the Head Start program with the addition of 43,000 children and families,[215] while the percentage of nondefense dollars spent on education was doubled.[216] Carter was complimentary of the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson and the 89th United States Congress for having initiated Head Start.[217] In a speech on November 1, 1980, Carter stated his administration had extended Head Start to migrant children and was \"working hard right now with Senator Bentsen and with Kika de la Garza to make as much as $45 million available in federal money in the border districts to help with the increase in school construction for the number of Mexican school children who reside here legally\".[218] During Carter's administration, the United States Foreign Service \"lifted its ban on gay and lesbian personnel\". In 1977, Jimmy Carter's administration became the first American presidential administration to invite gay male and lesbian rights activists to the White House to discuss federal policy with regard to ending employment discrimination in federal employment on the basis of sexual orientation and related issues (presidential advisor Midge Costanza having issued the invitation).[219] From the onset of his presidency, Carter attempted to mediate the Arab–Israeli conflict.[220] After a failed attempt to seek a comprehensive settlement between the two nations in 1977 (through reconvening the 1973 Geneva conference),[221] Carter invited the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin to the presidential lodge Camp David in September 1978, in hopes of creating a definitive peace. While the two sides could not agree on Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, the negotiations resulted in Egypt formally recognizing Israel, and the creation of an elected government in the West Bank and Gaza. This resulted in the Camp David Accords, which ended the war between Israel and Egypt.[222] The accords were a source of great domestic opposition in both Egypt and Israel. Historian Jørgen Jensehaugen argues that by the time Carter left office in January 1981, he was \"in an odd position—he had attempted to break with traditional U.S. policy but ended up fulfilling the goals of that tradition, which had been to break up the Arab alliance, sideline the Palestinians, build an alliance with Egypt, weaken the Soviet Union and secure Israel.\"[223] In an address to the African officials at the United Nations on October 4, 1977, Carter stated the U.S.'s interest to \"see a strong, vigorous, free, and prosperous Africa with as much of the control of government as possible in the hands of the residents of your countries\" and pointed to their unified efforts on \"the problem of how to resolve the Rhodesian, Zimbabwe question.\"[224] At a news conference later that month, Carter outlined that the U.S. wanted to \"work harmoniously with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe in particular\", as well as do away with racial issues such as apartheid, and for equal opportunities in other facets of society in the region.[225] Despite human rights concerns, Carter continued U.S. support for Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire.[226] Zaire received nearly half the foreign aid Carter allocated to sub-Saharan Africa.[227] Under Carter an allyship with Liberia's Samuel Doe who had come to power in a 1980 coup was pursued.[228] Carter visited Nigeria from March 31 to April 3, 1978, to improve relations;[229] the first U.S. president to do so.[230] He reiterated interest in convening a peace conference on Rhodesia that involved all parties and said the U.S. was moving as it could.[231] The elections of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister of the United Kingdom[232] and Abel Muzorewa for Prime Minister of Zimbabwe Rhodesia,[233] South Africa turning down a plan for South West Africa's independence, and domestic opposition in Congress were seen as a heavy blow to the Carter administration's policy toward South Africa.[234] On May 16, 1979, the Senate voted in favor of lifting economic sanctions against Rhodesia, seen by some Rhodesians and South Africans as a potentially fatal blow to joint diplomacy efforts the United States and Britain had pursued in the region for three years and any compromise between the Salisbury leaders and guerrillas.[235] On December 3, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance promised Senator Jesse Helms that when the British governor arrived in Salisbury to implement an agreed Lancaster House settlement and the electoral process began, the President would take prompt action to lift sanctions against Zimbabwe Rhodesia.[236] Carter sought closer relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC), continuing the Nixon administration's drastic policy of rapprochement. The two countries increasingly collaborated against the Soviet Union, and the Carter administration tacitly consented to the Chinese invasion of Vietnam. In December 1978, he announced the United States' intention to formally recognize and establish full diplomatic relations with the PRC starting on January 1, 1979, while severing ties with Taiwan, including revoking a mutual defense treaty with the latter.[237][238] In 1979, Carter extended formal diplomatic recognition to the PRC for the first time. This decision led to a boom in trade between the United States and the PRC, which was pursuing economic reforms under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.[239] Carter supported the China-allied Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia fighting the Soviet-backed Vietnamese invasion.[240] After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Carter allowed the sale of military supplies to China and began negotiations to share military intelligence.[241] In January 1980, Carter unilaterally revoked the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic of China (ROC), which had lost control of mainland China to the PRC in 1949, but retained control of the island of Taiwan. Conservative Republicans challenged Carter's abrogation of the treaty in court, but the Supreme Court ruled that the issue was a non-justiciable political question in Goldwater v. Carter. The U.S. continued to maintain diplomatic contacts with the ROC through the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act.[242] During Carter's presidency, the U.S. continued to support Indonesia under Suharto as a cold war ally, despite human rights violations in East Timor. The violations followed Indonesia's December 1975 invasion and occupation of East Timor. Under Carter's administration military assistance to Indonesia increased, peaking in 1978.[243][244] This was antithetical to Carter's stated policy of \"not selling weapons if it would exacerbate a potential conflict in a region of the world\".[245][246] During a news conference on March 9, 1977, Carter reaffirmed his interest in having a gradual withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and said he wanted South Korea to eventually have \"adequate ground forces owned by and controlled by the South Korean government to protect themselves against any intrusion from North Korea.\"[247] On May 19, The Washington Post quoted Chief of Staff of U.S. forces in South Korea John K. Singlaub as criticizing Carter's withdrawal of troops from the Korean peninsula. Later that day, Press Secretary Rex Granum announced that Carter had summoned Singlaub to the White House, and confirmed that Carter had seen the Washington Post article.[248] Carter relieved Singlaub of his duties on May 21 after a meeting between the two.[249][250] During a news conference on May 26, 1977, Carter said South Korea could defend itself with reduced American troops in case of conflict.[251] From June 30 to July 1, 1979, Carter held meetings with president of South Korea Park Chung Hee at the Blue House for a discussion on relations between the U.S. and South Korea as well as Carter's interest in preserving his policy of worldwide tension reduction.[252] On April 21, 1978, Carter announced a reduction in American troops in South Korea scheduled to be released by the end of the year by two-thirds, citing lack of action by Congress in regard to a compensatory aid package for the South Korean government.[253] Carter supported South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan during the suppression of the Gwangju Uprising in May 1980.[254] South Korean pro-democracy activist Kim Dae-jung was sentenced to death in September 1980, but his sentence was commuted after the intervention of Presidents Carter and Reagan.[255] On November 15, 1977, Carter pledged that his administration would continue positive relations between the U.S. and Iran, calling its contemporary status \"strong, stable and progressive\".[256] On December 31, 1977, he called Iran under the Shah an \"island of stability\" made possible by the \"admiration and love your people give to [the Shah]\".[257][258] Carter praised the Shah's \"great leadership\" and spoke of \"personal friendship\" between them.[259] American support for the unpopular Shah increased anti-American sentiment in Iran, which intensified after the Shah, who was dying of cancer, left Iran for the last time in January 1979 and Carter allowed him to be admitted to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York on October 22, 1979.[260] On November 4, 1979, a group of Iranian students took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The students belonged to the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line and supported the Iranian Revolution.[261] Fifty-two American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for the next 444 days. They were freed immediately after Ronald Reagan succeeded Carter as president on January 20, 1981. During the crisis, Carter remained in isolation in the White House for more than 100 days, until he left to participate in the lighting of the National Menorah on the Ellipse.[262] A month into the affair, Carter announced his commitment to resolving the dispute without \"any military action that would cause bloodshed or arouse the unstable captors of our hostages to attack them or to punish them\".[263] On April 7, 1980, he issued Executive Order 12205, imposing economic sanctions against Iran,[264] and announced further government measures he deemed necessary to ensure a safe release.[265][266] On April 24, 1980, Carter ordered Operation Eagle Claw to try to free the hostages. The mission failed, leaving eight American servicemen dead and two aircraft destroyed.[267][268] The failure led Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, who had opposed the mission, to resign.[269] Released in 2017, a declassified memo produced by the CIA in 1980 concluded \"Iranian hardliners—especially Ayatollah Khomeini\" were \"determined to exploit the hostage issue to bring about President Carter's defeat in the November elections.\" Additionally, Tehran in 1980 wanted \"the world to believe that Imam Khomeini caused President Carter's downfall and disgrace.\"[270] On February 8, 1977, Carter said he had urged the Soviet Union to align with the U.S. in forming \"a comprehensive test ban to stop all nuclear testing for at least an extended period of time\", and that he was in favor of the Soviet Union ceasing deployment of the RSD-10 Pioneer.[271] During a June 13 press conference, he said that at the beginning of the week, the U.S. would \"work closely with the Soviet Union on a comprehensive test ban treaty to prohibit all testing of nuclear devices underground or in the atmosphere\", and Paul Warnke would negotiate demilitarization of the Indian Ocean with the Soviet Union beginning the following week.[272] At a December 30 news conference, Carter said that during \"the last few months, the United States and the Soviet Union have made great progress in dealing with a long list of important issues, the most important of which is to control the deployment of strategic nuclear weapons\", and that the two countries sought to conclude SALT II talks by the spring of the next year.[273] The talk of a comprehensive test ban treaty materialized with the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II by Carter and Leonid Brezhnev on June 18, 1979.[274][275] In 1979, the Soviets intervened in the Second Yemenite War. The Soviet backing of South Yemen constituted a \"smaller shock\", in tandem with tensions that were rising due to the Iranian Revolution. This played a role in making Carter's stance on the Soviet Union more assertive, a shift that finalized with the impending Soviet-Afghan War.[276] In his 1980 State of the Union Address, Carter emphasized the significance of relations between the two regions: \"Now, as during the last 3½ decades, the relationship between our country, the United States of America, and the Soviet Union is the most critical factor in determining whether the world will live at peace or be engulfed in global conflict.\"[277] Communists under the leadership of Nur Muhammad Taraki seized power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978.[278] The new regime signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union in December of that year.[278][279] Due to the regime's improvement of secular education and redistribution of land coinciding with mass executions and political oppression, Taraki was deposed by rival Hafizullah Amin in September.[278][279][280] Amin was considered a \"brutal psychopath\" by foreign observers and had lost control of much of the country, prompting the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan on December 24, 1979, execute Amin, and install Babrak Karmal as president.[278][279] In the West, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was considered a threat to global security and the oil supplies of the Persian Gulf, as well as the existence of Pakistan.[279][281] These concerns led Carter to expand collaboration between the CIA and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which had begun in July 1979, when the CIA started providing $695,000 worth of non-lethal assistance (e.g., \"cash, medical equipment, and radio transmitters\") to the Afghan mujahideen.[282] The modest scope of this early collaboration was likely influenced by the understanding, later recounted by CIA official Robert Gates, \"that a substantial U.S. covert aid program\" might have \"raise[d] the stakes\", thereby causing \"the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended.\"[281][283] According to a 2020 review of declassified U.S. documents by Conor Tobin in the journal Diplomatic History: \"The primary significance of this small-scale aid was in creating constructive links with dissidents through Pakistan's ISI that could be utilized in the case of an overt Soviet intervention ... The small-scale covert program that developed in response to the increasing Soviet influence was part of a contingency plan if the Soviets did intervene militarily, as Washington would be in a better position to make it difficult for them to consolidate their position, but not designed to induce an intervention.\"[282] On December 28, 1979, Carter signed a presidential finding explicitly allowing the CIA to transfer \"lethal military equipment either directly or through third countries to the Afghan opponents of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan\" and to arrange \"selective training, conducted outside of Afghanistan, in the use of such equipment either directly or via third country intermediation.\"[282] His finding defined the CIA's mission as \"harassment\" of Soviet troops; at the time, \"this was not a war the CIA expected to win outright on the battlefield,\" in the words of Steve Coll.[284] Carter was determined to respond harshly to what he considered a dangerous provocation. In a televised speech on January 23, 1980, he announced sanctions on the Soviet Union, promised renewed aid and registration to Pakistan and the Selective Service System, and committed the U.S. to the Persian Gulf's defense.[281][283][285][286] Carter imposed an embargo on grain shipments to the USSR, tabled SALT II, requested a 5% annual increase in defense spending,[287][288] and called for a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which was ultimately joined by 65 other nations.[289][290][291] British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher enthusiastically backed Carter's tough stance.[281] National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski played a major role in organizing Carter's policies on the Soviet Union as a grand strategy.[292] In early 1980, Carter determined the thrust of U.S. policy for the duration of the war: he initiated a program to arm the mujahideen through Pakistan's ISI and secured a pledge from Saudi Arabia to match U.S. funding for this purpose. Despite huge expenditure, the Soviet Union was unable to quell the insurgency and withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 amid the economic, political, and social turmoil within the USSR, precipitating its collapse two years later.[293][281] The routing of U.S. aid through Pakistan led to some controversy, as weapons sent to Karachi were frequently controlled by Pakistan, whose government influenced which rebels received assistance. Despite this, Carter has expressed no regret over his decision to support what he still considers the Afghan freedom fighters.[281] Carter made twelve international trips to 25 countries as president.[294] He was the first president to make a state visit to Sub-Saharan Africa when he went to Nigeria in 1978.[230] His travel also included trips to Europe, Asia, and Latin America. He made several trips to the Middle East to broker peace negotiations. His visit to Iran from December 31, 1977, to January 1, 1978, took place less than a year before the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.[295] The September 21, 1977, resignation of Bert Lance, who was director of the office of management and budget in the Carter administration, came amid allegations of improper banking activities before his tenure and was an embarrassment to Carter.[296] Carter became the first sitting president to testify under oath as part of an investigation of him,[297][298] as a result of United States Attorney General Griffin Bell appointing Paul J. Curran as a special counsel to investigate loans made to the peanut business Carter owned by a bank controlled by Lance and Curran's position as special counsel not allowing him to file charges on his own.[299][d] Curran announced in October 1979 that no evidence had been found to support allegations that funds loaned from the National Bank of Georgia had been diverted to Carter's 1976 presidential campaign, ending the investigation.[300] Carter's reelection campaign was based primarily on attacking Ronald Reagan. The campaign frequently pointed out and mocked Reagan's proclivity for gaffes, using his age and perceived lack of connection to his native California voter base against him.[301] Later, the campaign used similar rhetoric as Lyndon Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign, portraying Reagan as a warmonger who could not be trusted with the nuclear arsenal.[302] Carter attempted to deny the Reagan campaign $29.4 million (equivalent to $91 million in 2023) in campaign funds, due to dependent conservative groups already raising $60 million to get him elected—an amount that exceeded the limit of campaign funds. Carter's attempt was later denied by the Federal Election Commission.[303] Carter announced his reelection campaign in December 1979.[304] A month earlier, Senator Ted Kennedy had announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination.[305] During the Democratic presidential primaries, questions about Kennedy were a frequent subject of Carter's press conferences.[306][307] Despite winning key states such as California and New York, Kennedy surprised his supporters by running a weak campaign. Carter won most of the primaries and secured renomination. He later wrote that the strongest opposition to his policies came from the Democratic Party's liberal wing, which he attributed to Kennedy's ambition to replace him as president.[308] Kennedy had mobilized the liberal wing, which weakened Carter's support in the general election.[309] Carter and Mondale were formally nominated at the 1980 Democratic National Convention in New York City.[310] Carter delivered a speech notable for its tribute to the late Hubert Humphrey, whom he initially called \"Hubert Horatio Hornblower\",[311] and Kennedy made \"The Dream Shall Never Die\" speech, in which he criticized Reagan and did not endorse Carter.[312] Along with Reagan and Kennedy, Carter was opposed by centrist John B. Anderson, who had previously contested the Republican presidential primaries, and upon losing to Reagan, reentered the race as an independent. Anderson advertised himself as a more liberal alternative to Reagan's conservatism.[313] As the campaign went on, Anderson's polling numbers dropped and his base was gradually pulled to Carter or Reagan.[314] Carter had to run against his own \"stagflation\"-ridden economy, while the hostage crisis in Iran dominated the news every week. He was attacked by conservatives for failing to \"prevent Soviet gains\" in less-developed countries, as pro-Soviet governments had taken power in countries including Angola, Ethiopia, Nicaragua and Afghanistan.[315] His brother, Billy Carter, caused controversy due to his association with Muammar Gaddafi's regime in Libya.[316] Carter alienated many liberal college students, who were expected to be one of his strongest support bases, by reactivating the Selective Service System on July 2, 1980, reinstating registration for the military draft. His campaign manager and former appointments secretary, Timothy Kraft, stepped down five weeks before the general election amid what turned out to be an uncorroborated allegation of cocaine use.[317] On October 28, Carter and Reagan participated in the sole presidential debate of the election cycle in which they were both present, due to Carter refusing to participate in debates that included Anderson.[318] Though initially trailing Carter by several points,[319] Reagan experienced a surge in polling after the debate.[320] This was in part influenced by Reagan deploying the phrase \"There you go again\", which became the election's defining phrase.[321] It was later discovered that in the final days of the campaign, Reagan's team acquired classified documents Carter used to prepare for the debate.[322] Reagan defeated Carter in a landslide, winning 489 electoral votes. The Senate went Republican for the first time since 1952.[323] In his concession speech, Carter admitted that he was hurt by the outcome of the election but pledged \"a very fine transition period\" with President-elect Reagan.[324] Shortly after losing reelection, Carter told the White House press corps that he intended to emulate the retirement of Harry S. Truman and not use his subsequent public life to enrich himself.[325] Diplomacy was a large part of Carter's post-presidency. These diplomatic efforts began in the Middle East, with a September 1981 meeting with prime minister of Israel Menachem Begin,[326] and a March 1983 tour of Egypt that included meeting with members of the Palestine Liberation Organization.[327] In 2018, official files revealed that, in January 1993, Carter had been suggested for a Northern Ireland peace process role by president-elect Bill Clinton amid speculation that Clinton would appoint a special envoy for Northern Ireland.[328] In 1994, president Clinton sought Carter's assistance in a North Korea peace mission, during which Carter negotiated an understanding with Kim Il Sung.[329][330] Carter outlined a treaty with Kim, which he announced to CNN without the Clinton administration's consent to spur American action.[331] In March 1999, Carter visited Taiwan and met with President Lee Teng-hui. During the meeting, Carter praised the progress Taiwan made in democracy, human rights, economy, culture, science and technology.[332] However, Carter remained, even at the time of his death, a controversial figure in Taiwan for having ended US diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan).[333] In 2003, Carter championed a plan to hold elections in Venezuela amid protests aimed at doing so.[334] Ultimately, no elections were held. In 2006, Carter stated his disagreements with Israel's domestic and foreign policy while saying he supported the country,[335][336] extending his criticisms to Israel's policies in Lebanon, the West Bank, and Gaza.[337] In July 2007, Carter joined Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg, South Africa, to announce his participation in The Elders, a group of independent global leaders who work together on peace and human rights issues.[338][339] After the announcement, Carter participated in visits to Darfur,[340] Sudan,[341][342] Cyprus, the Korean Peninsula, and the Middle East, among others.[343] He attempted to travel to Zimbabwe in November 2008, but was stopped by President Robert Mugabe's government.[344] In December 2008, Carter met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,[345][346] and in a June 2012 call with Jeffery Brown, stressed that Egyptian military generals could take full executive and legislative power to form a new constitution favoring themselves if their announced intentions came true.[347] On August 10, 2010, Carter traveled to North Korea to secure the release of Aijalon Gomes, successfully negotiating his release.[348][349] Throughout the latter part of 2017, as tensions between the U.S. and North Korea persisted, Carter recommended a peace treaty between the two nations[350] and confirmed that he had volunteered to the Trump administration to be a diplomatic envoy to North Korea.[351] Carter began his first year out of office with a pledge not to critique the Reagan administration, saying it was \"too early\".[352] He sided with Reagan on issues like building neutron arms after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,[353] but frequently spoke out against his administration, denouncing many of its actions in the Middle East;[354] in 1987, Carter said that Reagan was incapable of preserving peace in the Middle East.[355] He condemned the handling of the Sabra and Shatila massacre,[356] the lack of efforts to rescue and retrieve four American businessmen from West Beirut in 1984,[357] Reagan's support of the Strategic Defense Initiative in 1985,[358] and his claim of an international conspiracy on terrorism.[359] In 1987 he criticized Reagan for conceding to terrorist demands,[360] nominating Robert Bork for the Supreme Court,[361] and his handling of the Persian Gulf crisis.[362] On January 16, 1989, before the inauguration of George H. W. Bush, Carter told Gerald Ford that Reagan had experienced a media honeymoon, saying that he believed Reagan's immediate successor would be less fortunate.[363] Carter had a mostly poor relationship with Bill Clinton, who snubbed him from his inauguration ceremony. He doubted the morality of the Clinton administration, particularly with respect to the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the pardon of Marc Rich.[364] In July 2001, Carter said he was \"disappointed in almost everything\" President George W. Bush had done, but after the September 11 attacks, he offered only praise, calling on Americans to support Bush with \"complete unity\".[365] Later, Carter opposed the Iraq War[366] and what he considered an attempt by Bush and Tony Blair to oust Saddam Hussein with \"lies and misinterpretations\".[367] In 2004, Carter said that he believed Bush exploited the September 11 attacks and blamed the media for not criticizing him.[368] In 2007, Carter said the Bush administration \"has been the worst in history\" on foreign affairs;[369] he later said he was just comparing Bush's tenure to Nixon's.[370] Tony Fratto responded to Carter's comments on the Bush administration's behalf by saying that the comments increased Carter's irrelevance.[371] By the end of Bush's second term, Carter considered Bush's tenure disappointing, as he told Forward Magazine of Syria.[372] Though he praised President Barack Obama in the early part of his tenure,[373] Carter stated his disagreement with using drone strikes against suspected terrorists, Obama's choice to keep Guantanamo Bay detention camp open,[374] and the federal surveillance programs Edward Snowden revealed.[375][376] During Donald Trump's presidency, Carter spoke favorably of the chance for immigration reform[377] and criticized Trump for his handling of the U.S. national anthem protests.[378] In October 2017, he defended Trump in an interview with The New York Times, criticizing the media's coverage of him as harsher \"than any other president certainly that I've known about\".[379][380] In 2019, Trump called Carter and expressed concern that China was \"getting ahead\" of the United States. Carter agreed, saying that China's strength came from its lack of involvement in armed conflict and calling the U.S. \"the most warlike nation in the history of the world.\"[381] Carter was considered a potential candidate in the 1984 presidential election,[382][383] but did not run and instead endorsed Walter Mondale for the Democratic nomination.[384][385] After Mondale secured the nomination, Carter critiqued the Reagan campaign,[386] spoke at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, and advised Mondale.[387] After the election, in which Reagan defeated Mondale, Carter said the loss was predictable because Mondale's platform included raising taxes.[388] In the 1988 presidential election, Carter ruled himself out as a candidate and predicted Vice President George H. W. Bush would be the Republican nominee.[389] Carter foresaw unity at the 1988 Democratic National Convention,[390] where he delivered an address.[391] After the election, which Bush won, Carter said Bush would have a more difficult presidency than Reagan because he was not as popular.[392] During the 1992 presidential election, Carter met with Senator Paul Tsongas, who sought his advice.[393] Carter spoke favorably of former governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton,[394] and criticized Ross Perot, a Texas billionaire who was running as an independent.[395] As the primary concluded, Carter spoke of the need for the 1992 Democratic National Convention to address certain issues not focused on in the past,[396] and campaigned for Clinton after he became the Democratic nominee,[397] publicly stating his expectation to be consulted during Clinton's presidency.[398] Carter endorsed Vice President Al Gore days before the 2000 presidential election,[399] and in subsequent years voiced his opinion that Gore won the election,[400] despite Bush's eventual victory following the Supreme Court's ruling in Bush v. Gore.[401] In the 2004 presidential election, Carter endorsed John Kerry and spoke at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.[402] He also voiced concern about another voting mishap in Florida.[403] During the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, it was speculated that Carter would endorse Barack Obama over his main primary rival Hillary Clinton, as Carter spoke favorably of Obama, as did other members of the Carter family.[404][405] Carter also commented on Clinton ending her bid when superdelegates voted after the June 3 primary.[406] Carter criticized the Republican nominee, John McCain.[407][408] Carter warned Obama against selecting Clinton as his running mate.[409] Carter endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination during the primary season of the 2012 presidential election, though he clarified that his backing of Romney was due to him considering the former Massachusetts governor the candidate that could best assure a victory for President Obama.[410] Carter delivered a videotape address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.[411] Carter was critical of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump shortly after the latter entered the primary, predicting that he would lose.[412][413] As the primary continued, Carter said he would prefer Trump to his main rival, Ted Cruz,[414] though he rebuked the Trump campaign in remarks during the primary[415] and in his address to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Carter believed that Trump would not have been elected without Russia's interference in the 2016 election,[416] and \"that Trump didn't actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election, and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.\" When questioned, he agreed that Trump is an \"illegitimate president\".[417][418] In a 2017 discussion with Senator Bernie Sanders, Carter revealed he voted for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries.[419] Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter delivered a recorded audio message endorsing Joe Biden for the virtual 2020 Democratic National Convention. On January 6, 2021, following the U.S. Capitol attack, along with the other three still living former presidents, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton,[420] Jimmy Carter denounced the attack, releasing a statement saying that he and his wife were \"troubled\" by the events, also stating that what had occurred was \"a national tragedy and is not who we are as a nation\", and adding that \"having observed elections in troubled democracies worldwide, I know that we the people can unite to walk back from this precipice to peacefully uphold the laws of our nation\".[421] Carter delivered a recorded audio message for the inauguration of Joe Biden on January 20, 2021, as the Carters were unable to attend the ceremony in person.[422] In November 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overruled a three-judge panel of the court and scheduled a rehearing of the case against the Trump administration-proposed land swap in Alaska to allow a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. In an unusual action, Carter had filed an opinion in support of the suit by environmental groups, saying the swap violated the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Anilca) passed in 1980 near the end of Carter's term. Carter said the act \"may be the most significant domestic achievement of my political life\" at the time of his filing.[423] In August 2024, Carter's son Chip said his father wanted to live to 100 to vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.[424] He achieved this on October 16, the second day of early voting in Georgia.[425][426] Carter criticized the Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina,[427] and built homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.[428] He also partnered with former presidents to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities,[429] in addition to writing op-eds about the goodness seen in Americans who assist each other during natural disasters.[430] In 1982, Carter founded the Carter Center,[431] a non-governmental and non-profit organization with the purpose of advancing human rights and alleviating human suffering,[432] including helping improve the quality of life for people in more than 80 countries.[433] Among these efforts has been the contribution of the Carter Center working alongside the World Health Organization to the near-eradication of dracunculiasis, also called Guinea worm disease. The incidence of this disease has decreased from 3.5 million cases in the mid-1980s, to 25 cases in 2016,[434][435] and four in the first seven months of 2024, according to the Carter Center's statistics.[436] Carter attended the dedication of his presidential library[437] and those of Presidents Ronald Reagan,[438] George H. W. Bush,[439] Bill Clinton,[440][441] and George W. Bush.[442] He delivered eulogies at the funerals of Coretta Scott King,[443] Gerald Ford,[444][445] and Theodore Hesburgh.[446] In 2007, Carter founded the New Baptist Covenant organization for social justice.[447][448] As of August 2019[update], Carter was Honorary Chair for the World Justice Project[449] and formerly served as one for the Continuity of Government Commission.[450] He continued to occasionally teach Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church as of 2019.[451] Carter also taught at Emory University in Atlanta, and in June 2019 was awarded tenure for 37 years of service.[452] Carter's Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, a New York Times Best Seller book, published in 2006, generated controversy for characterizing Israel's policies in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as amounting to apartheid.[453] In an interview, Carter defined apartheid as the \"forced separation of two peoples in the same territory with one of the groups dominating or controlling the other.\"[454] In remarks broadcast over radio, he said that Israel's policies amounted to an apartheid worse than South Africa's:[455] When Israel does occupy this territory deep within the West Bank, and connects the 200-or-so settlements with each other, with a road, and then prohibits the Palestinians from using that road, or in many cases even crossing the road, this perpetrates even worse instances of apartness, or apartheid, than we witnessed even in South Africa.[455] Carter defended himself against accusations of antisemitism by saying \"the hope is that my book will at least stimulate a debate, which has not existed in this country. There's never been any debate on this issue, of any significance.\"[455] He expressed his opinion that Israel will not have peace until it agrees to withdraw from the occupied territories, adding, \"the greatest commitment in my life has been trying to bring peace to Israel.\"[455] In his 2010 book We Can Have Peace in the Holy Land, Carter cites Israel's unwillingness to withdraw from the territories and settlement expansion as the primary obstacle to peace in the Middle East.[456] The Carter family experienced another family peanut business dilemma when it accumulated a one-million-dollar debt in 1981. Former President Carter began writing books to pay off this debt. As of July 2019, he had \"published more than 30, from a children's book to reflections on his presidency\".[457] Carter's hobbies included painting,[458] fly fishing, woodworking, cycling, tennis, and skiing.[459] He also had an interest in poetry, particularly the works of Dylan Thomas.[460] During a state visit to the UK in 1977, Carter suggested that Thomas should have a memorial in Poets' Corner at Westminster Abbey;[461] this later came to fruition in 1982.[460][462] Carter was a personal friend of Elvis Presley, whom he and Rosalynn met on June 30, 1973, before Presley was to perform onstage in Atlanta.[463] They remained in contact by telephone two months before Presley's sudden death in August 1977. Carter later recalled an abrupt phone call received in June 1977 from Presley who sought a presidential pardon from Carter, to help George Klein's criminal case; at the time Klein had been indicted for only mail fraud, and was later found guilty of conspiracy.[464][465] According to Carter, Presley was almost incoherent because of barbiturates; although he phoned the White House several times again, this was the last time they spoke.[466] The day after Presley's death, Carter issued a statement and explained how he had \"changed the face of American popular culture\".[467] Carter filed a report with both the International UFO Bureau and the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena,[468] stating that he sighted an unidentified flying object in October 1969.[469][470][471] From a young age, Carter showed a deep commitment to evangelical Christianity.[472][473] Carter taught Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia.[474] At a private inauguration worship service, the preacher was Nelson Price, the pastor of Roswell Street Baptist Church of Marietta, Georgia.[475] As an evangelical Christian, Carter appealed to voters after the scandals of the Nixon administration, and he is credited with popularizing the term \"born again\" into the American lexicon during the 1976 presidential campaign.[473][476][477][478] As president, Carter prayed several times a day and professed that Jesus was the driving force in his life. He was greatly influenced by a sermon he had heard as a young man that asked: \"If you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?\"[479] In 2000, after the Southern Baptist Convention announced it would no longer permit women to become pastors, he renounced his membership, saying: \"I personally feel that women should play an absolutely equal role in service of Christ in the church.\"[480] He remained a member of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship.[472] Carter's support for the Equal Rights Amendment[481] led many evangelical conservatives to leave the Democratic Party, contributing to the development of the Christian right in American politics.[482] Carter had three younger siblings, all of whom died of pancreatic cancer: sisters Gloria Spann (1926–1990) and Ruth Stapleton (1929–1983), and brother Billy Carter (1937–1988).[483] He was first cousin to politician Hugh Carter and a distant cousin to the Carter family of musicians.[484] He was related to Motown founder Berry Gordy by way of their white great-grandfather James Thomas Gordy, who fathered a child with a black woman he enslaved.[485] Carter married Rosalynn Smith on July 7, 1946, in the Plains Methodist Church, the church of Rosalynn's family.[486] They had three sons, Jack, James III \"Chip\", and Donnel; one daughter, Amy; nine grandsons (one of whom is deceased), three granddaughters, five great-grandsons, and eight great-granddaughters.[487] Mary Prince (an African American woman wrongly convicted of murder, and later pardoned) was their daughter Amy's nanny for most of the period from 1971 until Jimmy Carter's presidency ended.[488][489][490] Carter had asked to be designated as her parole officer, thus helping to enable her to work in the White House.[489][e] The Carters celebrated their 77th anniversary on July 7, 2023. On October 19, 2019, they became the longest-wed presidential couple, having overtaken George and Barbara Bush at 26,765 days.[493] After Rosalynn's death on November 19, 2023, Carter released the following statement: Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished. She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.[494] The Carters' eldest son, Jack Carter, was the 2006 Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in Nevada and lost to Republican incumbent John Ensign. Jack's son Jason Carter is a former Georgia state senator,[495] and in 2014 was the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia, losing to the Republican incumbent, Nathan Deal. On December 20, 2015, while teaching a Sunday school class, Carter announced that his 28-year-old grandson Jeremy Carter had died of unspecified causes.[496] On August 3, 2015, Carter underwent an elective surgery to remove a small mass on his liver, and his prognosis for a full recovery was initially said to be excellent. On August 12, he announced he had been diagnosed with cancer that had metastasized, without specifying where the cancer had originated.[497] On August 20, Carter disclosed that melanoma had been found in his brain and liver, and that he had begun treatment with the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and was about to start radiation therapy. His healthcare was managed by Emory Healthcare of Atlanta. His family history of cancer includes both of his parents and all three of his siblings.[498] On December 5, he announced that his medical scans no longer showed any cancer.[499] Carter broke his hip in a fall at his Plains home on May 13, 2019, and underwent surgery the same day at the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Georgia.[500] On October 6, an injury above his left eyebrow received in another fall at home required 14 stitches[501] and resulted in a black eye.[502] On October 21, Carter was admitted to the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center after sustaining a minor pelvic fracture from falling at home for the third time in 2019.[503] He was able to resume teaching Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church on November 3.[504][505] On November 11, 2019, Carter was hospitalized at the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta for a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain caused by bleeding connected with his falls.[506][507] He was released from the hospital on November 27.[508][506] On December 2, 2019, Carter was readmitted to the hospital for a urinary tract infection. He was released on December 4.[509][510] On February 18, 2023, the Carter Center announced that following a \"series of short hospital stays\", Carter decided to \"spend his remaining time at home with his family\" in Plains to \"receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention\"[511][512] for an unspecified illness.[513][514] At 100 years old, Carter was the longest-lived former U.S. president, a title he held until his passing.[515] He was the earliest-serving living former president since Gerald Ford's death in 2006. In 2012, he surpassed Herbert Hoover as the longest-retired president. In 2017 and 2021, Carter became the first president to live to the 40th anniversary of his inauguration and post-presidency respectively. In 2017, Carter, then 92, became the oldest former president ever to attend an American presidential inauguration.[516][517] On March 22, 2019, he became the longest-lived U.S. president, surpassing George H. W. Bush, who died a few months earlier at the age of 94 years, 171 days.[518] He said in a 2019 interview with People that he never expected to live as long as he had and that the best explanation for longevity was a good marriage.[519] Carter entered hospice care six months before celebrating his 99th birthday at his home.[520] The Carter Center announced Jimmy Carter 100: A Celebration in Song, an event concert to celebrate Carter's 100th birthday that featured appearances by musicians and celebrities. The event took place on September 17, 2024, at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia.[521] On October 1, 2024, Carter turned 100, the first president to do so.[522] Local events to celebrate his birthday included a F-18 Super Hornet flyover formation by eight Navy pilots from Naval Air Station Oceana, which Carter viewed from his backyard, and a naturalization ceremony for 100 new citizens at Plains High School, which Chip Carter attended.[523][524] Carter made arrangements to be buried in front of his home at 209 Woodland Drive in Plains. In 2006, he said that a funeral in Washington, D.C., with visitation at the Carter Center, was also planned.[525] Carter asked President Biden to deliver his eulogy.[526] Carter died at his home in Plains, Georgia, on December 29, 2024, at the age of 100. His son, James E. Carter III, announced his death that afternoon.[527][528][529] This followed his February 2023 decision to enter hospice care.[530] Shortly after the announcement, President Joe Biden released a statement honoring Carter's legacy, calling him a \"man of principle, faith, and humility.\" The Biden administration also announced plans to hold an official state funeral, and a day of mourning for him on January 9, 2025.[531] When Carter left office in 1981, scholars and even many Democrats viewed his presidency as a failure.[532][533][534][535] Betty Glad, a political scientist at the University of Illinois, summarized the public consensus on Carter: \"he didn't have a well-developed political philosophy and gave people a feeling he didn't quite know where he was headed.\"[536] Historians have ranked Carter's presidency as below average.[537][538] After leaving office, he told allies he predicted history would be kinder to him than voters were in the 1980 election.[536] In a 1982 Chicago Tribune survey, when 49 historians and scholars were asked to rank the best and worst U.S. presidents, Carter was ranked the tenth worst.[539] In 2006, conservative British historian Andrew Roberts ranked Carter the worst U.S. president.[540] Yet some of Carter's policy accomplishments have been more favorably received.[541] The 2009 documentary Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace credits Carter's efforts at Camp David, which brought peace between Israel and Egypt, with bringing the only meaningful peace to the Middle East.[542][543] Stuart E. Eizenstat, who served as Carter's chief White House domestic policy adviser, wrote, \"Carter's accomplishments at home and abroad were more extensive and longer lasting than those of almost all modern presidents.\"[544] While historians generally consider Carter a below-average president, his post-presidency activities have been universally praised, including his peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts.[537][538] The Independent wrote in 2009, \"Carter is widely considered a better man than he was a president.\"[545] In exit polls from the 1976 presidential election, many voters still held Ford's pardon of Nixon in 1974 against him.[546] By comparison, Carter was viewed as a sincere, honest, and well-meaning southerner.[545] During his presidency, polls generally showed that most Americans saw Carter as likable and \"a man of high moral principles\".[547] In the 1980 election, Reagan projected an easy self-confidence, in contrast to Carter's serious and introspective temperament. Carter was portrayed as more pessimistic and indecisive than Reagan, who was known for his charm and delegation of tasks to subordinates.[548] Reagan used the economic issues, the Iran hostage crisis, and the lack of Washington cooperation to portray Carter as a weak and ineffectual leader. Carter was the first elected incumbent president since Herbert Hoover in 1932 to lose a reelection bid.[549] Carter began his presidency with an approval rating between 66% and 75%.[550][551] He maintained approval ratings above 50% until March 1978,[551] and the following month his approval rating fell to 39%,[552] primarily due to the declining economy.[553] His ratings briefly rebounded after the Camp David Accords in late 1978[554] but dipped during the 1979 energy crisis and got as low as 28% in July 1979.[555] At the beginning of the Iran hostage crisis, his approval rating surged to 61%, up 23 points from his pre-crisis rating.[556] Polls also found that up to 77% of Americans approved of Carter's initial response to the crisis,[556] but by June 1980, amid heated criticism from across the political spectrum[557] for his failure to free the hostages, his approval rating slumped to 33%; that same month Reagan surpassed Carter in pre-1980 election polling.[558] As Carter was leaving office, a Gallup poll found that 48% of Americans thought he had been an \"average\" or \"above average\" president, 46% said he had been \"below average\" or \"poor\", and only 3% thought he had been \"outstanding\".[559] His average approval rating during his entire presidency was 46%,[560][561] and he left office as one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents in history.[562] In a 1990 Gallup survey, 45% of respondents said they approved of the overall job Carter did as president, leaving only Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson with lower ratings.[563] In a 2006 poll, 61% of respondents said they approved of the job Carter did as president, his highest rating since 1979.[564] The next year, a Gallup survey found that 69% of respondents had a favorable opinion of Carter.[565] Carter received the American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award in 1984.[144] The Jimmy Carter Library and Museum was opened in 1986.[566] The following year, the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park was established as a National Historic Site[567] and in 2021, renamed as a national historical park.[568] In 1991, Carter was made an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa at Kansas State University,[569] and was elected to the American Philosophical Society.[570] In 1998, the U.S. Navy named the third and final Seawolf-class submarine USS Jimmy Carter, honoring Carter and his service as a submarine officer.[571] Carter received the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights, given in honor of human rights achievements,[572] and the Hoover Medal, recognizing engineers who have contributed to global causes.[573] Carter's 2002 Nobel Peace Prize[574] was partially a response to president George W. Bush's threats of war against Iraq and Carter's criticism of the Bush administration.[575] In 2009, the Souther Field Airport in Americus, Georgia, was renamed Jimmy Carter Regional Airport.[576] In November 2024, Carter received his 10th nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for audio recordings of his books. He has won three times—for Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis (2007), A Full Life: Reflections at 90 (2016), and Faith: A Journey For All (2018).[577][578][579][580][581][582] On February 21, 2024, the White House Historical Association unveiled its official 2024 White House Christmas ornament honoring Carter's naval service and efforts for peace. This was the first time a president being honored was alive at the time of the unveiling.[583]",

                "content": "James Earl Carter Jr. (October 1, 1924 – December 29, 2024) was an American politician and philanthropist. He was the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He was a member of the Democratic Party. Before becoming president, Carter was a Georgia state senator from 1963 to 1967 and the 80th governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975. He was born and grew up in Plains, Georgia. Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and joined the United States Navy. In 1953, Carter left the military and returned home to Georgia to take charge of the family's peanut-growing business. Carter was against racial segregation and supported the growing civil rights movement. He became an activist in the Democratic Party. From 1963 to 1967, Carter was in the Georgia State Senate, and in 1970, he was elected as Governor of Georgia. He was governor until 1975. At first, he was not seen as a serious presidential candidate as not many people knew him outside of Georgia. Carter eventually won the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination and was elected president, beating then-Republican President Gerald Ford. On his second day in office, Carter pardoned all the Vietnam War draft evaders. During Carter's term as president, he created the Department of Energy and the Department of Education. He also created a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter helped create the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II), and the return of the Panama Canal Zone to Panama. However, the economy during his presidency was bad as it had stagflation, high inflation, high unemployment and slow economic growth. The end of his presidential term was remembered for the 1979–1981 Iran hostage crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In 1980, Carter ran against Senator Ted Kennedy in the Democratic primaries and won re-nomination at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. Carter lost the 1980 presidential election. He lost to the Republican nominee Ronald Reagan, who won in a huge victory. Polls of historians and political scientists usually see Carter as an below-average president. He became more popular for his humanitarian work after leaving office. In 1982, Carter created the Carter Center to focus on human rights across the world. He traveled around the world to support peace talks, look over elections, and supported ending deadly diseases. In 2002, he won the Nobel Peace Prize. Carter was seen as an important person in the Habitat for Humanity charity. He wrote over 30 books from memoirs to poetry. Carter was the longest-lived president, the longest-retired president, the first to live forty years after their inauguration, and the first former president to reach the age of 100. Carter died on December 29, 2024 while in hospice care in Plains. Carter was born on October 1, 1924, at Lillian Carter Health and Rehabilitation in Plains, Georgia.[1] Carter was the first U.S. president to be born in a hospital.[2] He was the oldest son of Bessie Lillian (née Gordy) and James Earl Carter Sr.[3] The family moved many times when Carter was an infant.[4] The Carters settled on a dirt road in nearby Archery.[5] His family eventually had three more children: Gloria, Ruth, and Billy.[6] Carter had a good relationship with his parents even though his mother worked long hours, about twenty hours every day.[7] His father supported segregation, which allowed Carter to become friends with his family farm's Black workers.[8] Carter went to Plains High School from 1937 to 1941.[9] He also joined the Future Farmers of America and liked woodworking.[10][11] He also played basketball during his high school years.[8] After high school, Carter went to Georgia Southwestern College, in Americus, Georgia.[12] He took extra math classes at Georgia Tech.[13] In 1943, Carter was accepted to the United States Naval Academy.[14] While at the academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith.[15] The two married shortly after his graduation in 1946.[15] He was a sprint football player for the Navy Midshipmen.[16] Carter graduated 60th out of 820 midshipmen in the class of 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and became an ensign.[17][18] From 1946 to 1953, Carter and Rosalynn lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York and California, during his time in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.[18] In 1948, he began officers' training for being in a submarine.[18] He was promoted to lieutenant junior grade in 1949.[18] In 1952, Carter began his work with the US Navy's nuclear submarine program.[19] He was sent to the Naval Reactors Branch of the Atomic Energy Commission in Washington, D.C. for three month.[20] During this time, Rosalynn moved with their children to Schenectady, New York.[19][20] In March 1953, Carter began nuclear power school at Union College in Schenectady.[21] Carter's father died and he was released from active duty to allow him to take over the family peanut business.[22] Carter left active duty on October 9, 1953.[22] He was not active at the Navy Reserve until 1961, and left the service as a lieutenant.[23] His awards included the American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, China Service Medal, and National Defense Service Medal.[24] Carter's father, James died after having recently been elected to the Georgia House of Representatives.[25] For a year, Jimmy, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in public housing in Plains.[26] Carter is the only U.S. president to have lived in public housing before he took office.[26] Carter wanted to expand the family's peanut-growing business.[27] His first-year harvest failed because of droughts, however Carter wanted to open many bank lines of credit to keep the farm going.[27] He also took classes and read on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business.[28] Even though they struggled at first, the Carters grew the peanut business and became successful.[27][28] Carter, who was against racial segregation, was inspired to run for office over the racial tensions in the country.[29] By 1961 he was a known member of the Plains community and the Baptist Church as well as chairman of the Sumter County school board.[30] At the school board, Carter spoke against racial segregation in public schools.[30] In 1962, Carter announced his run for a seat in the Georgia State Senate.[31] At first, the results showed Carter losing, but this was the result of fraudulent voting done by the Democratic Party chairman in Quitman County.[32] Carter challenged the results; when fraud was confirmed, a new election was held, which he won.[31] Beginning in 1962, Americus was known where black protesters were hit and abused.[33] Carter did not say anything about this at first.[34] He did speak about some race issues such as giving speeches against literacy tests and against a change to the state constitution.[34] When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Carter called it \"the greatest blow that I had suffered since my father died\".[35] Two years later, Carter was in charge of the Democratic Executive Committee, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules.[36] He became chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission.[36] When Bo Callaway was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 1964, Carter wanted to run against him in the next election.[37] The two had fought over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college.[37] Carter wanted it to go to his alma mater, Georgia Southwestern College, but Callaway wanted the funding to go to downtown Columbus.[37] Carter was re-elected in 1964 to a second two-year term.[38] For a time in the State Senate, he was in charge of its Education Committee and also was part of the Appropriations Committee toward the end of his second term.[39] Before his term ended he worked on a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern a four-year program.[40] The last day of the term, he announced his run for the United States House of Representatives.[41] Carter ran for the United States House of Representatives for Georgia's 3rd district in 1966 against Bo Callaway.[37] However, Callaway ended his campaign to run for Governor of Georgia.[37] Callaway became a Republican in 1964.[42] Carter later wanted to run for governor against Callaway.[37] In the Democratic primary, he ran against the liberal former Governor Ellis Arnall and the conservative Lester Maddox.[43] Governor Maddox was not allowed to run for a second term as governor in 1970.[44] Carter had to run against Carl Sanders in the 1970 Democratic primary.[45] Carter was more conservative than before during this primary election.[46] That September, Carter was beating Sanders in the first round by 49% to 38%.[47] Since no one won more than half the vote, they went into a second round.[47] Carter won the Democratic nomination with 59% of the vote against Sanders's 40%.[48] In the general election, Carter beat Republican candidate Hal Suit, winning 59% of the vote against Suit's 40%.[49] Carter became the 76th Governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971.[50] In his inaugural speech, he said that \"the time of racial discrimination is over. ... No poor, rural, weak, or black person should ever have to bear the additional burden of being [without] the opportunity for an education, a job or simple justice\".[50] Time ran a story on the progressive \"New South\" governors elected that year in a May 1971 cover.[51] The cover of the magazine had Carter.[51] Lester Maddox, who Carter replaced as governor, became lieutenant governor.[50] Richard Russell Jr., then President pro tempore of the United States Senate, died in office during Carter's second week in office.[52] Carter picked David H. Gambrell, state Democratic Party chair, to replace Russell's in the United States Senate.[52] Carter wanted to grow the governor's power while making the state government easier to run.[53] He supported a bill that could give him the power of executive restructuring and to force a vote on it.[53][54] The plan was not popular in the state legislature.[53] But after two weeks of talking about the plan, it was passed.[53] He lowered the number of state agencies from 300 to 22.[55] In April 1971, while on television, Carter was asked if he supported the idea of governor and lieutenant governor running together.[56] He said, \"I've never really thought we needed a lieutenant governor in Georgia. The lieutenant governor is part of the executive branch of government and I've always felt—ever since I was in the state Senate—that the executive branches should be separate\".[56] In July 1971, while in Columbus, Georgia, Carter created a Georgia Human Rights Council that would help solve issues in the state of any possible violence.[57] In January 1972, Carter wanted to give state money for an Early Childhood Development Program and prison reform programs.[58] In April 1972, Carter went to Latin and South America for a possible trade deal with Georgia.[59] Carter said that he had met with Brazilian President Emílio Garrastazu Médici.[59] Many said he was acting like President Kennedy.[59] The number of black state workers, judges, and board members grew when Carter was governor.[60] He put paintings of Martin Luther King Jr. in the capitol building, while the Ku Klux Klan were at the ceremony protesting.[61] While on television with Governor of Florida Reubin Askew in January 1973, Carter said he supported a constitutional amendment to ban busing and to make desegregation in schools faster.[62] He supported an anti-busing plan with George Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference.[63][64] Carter signed a new death penalty law after the United States Supreme Court rejected it.[65] Carter later said he did not support the death penalty, saying, \"I didn't see the injustice of it as I do now\".[65] Carter wanted to give equal state aid to schools in the rich and poor areas of Georgia.[66] He helped create centers for mentally handicapped children and education programs for convicts.[67][68] He also wrote a program that made picking federal judges based on their experience over their political party possible.[69][70] In an unpopular move,[71] Carter rejected a plan to build a dam on Georgia's Flint River.[72] He said that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was not giving the right numbers on the project's cost and possible harm on the region.[72] The veto became popular with environmentalists across the country.[72] Carter was not allowed to run for re-election because of term limits.[73] Wanting to run for president, Carter was active in national politics and public appearances.[74] He was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, where Carter hoped he would be George McGovern's vice presidential pick.[74] He supported Senator Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson, to not support George Wallace.[75][76] In May 1973, Carter told the Democratic Party to not make the Watergate scandal a political issue.[77] On December 12, 1974, Carter announced his candidacy for President of the United States at National Press Club in Washington, D.C.[78] He talked about inequality, optimism, and change.[79][80] When Carter first announced his presidential run for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, he was seen as having little chances against better-known politicians.[81] However, by March 1976 Carter was doing better in polls against other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination.[81] He was also ahead of President Ford by a few percentage points.[81] Carter wrote Why Not the Best? in June 1976 to help make his name known for the American public.[82] Carter won the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.[81] In the South, Carter ran as a moderate and in the North, Carter ran as a conservative Christian.[83] He had visited 37 states, and gave over 200 speeches before any other candidate entered the race.[84] Carter ended up winning 30 states, with a total of 6,235,609 (39.2%) of the popular vote.[85] He was officially nominated as the Democratic nominee at the national convention.[86] He picked U.S. Senator Walter Mondale from Minnesota as his vice president pick.[86] During his presidential campaign in April 1976, Carter said to an interviewer, \"I have nothing against a community that is ... trying to maintain the ethnic purity of their neighborhoods\".[87] Carter said he understood why some neighborhoods were against desegregation.[87] However, he also supported open-housing laws that make it illegal not to sell or rent a house or apartment to a person based on their race.[87] His comments were unpopular with many Americans.[87] Carter's campaign supported congressional campaigns using public financing,[88] creating a federal agency for consumer protection,[89] creating a separate department for education,[90] signing an agreement that would stop the Soviet Union from using nuclear weapons,[91] lowering money given to the military,[92] increasing taxes for the rich and lowering them for the middle class,[93] supporting the Social Security Act,[94] and having a budget that would give money to government resources.[95] Carter and President Gerald Ford were in three televised debates during the 1976 election.[96] The debates were the first presidential debates since 1960.[96][97] Carter was interviewed by Robert Scheer of Playboy for the November 1976 issue, which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election.[98] While discussing his religion's view of pride, Carter said: \"I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times\".[98][99] He also said in another interview that he did not mind if people said the word \"fuck\".[100] This led to a media to criticize the idea if politicians should be separated from their political campaigns and their private intimate lives.[100] Carter began the race with a lead over Ford, who narrowed the gap during the campaign, but lost to Carter in by a small margin on November 2, 1976.[101] Carter won the popular vote by 50.1 percent to 48.0 percent for Ford, and received 297 electoral votes to Ford's 240.[102] Carter won fewer states than Ford, with Carter winning 23 states compared to Ford winning 27.[102] Carter was inaugurated as president on January 20, 1977.[3] On April 18, 1977, Carter gave a televised speech saying that the U.S. energy crisis during the 1970s was like war.[103] He supported energy conservation by all Americans and added solar water heating panels on the White House.[104][105] He wore sweaters because he turned down the heat in the White House.[106] On August 4, 1977, Carter created the Department of Energy.[107] During the signing event, Carter said the current \"crisis of energy shortages\" made him create the Department of Energy.[108] Carter said that the House of Representatives had created many energy saving ideas.[109] A month later, on October 13, Carter stated he believed in the Senate's power to pass the energy reform bill.[110] He said that \"the most important domestic issue that we will face while I am in office\" was the energy crisis.[110] On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said plans about his energy reform proposal were not being made and that Congress was not being respectful.[111] In April 1978, Carter said his biggest surprise since becoming president was the how hard it was for Congress to pass an energy reform bill.[112] On March 1, 1979, Carter wanted to create a gasoline rationing plan with Congress approving it.[113] On April 5, he talked about how important energy conservation is.[114] At the end of the month, Carter said it was important that the Congress pass his gas rationing plan.[115] On July 15, 1979, Carter said the crisis was a \"crisis of confidence\" among the American people.[116][117] Many did not like Carter's speech.[118][119][120] People thought Carter for not doing enough to solve the crisis.[121] Many believed he wanted Americans to do most of the work instead of the government.[121] In 1978, Carter said the Love Canal accident in the city of Niagara Falls, New York was a federal emergency.[122] During the 1940s, the canal was used as the site to dump chemical products from dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins.[123] More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which was built on top of a toxic waste landfill.[122] The Superfund law was created because of Love Canal.[124] Carter said that many places like \"Love Canals\" existed across the country.[125] He said that discovering hazardous dumpsites was \"one of the [saddest] discoveries of our modern era\".[125] In 1979, the Environmental Protection Agency said that people living near the Love Canal accident were at risk for leukemia.[126][127][128] Carter had many problems with the economy when he became president.[129] He tried to continue the recovery from the severe 1973–75 recession.[130] His economy also had high inflation, with very high interest rates, oil shortages, and slow economic growth.[129] In his first two years, Carter created millions of new jobs.[131][132] The 1979 energy crisis ended job growth, however, and both inflation and interest rates rose.[133] Economic growth, job creation, and consumer confidence quickly went down.[133] There was also not a lot of gasoline because of the oil crisis.[134] Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act into law on October 24, 1978.[135] The main purpose was to remove government control over fees, routes and airline market from commercial aviation.[135] The Civil Aeronautics Board's powers of regulation were removed.[135] The act did not remove the FAA's powers over airline safety.[136] In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell malt, hops, and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the beginning of Prohibition in the United States.[137] This led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s.[138] During his presidential campaign, Carter wanted to fix healthcare in the country.[139] Carter's plans on healthcare included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal,[140] and a June 1979 plan that gave private health insurance coverage.[141] Carter saw the June 1979 plan as a growing part of Medicare and Medicaid.[142][143] The April 1977 mandatory health care cost plan was passed in the Senate,[144] and later was not approved in the House.[145] During 1978, Carter also had meetings with Kennedy for a healthcare law that did not pass the U.S. House.[146] Carter later blamed Kennedy for his healthcare plans not being approved in Congress.[147] Carter worked with Congress to create an education department.[148] In February 1978, Carter said that education is very important and should not be in control over many departments.[149] On February 8, 1979, Carter released a plan to create an education department.[148] On October 17, 1979, Carter signed a law that created the United States Department of Education.[150] Carter grew the Head Start program by adding 43,000 children and families.[151] In a November 1980 speech, Carter said he would allow the Head Start to migrant children and wanted to increase building schools near the Mexico–United States border in Texas.[152] In September 1977, Carter and General Omar Torrijos signed the Panama Canal Treaty.[153] The treaties would give Panama control of the Panama Canal after 1999.[153] This would remove United States control of the canal.[153] The second treaty said that Panama would have full control of the canal.[153] The treaty was not popular with conservatives.[153] In September 1978, Carter created many political agreements between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at Camp David.[154] The two agreements were signed at the White House.[154] The second of these frameworks helped create the 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty.[155] Carter spoke to African officials at the United Nations about his support of democratic elections and power in African countries.[156] Carter later said his plans for wanting \"to work with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe\" and to end racial issues like apartheid.[157] Carter visited Nigeria from March 31 to April 3, 1978, trying to fix relations with the country.[158] He was the first U.S. president to visit Nigeria.[159] Carter wanted to create peace in Rhodesia.[160] On May 16, 1979, the Senate voted in favor of President Carter ending economic sanctions against Rhodesia.[161] In November 1977, Carter said he wanted to have a good partnership between the United States and Iran.[162] In November 1979, a group of Iranian students took over the United States Embassy in Tehran.[163] The students were in support of the Iranian Revolution.[163] 52 Americans were held hostage for the next 444 days until they were freed on January 20, 1981.[164] They were freed on the day Ronald Reagan replaced Carter as president.[164] During the crisis, Carter never left the White House for more than 100 days.[165] In December 1979, Carter said he wanted to solve the issue without using the military or violence.[166] On April 7, 1980, Carter passed Executive Order 12205, adding economic sanctions against Iran[167] and announced more action to make sure the hostages were released safely.[168][169] On April 24, 1980, Carter pushed for Operation Eagle Claw to try to free the hostages.[170] The mission failed as military helicopters crashed killing eight American military people.[170][171] Whistleblowers have said that people working on Ronald Reagan's campaign convinced Iran to not release the hostages to make sure Carter was not re-elected.[172] On February 8, 1977, Carter said he had wanted the Soviet Union to work with the United States to stop nuclear testing.[173] During a June 13 meeting, Carter said that the United States would begin to talk to the Soviet Union about demilitarization of the Indian Ocean.[174] On December 30, Carter said that the United States and the Soviet Union have made great progress on talking about important issues.[175] These talks helped create the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II by Carter and Leonid Brezhnev on June 18, 1979.[176][177] Nur Muhammad Taraki and other Communists took power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978.[178] Following an uprising in April 1979, Taraki was removed by Khalq rival Hafizullah Amin in September.[179] By December, Amin's government had lost control of much of the country.[178] This caused the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan.[178] Carter was surprised by the invasion.[180] The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was seen as a threat and Carter saw the Soviet Union as dangerous.[181] Carter announced sanctions on the Soviet Union.[181][182] He created an embargo on grain to the Soviet Union.[183][184] Carter also supported not taking part of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.[185] British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher supported Carter's actions towards the Soviet Union.[186] In early 1980, Carter created a program to arm the mujahideen.[187] The Soviets were unable to fight off them off and left Afghanistan in 1989.[187] In March 1977, Carter supported removing American troops from South Korea.[188] He wanted South Korea to have their own military forces to protect themselves from North Korea.[188] Carter's move to remove the troops was unpopular with military officials.[189] In May, Carter said he believed South Korea would be able to defend themselves without as many American troops.[190] From June 30 to July 1, 1979, Carter had meetings with President of South Korea Park Chung-hee at the Blue House.[191] Carter said that the liberal part of the Democratic Party did not support his policies the most.[192] He said they were caused by Senator Ted Kennedy's plan to replace him as president.[192] Kennedy announced his plans to run for president in November 1979.[193][194][195] Kennedy did not run a good campaign and Carter won most of the primaries.[196] Carter won the Democratic re-nomination, however, Kennedy gave Carter weak support from the Liberal Democrats in the general election.[196] Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale were nominated at the Democratic National Convention in New York City.[197] Carter's campaign for re-election in 1980 was not easy as he ran against Republican Ronald Reagan.[198] His campaign manager and former appointments secretary, Timothy Kraft, left the campaign five weeks before the election because of possible cocaine use.[199] On October 28, Carter and Reagan had the only presidential debate of the election.[200] Reagan was losing to Carter at first,[201] but after the debates, Reagan became popular.[202] Carter lost his re-election to Reagan in a landslide victory.[198] Reagan won 489 of the electoral votes and Carter won 49.[198] After the election, Carter said that he was hurt by the outcome of the election.[203] Shortly after losing his re-election bid, Carter told the White House press corps that he wanted his retirement to be similar than that of Harry S. Truman and not use his public life to make himself rich.[204] In October 1986, his presidential library was opened in Atlanta, Georgia.[205] At aged 88, Carter built homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy,[206] and partnered with former presidents to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[207] Carter went to the opening ceremonies of his presidential library[205] and those of Presidents Ronald Reagan,[208] George H. W. Bush,[209] Bill Clinton,[210][211] and George W.

Bush, Carter was against the Iraq War.[249] He believed Bush wanted to remove Saddam Hussein by using lies.[250] In May 2007, Carter stated the Bush administration \"has been the worst in history\" in terms of its impact in foreign affairs,[251] Carter did not support Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina.[252] Though he supported President Barack Obama in the early part of his presidency,[253] Carter criticized his use of drone strikes against suspected terrorists, Obama's choice to keep Guantanamo Bay detention camp open,[254] and use of surveillance programs.[255][256] In July 2016, Carter announced his support of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's presidential nomination during the 2016 Democratic National Convention.[257] Carter said that the 2016 election would \"define the US for a generation\".[257] He originally supported Vermont U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and voted for him during the primaries in 2016.[258] During the Donald Trump presidency, Carter supported immigration reform through Congress,[259] and did not support Trump's response during the national anthem protests.[260] In September 2019, Carter said he would support an \"age-limit\" for presidential candidates.[258] In August 2020, he supported former Vice President Joe Biden for president during a video played at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.[261] In October 2024, weeks after turning 100, Carter voted for Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election by absentee ballot.[262] Carter and Rosalynn Smith had three sons, one daughter, eight grandsons, three granddaughters, and two great-grandsons.[263][264][265] Carter and Rosalynn were well known for their work as volunteers with Habitat for Humanity.[266] Carter's hobbies included painting,[267] fly-fishing, woodworking, cycling, tennis, and skiing.[268] He also liked poetry.[269] Carter was also a personal friend of Elvis Presley.[270] Carter and Rosalynn met him on June 30, 1973, before Presley was to perform onstage in Atlanta.[270] The day after Presley's death, Carter issued a statement and explained how he had \"changed the face of American popular culture\".[271] In 2000, Carter ended his membership with the Southern Baptist Convention, saying the group's ideas did not support with his Christian beliefs.[272] Carter became the oldest to ever attend a presidential inauguration in 2017, at age 92, and the first to live to the 40th anniversary of their own.[273][274] Two years later, on March 22, 2019, he became the nation's longest-lived president.[275] On October 1, 2019, Carter became the first U.S. president to live to the age of 95.[276] In May 2023, it was announced that his wife Rosalynn had dementia.[277][278] She entered hospice care alongside her husband on November 17, 2023,[279] and died two days later at the age of 96.[280] He went to her funeral in Atlanta on November 28 alongside all living former first ladies, former President Bill Clinton and President Joe Biden.[281] She was buried at their home that they built, where Carter also planned to be buried.[282] On October 1, 2024, Carter turned 100, the first president to do so.[283][284] On August 3, 2015, Carter had surgery to remove \"a small mass\" on his liver. On August 12, however, Carter announced he had been diagnosed with cancer that had metastasized.[285] On August 20, he said that melanoma had been found in his brain and liver.[286] On December 6, 2015, Carter said that his medical scans no longer showed any cancer.[287] On May 13, 2019, Carter broke his hip at his Plains home and had surgery in Americus, Georgia.[288] On October 6, 2019, Carter got 14 stitches above his left eyebrow after injuring it during another fall at home.[289] A few weeks later, Carter was hospitalized after having a minor pelvic fracture after falling again at home.[290] A month after his fall, Carter was hospitalized in November at the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta to relieve pressure on his brain.[291] The surgery was successful, and Carter was released from the hospital on November 27.[292][293] In February 2021, it was announced that Carter and his wife both received their doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.[294] In late February 2023, Carter stopped medical treatment and started hospice care at home.[295] He was being treated for an \"aggressive form\" of melanoma.[296] On March 13, 2023 it was revealed by President Joe Biden that Carter had asked him to deliver his eulogy after his death.[297] His grandson said in June 2024 that Carter is no longer awake every day.[298] Two months later, Carter said he hoped to vote for the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 presidential election.[299] Later that month, his grandson said that Carter was really sick, although he hoped to turn 100 years old and vote to in the 2024 election.[300] Carter died at his home in Plains on December 29, 2024, almost three months after his 100th birthday.[301][302][303] Shortly after his death, President Joe Biden honored Carter's legacy, calling him a \"man of principle, faith, and humility.\"[304] President-elect Donald Trump and former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W.

Johnson with lower ratings.[323] In a 2018 retrospective poll, Carter's presidency received a 55% favorability rating, its highest since 1980.[324] Carter has had many awards since his presidency. In 1998, the U.S. Navy named the third and last Seawolf-class submarine honoring former President Carter and his service as a submariner officer.[325] That year he also received the United Nations Human Rights Prize, given in honor of human rights achievements,[326] and the Hoover Medal.[327] He won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize.[328] Carter has been nominated ten times for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for audio recordings of his books, and has won three times in 2007, 2016 and 2019.[329][330][331][332] In November 2024, at age 100, Carter got his tenth nomination.[333] This made him the oldest nominee ever.[333] The Souther Field Airport in Americus, Georgia was renamed Jimmy Carter Regional Airport in 2009.[334] Death and state funeral of Jimmy Carter Dunant / Passy (1901) · Ducommun / Gobat (1902) · Cremer (1903) · IDI (1904) · Suttner (1905) · Roosevelt (1906) · Moneta / Renault (1907) · Arnoldson / Bajer (1908) · Beernaert / Estournelles de Constant (1909) · IPB (1910) · Asser / Fried (1911) · Root (1912) · La Fontaine (1913) · International Committee of the Red Cross (1917) · Wilson (1919) · Bourgeois (1920) · Branting / Lange (1921) · Nansen (1922) · Chamberlain / Dawes (1925) Briand / Stresemann (1926) · Buisson / Quidde (1927) · Kellogg (1929) · Söderblom (1930) · Addams / Butler (1931) · Angell (1933) · Henderson (1934) · Ossietzky (1935) · Lamas (1936) · Cecil (1937) · Nansen Office (1938) · International Committee of the Red Cross (1944) · Hull (1945) · Balch / Mott (1946) · QPSW / AFSC (1947) · Boyd Orr (1949) · Bunche (1950) Jouhaux (1951) · Schweitzer (1952) · Marshall (1953) · UNHCR (1954) · Pearson (1957) · Pire (1958) · Noel‑Baker (1959) · Lutuli (1960) · Hammarskjöld (1961) · Pauling (1962) · International Committee of the Red Cross / League of Red Cross Societies (1963) · King (1964) · UNICEF (1965) · Cassin (1968) · ILO (1969) · Borlaug (1970) · Brandt (1971) · Kissinger / Le (1973) · MacBride / Sato (1974) · Sakharov (1975) B.Williams / Corrigan (1976) · AI (1977) · Sadat / Begin (1978) · Mother Teresa (1979) · Esquivel (1980) · UNHCR (1981) · Myrdal / García Robles (1982) · Wałęsa (1983) · Tutu (1984) · IPPNW (1985) · Wiesel (1986) · Arias (1987) · UN Peacekeeping Forces (1988) · Dalai Lama (1989) · Gorbachev (1990) · Suu Kyi (1991) · Menchú (1992) · Mandela / de Klerk (1993) · Arafat / Peres / Rabin (1994) · Pugwash Conferences / Rotblat (1995) · Belo / Ramos-Horta (1996) · ICBL / J.Williams (1997) · Hume / Trimble (1998) · Médecins Sans Frontières (1999) · Kim (2000) UN / Annan (2001) · Carter (2002) · Ebadi (2003) · Maathai (2004) · IAEA / ElBaradei (2005) · Yunus / Grameen Bank (2006) · Gore / IPCC (2007) · Ahtisaari (2008) · Obama (2009) · Xiaobo (2010) · Sirleaf / Gbowee / Karman (2011) · EU (2012) · Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (2013) · Yousafzai / Satyarthi (2014) · Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet (2015) · Juan Manuel Santos (2016) · International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (2017) · Mukwege / Murad (2018) · Ahmed (2019) · World Food Programme (2020) · Ressa / Muratov (2021) · Bialiatski / Memorial / Center for Civil Liberties (2022) · Mohammadi (2023) · Nihon Hidankyo (2024)",

                "content": "The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500 The 39th President of the United States The biography for President Carter and past presidents is courtesy of the White House Historical Association. Jimmy Carter served as the 39th President of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He was awarded the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize for work to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development. Jimmy Carter aspired to make Government “competent and compassionate,” responsive to the American people and their expectations. His achievements were notable, but in an era of rising energy costs, mounting inflation, and continuing tensions, it was impossible for his administration to meet these high expectations. Carter, who has rarely used his full name–James Earl Carter, Jr.–was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. Peanut farming, talk of politics, and devotion to the Baptist faith were mainstays of his upbringing. Upon graduation in 1946 from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Carter married Rosalynn Smith. The Carters have three sons, John William (Jack), James Earl III (Chip), Donnel Jeffrey (Jeff), and a daughter, Amy Lynn. After seven years’ service as a naval officer, Carter returned to Plains. In 1962 he entered state politics, and eight years later he was elected Governor of Georgia. Among the new young southern governors, he attracted attention by emphasizing ecology, efficiency in government, and the removal of racial barriers. Carter announced his candidacy for President in December 1974 and began a two-year campaign that gradually gained momentum. At the Democratic Convention, he was nominated on the first ballot. He chose Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota as his running mate. Carter campaigned hard against President Gerald R. Ford, debating with him three times. Carter won by 297 electoral votes to 241 for Ford. Carter worked hard to combat the continuing economic woes of inflation and unemployment. By the end of his administration, he could claim an increase of nearly eight million jobs and a decrease in the budget deficit, measured in percentage of the gross national product. Unfortunately, inflation and interest rates were at near record highs, and efforts to reduce them caused a short recession. Carter could point to a number of achievements in domestic affairs. He dealt with the energy shortage by establishing a national energy policy and by decontrolling domestic petroleum prices to stimulate production. He prompted Government efficiency through civil service reform and proceeded with deregulation of the trucking and airline industries. He sought to improve the environment. His expansion of the national park system included protection of 103 million acres of Alaskan lands. To increase human and social services, he created the Department of Education, bolstered the Social Security system, and appointed record numbers of women, blacks, and Hispanics to Government jobs. In foreign affairs, Carter set his own style. His championing of human rights was coldly received by the Soviet Union and some other nations. In the Middle East, through the Camp David agreement of 1978, he helped bring amity between Egypt and Israel. He succeeded in obtaining ratification of the Panama Canal treaties. Building upon the work of predecessors, he established full diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China and completed negotiation of the SALT II nuclear limitation treaty with the Soviet Union. There were serious setbacks, however. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan caused the suspension of plans for ratification of the SALT II pact. The seizure as hostages of the U. S. embassy staff in Iran dominated the news during the last 14 months of the administration. The consequences of Iran’s holding Americans captive, together with continuing inflation at home, contributed to Carter’s defeat in 1980. Even then, he continued the difficult negotiations over the hostages. Iran finally released the 52 Americans the same day Carter left office.

                "content": "It took nearly a full overtime period but the Washington Commanders won 30-24 over the Atlanta Falcons on \"Sunday Night Football\" to reach 11 wins for the first time since 1991. Washington's offense went 70 yards in seven minutes and culminated in quarterback Jayden Daniels finding tight end Zach Ertz for the game-winning 2-yard touchdown pass. Daniels had a historic night, completing 24 of 36 passes for 227 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception. He also led the Commanders with 127 rushing yards on 16 carries. Daniels broke the rookie quarterback rushing yards record, previously held by former Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III, in the third quarter. Washington took control early by converting an interception by Falcons rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr. to a touchdown. Atlanta scored 17 unanswered points by halftime, though, and a 10-point deficit was the biggest Washington's faced all season at the break. Atlanta running back Bijan Robinson scored two rushing touchdowns in the first half and finished the night with 17 carries for 90 yards and two scores. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. The Commanders came out strong in the second half with a 15-play drive that took up nearly eight minutes of time in the third quarter. Daniels found Ertz for his fifth touchdown of the season to cut the deficit to 17-14. Washington chewed another seven minutes of clock on their ensuing drive capped off by a go-ahead touchdown run by Chris Rodriguez. Their ensuing drive took 5:30 off the clock but finished off with a field goal. Atlanta fought back on their next drive as Penix Jr. threw his first NFL touchdown pass to tight end Kyle Pitts on 4th-and-goal and tie the game 24-24. A quick stop by the Falcons' defense gave the Penix Jr. and company the ball back with 40 seconds to go. They got into field goal range but Riley Patterson couldn't hit the 56-yard attempt. Penix Jr. completed 19 of 35 passes for 223 yards, one touchdown, and an interception in his second career start. Washington began overtime on offense and didn't let Atlanta's offense back on the field. Daniels repeatedly went to former Falcons wide receiver Olamide Zaccheaus on the night as Atlanta cornerback A.J. Terrell blanketed Terry McLaurin, his typical top target. Zaccheaus tied a career-high with eight catches for 85 yards and a touchdown, but had a critical drop on their final drive of regulation. Both teams had more success on the ground. Washington had 216 yards rushing and Atlanta tallied 126 by the final whistle. Washington overcame multiple miscues, including Daniels' interception and 108 yards in penalties, for their 11th win of the season. The Commanders (11-5) close out the regular season on the road next week against the Dallas Cowboys (7-9). This loss moves Atlanta (8-8) one game back from NFC South leader Tampa Bay (9-7). The Falcons head home for their regular season finale against the Carolina Panthers (4-12) and need the Buccaneers to lose to the New Orleans Saints to have a chance to win the division and make the playoffs. NFL PLAYOFF PICTURE: Where things stand in the AFC and NFC DO YOU LIKE FOOTBALL? Then you'll enjoy getting our NFL newsletter delivered to your inbox Jayden Daniels' 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Zach Ertz gave the Commanders the win in overtime. More importantly, the win secured the Commanders' first playoff berth since the 2020 season. It also clinched a postseason spot for the Los Angeles Rams, who are NFC West winners due to a strength of victory tiebreaker over the Seattle Seahawks. Washington's gone 68 yards in more than seven minutes to take it deep into the red zone. Washington is facing third-and-goal from the 2-yard line with 2:45 to go in overtime. Washington won the coin toss and elected to receive the ball and start overtime on offense. Atlanta's Riley Patterson attempted a 56-yard field goal but it fell well short and \"Sunday Night Football\" is headed to overtime. A zero-yard sack and two incomplete passes meant the Commanders took just 39 seconds off the clock before punting back to the Falcons. Atlanta gets the ball back on its own 19-yard line with 40 seconds to go and two timeouts. After a 21-yard loss on first-and-goal on a botched snap, the Falcons were able to battle back and score on a Michael Penix Jr. pass to tight end Kyle Pitts on fourth-and-goal. The 13-yard touchdown pass is Penix Jr.'s first as an NFL quarterback and Riley Patterson's extra point is good to tie the game with 1:19 to go in the fourth quarter. Facing first-and-goal from the Washington 5-yard line, the Falcons tried a direct snap to running back Bijan Robinson but it went through his hands and back for a 21-yard loss. The Falcons will be facing second-and-goal from the Commanders' 26-yard line after the two-minute warning. Washington took more than five minutes to drive 52 yards for their third scoring drive of the second half. A holding call on third-and-goal nullified a touchdown pass from Jayden Daniels to Olamide Zaccheaus to keep the Falcons in contention and force a field goal. Zane Gonzalez knocked it through from 31 yards out to give Washington a seven-point lead with 4:32 to go. The rookie quarterback rushed for 7 yards on first-and-10 from the Falcons' 48-yard line in the fourth quarter, giving him 820 rushing yards on the season. That mark breaks the previous record of 815 yards held by fellow Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III set in the 2012 NFL season. Atlanta's offense picked up a first down to pass midfield but Commanders defensive lineman Dorance Armstrong sacked Michael Penix Jr. for an eight-yard loss on 3rd-and-10. The Falcons punt for the second time in a row in the second half and Washington's offense takes over from their own 36-yard line with 10:02 to go in the game. The Commanders took another seven minutes off the clock with a 14-play, 70-yard drive culminating in a 2-yard touchdown run by second-year running back Chris Rodriguez. Zane Gonzalez's extra point is good and Washington takes the lead again for the first time since the first quarter. Quarterback Jayden Daniels used his legs on the drive multiple times, scrambling for 39 yards and two first downs on the drive. He also found Jeremy McNichols for a key conversion on fourth-and-5 in Falcons territory. Washington's dominated time of possession in the third frame. The Commanders out-gained the Falcons 125 yards to minus-1 in the quarter. Washington's offense has the ball at the Falcons' 14-yard line facing second-and-5 to open the final quarter of the game. Atlanta managed just five yards before Washington defensive lineman Dante Fowler Jr. got a strip sack on third-and-5. Michael Penix Jr. recovered the ball, but the Falcons had to punt for just the second time all game. Washington's offense gets the ball back at its own 30-yard line with 5:06 to go in the third quarter. Washington's offense took nearly eight full minutes off the clock in their opening drive of the second half. Jayden Daniels fired a pass to tight end Zach Ertz on third-and-8 for a 10-yard touchdown. Zane Gonzalez's extra point is good as the Commanders make it a one-score game. Multiple key plays kept the drive going at crucial moments. An illegal contact penalty on the Falcons' defense on 3rd-and-22 kept Washington's offense on the field. Ertz had a 37-yard catch-and-run — his longest catch in three seasons — to get Washington past midfield. Daniels' 4-yard run on fourth-and-1 from the Falcons' 16-yard line gave the Commanders a new set of downs and closer to the end zone. Atlanta's field goal with two seconds to go sealed a two-score lead after the first half. After Washington's opening drive touchdown, the Falcons have clamped down on defense. The Commanders kicked two punts and threw and interception on their three drives after their first touchdown. Atlanta's pass rush has sacked Jayden Daniels twice and both quarterbacks have thrown one interception through the first two quarters. Washington will get the ball to start the third quarter. The Falcons went 51 yards in less than two minutes to make it a two-score game behind a 39-yard field goal by Liam McCullough. Michael Penix Jr. completed 3 of 5 passes for 32 yards on the drive. A holding penalty and 10-yard sack on consecutive plays forced the Washington offense into a third-and-30 from their own 35-yard line. The Commanders couldn't overcome that and will settle for a punt on the other side of the two-minute warning. Atlanta will have a chance to score before halftime with all three timeouts. Atlanta's offense capitalized on the interception by marching 72 yards in 11 plays for a go-ahead touchdown. Bijan Robinson's second-and-2 run from the Commanders' 4-yard line was initially ruled a touchdown run but was called back due to the ball going out of bounds before crossing the plane of the end zone. Two plays later, he made good on that miss with a 1-yard score. The Falcons ran the ball eight times on the drive for 49 yards. After a holding penalty backed the Commanders out of the red zone, Jayden Daniels dropped back and threw an interception to Falcons linebacker Kaden Elliss. Elliss had a short return to give the ball back to the Falcons offense at their own 29-yard line with 10:37 to go in the second quarter. Facing third-and-6 from their own 33-yard line, Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr. dropped back and threw deep for running back Bijan Robinson, who had a step on his defender. The pass fell incomplete and the Falcons were forced to punt. Washington takes over at its own 28-yard line with less than a minute to go in the first quarter. Falcons rookie linebacker JD Bertrand got to Jayden Daniels for a 13-yard sack on second-and-10 and Washington's offense couldn't recover. The Commanders punted for the first time tonight and the Falcons will take over at their own 27-yard line with 2:48 to go in the first quarter. Two key penalties against the Commanders kept the Falcons alive for a 10-play, 70-yard drive capped off by a rushing touchdown by Bijan Robinson off a direct snap. Liam McCullough's extra point is good and the game is tied with 5:10 to go in the first quarter. The Falcons were lined up for a field goal on fourth-and-4 from the Washington 28-yard line. But rookie cornerback Mike Sainristil was lined up offsides and a 5-yard penalty gives Atlanta another shot near the red zone. Following the turnover, the Commanders made the most of a short field with a seven-play touchdown drive in a matter of three minutes. Rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels faked a handoff and rolled out to his left before finding Olamide Zaccheaus for a 7-yard touchdown on fourth-and-2. Zane Gonzalez's extra point is good and Washington takes the first lead of the game with 9:33 to go in the first quarter. The rookie dropped back for his third pass of the game and threw it to Commanders safety Quan Martin. Washington's offense takes over at the Falcons' 38-yard line with 12:45 to go in the first quarter. Rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr. will have the first drive of the game in his second start of the season.

Sunday will feature a tripleheader before the round wraps up on \"Monday Night Football\" on Monday, Jan. 13. The Falcons have a fairly simple task ahead of them because they control their destiny. Here's how Atlanta can get to the playoffs. They clinch a playoff spot with wins in their last two games. However, things get dicey with a Falcons loss tonight. Atlanta would hand control of the division back to Tampa Bay with one week to go. Under that scenario, here is how Atlanta can make the postseason: The Falcons cannot make the playoffs as a wild-card team. The Commanders have several different paths into the postseason. They are as follows: The only way the Commanders can be eliminated from postseason contention is if they finish with the same record as the Falcons and Buccaneers. That would allow the Falcons to win the NFC South and the Buccaneers to displace the Commanders in the wild-card race by virtue of Tampa Bay's head-to-head win over Washington in Week 1. Here’s how the NFC East stacks up entering the “SNF” matchup between the Commanders and Falcons: Here’s how the NFC South lines up entering the “SNF” matchup between the Falcons and Commanders: Here's how the AFC and NFC stack up entering “SNF”: AFC In the hunt: Miami Dolphins (8-8), Cincinnati Bengals (8-8) NFC In the hunt: Seattle Seahawks (9-7), Atlanta Falcons (8-7) x – clinched playoff berth y – clinched division z – clinched home-field advantage, first-round bye Here’s how the top 15 picks of the first round of the 2025 NFL draft stack up entering the “SNF” game: The Falcons travel North to take on the Commanders and Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland.

                "title": "Commanders clinch playoff spot with walk-off touchdown pass over Falcons in overtime - Yahoo Sports",
                "content": "The quarterback class from the 2024 NFL Draft was already one of the top stories of this season. And it keeps getting better. Jayden Daniels won on Sunday night, sending the Washington Commanders to the playoffs. And that usually would be enough that he wouldn’t have to share the spotlight. But the other rookie quarterback in the game, Michael Penix Jr. of the Atlanta Falcons, was also fantastic in rallying his team to overtime with a great game-tying drive in regulation. Daniels’ season will continue into the postseason. The Commanders clinched a playoff berth with the 30-24 overtime win. Washington won the coin toss to start OT and took the first drive into the end zone to end the game before Penix ever had a chance to get a possession. Daniels looked like a veteran in moving his team downfield in a pressure situation. On third-and-goal, Daniels hit Zach Ertz for a 2-yard touchdown for the walk-off win. The win also clinched the NFC West title for the Los Angeles Rams due to tiebreakers. The Falcons now need help to win the NFC South. Atlanta needs to beat the Carolina Panthers in Week 18 while the Tampa Bay Buccaneers need to lose to the New Orleans Saints to give the Falcons a division title. The silver lining for the Falcons in a loss that likely will cost them a shot at the division crown was that they should have a lot of excitement over their quarterback going forward. All five first-round rookie quarterbacks who have started games have had flashes of brilliance, or in Daniels’ case, a historic rookie season. The question for Falcons head coach Raheem Morris in the offseason might be why he didn’t pull the plug on Kirk Cousins and turn to Penix sooner. The first half wasn’t about either rookie quarterback. It was about Bijan Robinson and the Falcons' defense. Robinson had 82 rushing yards before halftime and two touchdowns. Meanwhile, the Falcons did a solid job of stopping Washington’s run game and limiting Daniels. The Commanders scored just once in the first half and trailed 17-7 at halftime. That changed quickly in the second half. Daniels started running more and the Commanders’ offense came alive. Washington scored quickly, on a Daniels touchdown pass to Ertz, and the Falcons’ lead was down to 17-14. The Commanders' offense stayed hot on its next drive, and Chris Rodriguez Jr. scored on a 2-yard touchdown run to give Washington the lead early in the fourth quarter. The Falcons' offense couldn’t get in any rhythm, and Daniels and the Commanders rarely let Atlanta have the ball. By the time the Commanders extended their lead to 24-17, the Commanders had run 39 second-half plays to just nine for Atlanta, and Washington had a 20:20 to 5:08 edge in time of possession. It looked like the Commanders had taken over the game and would escape with a win behind Daniels’ great second half. But Penix wasn’t backing down. The Falcons trailed 24-17 in a game they likely needed in the NFC South race, and that’s not a great spot for a rookie in his second career start. But Penix never looked like he was in just his second start. Penix was impressive in driving the Falcons downfield in the final minutes, including a big fourth-and-11 completion to Drake London for 31 yards. On first-and-goal a direct snap to Robinson was high and mishandled, and even though Robinson recovered, he was tackled at the 26-yard line, putting Atlanta in a ridiculous second-and-goal position. After that disaster, the rookie completed a 13-yard pass to London on second down and a 13-yard touchdown to Kyle Pitts on fourth down to tie it with 1:19 to go. Daniels was excellent in the second half, as he has been most of the season. But in that crucial drive, the Falcons learned a lot about their own rookie quarterback. After the score, Daniels threw a nice pass to Olamide Zaccheaus on third down but Zaccheaus dropped it and the Commanders punted, giving the ball right back to the Falcons with less than a minute to go. Penix rallied the team downfield and with two seconds left he escaped the rush and threw downfield, which led to a pass interference call on the Commanders. That gave the Falcons a shot at a field goal as time expired. But Riley Patterson’s 56-yard attempt was short and the game went to overtime. The Commanders got the ball first and Daniels continued to make plays. He had a great scramble for a first down on a crucial third-and-2. The drive kept moving inside the 10-yard line. The Commanders faced a third-and-goal from the 2-yard line, knowing a touchdown would clinch a playoff spot. Daniels hit Ertz for the touchdown, and Washington got its biggest win in years. Washington is heading to the playoffs. It seems like the rookie quarterback class of 2024 has plenty of postseason berths in its future.

If the game should end in a tie, the Commanders (10-5-1 with a tie) would clinch a wild-card playoff berth and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (9-7) would then go into the driver’s seat in the NFC South, just needing a Week 18 win to win the division over the Falconswho would enter Week 18 at 8-7-1, and need a Bucs loss to win the division. It would have been a career-best for Patterson, who is in for the injured Younghoe Koo, and the game heads to overtime. Twelve penalties for 103 yards for Washington tonight.

                "title": "Falcons vs. Commanders score, takeaways: Washington punches postseason ticket with overtime win - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Washington Commanders are back in the playoffs. Despite an inspired performance by Falcons rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr., Washington prevailed in overtime after their rookie quarterback, Jayden Daniels, hit tight end Zach Ertz for the game-winning score in the extra session. Washington (11-5) has clinched its first playoff berth since 2020 with Sunday night's 30-24 win. The Commanders also clinched a playoff berth for the Los Angeles Rams. Conversely, Atlanta (8-8) lost control of its own playoff destiny. The Commanders scored 17 unanswered points after trailing 17-7 at halftime, but Atlanta forced overtime after Penix hit Kyle Pitts on a 13-yard touchdown pass with 1:19 left in regulation. The Falcons could have won it in regulation, but Riley Patterson's 56-yard field goal try at the buzzer was short. In overtime, Daniels led the Commanders on a 12-play, 70-yard drive that was punctuated by his third touchdown pass of the night. Daniels also led both teams with 127 yards on 16 carries. Penix threw for 223 yards with a touchdown and a pick in a losing effort. Here's a closer look at how Washington punched its playoff ticket. Without taking anything away from Atlanta, Washington's win was largely the result of Dan Quinn's team not getting in its own way as much in the second half and in overtime after committing several costly errors in the first half. One of those mistakes was a special teams penalty on a Falcons punt that extended the drive and ultimately led to a touchdown for the visiting team. The Commanders were flagged a whopping 13 times for 108 yards, but Daniels largely overcame the sloppy play with breathtaking plays. Daniels' night also included some history; he broke former Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III's rookie record for rushing yards by a quarterback. With A.J. Terrell following Terry McLaurin's every move, Commanders wideout Olamide Zaccheaus stepped up with eight grabs for 85 yards that included his 7-yard touchdown catch on Washington's first drive. Defensively, the Commanders set up the game's first score after picking off Penix on the game's fifth play. In the second half, Washington was able to get Atlanta's offense off the field on its first two possessions. The Falcons had run just nine plays prior to their game-tying touchdown drive in the final moments of regulation. The Falcons sacked Daniels five times, but they weren't able to bring him down when it mattered most. They also were unable to come up with a fourth-down stop, as the Commanders converted on all three of their fourth-down tries. While the loss surely hurts, Falcons fans should take solace in Penix's performance. After a shaky opening drive, Penix quickly found his rhythm, leading the Falcons on three scoring drives in the first half. Two of those drives ended with touchdowns by running back Bijan Robinson, who rushed or 82 yards on 13 carries in the game's first 30 minutes. Penix then led an improbable, game-tying drive near the end of regulation that included a 31-yard completion to Drake London (who caught seven passes for 106 yards) on a fourth-and-11 play. His touchdown pass to Pitts was on a fourth-and-13 play. Speaking of Robinson, his lack of involvement in the second half loomed large in the loss. He had just eight yards on four carries in the second half after being an integral part of the Falcons' success in the first half. One of Washington's most important plays of the night took place on a fourth-and-5 on the Falcons' 39-yard line late in the third quarter. On the play, Daniels threw a short pass to running back Jeremy McNichols, who was initially short of the first-down market before fighting for the necessary yardage. The 6-yard gain helped set up the Commanders' go-ahead touchdown at the start of the fourth quarter. Daniels' game-winning touchdown pass was a dart that corralled by Ertz, who caught six passes for 72 yards and two scores. \"I like our teams' chances against anyone.\" -- Daniels with NBC Sports afterward when asked about Washington's playoff prospects Atlanta will play host to the Panthers in their regular-season finale. The Falcons need to win and have the Buccaneers lose to the Saints in order to capture the NFC South division title and the playoff berth that comes with it. The Commanders will wrap up the regular season in Dallas against the rival Cowboys. Washington clinches the playoff spot and right now is the No. 6 seed ahead of the Packers due to the conference record tiebreaker. That'll be settled next week. Atlanta now needs the Buccaneers to lose next week in order to win the NFC South. For the second week in a row, Jayden Daniels leads a game-winning, walk-off drive. This time, he sends the Commanders to the playoffs with a strike to Zach Ertz over the middle of the field. That drive was basically all Daniels the whole way. What a performance: 24 of 36 for 227 yards, 3 touchdowns and 1 interception, plus 16 (SIXTEEN) carries for 127 yards. WOW. Daniels' escapability is just unreal. Riley Patterson's 56-yard field goal came up way short, so the Davis penalty escapes ignominy. We're headed to an extra period. This penalty on Michael Davis being pass interference rather than holding may have just won Atlanta the game. Wow. Noah Igbinoghene may have gotten away with illegal contact on that last throw to Drake London. Their feet got tangled so it wasn't pass interference, but Igbinoghene had hands on London farther than 5 yards downfield. EXTREMELY suspect time management from the Falcons. Wow. They let the clock run all the way down to 12 seconds when they still had an extra timeout. Wow. Might have just cost themselves a chance to win the game. AJ Terrell got away with a pretty obvious pass interference on second down and Olamide Zaccheus had a ball hit him in the facemask on third, and now the Falcons will have 40 seconds to drive for the game-winning score, with two timeouts still in their pocket. And Penix comes back on the very next snap and makes up for it with his best throw of the night. Fantastic job by Kyle Pitts to make the contested catch over the middle. Extra point tied it up. What a drive. Yikes. Second time Penix has missed an open corner route for a touchdown. Absolutely massive loss for the Falcons on a bad snap on first-and-goal results in a 21-yard loss. It'll be second-and-goal from the 26-yard line after the two-minute warning. Atlanta tried to go with the direct snap to Bijan again and it backfired in a big way. Penix has made two really nice throws to the wide left side of the field to extend this drive. Falcons still have a shot to tie. Washington tacked on a field goal after the Cosmi penalty, and now leads by 7. The Falcons have 4:32 to drive the field for a game-tying touchdown, armed with two timeouts. Oh boy, that could be a huge penalty. Holding on Sam Cosmi wipes a Zaccheus TD off the board and now it'll be third-and-goal from the 13 with Washington up by 4 points. Daniels just broke the record for rushing yards by a rookie quarterback. It was, of course, previously held by Robert Griffin III for this same Washington franchise. Second time tonight that Penix has gotten stripped but the Falcons have recovered the fumble. He's got to have better ball security in the pocket, especially when he's trying to step up and through the rush. What a move by Ray-Ray McCloud! Stayed on his feet through a pair of tacklers on third down and created a whole bunch of yards after the catch by himself. Moved the Falcons into plus territory as they try to take the lead here. Another fantastic drive from Washington culminates with a trip to the end zone. This time it's Chris Rodriguez scoring on a pitch play from 2 yards out to cap a 14-play, 70-yard drive that again took more than 7 minutes off the clock. Really nice coverage from A.J. Terrell on a third-down deep shot to Terry McLaurin forced Washington into fourth-and-5. Naturally, Daniels converted it again, this time with a checkdown over the middle to Jeremy McNichols. He was nearly stood up just before the line to gain but appeared to reach out and convert it at the last second. Atlanta got away with one on third down, as Penix got stripped of the ball but fell on it himself before a defender could recover the fumble. Washington will get it back with a chance to tie or take the lead. Big drive for Zach Ertz. He had the huge gain earlier and now he steps up on third-and-long inside the red zone and makes a great contested grab in the front of the end zone to get Washington back within one score. 15 plays, 79 yards and a touchdown in a drive that took more than half the third quarter. Second fourth-down conversion of the night for Washington. Now 18 of 21 on the year. Zach Ertz has basically been a catch-and-fall guy for years now, He just had a MASSIVE catch and run for a huge gain on a scramble-drill play after Daniels evaded pressure in the pocket. Washington's offensive line is getting totally bowled over here. Just got bailed out by an illegal contact penalty. Some really, really bad clock management from Atlanta on this final drive, and then Penix airmailed an open corner route on third down, so the Falcons settled for a Riley Patterson field goal to take a 10-point lead into the break. Washington gets the ball to begin the third quarter. It looked like the second score of the night for Bijan Robinson, but apparently the ball was behind him as he went through the front corner of the end zone, so they took the score off the board. Michael Penix then got stopped on a QB sneak from inside the 1-yard line. Falcons still trying to punch it in. And then Bijan took it into the end zone anyway, bouncing it outside the tackle box and easily jumping into the end zone to give the Falcons their first lead of the night. Really undisciplined performance from the Washington defense so far. Already three penalties to extend drives. After a penalty set Washington's drive back inside the red zone, Kaden Elliss came up with a huge play to shut down the scoring opportunity. Looks like Daniels got fooled by the coverage and never saw Elliss dropping into his zone, and just threw the ball right into the defender's chest. Former Falcons WR Olamide Zaccheus has 5-53-1 against his former team less than 5 minutes into the second quarter. One of the best games of his career already. That looked like the third miscommunication of the game for the Falcons already. The snap operation isn't on the same page, and neither are the receivers. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "title": "Game recap: 5 takeaways from Packers’ loss to Vikings",
                "content": "packers.com editor MINNEAPOLIS – The Packers fell way behind and then rallied late, but it wasn't enough in a 27-25 defeat to the Vikings on Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium. Here are five takeaways from the tough loss: Because the Vikings, after the Packers scored two touchdowns for 15 points to cut a 17-point deficit to two, got two first downs to run out the clock. The second one was converted on a third-and-3, the Packers' last chance to get the ball back, and QB Sam Darnold floated a pass in the flat that running back Cam Akers caught above his shoetops while falling backwards. The Vikings went into victory formation and the comeback went for naught. \"Our guys continue to fight and scratch and claw, but we just can't put ourselves in a hole like that,\" Head Coach Matt LaFleur said. \"It took too long to get going offensively, and that was the result.\" A fumble on the game's opening drive, a failed fourth down in scoring territory, two illegal formation flags that wiped out first downs, a 12-men-in-the-huddle penalty, and an offside on a missed field goal that gave the Vikings another crack at the kick on the final play of the first half … it all added up to a frustrating afternoon and, in the end, too much to overcome. LaFleur clearly disagreed with one of the illegal formation calls, as well as the offside on the field goal, but to no avail. Those occurred on back-to-back possessions late in the first half that helped end a Green Bay drive and give Minnesota three points for a 13-3 lead at intermission. The deficit then got worse when the Vikings scored a TD to open the second half. \"I'm not going to make excuses for it,\" LaFleur said of the flags. \"They saw it differently.\" Green Bay's defense was already shorthanded in the secondary due to injuries and then lost safety Zayne Anderson to a concussion early from a tackle on kickoff coverage. The thinning depth in the back end wasn't helped by a pass rush that struggled to get to Darnold, who was rarely pressured and sacked just once in 43 pass attempts. He completed an efficient 33 for 377 yards and three TDs, with one INT, for a 116.1 rating, generating several big gains downfield. \"You've got to get pressure on these guys if they're going to drop back that many times,\" LaFleur said. \"If you don't, it's going to be a long day. \"They've got a lot of weapons.\" Indeed, on a day the Packers stopped the Vikings' ground game for the most part (23 carries for 72 yards, not including kneel-downs), four pass catchers each compiled 68 or more yards for Darnold, led by Justin Jefferson with eight catches for 92 yards. Cornerback Carrington Valentine's interception in the third quarter set up running back Josh Jacobs' rushing touchdown to make it 20-10. Jacobs, who overcame the early fumble to gain 69 yards on 17 carries, scored a rushing TD for the seventh straight game, tying Paul Hornung's franchise record set in 1960. But the Vikings came right back with a touchdown to resume their 17-point lead. The Packers finally got going on offense, but it was sitting with just those 10 points through 3½ quarters that they most regret. LaFleur and QB Jordan Love discussed the Vikings playing more man coverage than they anticipated and the Packers being slow to adjust. But the other mistakes factored into missed chances, too, and the Packers were well under 200 yards of total offense until their two fourth-quarter TD drives. \"It's tough,\" said Love, who was 19-of-30 for 185 yards with a TD (to Malik Heath) and 91.7 rating. \"Obviously it ended up being a close game, but we know it's hard when you put yourself in a hole and are down early and shooting yourself in the foot. \"It's hard to get out of that hole, and when it's a good team like the Vikings that makes it even tougher.\" The loss dropped the Packers to 11-5 and took the No. 5 seed out of play for Green Bay. The Vikings improved to 14-2 and have a shot at the NFC's No. 1 seed and first-round bye when they play the Lions in the regular-season finale. Green Bay's seed will be determined, in part, by how Washington fares. The Commanders are also 11-5 following their Sunday night overtime win over the Falcons, and if they win in Week 18 over the Cowboys, they will be the No. 6 seed and the Packers will get the No. 7. If the Packers win and the Commanders lose, Green Bay gets the No. 6 seed. Regardless, the Packers already knew they'd have to be road warriors in the postseason, and that won't change no matter what happens against the Bears next week. \"That's going to be our reality,\" Love said. \"We're going to have to find ways when the playoffs start to go into these road atmospheres and win.\" Regrets galore upon return from Minnesota Week 18 to determine Green Bay's playoff seeding Team knows it's up to them to change the narrative after fourth division loss Green Bay's second-half rally not enough vs. Vikings It's almost do-or-die time Late rally by Green Bay comes up short Follow the Green Bay Packers vs. Minnesota Vikings game with live updates from U.S. Bank Stadium Team will rotate captains on a weekly basis Rookie safety back after missing last two games for Packers Green Bay Packers vs. Minnesota Vikings channel listing, radio & streaming options Green Bay announces roster move ahead of Sunday's matchup vs. Vikings COPYRIGHT © GREEN BAY PACKERS, INC.",

                "content": "Love would find Heath in the end zone just a few minutes later and the Packers had a real chance after cutting the lead to two in the final couple minutes of the game. MIN got the ball back and made a couple of gutsy calls to pass on plays that moved the chains and kept the clock running until the were able to kneel it and move to 14-2 on the year. That sets up an all or nothing finish to the regular season next week against the Detroit Lions. It's this simple: The winner gets the one seed and home field advantage, while the other gets the Wild Card and will most likely have to play all of their games on the road. The Packers turned it on in the final few minutes but it was much too little too late. Emanuel Wilson punched in the TD to give the Packers hope with just over 6 minutes to go. The Vikings responded with a professional drive to take back control of the game and stretch the lead back to a three possession game. Former Packer, Aaron Jones, carried the Vikes down field and set up this 9 yard TD for Cam Akers on the screen pass. Jones had 47 yards on 12 carries and Darnold finished the day with 3 TDs in another game that he had a +100 rating. Josh Jacobs was the only one producing on the offensive end for the Packers in the first three quarters, and he finally got into the end zone just a few plays after the Vikings only TO of the game. He ended the night with 69 yards, but almost all of those came in the first half. Just when it seemed like the Vikes were going to run away with it, Darnold made his only mistake of the game. He got picked off by Carrington Valentine and that gave the Packers a glimmer of hope for the final quarter and a half. The Packers would get held out of the end zone for the first 30 minutes and the Vikings stretched the lead out to 10 before the break. Coming out of the break, Minnesota stretched the lead out to a three possession advantage with another perfect pass from Darnold, this time to Jordan Addison. For some reason there are a lot of people who were doubting the Vikings, myself included. Maybe it's because they have a QB who has never been in this situation before, but Sam Darnold continues to show up in big games and in big moments and make big plays. He hit Jalen Nailor on the opening TD of the game with this beautiful 31 yard dime. The Minnesota Vikings are still in the hunt for the top seed in the NFC after a narrow win over the Green Bay Packers. Sam Darnold threw for 377 yards and 3 TDs in the 27-25 win. It was the Vikings defense setting the tone early, stripping Josh Jacobs on the first drive of the day and they would keep the Packers offense quiet for most of the night.

They do this often, lets see if they can get a quick TD early on. While all of the spotlight has been on Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry who swapped teams this offseason, Josh Jacobs should be getting just as much love. He is the fourth leading rusher in the league, with 1,216 yards and has 13 rushing TDs which is tied for second most in the league. The Packers let Aaron Jones go and picked up the league’s former leading rusher and it looks like the gamble is paying off. Sam Darnold was a forgotten quarterback after years of voyaging around the NFL for years. He was named the starter and no one could have expected him to have as much success as he’s having this year. He has thrown for 3,776 yards which is good enough for 7th in the league and his 32 TDs are 5th in the league but more importantly he has the Vikings in prime position to get the one seed in the NFC. We had no clue what to expect from the Vikings after letting Kirk Cousins go, but they put Sam Darnold in at QB1. All they did was be the last undefeated team in the league going 5-0 to start the season, but would lose two in a row against the Lions and the Rams and everyone thought the Vikings dream season was over. Since then they have won eight straight, but five of those came in one possession games. For a two win team, there are still some doubts surrounding this team, but if they win out in their final two games against the Packers and the Lions they get the top seed in the NFC. There was a lot expected of the Packers coming into this season after Green Bay went to the playoffs in Jordan Love’s first season as the QB1. They went to Brazil to start the game and lost to the Eagles and lost Love for a couple weeks to injury but Malik Willis manned the ship and led them to two wins his absence. Love returned for the Vikings game in Week 4, but they would lose that game by just 2 points. They would win 7 of their next 8 losing to the Lions once during that span and then again three weeks ago. The Packers have shown they are a good team but they have yet to beat a top team in the NFC. All four of their losses came to teams that are ahead of them in the NFC. Minnesota went in to Seattle and went back and forth with the Seahawks until the final tick of the clock. Sam Darnold threw two first half TDs to Jordan Addison and Justin Jefferson but Geno Smith matched that with a couple TD passes of his own but Minnesota went to half with a 17-14 lead. After a couple field goals on each side the Vikings led 20-17 heading into the 4th quarter, but Smith would put the home side up 24-20 with just 4:21 to go, but Sam Darnold would answer with a 39 yard bomb to Justin Jefferson just a minute later. Seattle would get two chances to tie or take the lead but they missed a field goal and Smith got intercepted for the second time to end the game. It was a bloodbath in the Frozen Tundra as the Packers hosted an injury plagued New Orleans team. Green Bay received the ball to start the game and dominated from the start to finish. They scored on their first three drives of the night going up 21-0 and didn’t look back from there. Jordan Love had 182 yards and a TD on 16/28 passing and the ground game combined for 188 yards as the starters got to sit and watch most of the 4th quarter as the Pack cruised to a 34-0 win. Hello everyone and welcome to Minnesota where both of these two teams are in the playoffs, but both are looking to improve their playoff position in the final two weeks of the season. The Vikings have chance for one seed if they win out but they have two tough games to finish the season starting with today’s match up against the Packers. Green Bay are coming off of their most complete game of the season and the first shutout of the NFL season against a banged up Saints team, but today’s matchup in Minnesota is going to be a whole other ball game. We have a massive matchup with all sorts of playoff implications from US Bank Stadium this afternoon. Two top teams in the conference, two division rivals and two teams gearing up for a deep postseason run will meet in Minnesota where there will be a playoff like atmosphere. It’s the Vikings hosting the Green Bay Packers and AS English will be with you all day long providing live coverage, stats, highlights and analysis of today’s Game of the Week on this penultimate Sunday of the season.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Vikings got a big lead on the rival Green Bay Packers back in September, going up 28-0 before nearly coughing up the advantage entirely. Three months later, they offered up a sequel for the U.S. Bank Stadium crowd, nearly surrendering a 27-10 fourth-quarter lead before outlasting their NFC North rivals for a critical 27-25 victory, their ninth straight on the 2024 season. Sam Darnold turned in an MVP-caliber performance to help Minnesota dominate much of the afternoon, while Brian Flores' defense suffocated Jordan Love and Co. until the final quarter, when Green Bay surged back to life thanks to a couple of surgical drives through the air. Vikings kicker Will Reichard also contributed to the game's close finish, missing two of four field goals while also failing to hit the landing zone on a kickoff, granting the Packers favorable field position. Sunday's anticipated showdown started slowly, with both sides trading stingy defensive stands, but Darnold settled in after feeding speedy wide receiver Jalen Nailor, who saw an uptick in opportunities with Green Bay zeroing in on star pass catcher Justin Jefferson. From there, he had little trouble spreading the ball to the array of weapons in Kevin O'Connell's lineup, with Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson all corralling at least five catches against a \"D\" missing star corner Jaire Alexander. Flores' group, meanwhile, all but rendered the Packers' pass game a non-factor early. Missing deep threat Christian Watson, Love managed just 45 yards through the air in the game's first two quarters, and while bruising back Josh Jacobs had a heavy workload up the middle, Green Bay spent most of the rematch playing catch-up. Things finally clicked late, with Love guiding a pair of fourth-quarter touchdown drives while feeding Romeo Doubs, but it was too little, too late. The win bumps the Vikings to 14-2 on the season and sets up a winner-take-all against the Lions in Week 18 for the NFC North title and home-field advantage. It also drops the Packers to 11-5 in the North. Take your pick of Darnold's pretty throws, basically. This one to Addison helped give Minnesota a 20-3 advantage, showcasing the quarterback's steadiness as a pocket-climber and downfield thrower: The Vikings (14-2) will close their 2024 season with a pivotal Week 18 rematch in Detroit, where they'll fight the Lions (13-2) for the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs, plus the NFC North crown. The Packers (11-5), meanwhile, will finish their regular season against the Chicago Bears (4-12), who fell to the Seattle Seahawks in an ugly 6-3 contest in Week 17. It wasn't pretty late, but Minnesota pulls it off, sealing the deal by getting a first down on a Sam Darnold-to-Cam Akers dump-off. Jordan Love's late-game heroics were strong, but it was too little, too late for Green Bay. The Vikings officially improve to 14-2, while the Packers drop to 11-5. What a finish. Wow. Down 20-3 earlier, the Packers are suddenly within two points after Jordan Love orchestrates a beautiful nine-play scoring series. Feeding his entire makeshift receiving corps, including Romeo Doubs, Bo Melton and Dontayvion Wicks, he ultimately hits Malik Heath over the middle for the score. It's now 27-25 Vikings, and Minnesota has a chance to seal it by moving the chains on the ensuing drive. But things suddenly look tight, and the Vikings' errors on the margins could come back to bite them; they had 12 men on the field on the Packers' score, and kicker Will Reichard's two field goal misses look even more glaring now. Don't turn this one off just yet. The Vikings have been dominating, but seemingly out of nowhere Matt LaFleur produces a nine-play, 67-yard scoring series headlined by a couple of long strikes from Jordan Love -- first to Bo Melton, then to Tucker Kraft. Josh Jacobs and Emanuel Wilson then share touches on the ground, with the latter powering forward for the score. It's 27-18 after Love finds Romeo Doubs for the two-point try, meaning Green Bay isn't done yet. Brian Flores' secondary nowhere to be found on this drive. The Vikings have a chance to go up 30-10, but Will Reichard bangs a 43-yard field goal off the uprights. He's now missed two of four field goal tries on the day. Probably the only blemish for Minnesota thus far. Green Bay has nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Down 27-10 with the clock ticking in the fourth, Jordan Love's pocket collapses and Andrew Van Ginkel sandwiches him for the sack to force a punt. That means the Packers went backwards two yards on their six-play series. They have just nine first downs on the day. We can't call this one yet, because the Pack did threaten a comeback against these Vikings despite falling behind 28-0 in their September meeting, but boy does this one look good for Minnesota. Sam Darnold is 21 of 22 on passes between the numbers against the Packers, per ESPN. In other words, the Vikings are absolutely killing it over the middle of the field. Green Bay not having Quay Walker and Jaire Alexander hasn't helped. It's partly why everything's coming up purple in this one. Everybody eats in Minnesota! Sam Darnold slings another beauty to Jordan Addison, who's up to six catches on the day, and after a couple of Aaron Jones tosses, Cam Akers gets the dump-off screen, fighting through a few would-be tacklers to reach the end zone and put the Vikings up 27-10. The Packers have no answers for the wide array of weapons. Minnesota now has 22 first downs to Green Bay's eight, and owns the time-of-possession battle 27:33 to 16:36. It's been a one-sided affair except for the one Darnold pick. Four plays after Carrington Valentine's interception of Sam Darnold, the Packers score their first touchdown of the day, feeding Josh Jacobs at the goal line. It's now 20-10 Vikings, and we've got ourselves a ballgame. Jeff Hafley's \"D\" had struggled to get off the field for a while, so perhaps this will turn the tide. Absolutely desperate for a big play, Green Bay gets one on the defensive side, baiting Sam Darnold into a sideline shot. Aiming for T.J. Hockenson with pressure in his face, Darnold instead zips it to Packers cornerback Carrington Valentine, with star safety Xavier McKinney also in the area. The much-needed takeaway puts Green Bay in scoring range about halfway through the third. Christian Watson's injury-related absence is being felt by the Packers offense. Jordan Love has just a single pass completion over 10 yards in this game. Nobody's really separating downfield, and while Matt LaFleur's focus has been on wearing down Minnesota with Josh Jacobs, that approach isn't necessarily ideal when you're down 20-3. The Packers need a splash play in a hurry. Jordan Love may have the most gifted arm in the NFC North, but it's yet to matter today. After finding Jalen Nailor for another big gain, Sam Darnold stands tall amid pressure off the edge and threads a perfect downfield end-zone shot to Jordan Addison, making up for an earlier deep shot that got broken up. Rookie safety Javon Bullard is on the wrong end of the pass coverage for Green Bay, and all of a sudden Minnesota leads this by three scores. That's passing touchdown No. 34 for Darnold on the year. Will Reichard misses from 55 yards out on a last-second field goal try, but the Packers get flagged for offsides, giving the Vikings a second chance at extra points. Reichard delivers from 50, and we go into the break with Minnesota up 10 points, owning a 13-3 advantage. Credit to Brian Flores' defense for really limiting the Jordan Love-led aerial attack thus far. Sam Darnold also looks especially sharp, even with Justin Jefferson blanketed by the Green Bay secondary, zipping some chain-moving darts into tight windows. Jalen Nailor is up to 59 yards on four catches as Sam Darnold's top target in lieu of Justin Jefferson drawing extra attention from the Packers. His latest reception, a 16-yarder, comes in a tight window and helps set up a 25-yard Will Reichard field goal, and we've got ourselves a 10-3 ballgame in favor of Minnesota. That scoring drive goes 69 yards over 10 plays. Halftime is fast approaching. Josh Jacobs gets a big workload on Green Bay's latest series, and the Packers push the rock to the Vikings 23, but on fourth-and-3, Jordan Love gets jumpy in the pocket and can't quite connect with Jayden Reed over the middle. Reed has yet to secure a catch on the day, and the ball goes back to Minnesota. Love is 7 of 11 for 45 yards so far, and only Dontayvion Wicks has more than one catch. Most of Matt LaFleur's attack has centered on Jacobs' bruising ground game. The Vikings are toughing it out. Injury alert: Vikings edge rusher Pat Jones II walks off after taking a shot to the knee from Packers tight end Tucker Kraft. Required some attention from trainers before limping his way to the sidelines. Justin Jefferson is getting almost no looks as the Packers focus their attention on the Vikings' top pass catcher, but that opens the door for Jalen Nailor, who outraces the entire Green Bay secondary for a 31-yard score. That's Sam Darnold's 33rd touchdown pass of the year, and it puts the Vikes up 7-3 in this one. Josh Jacobs rumbles into Minnesota territory with another strong dose of touches, but the Vikings hold firm inside the 10, with Josh Metellus stuffing Luke Musgrave on third down. So Green Bay goes up first but settles for a 22-yard field goal from Brandon McManus. It's 3-0 Packers at U.S. Bank Stadium. This one's been a gritty defensive affair thus far, with Brian Flores and Jeff Hafley both showcasing strong stuff. Jordan Addison burns Keisean Nixon on the outside for a potential score, but Sam Darnold floats it high rather than with velocity, and Nixon makes a leaping recovery to break up the connection. Then Will Reichard boots a field goal try from 57 yards out, and it bounces off the crossbar. So we're still at 0-0 here. Darnold is facing some heat up the middle from the Packers front. Green Bay takes to the air on its second series, perhaps as a response to Josh Jacobs' early fumble, and Jordan Love tries for three straight downfield shots, nearly connecting with Dontayvion Wicks. But the passes are just off, and the last one is nearly picked by Harrison Smith over the middle. So it's a punt, and the Vikings are back in control. Three drives so far, and three defensive stands. Josh Jacobs' fumble put Minnesota in a great position near midfield, but Jeff Hafley's defense shows up, putting pressure in Sam Darnold's face on back-to-back plays to force a punt. Kenny Clark got the first pressure, and Rashan Gary nearly came up with a sack on third down. Green Bay starts strong with a couple of tough Josh Jacobs carries and a quick first-down catch by Dontayvion Wicks, but then Jacobs coughs up the ball on a hit from Jerry Tillery. Vikings safety Cam Bynum (who else?) jumps on it, and we've got out first turnover already. Former Vikings Pro Bowl defensive lineman Pat Williams shows up at U.S. Bank Stadium to blow the pregame Gjallarhorn ahead of the opening kickoff. A \"Skol\" chant follows, and we're ready to go. The Packers win the coin toss and elect to receive the ball. It's Jordan Love up first in Minnesota. The fake snow is falling inside U.S. Bank Stadium as the Vikings and Packers prepare to take the field. Live from U.S. Bank Stadium, we've got you covered with all the key notes and analysis from today's matchup. First up: The Packers are without some big names in Minnesota, with Jaire Alexander, Christian Watson and Quay Walker among notable inactives. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. PHILADELPHIA -- In a battle of backup quarterbacks, the host Philadelphia Eagles (13-3) had the definitive edge over the Dallas Cowboys (7-9) as they dominated in a decisive 41-7 Week 17 victory. They clinched the 2024 NFC East division title with the win. It's their first division title since 2022, a year that ended with them as the Super Bowl runner up. It's also their 11th NFC East division title since 2001, which is the most in the division in that span. Philadelphia also now has their fourth ever 13-win season, which is key because they have reached the Super Bowl in each of the last three occurrences (2004, 2017, 2022). After two three-and-outs to start the game, the Eagles scored on their next six drives -- four touchdowns and two field goals. Philadelphia also secured its first sweep of the Cowboys since 2011. Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett, the 2022 first-round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers who is filling in for an injured Jalen Hurts (concussion), produced a strong performance. He threw for 143 yards and a touchdown on 10 of 15 passing while adding a 1-yard rushing score via the tush push to end the first half. He threw a 22-yard scoring strike to Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith with 6:38 left in the half after Smith cooked backup Cowboys corner Andrew Booth by multiple steps for the touchdown. Pickett exited the game early in the third quarter after aggravating his ribs injury on a late hit by Dallas defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa, who was penalized for roughing the passer. He clearly hit Pickett late after the football was gone. As a result, Eagles third-string quarterback Tanner McKee, a 2023 sixth-round pick out of Stanford, subbed into the game. McKee's first full drive ended with him throwing his first NFL regular-season touchdown pass to Eagles No. 1 receiver A.J. Brown on a 20-yard scoring strike. Brown got a stop on Cowboys All-Pro corner DaRon Bland, and McKee threw a perfectly placed pass over Brown's outside shoulder for the touchdown. That increased the Eagles' lead to 34-7 over the Cowboys with 2:44 left in the third quarter. He then hit Smith on an underneath throw, and he took the football all the way to the house with ease for a 25-yard receiving touchdown. McKee finished with 54 yards passing and two touchdowns on 3 of 4 passing, and Smith totaled 120 yards receiving and two touchdowns on six catches. Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush, their eight-year veteran backup who is filling in for an injured Dak Prescott (hamstring tear), played slightly better than his first start of the season back in Week 10, a 34-6 home defeat against the Eagles. He threw a 69-yard pick six to Philadelphia safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson on the opening drive of the game, but he bounced back to throw a 4-yard goal-line fade touchdown to Dallas wide receiver Jalen Tolbert on the game's second possession. At the end of the first half, Rush sailed a deep throw intended for wide receiver Brandin Cooks on third-and-5, and Gardner-Johnson picked him off for the second time. He returned the football down to the Eagles' 35-yard line with 36 seconds left in the half. It's Gardner-Johnson's second career game with multiple interceptions, and both have come against the Cowboys. Rush finished the game with 147 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions on 15 of 28 passing. With a massive lead, 2024 NFL rushing yards leader Saquon Barkley was able to take over in the second half. He went off for 167 yards on 31 carries Sunday afternoon to become the ninth player in NFL history to register at least 2,000 rushing yards in a single season. Here are the five main takeaways from the Eagles' Week 17 victory: The Eagles defense took a massive hit once Gardner-Johnson was ejected from last Sunday's loss to the Washington Commanders as a result of two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Gardner-Johnson's ejection certainly affected how the Eagles defense played Jayden Daniels, who was 16 of 24 for 150 yards and three touchdowns to one interception (105.9 passer rating) after the defender's disqualification. The Commanders scored 22 fourth-quarter points in the comeback victory, all with Gardner-Johnson off the field. Gardner-Johnson was back for this game and made an impact on the first series. On third-and-3 from the Eagles' 35-yard line, Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush threw a pass across the middle of the field and Gardner-Johnson read it for the interception. He took the takeaway 69 yards the other way for a touchdown to give the Eagles an early 7-0 lead with 11:55 remaining in the first quarter. Gardner-Johnson later had his second interception that set the Eagles up for a touchdown in the final seconds of the first half. The Eagles had three takeaways in the first half, all of which led to points. Even when Gardner-Johnson is struggling in coverage, he's making turnover-worthy plays for the Eagles to change the course of a game. In 28 games with the Eagles, Gardner-Johnson has 12 interceptions (6+ in each season played). He's a difference maker on this defense. Whatever the scripted game plan was in the first quarter of Pickett's start (filling in for Jalen Hurts as he was ruled out with a concussion), it wasn't what the Eagles were hoping for. A Landon Dickerson false start on the first play based the Eagles up to a first-and-15. Two incomplete passes and a checkdown to Kenneth Gainwell resulted in the first Eagles three-and-out. On the Eagles' second offensive possession, Pickett didn't even throw the football. With DeVonta Smith on the sidelines (wrist injury), the Eagles had Saquon Barkley carry the ball on three consecutive plays -- one via direct snap -- before choosing to punt on fourth-and-1 on their own 46-yard line. The decision to punt showed a lack of trust in Pickett to get the first down, with his arm or legs, or hand the ball off and get the first down. Six plays for 14 yards on the Eagles' first two series, and a lack of trust in Pickett. Different quarterback, same slow start. The Eagles opened things up for Pickett on the third drive, as he went 6 of 6 for 72 yards and a touchdown -- a 22-yard pass to DeVonta Smith. In the second quarter, 8 of 11 for 128 yards with a touchdown for a 141.5 passer rating. This doesn't include the rushing touchdown he had to get the Eagles up 24-7 at halftime. Pickett found an early connection with Smith once the Eagles opened up the passing game, hitting him three times for 74 yards and a score -- including a 49-yard pass to Smith that resulted in the 1-yard touchdown run just before the half. While it took the Eagles three series to get Pickett comfortable, opening things up for the quarterback certainly sparked the offense. Pickett left the game with a rib injury in the third quarter, yet the Eagles offense didn't miss a beat once third-string quarterback Tanner McKee entered the game. McKee, elevated to the No. 2 quarterback with Hurts out, threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to A.J. brown to put the Eagles up 34-7 late in the third quarter. The Eagles had a run-heavy offense once McKee entered the game with a big lead, yet he went 2 of 3 for 29 yards and a touchdown pass to Brown on his first series. He then followed with a 25-yard touchdown pass to DeVonta Smith on his second series, going 3 of 4 for 54 yards and two touchdowns for a 154.2 rating on his first two series. Whether it was Pickett or McKee, the Eagles offense was clicking from the second quarter on. Barkley reached the 2,000-yard rushing plateau on Sunday, becoming the ninth running back to amass 2,000 rushing yards in a season. He's eighth all-time for rushing yards in a season with 2,005. The chase is officially on in regards to Dickerson's record. Barkley finished with 31 carries for 167 yards, averaging 5.4 yards per carry. putting himself in striking distance of the mark. Dickerson rushed for 2,105 yards in 1984 and Barkley is 101 yards away from passing him. Barkley is averaging 125.3 rushing yards per game this season, which would put him on pace to pass Dickerson. Will the Eagles play him in Week 18? The 2,000-yard plateau was a goal of Barkley's and he achieved it. Just 101 yards away from Dickerson is approachable, even if the Eagles do play a meaningless game in Week 18. One of the hardest records in sports is Dickerson's rushing record. This mark can be broken if the Eagles decide to play barkley in Week 18, but it will likely be his call. The Cowboys have inserted 2021 third overall pick quarterback Trey Lance into the game with 2:24 left to play. Cowboys wide receiver Jalen Brooks and Cowboys cornerback Troy Pride, along with Eagles cornerback Sidney Brown, were ejected for fighting. Cowboys All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey drills a 61-yard field goal off the right upright for a missed field goal. The Eagles take over at the Cowboys' 49 up 41-7 with 4:40 left to play. Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith caught an underneath pass from Tanner McKee and left the Dallas defense in the dust for a 25-yard receiving touchdown, his second score of the day. The Eagles lead 41-7 with 10:03 left to play. Utter domination. Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is now up to 2,005 rushing yards, and he is the ninth player in NFL history to run for over 2,000 yards in a single season. Dallas commits their fourth turnover of the day with running back Rico Dowdle fumbling on third-and-5. Philadelphia linebacker Nolan Smith forced the fumble, and Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean recovered the loose ball. Philadelphia takes over at their own 25 up 34-7 with 14:20 left in the game. Tanner McKee threw his first NFL regular season touchdown pass to Eagles No. 1 receiver A.J. Brown for a 20-yard scoring strike. Brown got a step on Cowboys All-Pro corner DaRon Bland, and McKee threw a perfectly placed pass over Brown's outside shoulder for the touchdown. The Eagles lead 34-7 over the Cowboys with 2:44 left in the third quarter. Eagles backup quarterback Kenny Pickett (ribs) is officially questionable to return. He initially suffered a ribs injury a week ago against the Washington Commanders. Third-string quarterback Tanner McKee is primed to lead this drive after the Cowboys went run-run-pass for a three-and-out on their latest drive. The Eagles lead 27-7 with 6:34 left in the third quarter. An A.J. Brown receiving touchdown gets nullified by a holding penalty on Landon Dickerson trying to contain Cowboys All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons. Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett suffered an injury on the play, and Philadelphia subbed in third-stringer Tanner McKee to take the snap on third-and-goal from the Cowboys' 17. He handed off to Barkley for a gain of nine, and the Eagles took three more points on a 26-yard field goal. Philadelphia leads 27-7 with 8:03 left in the third quarter. The Eagles are marching up the field with ease to start the second half. Following a near interception by Pickett, it's been all runs by Saquon Barkley. A disaster for Dallas on their last drive of the half. Quarterback Cooper Rush sailed a deep throw intended for wide receiver Brandin Cooks on third-and-5, and Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson picked off Rush for the second time. He returned the football down to the Eagles' 35 with 36 seconds left in the half. It's Gardner-Johnson's second career game with multiple interceptions, and both have come against the Cowboys. Philly extends their lead to 10, 17-7, following Jake Elliott's 31-yard field. They can double dip with points since they start the second half with the football. Dallas has 1:55 on the clock and one timeout left. The Cowboys commit their second turnover of the half with tight end Jake Ferguson getting stripped by Eagles linebacker Oren Burks. Philadelphia defensive tackle Jordan Davis recovered the loose ball for the takeaway. Philadelphia takes over at the Cowboys' 39 up 14-7 with 6:27 left to play. The Eagles crowd is now chanting \"Dallas sucks.\" Dallas' lack of depth at cornerback because of injuries was just on full display. Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith cooked backup corner Andrew Booth with ease, getting open by multiple steps, which is how Philadelphia fill-in quarterback Kenny Pickett was able to hit him for a 22-yard touchdown. Philadelphia is back in front by seven, 14-7, with 6:38 left in the first half. The Cowboys take a deep shot down the left sideline to wide receiver Jonathan Mingo on third-and-1 instead of running with Dowdle, and it doesn't work. Mingo cooked Eagles first-round rookie corner Quinyon Mitchell, but he couldn't track Rush's throw. That led to the football harmlessly hitting the ground for an incompletion. Dallas punts it away, and Philadelphia fair-caught the football at their own 19. It's seven to seven with 12:49 left in the first half. After NFL rushing yards leader Saquon Barkley didn't touch the football on the Eagles' opening drive, the Eagles gave up three consecutives runs. However, he netted nine yards, and the Eagles punted the football away for a touchback. Philadelphia decided they would take their chances vs. Cooper Rush instead of potentially giving Dallas a short field if they bungled a fourth down attempt with Kenny Pickett at quarterback. It's a 7-7 game with 56 seconds left in the first quarter. Dallas goes three-and-out up against their own goal line, and they punt it away. The Cowboys got good hang time on the punt, so they were able to limit returner Cooper DeJean to just a yard on the return. The Eagles will have their second offensive possession starting at their own 37 in a 7-7 game with 2:48 left in the first quarter. Following a first down false start penalty, Eagle backup quarterback Kenny Pickett threw two consecutive incompletions, and then a short five-yarder to running back Kenneth Gainwell. Philadelphia goes three-and-out to start, and Dallas gets the football back on their own nine after a 52-yard punt by the Eagles. Eagles edge rusher Bryce Huff (shoulder) is questionable to return. Cooper Rush bounced back in a big way from his pick-six by capping the Cowboys' ensuing drive with a four-yard touchdown pass on a goal line fade to wide receiver Jalen Tolbert. Dallas continues to fight for head coach Mike McCarthy. This game is tied at seven with 5:38 left in the first quarter. Kenny Pickett and the Eagles offense will take the field for the first time today up next. With All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb out, Brandin Cooks is the Cowboys' clear cut No. 1 option in the passing game early on. Quarterback Cooper Rush has targeted him five times already, and Cooks has hauled in two of them for 38 yards, including 22 yards on the last play to move the chains on a third-and-9. Cooper Rush had been on a roll with wins in four of the last five games, which included a stretch of nine touchdowns to one interception, but he makes a critical error on the opening drive. He looked to force the football to Brandin Cooks on a third-and-3, but Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson jumped the route and took it all the way back for a 69-yard pick-six. It's Philadelphia's first defensive touchdown of the season, and the Eagles now lead 7-0 with 11:43 left in the first quarter. The Cowboys offense led by quarterback Cooper Rush and running back Rico Dowdle start with the football first. Cowboys three-time All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons has helped power a defensive renaissance in Dallas sparked by his return from his high ankle sprain along with an increased comfort in defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer's scheme in his first season working with the Cowboys defense after playing the last three under Dan Quinn, who is now the Washington Commanders head coach. He leads the NFL in both sacks (8.5) and quarterback pressures (42) since Week 10, and as a result, the Cowboys defense is one of the NFL's most disruptive in that span, ranking top five in the entire NFL in third down conversion rate allowed (35%, fifth-best in the NFL), sacks (28, best in the NFL), sack rate (10.4%, best in the NFL), quarterback pressure rate (39.3%, fifth-best in the NFL) and takeaways (15, tied for the second-most in the NFL). Cowboys All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey has made 36 field goals thus far in 2024. With just one more made field goal on Sunday in Philadelphia, Aubrey will set the franchise single season record for makes in a season, which would break a tie with his own record of 36 that he set in his first year last season in 2023. Cowboys running back Rico Dowdle is 97 rushing yards away from his first 1,000-yard season. If he accomplishes the feat on Sunday in Philadelphia, it would make him the first undrafted player in Cowboys history to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. Since Week 9, Dowdle ranks second in the NFL with 494 rushing yards after contract, trailing only Saquon Barkley's 566 in that span, according to Pro Football Focus. Dallas Cowboys three-time All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons knows he gave the Philadelphia Eagles (12-3), Dallas' Week 17 opponent, bulletin board material last week. \"Nah, at this point, it's f--- Philly, now,\" Parsons said on Dec. 19. \"Even if we got eliminated, like, I got to crush Philly. F--- them. I hate them now. I be seeing them just talking so much on socials. I don't know, my Twitter page got consumed by Philly [fans]. Man, ugh. They say don't look forward to some things, but I'm excited about the matchup [next week in Week 17], too.\" This Thursday, he acknowledged that beating the Eagles on Sunday would \"probably\" make their year. \"That probably makes the year you know what I'm saying? That sets everything off,\" Parsons said when asked how it would feel to beat the Eagles on Sunday. \"Us getting that win, away game in Philly. Knowing how they're trying to get the No. 1 seed. Can set them back a little bit. They're fighting for everything. They're fighting for where they want to be in the playoffs. We're just fighting to whoop them. They got more to lose than we do, so that'll be a great feeling right there.\" Check out his full remarks below. After two consecutive losses in Rush's first two starts this season versus the Eagles (34-6) and versus the Houston Texans (34-10), Dallas has won four of their last five games with Rush under center. His play has definitely picked up in this stretch. Rush has thrown for nine touchdowns and just one interception while averaging 226.2 passing yards per game and 6.9 yards per pass attempt with a 64.4% completion percentage in that stretch. That's good for a 100.5 passer rating since Week 12, 12th in the league in that span. The Dallas Cowboys have won and covered in four of their last five games. Cowboys Last 5 Games Covered? Week 12 +10.5 at Commanders Yes Week 13 -4 vs Giants Yes Week 14 +4.5 vs Bengals No Week 15 +2.5 at Panthers Yes Week 16 +4.5 vs Buccaneers Yes The Dallas Cowboys (7-8), who were eliminated from postseason contention last week, have gotten hot of late with victories in four of their last five games. Despite being eliminated, head coach Mike McCarthy and his staff, who are in the final season of their current coaching contracts, aren't looking to simply play the young guys. Their mindset is still to seek wins first and foremost, which is why McCarthy is still starting a 31-year-old career backup in Cooper Rush over 2021 third overall pick quarterback Trey Lance. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. PHILADELPHIA (AP) Nick Sirianni wore the hat given to NFC East champions as he sat at the podium and considered all the greatness that his Eagles still could accomplish this season. Personal goals, sure. Saquon Barkley has Eric Dickerson's NFL rushing record in sight. Team goals, absolutely. There are playoff games and a Super Bowl to try and win - and this Philadelphia team sure plays like one that could win it all. “It’s cool, I’m not going to downplay it,\" Barkley said of the division crown. “At the end of the day, you’re not getting remembered for being a 2024 NFC East division champ.” Barkley rushed for 167 yards to top 2,000 on the season, backup quarterback Kenny Pickett ran and threw for scores before departing with injured ribs, and the Eagles clinched the division title by routing the Dallas Cowboys 41-7 on Sunday. Barkley has 2,005 yards and needs 101 in next Sunday's mostly meaningless regular-season finale to top Dickerson and his 2,105 yards for the Los Angeles Rams in 1984. The Eagles (13-3) led 24-7 in the third quarter when Pickett was drilled by defensive end Micah Parsons, ending his first start in place of the concussed Jalen Hurts. Tanner McKee, a career third-stringer, entered the game and the Eagles finished the drive with a field goal. McKee later threw two TD passes, a 20-yarder to A.J. Brown and a 25-yarder to DeVonta Smith, in front of a roaring crowd delighted to watch the Eagles dominate their rivals to wrap up the division title and at least the No. 2 seed in the NFC. “We always want to do special things. I think winning the division is always a special thing, and then our goals are much bigger from here,” Sirianni said. “I think we’ve got special guys.” Hurts was injured in last week's loss at Washington and remains in the NFL's concussion protocol - he didn’t practice all week -- which opened the door for Pickett to start. Pickett, acquired from Pittsburgh in the offseason, played with extra protection under his jersey after he suffered a rib injury when he was pressed into service against the Commanders. Sore ribs or not, Pickett was pumped for this start all week. He was raised a diehard Eagles fan in central New Jersey about 80 miles from Lincoln Financial Field and recalled “great memories” of going to games with his dad and grandfather since he was 5 years old. The 26-year-old Pickett said he had plenty of family at the Linc to cheer him on against Dallas (7-9). More than 60,000 other Eagles rooted him on, too, but Pickett's dream day ended prematurely. He finished 10 of 15 for 143 yards. With the Eagles no longer having a division title to play for, it's likely Hurts will rest another week ahead of the playoffs. Now, Pickett could be sidelined as well - possibly forcing McKee into the starting lineup. Barkley had 31 carries and his last one went for 23 yards to push him over 2,000. He could also sit out rather than risk injury chasing Dickerson's record. Barkley, who left the Giants and signed a three-year deal with the Eagles for $26 million guaranteed, set the NFL mark for most yards rushing in a player's first season with a new team. The friends and family that traveled to see Pickett play had to wait a bit after Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson returned an interception 69 yards for a score on Dallas’ opening drive. Cooper Rush - who threw for 147 yards and had two interceptions - followed on the next drive for Dallas with a 4-yard TD pass to Jalen Tolbert. Pickett connected with Grant Calcaretta for 34 yards and then hit Smith - who had six catches total for 120 yards - for a 22-yard score and a 14-7 lead. The Eagles' defense broke the game open when a recovered fumble led to Jake Elliott’s 31-yard field goal and Gardner-Johnson’s second pick of the day set up Pickett's rushing score on a tush push. Just like Hurts. Pickett took two tough shots on the same drive on the third: Osa Odighizuwa was flagged for roughing the passer on a late hit and Parsons delivered the knockout blow. The Eagles were thrilled to have a capable backup QB who went 14-10 as a starter with the Steelers. His performance prompted Pittsburgh legend and Fox broadcaster Terry Bradshaw to say the Steelers never should have gotten rid of him. “All I wanted to accomplish today was to get the win, for the team, for the city,” Pickett said. The injury-depleted Cowboys had won four of five but were no match for Philadelphia. “We knew it was going to be a different game with the plan this week,” Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy said. “To be honest with you, we didn’t really get to some of the things we’d hope to get to.” The teams scuffled late in the game, and Eagles defensive back Sydney Brown was ejected after an altercation in a stadium tunnel. Cowboys wide receiver Jalen Brooks and cornerback Troy Pride were also thrown out. Cowboys: S Donovan Wilson suffered a knee injury. ... All-Pro WR CeeDee Lamb was shut down for the final two weeks with a sprained right shoulder. Eagles: DE Bryce Huff briefly left with a shoulder injury sustained in his first game back since he was activated off the injured list. He had wrist surgery. The Cowboys host Washington next Sunday in their final game of the season. The Eagles tune up for the playoffs with a home game against the Giants next Sunday. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/dallas-cowboys The Cowboys were blown out by the Eagles on Sunday Jerry Jones and the Dallas Cowboys are likely counting down the days until the end of the season after another low point on Sunday. America's Team were blown out by the Philadelphia Eagles, who clinched the NFC East in style with a 41-7 victory. The loss meant little for the Cowboys in terms of their season as they entered the game having already been eliminated from playoff contention, though it still had to sting to lose to a rival in such humiliating fashion. Related: Dallas was outgained 376 to 268, and also turned the ball over four times compared to Philly's zero. Unsurprisingly, Eagles fans, who are known for being ruthless, made sure to let Jones have it as his team struggled on the field. While the 82-year-old was in the luxury box trying to watch the game, Eagles fans took aim at the owner and team. \"Keep doing the job you're doing this year,\" one fan told Jones in a video that has emerged on social media. The video has sparked plenty of talk on social media, with one fan responding: \"No way this dude didn't understand that was sarcasm.\" Another wrote: \"That eagles fan is having a good laugh with his buddies right now.\" \"What did they do in the off season to improve that team? Nothing,\" another wrote. \"Sounds exactly like an Eagles fan!,\" added another. After the game coach Mike McCarthy, who's future with the team remains a huge talking point, stated that the Cowboys weren't able to do many of the things they wanted to given how the game played out. \"We knew it was going to be a different game with the plan this week,\" he said. \"To be honest with you, we didn't really get to some of the things we'd hope to get to.\" The Cowboys close out their season against the Washington Commanders on Sunday. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

                "content": "The Eagles rocked the Kelly Green uniforms at Lincoln Financial Field as they clinched the NFC East with a 41-7 victory over the Cowboys. Saquon Barkley eclipsed the 2,000-yard mark on a 23-yard run in the fourth quarter and the franchise-record (2,146 by LeSean McCoy in 2013) for scrimmage yards in a season early in the game. He needed 33 yards to break the scrimmage record going into today. \"I'm not going to lie, but just being a fan of the game and the running back position, to reach a milestone and put myself up there with eight other backs that I respect, and some of them I grew up watching, definitely means a lot. But at the same time, I wouldn't be able to do that without this team. Like I said, you can't be great without the greatness of others, and I'm just happy I was able to be a part of the team and be able to reach a milestone like that,\" Barkley said after the game. Philadelphia was without star quarterback Jalen Hurts, who suffered a concussion last week against Washington. Linebacker Nakobe Dean was also out with an abdomen injury. Kenny Pickett made his first start as an Eagle and went 10/15 for 143 yards and touchdown before leaving the game with a rib injury. Tanner McKee came in for the second half as the Eagles held a big lead and went 3/4 for 54 yards and two touchdowns.

Get ready for a home playoff game at Lincoln Financial Field during Wild Card Weekend. The NFC East Champions will host their division rival in the regular-season finale. The Eagles' 41-7 triumph over the rival Cowboys featured everything that has made this a 13-win team with one week remaining in the regular season. Pickett and McKee combined for three touchdowns and a 141.9 passer rating in the 41-7 win. Linebacker Nakobe Dean is out with an abdomen injury. The Eagles (12-3) return to Lincoln Financial Field for the first of two home games to close out the regular season. A win guarantees more company at home into the postseason, while Dallas (7-8) is relishing the role of spoiler. The Eagles can clinch the NFC East with a win or tie on Sunday. This is the second straight year that Allen is among the 15 finalists for induction into Canton. The Eagles also elevated running back Tyrion Davis-Price and linebacker Dallas Gant from the practice squad for Sunday's game. Britain Covey, Jalen Hurts, and Will Shipley are out for Sunday. Nakobe Dean is doubtful with an abdomen injury. Copyright © 2024 Philadelphia Eagles. All rights reserved.",

                "content": "Saquon Rasul Quevis Barkley[1] (/ˈseɪkwɒn/ SAY-kwon; born February 9, 1997) is an American professional football running back for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions, where he set several school records for his offensive production over three seasons, before forgoing his senior year to enter the NFL. In 2017, Barkley finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting with 304 total votes, third in Maxwell Award voting, and received multiple national and Big Ten Conference awards and recognition. During his three-year collegiate career, Barkley set Penn State records for most all-purpose career yards (5,538), most career rushing touchdowns (43), most career receiving yards by a running back (1,157), most rushing yards by a freshman and sophomore, and most total yards in a single game. Barkley was selected second overall by the New York Giants in the 2018 NFL draft, setting several NFL and team records en route to making the 2018 Pro Bowl and being named the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. He confronted injuries in the 2020 season, but was again named to the Pro Bowl in 2022. A free agent following the 2023 season, Barkley signed a three-year deal with the Eagles, setting numerous franchise records and rushing for over 2,000 yards in his first season with the team. Barkley was born in Bronx, New York, the son of Alibay Barkley, a boxer, and Tonya Johnson. He has three brothers and two sisters. His brother Alibay Jr. was a baseball player drafted by the Los Angeles Angels, and his great uncle is former WBC middleweight champion Iran Barkley.[2] In 2001, Barkley and his family moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley in search of a safer and more suburban environment.[3] The family later moved to neighboring Allentown and, in 2005, to Coplay, Pennsylvania.[4] Barkley attended Whitehall High School in Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania, which competes in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, an elite division of large high schools in the Lehigh Valley and Poconos known nationally for producing a large number of NFL and other professional athletes.[5] At Whitehall High School, Barkley rushed for 3,646 yards with 63 touchdowns from his sophomore to senior year, including 1,856 yards and 31 touchdowns as a senior.[6] Barkley was rated as a four-star recruit and committed to Penn State to play college football.[7][8] He originally committed to Rutgers before changing to Penn State.[9] In addition to football, Barkley also lettered in basketball and track and field at Whitehall. As a senior in 2015, he won Eastern Pennsylvania Conference gold medals in both the 100-meter dash (11.15 seconds) and in the long jump (22'2.5\" or 6.77m) at the PIAA District 11 meet, where he also earned a second-place finish in the 100-meter dash with a time of 10.90 seconds, which set a Whitehall High School record.[10] Later in the track and field season, Barkley set personal best marks of 46'2.5\" (14.08m) in the shot put and 6'0\" (1.83m) in the high jump.[11] Barkley was considered a top NCAA Division I football prospect and received multiple football scholarship offers, including from Missouri, North Carolina, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Pitt, Rutgers, Syracuse, and Temple. He chose to accept an offer from Penn State.[12] Sources: On September 10, 2021, Whitehall High School retired Barkley's jersey number (#21). Earlier, the school had retired the jersey numbers of two other alumni who went on to have successful NFL careers: Matt Millen, who played from 1980 until 1991 with the Oakland and Los Angeles Raiders, the San Francisco 49ers, and the Washington Redskins; and Dan Koppen, who played from 2003 until 2013 with the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos.[13] At Penn State, Barkley earned immediate playing time as a true freshman in 2015.[14] After rushing for one yard on one carry during his first game, he rushed for 115 yards with a touchdown in his second game against Buffalo.[15] He followed up that performance by rushing for 195 yards and two touchdowns on 21 carries in his third game against Rutgers.[16] In October, he missed two games due to injury.[17] In his first game back against top-ranked Ohio State on October 17, 2015, he rushed for 194 yards on 26 carries.[18][19] During his freshman year at Penn State in 2015, Barkley rushed for 1,076 yards on 182 carries.[20] During the offseason, Barkley received praise for his freshman year performance and was awarded second-team All-Big Ten with some votes for first team status and being named BTN.com Freshman of the Year.[21] In the first game of his sophomore year at Penn State in 2016, Barkley rushed for 105 yards and a touchdown in a 33–13 win over Kent State.[22] In week two, in a renewed rivalry game against Pitt, Penn State trailed in the second quarter 28–7 before Barkley led Penn State back, scoring five touchdowns with his fifth coming with 5:00 left in the fourth quarter, to bring the Nittany Lions within three points. However, quarterback Trace McSorley threw an interception in the Pitt end zone with 1:41 left that denied the Nittany Lions' hopes of completing the comeback.[23] In week five against Minnesota, in what would become a recurring theme for the 2016 Penn State football team, Penn State again was forced to come back from a halftime deficit. In overtime, after being held to only 38 yards on 19 carries during regular playing time, Barkley's first play in overtime, a 25-yard touchdown run, gave Penn State the victory.[24] In week six against Maryland, Barkley had his first ever 200-yard rushing game at Penn State, finishing with 31 carries for 202 yards and one touchdown.[25] In week seven, in a matchup versus Ohio State, Barkley rushed for 99 yards on 12 carries with one 37 yard run in a 24–21 win over the second ranked Buckeyes.[26] In week eight, Barkley and no. 24 Penn State scored a season high 62 points versus Purdue as Barkley rushed for a career-high 207 yards and a career-high long 81 yard run, along with 70 yards in receiving yards and two touchdowns, giving him a total of 277 yards in the game. Penn State defeated Purdue 62–24 and improved to 6–2 and 4–1 in Big Ten play.[27] On November 1, 2016, Barkley was named a semi-finalist for the Maxwell Award, granted to the all-around best collegiate football player of the year.[28] On November 5, Barkley rushed for 167 yards and a touchdown against Iowa. He added 44 yards and another touchdown in receiving for a total of 211 all-purpose yards in Penn State's 41–14 victory.[29] After the regular season, Barkley was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, Ameche–Dayne Running Back of the Year and First Team All-Big Ten.[30] On December 3, 2016, Barkley had 19 carries for 83 yards, rushed for a touchdown, and caught another touchdown on a wheel route. His efforts helped Penn State recover from a 28–7 deficit to stun Wisconsin, 38–31, in the 2016 Big Ten Championship Game.[31] In the 2017 Rose Bowl on January 2, Barkley had 25 carries for 194 yards, averaging 7.8 yards per carry, including a 79-yard rushing touchdown that gave Penn State a 28–27 lead. After trailing 13–0, Penn State scored seven touchdowns on seven consecutive possessions, including four touchdowns on four consecutive offensive plays, including Barkley's 79-yard touchdown. Barkley scored the first, fourth, and seventh touchdowns for Penn State, giving the Nittany Lions a 49–35 lead in the fourth quarter, though USC ultimately went on to win the game, 52–49.[32] At the close of his sophomore year at Penn State, Barkley had set Penn State records for most rushing yards in a season by a freshman (1,076) and by a sophomore (1,496). In the first game of the 2017 season against Akron, Barkley ran 14 times for 172 yards, two rushing touchdowns, and a long run of 80 yards. He also caught two passes for 54 receiving yards. For his efforts, Barkley was named co-Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week.[33] In Penn State's 2017 Big Ten opener, at Iowa, Barkley led Penn State to a 21–19 win, recording 358 all-purpose yards. He also set a school record for most all-purpose yards in a single game, recording 211 rushing yards, a rushing touchdown, 94 receiving yards, and 53 kick return yards.[34] For his efforts, Barkley was again named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week.[35] In the first Big Ten home game of his junior year against the Indiana, Barkley rushed 20 times for just 56 yards, an unusually underwhelming rushing day for him. Despite this, he still had a major impact on the game, returning the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown, catching four passes for 52 yards, and throwing a 16-yard pass to receiver DaeSean Hamilton late in the fourth quarter to cap a 45–14 Penn State win. This made Barkley the first player in Big Ten history to record a return and passing touchdown in the same game.[36] Barkley was named Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week.[36] One month later against Ohio State, Barkley again returned the opening kickoff back 97 yards for a touchdown, but was limited for the rest of the game recording 44 rushing yards on 21 carries, 36 of which came on a touchdown run in the second quarter.[37] In his final collegiate game at Penn State, Barkley rushed for 137 yards and scored two touchdowns, one of them a 92-yard effort to put Penn State up 28–7 over the Washington Huskies in the 2017 Fiesta Bowl, which Penn State went on to win 35–28.[38] On December 31, 2017, following Penn State's Fiesta Bowl victory, Barkley declared his intention to forgo his senior year at Penn State and enter the 2018 NFL draft.[39] Penn State: Entering the 2018 NFL draft, Barkley was widely projected to be a top 10 NFL pick.[39] In the weeks leading up to the NFL Combine, Barkley's stock rose even higher. By late February 2018, some mock drafts projected him as high as the second selection overall,[64] the highest for a running back since Reggie Bush in 2006. ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr., who has history of not supporting the selection of running backs in the NFL draft's first round, said \"Barkley is a once in a lifetime talent; teams that pass on this young man will be sorry.\"[65] At the combine, Barkley had a performance that was widely praised, running a 4.4 second 40-yard dash and doing 29 bench presses of 225 pound weight, tying for the most reps by any running back at this combine.[66] According to NFL analyst Ian Rapoport, the Cleveland Browns were \"strongly considering\" drafting Barkley first overall, which would have made him the first running back since Ki-Jana Carter in 1995 to be selected first overall.[67] Barkley was selected by the New York Giants with the second overall selection in the 2018 draft.[69] On July 22, 2018, Barkley signed a four-year rookie contract, worth $31.2 million fully guaranteed.[70] Barkley scored his first NFL touchdown, a 68-yard rush, in the season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Overall in his first NFL game, he rushed for 106 yards and scored a touchdown in the Giants' 20–15 loss.[71] The following week, in a 20–13 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, Barkley recorded 14 receptions, setting a Giants' all-time franchise record for most catches in a game. He also tied the NFL single game record for most catches in a game by an NFL rookie.[72] In Week 3, in the Giants' 27–22 victory over the Houston Texans, Barkley recorded 82 rushing yards, rushed for a touchdown, and caught five passes for 35 receiving yards.[73] The following week, in the Giants' loss to the New Orleans Saints, Barkley recorded 100 scrimmage yards with 44 rushing yards and 56 receiving yards and a rushing touchdown.[74] In Week 5, against the Carolina Panthers, he recorded four receptions for 81 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns and rushed for 48 yards in the Giants' 33–31 loss.[75] In the Giants' Week 6 Thursday Night Football game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Barkley finished with 130 rushing yards, including a 50-yard touchdown and 99 receiving yards, totaling 229 all-purpose yards in the Giants 34–13 loss to Philadelphia.[76] In Week 11 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Barkley rushed for his NFL career-high to date with 142 yards and three touchdowns as the Giants won 38–35,[77][78] and for his efforts he was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[79] In Week 12's 25–22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Barkley rushed for 101 yards and scored a 51-yard touchdown, becoming the first player since John Fuqua in 1970 to rush for two 50-plus yard touchdowns against the Eagles in a single season.[80][81] In Week 13 against the Chicago Bears, Barkley had 125 rushing yards and three receptions for 21 yards in the 30–27 overtime win.[82][83] During Week 14, in the Giants' 40–16 win over the Redskins, Barkley rushed for 170 yards, including a 78-yard touchdown, becoming the first Giants rookie to surpass 1,000 rushing yards in a season, and setting the franchise's single-season record for rookies with 15 touchdowns scored.[84] In the regular season finale against the Dallas Cowboys, Barkley had 17 carries for 109 yards, his seventh game with over 100 rushing yards on the season, and he scored a touchdown in the Giants' 36–35 loss.[85] In recognition of his rookie season accomplishments, Barkley was elected to the 2019 Pro Bowl, where he helped the NFC win the Skills Showdown.[86] Barkley received numerous awards during and after his rookie season, including Pepsi Rookie of the Year,[87] FedEx Ground NFL Player of the Year,[88] AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year[89] and was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team and AP All-Rookie teams.[90] Entering his second NFL season, Barkley was ranked No. 16 on the NFL's Top 100 players for 2019.[91][92] Barkley was chosen by his teammates as one of seven team captains for the 2019 season, an honor rarely bestowed on players after only one year on the team.[93] In Week 1 against the Cowboys, Barkley rushed 11 times for 120 yards, including a 59-yard run, in the Giants' 35–17 loss.[94] In this game, he fumbled the ball for the first time in his NFL career. In Week 2 against the Buffalo Bills, Barkley rushed 18 times for 107 yards and a touchdown and caught three passes for 28 yards in the Giants' 28–14 loss to Buffalo.[95] In Week 3 against the Buccaneers, Barkley suffered a high ankle sprain and was expected to miss four to eight weeks.[96] Barkley made his return from the injury in Week 7 against the Arizona Cardinals. In the game, Barkley rushed 18 times for 72 yards and a touchdown in the Giants' 27–21 loss.[97] In Week 8 against the Detroit Lions, Barkley rushed for a season-high 19 times and 64 yards and caught a season-high eight passes for 79 yards and a touchdown in the team's 31–26 loss.[98] In Week 15 against the Miami Dolphins, Barkley rushed 24 times for 112 yards and two touchdowns and caught four passes for 31 yards in the Giants' 36–20 win.[99] In Week 16, Barkley rushed for a career high 189 yards on 22 carries and caught four passes for 90 yards and two total touchdowns in a 41–35 win over the Redskins.[100] He won the NFC Offensive Player of the Week award for his performance in Week 16.[101] In Week 17 against the Eagles, Barkley rushed 17 times for 92 yards, including a season-long 68-yard run that resulted in a touchdown, during the Giants' 34–17 loss to Philadelphia.[102] Barkley finished his sophomore season as the only running back in Giants' history to have 1,000 rushing yards in their first two seasons.[103] He was ranked 31st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[104] In Week 1 against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday Night Football, Barkley rushed 15 times for six rushing yards and caught six passes for 60 receiving yards in the Giants' 26–16 loss to the Steelers.

                "content": "The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, an arena they share with the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League.[10] The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA with 17 championships, the second most in the league behind the Boston Celtics.[11] The franchise began in 1946 as the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL).[12] After one season, a new ownership relocated the team to Minneapolis, Minnesota,[13][12] and renamed the team as the Minneapolis Lakers.[14] The Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America, where they won the 1949 BAA championship. Following the merger of the NBL and the BAA into the NBA in 1949, the Lakers won four of the next five NBA championships.[15] After struggling financially in the late 1950s, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season. The Lakers made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost every series to the Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain, and won their sixth NBA title in 1972, led by coach Bill Sharman. After the retirement of Chamberlain, the team traded for superstar Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Two big changes came in 1979, first, Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers, and pioneered a vision of basketball as entertainment as well as sport.[16] Second, the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson first overall in the 1979 NBA draft. The combination of Johnson, a prodigy point guard, and dominant center in Abdul-Jabbar provided the Lakers with superstars to anchor their roster. The promotion of head coach Pat Riley in 1981 and addition of forward James Worthy through the 1982 draft established the Lakers as an NBA powerhouse throughout the 1980s. The franchise won five championships in a nine-year span, including two out of three marquee Finals matchups against the Celtics. The Lakers were defeated by their Boston archrivals in the 1984 Finals, but triumphed over them in 1985 and 1987. After Riley departed and Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, and Worthy retired, the Lakers struggled in the early 1990s. It was not until 1996 when the team traded with the Charlotte Hornets for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant and signed center Shaquille O'Neal that the Lakers returned to dominance during the early 2000s. The superstar duo, along with Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, led the Lakers to three consecutive championships between 2000 and 2002, securing the franchise's second \"three-peat\".[17] The dynamic \"Shaq-and-Kobe\" era ended when the Lakers traded away O'Neal after the team lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 Finals. It was not until the Lakers traded for Pau Gasol that Bryant and Jackson returned to the NBA Finals, losing to the Celtics in 2008 but winning championships in 2009 and 2010. The 2010 Finals marked the latest matchup of the Lakers and Celtics, with Los Angeles winning its 16th title. Jackson retired in 2011, and the Lakers endured their longest playoff drought in franchise history. Gasol departed in 2014, and Bryant retired in 2016. After rebuilding seasons with young, highly rated prospects, the Lakers signed superstar LeBron James in 2018.[18] In 2019, the team traded several of those prospects for star big man Anthony Davis.[19] The Lakers—led by James, Davis, and coach Frank Vogel—won the team's 17th championship in 2020, tying the Celtics for the most titles until 2024.[20] The Lakers hold the record for NBA's longest winning streak, 33 straight games, set in 1971–72.[21] 26 Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles, while four have coached the team. Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, O'Neal, and Bryant won a combined eight NBA MVP awards with the Lakers.[22] The franchise was founded in 1946 as the Detroit Gems and played in the National Basketball League (NBL) during the 1946–47 season where it finished last in the league with only 4 wins in 44 games. Though the team was scheduled to continue in the NBL the following season,[23] its ownership, faced with high losses due to low attendance and lack of homecourt, decided on selling the team to Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota for $15,000[13][24] Minneapolis sportswriter Sid Hartman played a key behind-the-scenes role in helping put together the deal and later the team.[25] Inspired by Minnesota's nickname, \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\", the team rechristened themselves the Lakers.[26][27] Hartman helped them hire John Kundla from College of St. Thomas, to be their first head coach, by meeting with him and selling him on the team.[28][29] As the franchise had the worst record in the NBL the previous season, it got the first pick in the 1947 Professional Basketball League of America dispersal draft, which they used to select George Mikan. Led by Mikan, the Lakers had a solid roster, which also featured forward Jim Pollard and playmaker Herm Schaefer.[30] In their first season, they led the league with a 43–17 record, later winning the NBL championship that season.[31] In 1948, the Lakers moved from the NBL to the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and Mikan's 28.3 point per game (ppg) scoring average set a BAA record. In the 1949 BAA Finals they won the championship, beating the Washington Capitols four games to two.[32] Following the season, the BAA and the NBL merged to form the National Basketball Association (NBA).[33] In the newly formed league, the Lakers improved to 51–17 record and won their third straight professional championship.[34] In the 1950–51 season, Mikan won his third straight scoring title at 28.4 ppg and the Lakers went 44–24 to win their second straight division title.[35] One of those games, a 19–18 loss against the Fort Wayne Pistons, became infamous as the lowest scoring game in NBA history.[36] In the playoffs, they defeated the Indianapolis Olympians in three games but lost to the Rochester Royals in the next round.[30] During the 1951–52 season, the Lakers won 40 games, finishing second in their division.[37] They faced the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals, which they won in seven games.[38] In the 1952–53 season, Mikan led the NBA in rebounding, averaging 14.4 rebounds per game (rpg), and was named MVP of the 1953 NBA All-Star Game.[35] After a 48–22 regular season, the Lakers defeated the Fort Wayne Pistons in the Western playoffs to advance to the NBA Finals.[38] They then defeated the New York Knicks to win their second straight championship.[39] Though Lakers star George Mikan suffered from knee problems throughout the 1953–54 season, he was still able to average 18 ppg.[40] Clyde Lovellette, who was drafted in 1952, helped the team win the Western Division.[40] The team won its third straight championship in the 1950s and sixth in seven seasons when it defeated the Syracuse Nationals in seven games.[39] Following Mikan's retirement in the 1954 off-season, the Lakers struggled but still managed to win 40 games. Although they defeated the Rochester Royals in the first round of the playoffs, they were defeated by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the semifinals.[41] Although they had losing records the next two seasons, they made the playoffs each year.[37] Mikan came back for the last half of the 1955–56 season, but struggled and retired for good after the season.[42] Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956–57. The Lakers had one of the worst seasons in team history in 1957–58 when they won a league-low 19 games.[43] They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace Kundla. Mikan was fired in January when the team was 9–30, and Kundla was rehired.[37][44] The Lakers earned the top pick in the 1958 NBA draft and used it to select Elgin Baylor. Baylor, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year and co-MVP of the 1959 NBA All-Star Game, averaged 24.9 ppg and 15.0 rpg helping the Lakers improve to second in their division despite a 33–39 record.[45] After upsetting the Hawks in six games in the division finals, they returned to the NBA Finals, but were swept by the Celtics, beginning their long rivalry.[46] In their last year in Minneapolis, the Lakers went 25–50. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and traveling to St. Louis when their plane crash-landed.[49] Snow storms had driven the pilot 150 miles off course when he was forced to land in a cornfield. No one was hurt.[50] Their record earned them the number two pick in the 1960 NBA draft. The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia University.[51] During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles.[52] Led by Baylor's 34.8 ppg and 19.8 rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the year before in West's first season.[53] On November 15 that season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks while grabbing 25 rebounds.[54] In doing so, Baylor broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers made the playoffs.[37] They came within two points of the NBA Finals when they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.[55] Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8 ppg respectively,[56] the Lakers improved to 54–26 in 1961–62, and made the finals. In a game five victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61,[57] despite fouling out of the game.[58] The Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven.[56] Frank Selvy, after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game,[59][60] missed a potential game-winning 18 foot jump shot in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later.[60] Los Angeles won 53 games in 1962–63, behind Baylor's 34.0 ppg and West's 27.1 ppg[61] but lost in the NBA Finals in six games to the Celtics.[61] After falling to 42–38 and losing in the first round of the 1964 NBA playoffs to the Hawks, the team won 49 games in 1964–65. The Lakers surged past the Baltimore Bullets in the division finals, behind West's record-setting 46.3 ppg in the series.[62] They lost again to the Celtics in the Finals however, this time in five games.[63] Los Angeles lost in the finals to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points.[64] Down by 16 entering the fourth quarter, and 10 with a minute and a half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments, which fell just short.[65] After dropping to 36 wins and losing in the first round of the 1967 NBA playoffs, they lost in the finals to the Celtics again in 1968.[37] Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. On July 9, 1968, the team acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers.[67] In his first season as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league-leading 21.1 rpg.[68] West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, and Los Angeles won their division.[69] The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston for the first time in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry West's 53 points,[70] and had a 3–2 lead after five.[71] Boston won the series in seven games however,[72] and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons.[73] West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award.[74] In 1970, West won his first scoring title at 31.2 ppg, the team returned to the finals, and for the first time in 16 years, they did not have to face the Celtics; instead playing the New York Knicks, who defeated them 4–3.[75][76] The next season the Lakers were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks, led by future Laker Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in the Western Conference Finals.[77] The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner Jack Kent Cooke brought in Bill Sharman as head coach,[78] and Elgin Baylor announced his retirement early in the season after realizing that his legs were not healthy enough.[78] Sharman increased the team's discipline.[79] He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots.[80] They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December.[78] They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104.[81] By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in major American professional team sports.[82][83] The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96.[84] Chamberlain averaged a low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game.[85] West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game.[85] The team failed to score 100 points just once all year,[86] and at the end of the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year.[87] The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.[88][89] The Lakers won 60 games in the 1972–73 season, and took another Pacific Division title.[90] Wilt Chamberlain, playing in his final season, again led the league in rebounding and set the NBA record for field-goal percentage at 72.7% which stood for several decades.[90] The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven games in the conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals.[90] They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.[91] During the 1973–74 season, the team was hampered by the loss of West, who played only 31 games before his legs gave out.[92] Goodrich, averaging 25.3 points, helped the team to a late-season surge.[92] Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division.[92] They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.[93] After missing the playoffs in the 1974–75 season, the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVPs by that time.[94] Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade to either New York or Los Angeles.[95] He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played.[96] The Lakers struggled in January, going 3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.[96] West and Cooke settled their differences—and the former Laker's lawsuit—and Cooke hired him to replace Sharman as the team's coach.[97] West became upset, however, when Cooke refused to spend the money necessary to acquire forward Julius Erving, who the Nets were selling.[98] Behind another MVP season from Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles won the Pacific Division, finishing the 1976–77 season a league-best 53–29.[99] They defeated the Warriors in a seven-game series to open the postseason before being swept by Portland in the Western Conference Finals.[96] During the off-season, Los Angeles picked up Jamaal Wilkes from Golden State and signed first-round draft pick Norm Nixon. In the first two minutes of the first game of the 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar punched Bucks center Kent Benson for an overly aggressive elbow and broke his hand.[100] Two months later, a healthy Abdul-Jabbar got into an altercation with Houston Rockets center Kevin Kunnert after a rebound. The team's starting power forward, Kermit Washington, who was averaging 11.5 points and 11.2 rebounds,[101] entered the fight, and when Rudy Tomjanovich ran in from the bench to break up the action, Washington punched him in the face.[102] Tomjanovich nearly died from the punch, suffering a fractured skull and other facial injuries, which prematurely ended his playing career.[103] Washington, who stated that he assumed Tomjanovich was a combatant, was suspended for two months by the NBA, and released by the Lakers.[104] The team won 45 games despite being down a starter in Washington and not having Abdul-Jabbar for nearly two months, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to Seattle.[105] During the 1978–79 season, the team posted a 47–35 record but lost to the SuperSonics in the semifinal round of the playoffs.[96] In the 1979 NBA draft, Los Angeles selected 6-foot, 9-inch point guard Magic Johnson from Michigan State with the first overall pick.[106] It took Johnson's teammates time to acclimate themselves to his passing ability, as his \"no-look\" passes often caught them unaware. Once they adjusted, his passing became a key part of Los Angeles' offense.[107] The Lakers won 60 games in Johnson's rookie year, and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals. Johnson won the Finals MVP award, after starting at center for the injured Abdul-Jabbar in game six, and tallying 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists.[108] The team fell off in the 1980–81 season, though, as the Lakers lost Johnson for most of the season to a knee injury.[109] The team turned in a 54–28 record and finished second behind the Phoenix Suns in the Pacific Division.[109] The Rockets, led by Moses Malone, defeated Los Angeles in the first round of the playoffs.[109] Early in the 1981–82 season, Johnson complained to the media about head coach Paul Westhead and demanded a trade.[110] Westhead was fired shortly after Johnson's criticisms, and although Lakers' owner Jerry Buss stated that Johnson's comments did not factor into the decision, Johnson was vilified by the national media and booed both on the road and at home.[111][112][113] Buss promoted assistant coach Pat Riley to \"co-head coach\" with Jerry West (although West considered himself Riley's assistant) on November 19 and the team won 17 of its next 20 games.[109][114][115] Nicknamed \"Showtime\" due to the team's new Johnson-led fast break-offense, the Lakers won the Pacific Division title and swept both the Suns and Spurs in the 1982 playoffs.[116] Los Angeles stretched its postseason winning streak to nine games by taking the first contest of the NBA Finals from the 76ers.[109][117] The team won the Finals 4–2 to finish a 12–2 playoff run.[109] On draft night in 1982, the Lakers had the first overall pick (the result of a trade with Cleveland midway through the 1979–80 season, when the Lakers had sent Don Ford and a 1980 first-round pick to the Cavaliers for Butch Lee and their 1982 selection) and selected James Worthy from North Carolina.[118] The Lakers won the Pacific Division at 58–24, but Worthy suffered a leg injury in the last week of the season and missed the rest of the season.[119] Nevertheless, they advanced to play Philadelphia in the 1983 NBA Finals after defeating Portland and San Antonio.[119] The Sixers, however, won the series and the championship in four games.[118] After the season West replaced Sharman as the team's GM.[120] In the 1983–84 season, Los Angeles went 54–28, and played Boston in the Finals for the first time since 1969.[121] The Lakers won two of the first three games. However, Kevin McHale's hard clothesline foul of Lakers forward Kurt Rambis on a fast break is credited as a turning point of the series.[122] Boston won three of the next four to win the title and send Los Angeles's record to 0–8 in Finals series against the Celtics.[121] Using the past year's Finals defeat as motivation, the team won the Pacific Division for the fourth straight year and lost just two games in the Western Conference playoffs. In the NBA Finals, the Celtics were again the Lakers' final hurdle. Los Angeles lost game one of the NBA Finals by a score of 148–114, in what is remembered as the \"Memorial Day Massacre\".[123] The Lakers, behind 38-year-old Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar, recovered to defeat the Celtics in six games.[124] The team won the title in the Boston Garden and became the first visiting team to ever win an NBA championship in Boston, as the Golden State Warriors later achieved this feat in 2022.[123] In the 1985–86 season, the Lakers started 24–3 and went on to win 62 games and their fifth straight division title.[126] The Rockets, however, defeated the Lakers in five games in the Western Conference Finals. Houston won the series when Ralph Sampson hit a 20-foot jumper as time expired in game five at The Forum.[126] Prior to the 1986–87 season, the Lakers moved A.C. Green into the starting lineup, and acquired Mychal Thompson from the Spurs.[127] Johnson won his first career MVP Award while leading the Lakers to a 65–17 record,[127] and Michael Cooper was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year.[127] Before the season, Riley had made the decision to shift the focus of the offense to Johnson over the 40-year-old Abdul-Jabbar.[128] The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals by sweeping the Nuggets, defeating the Warriors in five games, and sweeping the SuperSonics in the Western Conference Finals.[129] The Lakers defeated Boston in the first two games of the Finals, and the teams split the next four games, giving Los Angeles their second championship in three seasons.[127] The series was highlighted by Johnson's running \"baby hook\" shot to win game four at Boston Garden with two seconds remaining.[130] Johnson was named the NBA Finals MVP, in addition to regular season MVP.[131] At the Lakers' championship celebration in Los Angeles, coach Riley brashly declared that Los Angeles would repeat as NBA champions,[127] which no team had done since the 1968–69 Boston Celtics. Looking to make good on Riley's promise in the 1987–88 season, the Lakers took their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title with a 62–20 record. They swept the Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Finals before pulling out a tough seven-game series win over the Utah Jazz led by youngsters Karl Malone and John Stockton. A seven-game Western Conference finals win over the Dallas Mavericks propelled the Lakers to the NBA Finals once again. In their seventh trip to the Finals in nine years, they met the Detroit Pistons. Los Angeles would take the series in seven games, and James Worthy's game seven triple-double earned him a Finals MVP award.[132] The win marked their fifth title in nine years, but would also mark their last title until 2000. In the 1988–89 season, Los Angeles won 57 games and their eighth consecutive Pacific Division crown. They swept through the playoffs defeating Portland, Seattle, and Phoenix. In an eighth trip to the NBA Finals in 10 years, they once again faced the Detroit Pistons.[133] Hampered by injuries to Byron Scott and Johnson, the Lakers were swept by Detroit.[134] Following the 1989 Finals, on June 28, 1989, after 20 professional seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar announced his retirement. The Lakers still cruised through the Pacific Division, winning their ninth consecutive division crown with a 63–19 record. However, after beating the Rockets in the first round, they lost four games to one in the second round of the playoffs to the Suns.[135] Riley announced he was stepping down after the season citing burnout,[136] and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy.[137] Riley's departure received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had grown tired of his intense practices and felt he tried to take too much credit for the team's successes.[138] Following the season, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request.[139] The 1990–91 Lakers failed to win the Pacific Division for the first time in 10 years, but still finished with a 58–24 record. After cruising through the Western Conference playoffs, the Lakers found themselves in the NBA Finals once again, their ninth trip to the Finals in 12 years. The 1991 Finals represented a changing of the guard as the Lakers were defeated in five games by the Chicago Bulls, led by superstar Michael Jordan.[140] On November 7, 1991, Magic Johnson announced he had tested positive for HIV and would retire immediately.[141] In their first season without Johnson, the team won 43 games to earn the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoffs.[37] The Lakers were defeated in the first round by Portland. Following the season, head coach Mike Dunleavy was fired. The Lakers would lose 43 games in 1992–93 under Randy Pfund, their first losing season since 1976. The Lakers would still make the playoffs, and would become the first eighth seed to win the opening two games on the road against a number one seed when they took a 2–0 lead against Phoenix.[142] They lost the next two games at home however, then game five in Phoenix in overtime.[142] During the 1993–94 season, Pfund was fired during the season that would result in the Lakers failing to make the playoffs for the first time since 1976. Magic Johnson, would coach the final 16 games of the season with former teammate Michael Cooper as his lead assistant.[143] Johnson decided not to take the job permanently due to what he felt was a lack of commitment from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing streak to finish 33–49.[144][145] Under new coach Del Harris, Los Angeles made the playoffs each of the next two seasons but was eliminated in the second and first rounds respectively.[146][147] The team was led by young guards Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones.[148] Johnson came out of retirement to return as a player in the 1995–96 season to lead the then 24–18 Lakers to a 29–11 finish.[149] After some run-ins with Van Exel, displeasure with Harris's strategies, and a first-round loss to the Rockets, Johnson decided to retire for the final time after the season.[150] During the 1996 off-season, the Lakers acquired 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th overall out of Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in that year's draft, by Charlotte. Los Angeles also signed free-agent Shaquille O'Neal.[151] Trading for Bryant was West's idea, and he was influential in the team's signing of the all-star center.[152] \"Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers\", O'Neal later said.[153] They used their 24th pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher.[154] During the season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos to Phoenix for Robert Horry.[155] O'Neal led the team to a 56–26 record, their best effort since 1990–91, despite missing 31 games due to a knee injury.[156] O'Neal averaged 26.2 ppg and 12.5 rpg and finished third in the league in blocked shots (2.88 bpg) in 51 games.[156][157] The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs as O'Neal scored 46 points in Game 1 against the Trail Blazers, marking the highest single-game playoff scoring output by a Laker since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics in 1969.[156] In the next round, the Lakers lost in five games to the Utah Jazz.[156] In the 1997–98 season, O'Neal and the Lakers had the best start in franchise history, 11–0.[158] O'Neal would miss 20 games on the season due to an abdominal injury.[158] Los Angeles battled Seattle for the Pacific Division title most of the season. In the final two months, the Lakers won 22 of their final 25 games,[158] finishing 61–21, but still finished second to Seattle in the standings.[158] The Lakers defeated Portland three games to one in the first round to advance to face Seattle. Although the Sonics won the first game, the Lakers responded with four straight wins, taking the series,[158] but were swept by the Jazz in the Western Conference Finals.[158] During the 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell were traded to the Charlotte Hornets.[159] The team also acquired J. R. Reid, B. J. Armstrong, and Glen Rice.[160] Head coach Del Harris was fired in February after a three-game losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former Laker Kurt Rambis.[161] The team finished 31–19 in the strike-shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference.[162] The Lakers defeated Houston in the first round of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round. Game four of the series would be the last game ever played at the Great Western Forum.[163] Before the 1999–2000 season, West was prepared to hire Rambis as the team's full-time coach before an outcry from fans and members of the organization caused him to seek out a bigger name.[164] Los Angeles hired former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who had coached that team to six championships, and gave him a lucrative $6 million a year contract.[165] He brought along assistant Tex Winter and they installed Winter's version of the triangle offense.[166] The Lakers signed veterans Brian Shaw, John Salley, Ron Harper, and A.C. Green, who was a Laker during the \"Showtime\" era.[155] The team also moved to a new arena, the Staples Center.[167] Led by league MVP O'Neal, the Lakers won 31 of their first 36 games.[168] They finished 67–15, the highest win total since they won 65 in the 1986–87 season.[168] Then eliminated Sacramento and Phoenix in the first two rounds of the playoffs.[169] After the Lakers took a three games to one lead in the Western Conference Finals against Portland, the Trail Blazers won the next two games to force a game seven.[170] The Lakers, who trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter, would go on 19–4 run to tie the game and eventually win 89–84 to advance to the NBA Finals.[170] In their first trip to the Finals since 1991, the Lakers defeated Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers four games to two win their first title since 1988.[171] West retired from his spot in the team's front office after the season after a power struggle between him and Jackson over control of the team's operations.[172] After the season, starters Rice and Green left the team,[173] and Los Angeles signed Horace Grant.[174] The following season, the Lakers won 11 fewer regular season games than the prior year,[175] but swept the first three rounds of the playoffs, defeating the Portland, Sacramento, and San Antonio.[176] They met Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals. Although the Sixers took game one in overtime,[177] the Lakers won the next four games to win their second straight title. Their 15–1 postseason record was the best in NBA history.[178] The Lakers won 58 games in 2001–02. In the playoffs, they swept Portland and defeated San Antonio four games to one to advance to the Western Conference Finals to face Sacramento.[181] The series would go on to be known as one of the greatest playoff matchups in NBA history. The series extended to all seven games and ended in a Lakers victory.[182] In game one, Bryant scored 30 points as the Lakers won, 106–99. The series would then shift in Sacramento's favor, with the Kings winning the next two games. Facing a deficit in game 4, the Lakers had the ball with under 20 seconds to play. After misses by both Bryant and O'Neal, Kings center Vlade Divac tapped the ball away from the rim in an attempt to wind down the clock. It went straight into Robert Horry's hands, who drained a game-winning three with under three seconds to play. After the Kings won game five on a buzzer-beater by Mike Bibby, the Lakers were faced with a must-win game six. In one of the most controversial playoff games in league history (Tim Donaghy's betting scandal), the Lakers would win by four points.[183] The Lakers went on to win game seven in overtime, with the Kings missing numerous potentially game-saving shots and free throws. The Lakers then achieved a three-peat by sweeping Jason Kidd and the New Jersey Nets in the NBA Finals.[184] O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP awards, making him the only player besides Michael Jordan to win three consecutive Finals MVPs.[185] The Lakers would attempt a four-peat the following year, but started the 2002–03 season 11–19.[186] However, they finished the season 39–13 to finish 50–32.[187] They defeated Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, but the four-peat attempt ended as they were eliminated by San Antonio in six games in the second round.[188] During the 2003–04 season, the team was the subject of intense media coverage generated by the teaming of four stars and the sexual-assault case involving Kobe Bryant.[189][190] Before the season, the Lakers signed two-time MVP Karl Malone formerly of the Jazz, and former Seattle Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton to join O'Neal and Bryant,[191] forming the first \"superteam\" of the 21st century.[192][193] Three of the \"big four\", however, struggled with injuries: O'Neal suffered from a strained calf, Malone an injured knee, and Bryant an injured shoulder.[194][195] The Lakers started 18–3 and finished 56–26 and won the Pacific Division title, entering the playoffs as the No. 2 seed. They defeated Houston, San Antonio, and Minnesota to advance to the NBA Finals.[196] In the Finals, they would lose to Detroit in five games. During the 2004 off-season, the team entered a rebuilding phase when O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, Caron Butler, and a first-round draft pick.[197] Bryant and O'Neal had clashed in the past,[198] and the media credited their feud as one of the motivating factors for the trade.[199] Jackson did not return as head coach, and wrote a book about the team's 2003–04 season, in which he heavily criticized Bryant and called him \"uncoachable\".[200][201][202] The Lakers front office said that the book contained \"several inaccuracies\".[203] The Lakers also traded Rick Fox and Gary Payton to Boston, for Chris Mihm, Marcus Banks, and Chucky Atkins before the 2004–05 season.[204] Derek Fisher, frustrated with losing playing time, opted out of his contract and signed with the Warriors.[204] The team hired Rudy Tomjanovich to replace Jackson.[204] After sitting out the first half of the 2004–05 season, Malone announced his retirement on February 13, 2005.[205] Tomjanovich coached the team to a 22–19 record before resigning due to health problems.[206] Assistant Frank Hamblen was named interim head coach to replace Tomjanovich for the remainder of the season.[207] Bryant (ankle) and Odom (shoulder) suffered injuries, and the Lakers finished 34–48, missing the playoffs for only the fifth time in franchise history and the first time since 1994.[37] With the tenth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft, the Lakers selected Andrew Bynum, a center from St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey.[208] The team also traded Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins to Washington for Kwame Brown and Laron Profit.[209] Jackson returned to coach the team after Rudy Tomjanovich resigned midway through the previous season.[210] On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points against Toronto, the second-highest total in NBA history.[211] Ending the season 45–37, the team made the playoffs after a one-season absence.[212] After taking a three games to one lead in the first round, Phoenix came back to take the series in seven games.[213] In the following season, the Lakers won 26 of their first 39 games,[214] but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40.[214] They were eliminated in the first round by Phoenix again.[214] Frustrated by the team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the off-season.[215] Buss initially agreed to seek a trade,[216] but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.[217] After re-acquiring Derek Fisher, the Lakers started the 2007–08 season with a 25–11 record, before Andrew Bynum, their center who was leading the league in field-goal percentage, went out for the year due to a knee injury in mid-January.[218] In what would become a crucial transfer for the franchise's return to championship form, they acquired the six-time all-star power forward Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade in early February and went 22–5 to finish the season.[219] The Lakers' 57–25 record earned them the first seed in the Western Conference.[220] Bryant was awarded the league's MVP award, becoming the first Laker to win the award since O'Neal in 2000.[221][222] In the playoffs, they defeated the Nuggets in four games, the Jazz in six, and the defending champion Spurs in five, but lost to the Celtics in six games in the NBA Finals.[223] In the 2008–09 season, the Lakers finished 65–17; the best record in the Western Conference.[224] They defeated the Jazz in five games, the Rockets in seven and the Nuggets in six, to win the Western Conference title. They then won their 15th NBA championship by defeating the Orlando Magic in five games in the NBA finals.[225] Bryant was named the NBA Finals MVP for the first time in his career.[226] The Lakers, who had added Ron Artest (Metta World Peace)[227] in place of Trevor Ariza in their starting lineup, finished the 2009–10 season with the best record in the Western Conference for the third straight time. On January 13, 2010, the Lakers became the first team in NBA history to win 3,000 regular-season games by defeating the Dallas Mavericks 100–95.[228] They defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Utah Jazz, and the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference playoffs. In the finals, the Lakers played the Boston Celtics for the 12th time. They rallied back from a 3–2 disadvantage in the series and erased a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter of the seventh game to defeat the Celtics. This series win gave them their 16th NBA title overall and 11th since they moved to Los Angeles.[229] Bryant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, despite a 6–24 shooting performance in game seven.[230] After much speculation, head coach Phil Jackson returned for the 2010–11 season.[231] In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the New Orleans Hornets in the first round.[232] But their opportunity for a three-peat was denied by the Dallas Mavericks in a four-game sweep of the second round. After the season, it was announced that Jackson will not be returning to coach the Lakers.[233] After Jackson's retirement, former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown was hired as head coach on May 25, 2011.[234] Before the start of the shortened 2011–12 season, the Lakers traded Lamar Odom to the Dallas Mavericks after Odom requested to be traded.[235] On the trade deadline long time Laker Derek Fisher along with a first round draft pick were traded to the Houston Rockets for Jordan Hill.[236] With a 41–25 regular season record the Lakers entered the playoffs as the third seed, the team defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round in seven games but were eliminated by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round in five games.[237][238] On July 4, 2012, Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns agreed to a sign-and-trade deal that would send him to the Lakers in exchange for the Lakers' 2013 and 2015 first round draft picks, 2013 and 2014 second round draft picks, and $3 million. The trade was made official on July 11, 2012, the first day the trade moratorium was lifted.[239] On August 10, 2012, in a four-team trade the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum and acquired Dwight Howard.[240] The combination of these players with Bryant and Gasol led media outlets to refer to them as a \"superteam\" comparable to the 2003-04 Lakers.[241][242] On November 9, 2012, Mike Brown was relieved of coaching duties after a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season.[243] Assistant Coach Bernie Bickerstaff took over as interim head coach, leading the Lakers to a 5–5 record. On November 12, 2012, the Lakers hired Mike D'Antoni as head coach.[244] On February 18, 2013, Lakers owner Jerry Buss died from cancer at age 80.[245] On the court, D'Antoni coached the Lakers to a 40–32 record the rest of the way to finish 45–37, their worst record since 2007. The Lakers clinched a playoff berth on the final game of the season and finished seventh in the Western Conference after beating the Houston Rockets on April 16, 2013.[246][247] The Lakers battled injuries all season, the most prominent of which is the Achilles tendon rupture to Kobe Bryant that ended his season after 78 games. The absence of Bryant was sorely felt as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs.[248] Nevertheless, Bryant passed Lakers legend Wilt Chamberlain to become the fourth all-time leading scorer in NBA history on March 30, 2013, against the Sacramento Kings.[249] On December 8, 2013, Bryant played in his first game since tearing his Achilles tendon on April 12, 2013.[250] However, on December 17, 2013, he suffered a broken bone in his knee, and did not return for the remainder of the season.[251][252] On March 25, 2014, the Lakers scored 51 points in the third quarter against the New York Knicks, the most points scored in a quarter in the history of the franchise.[253] The Lakers went on to miss the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2005, for just the second time in the last two decades and for just the sixth time in franchise history. On April 30, 2014, Mike D'Antoni resigned from his position as head coach after a 27–55 season.[254] After spending the majority of the off-season without a head coach, the Lakers named former player Byron Scott as the new head coach.[255] After the season, he was the frontrunner to become the new Lakers head coach. Scott interviewed three times for the position, which had become vacant after Mike D'Antoni's resignation.[256] On July 28, 2014, he signed a multi-year contract to coach the Lakers.[257] During the first game of the 2014–15 season, the seventh overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, Julius Randle went down with a broken leg, which ended his rookie season. The Lakers began their season losing 10 of their first 16 games. After playing only 35 games, Kobe Bryant tore a rotator cuff in his shoulder ending his season. Nick Young was also forced to end his season with a fractured kneecap, leaving the team with a record of 14–41.[258] With 27 games left in the regular season, Byron Scott gave rookie Jordan Clarkson more playing time. Clarkson, the 46th overall pick in the 2014 draft, finished his rookie season with game stats of 11.9 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 3.5 apg, and shooting 44.8% from the field.[259] The Lakers' season ended with a record of 21–61, the fourth worst record in the league and at the time the worst record in franchise history. The next season, the Lakers had the second overall pick of the 2015 NBA draft, which they used to select Ohio State freshman point guard D'Angelo Russell. The team also selected Larry Nance Jr. with the 27th overall pick.[260] On November 30, 2015, Bryant announced he would retire at the end of the season after 20 seasons with the team.[261] In Bryant's last season the team missed the playoffs for the third straight year with a 17–65 record, the worst in franchise history.[262] On April 24, 2016, the Lakers announced that they would not exercise their option on Byron Scott's contract for the following season.[263] On April 29, the team announced another former Laker, Luke Walton, as their new head coach. At the time of his hiring, Walton was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, who were in the playoffs, so he could not officially begin his duties as head coach until the Warriors' playoff run was over.[264] The Lakers earned the second overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft,[265] and selected Brandon Ingram from Duke University.[266] The team also selected Ivica Zubac with the 32nd overall pick.[267] On February 21, 2017, the Lakers fired general manager Mitch Kupchak, while Magic Johnson was named as the president of basketball operations. The team's governor Jeanie Buss, also announced the removal of her brother, Jim Buss, from his position as executive vice president of basketball operations.[268][269] On March 7, 2017, the Lakers hired Rob Pelinka as the general manager, signing him to a five-year deal.[270] The Lakers again earned the second overall pick, this time, in the 2017 NBA draft,[271] and selected Lonzo Ball from UCLA.[272] The Lakers also acquired Kyle Kuzma from the University of Utah with the 27th overall pick from a draft-day trade, along with Brook Lopez in exchange for D'Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov.[273] The Lakers also traded their 28th overall pick, Tony Bradley, in exchange for the 30th overall pick, Josh Hart, from Villanova University and the 42nd overall pick, Thomas Bryant, from Indiana University.[274] In February 2018, Nance Jr. and Clarkson were traded away to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye, and a 2018 first-round draft pick.[275] On July 2, 2018, Randle was renounced by the Lakers.[276] On July 9, 2018, the Lakers signed LeBron James to a four-year, $154 million contract.[277][278] By the Christmas Day game, the Lakers were six games over .500 before James sustained a groin injury leading to several weeks of missed games. Ball and Ingram also ended their seasons early due to injuries. On February 7, 2019, Zubac was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers along with Michael Beasley in exchange for Mike Muscala.[279] On April 9, 2019, Johnson stepped down as the team's president of basketball operations,[280] and two days later, the Lakers parted ways with head coach Walton after the team failed to reach the playoffs for the sixth straight year.[281] On May 13, Frank Vogel was named the Lakers' head coach.[282] The Lakers received the fourth overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft lottery.[283] On July 6, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans for Ball, Ingram, Hart, and three first-round picks, including the number four overall in the 2019 draft.[284] This trade officially ended the young core era of the Lakers; only Kuzma remained out of the group of players. Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Lakers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season.[285] The Lakers finished the regular season with a 52–19 record, entering the playoffs for the first time since 2013,[286] and as the top seed for the first time since 2010.[287] They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010.[288] They defeated the Miami Heat 4–2 to win the 2020 NBA Finals,[289] and James was named the Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career.[290] The win gave Los Angeles their 17th championship in franchise history, tying the Boston Celtics for the most all-time.[291] Primary Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, who took over the team in 2017, would also become the first female controlling owner of an NBA team to win the NBA Finals.[292] During the 2021 off-season, the Lakers picked up many NBA veterans, the most notable of which was Russell Westbrook, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade with the Washington Wizards. Kyle Kuzma, the last player left from the Lakers' young core era, was traded away, along with others. Other veterans picked up during the off-season included Carmelo Anthony, DeAndre Jordan, and returning players Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo.[293] Alex Caruso left the Lakers and signed with the Chicago Bulls, and veteran locker-room voice Jared Dudley retired.[294][295] The Lakers made a surprising run in the 2023 Playoffs, making the Western Conference Finals, but were defeated by the eventual champion Denver Nuggets. On December 9, 2023, the Lakers won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament after defeating the Indiana Pacers in the championship game. James was named the inaugural tournament MVP.[296] They finished the 2023–24 season 47–35 and beat the New Orleans Pelicans in the Play-In to make the playoffs as the seventh seed. On June 27, 2024, the Lakers selected Bronny James, the son of LeBron, at 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, forming the first father-son duo in NBA history.[297] JJ Redick was hired as head coach of the Lakers.[298] On October 23, 2024, the team made NBA history as being the first one to have father and son (LeBron James & Bronny James) play together as they beat Minnesota Timberwolves on their season opening game.[299] The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the Lakers involves the two most storied basketball franchises in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. It has been called the best rivalry in the NBA.[300] The two teams have met a record 12 times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s and three times in the 1980s. The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4–2. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games. The two teams were tied for the highest number of championships, with 17 titles apiece, until the Celtics surpassed this record in the 2024 NBA Finals; together, the 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history. The all-time series record for the Lakers vs Celtics is 209–165 with the Celtics being the forerunners. Boston is the only NBA team with an overall winning record against the Lakers.[301] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Detroit Pistons developed in the late 1980s.[302]: 228 Both teams faced each other in back-to-back finals appearances in the 1988 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games and the 1989 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in 4 games. The rivalry reemerged in the early 2000s as both teams squared off against one another in the 2004 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in five games. The Lakers have a lengthy history with the Golden State Warriors as both franchises relocated to California during the early 1960s. Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike, unlike the Dodgers–Giants rivalry of MLB, or the 49ers–Rams rivalry of the NFL in which both teams express fierce animosity against one another.[303][304] The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991. Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers. Both teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams relocated to California in the early 1960s.[305][306] The Lakers lead the all time regular season series 262–173, and the postseason series 25–11.[307][308] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers is unique because they were the only two NBA teams to share an arena, the Crypto.com Arena. It is also one of only two intra-city rivalries in the NBA, the other being the new crosstown rivalry between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets. Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers.[309][310] Some contend that the term rivalry was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful.[311] The Lakers and the Phoenix Suns rivalry didn't develop until the 2000s where the teams were led by Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash, respectively. The San Antonio Spurs and the Lakers, developed what some would classify as a rivalry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 1999, the teams have met in the NBA Playoffs five times, with the clubs combining to appear in seven consecutive NBA Finals (from 1999 to 2005). Additionally, the teams combined to win five NBA championships from 1999 to 2003; the Spurs won the NBA championship in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014 while the Lakers won the championship in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010. From 1999 to 2004 the clubs' rivalry was often considered the premier rivalry in the NBA,[312] and each time the clubs faced each other in the playoffs the winner advanced to the NBA Finals. In 2008, the teams met again in the Western Conference Finals where the Spurs were handily defeated only to beat the Lakers when they met again in 2013. The Kings and the Lakers have faced each other in the playoffs nine times between 1949 and 2002, and since the Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985, both have been based in California. The 2002 Western Conference Finals was one of the most bitterly contested in NBA history, with many controversial calls in game 6.[313] The Lakers would win the series in game 7. Berger and Chalfen purchased the NBL's disbanded Detroit Gems for $15,000 in 1947, changed their name to the Lakers, and relocated them to Minnesota. Max Winter bought a third of the club in their early years and sold his share to Mikan in 1954. Berger bought Mikan's share in 1956 giving him a controlling (⅔) interest.[314] After Mikan retired, attendance plummeted and the team lost money for several seasons, leading the ownership group to put the team up for sale in 1957.[315] Marty Marion, a retired baseball player and manager, and his business partner Milton Fischman attempted to purchase the team with the intention of moving the club to Kansas City, Missouri.[315][316] Mikan offered to mortgage his home in an attempt to buy the team and keep the club in Minnesota.[317] The Lakers were sold to a group of investors led by Bob Short, however.[314] The team was sold to Short's group with the agreement that it would not be relocated to Kansas City but kept in Minnesota.[318] Short's ownership group consisted of 117 Minnesota businesses and private citizens, who amassed a total of $200,000 for the purchase; $150,000 to buy the team and $50,000 to run it.[314] By 1958 Short had become 80% owner of the team by buying out his partners,[314] but the team was floundering. Attendance remained poor, and the NBA had put the Lakers on \"financial probation\", notifying them that if they did not meet certain ticket sales numbers they could be bought out by the league and relocated. Short was forced to move the team to Los Angeles in 1960; the club had lost $60,000 in the first half of the 1959–60 season alone.[319] The NBA's owners originally voted 7–1 against the move.[320] When Short indicated that he might take the team to a new rival league that was developing, however, the owners held another vote that same day and allowed the relocation (8–0).[321] Aided by Baylor's drawing power,[322][323] and the new locale, the team's finances improved when they arrived in LA.[324][325] Short sold the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for a then league record amount of $5.175 million.[326] Short insisted the deal be conducted in cash as he was wary of Cooke, so guards transported the money in a cart from one New York bank to another.[327] Cooke was a more hands-on owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations.[328] He personally financed construction of the Forum in 1967 at a cost of $16.5 million.[329][330] He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67 million.[331] Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce.[332][333] Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate.[330][334] Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998,[335] and until October 2010 Magic Johnson was a minority owner as well.[336] Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988.[337] In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league.[335] In 2013, Buss died at the age of 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer.[338][339][340] His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote.[341][342] Buss' succession plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.[342][343] Given the team's proximity to Hollywood, the Lakers fanbase includes numerous celebrities, many of whom can be seen at the Staples Center during home games.[344] Jack Nicholson, for example, has held season tickets since the 1970s, and directors reportedly need to work their shooting schedules around Lakers home games.[345] From 2002 and 2007 the team averaged just over 18,900 fans, which placed them in the top ten in the NBA in attendance. Red Hot Chili Peppers' song \"Magic Johnson\", from their 1989 album Mother's Milk, is a tribute to the former point guard, and frontman Anthony Kiedis and bassist Michael \"Flea\" Balzary are frequently seen attending home games.[346] In 2008, the team sold out every home game,[347] and in 2010, the Lakers had the most popular team merchandise among all NBA teams, and Bryant the most popular jersey.[348] The Laker nickname came from the state of Minnesota being the Land of 10,000 Lakes.[14][349] The team's colors are purple, gold and white.[350][6][351] The Lakers logo consists of the team name, \"Los Angeles Lakers\" written in purple on top of a gold basketball. The team usually wears white jerseys for Sunday and holiday home games.[350][352] List of the last five seasons completed by the Lakers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Los Angeles Lakers seasons. The Lakers have won 17 NBA titles and have appeared in the NBA Finals 15 other times.[37] These appearances include eight NBA Finals appearances in the 1980s. The best record posted by the team was 69–13, in 1972; the worst record was 17–65, in 2016.[37] Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage Bryant holds most individual team records for longevity including most games played (1,333), and most minutes logged (48,298). Johnson holds all significant assist records for the club including career assists (10,141), assists in a game (24), and highest assist average for a season (13.1). Johnson also has the most triple doubles, with his 138 over 100 more than the next closest player (Bryant; 17). Elmore Smith holds team records for blocks in a game (17), blocks per game for a season (4.85), and career blocks per game (3.93). The scoring records are mostly shared by Elgin Baylor and Bryant, with Baylor having the highest average for a career (27.4) while Bryant has the highest points scored in a single game (81). Baylor, Bryant and West hold the top five single-season scoring averages, with Bryant occupying the first (35.4) and fourth (31.6) spots, while Baylor has the second (34.8), and third (34.0), and West the fifth (31.3).[353][354] The Lakers hold several NBA records as a team including most consecutive games won overall (33) and most consecutive road games won (16), both of which came during the 1971–72 season,[355] highest field-goal percentage for a season at 54.5% (1984–85),[356] and highest road winning percentage at 0.816 (1971–72).[66] They also hold records for having (into the 2009–10 season) the most wins (3,027), the highest winning percentage (61.9%), and the most NBA Finals appearances (31).[37][357] The 2000–01 team set the NBA record for best playoff record at 15–1, which was later broken by the Golden State Warriors in 2017.[358] The 1971–72 team holds franchise records in wins (69), most points scored, and largest margin of victory; both of the latter came in the team's 63 point win versus Golden State (162–99).[359] They also held the record for most wins at home in the regular season (going 36–5 in 1971–72, then 37–4 in both 1976–77 and 1979–80) unil the Boston Celtics set the current record of 40–1 in the 1985–86 season. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, located at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles. The arena opened in fall 1999 and seats up to 18,997 for Lakers games.[360] Owned and operated by AEG and L.A. Arena Company, the arena is also home to the Los Angeles Clippers, the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings.[360] Before moving to Staples Center, for 32 seasons (1967–1999), the Lakers played their home games at The Forum in Inglewood, California, located approximately 10 miles southwest of the team's current home.[167] During the 1999 preseason, the Lakers played their home games at the Forum before officially moving into Crypto.com Arena, and once again hosted a preseason game versus the Golden State Warriors on October 9, 2009, this time to commemorate the team's 50th-anniversary season in Los Angeles.[361] In the first seven years in Los Angeles, the team played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, south of downtown Los Angeles.[362] While the team played in Minneapolis, the team played their home games at the Minneapolis Auditorium and the Minneapolis Armory from 1947 to 1960.[363] Roster Last transaction: December 29, 2024 The Lakers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA.[364] A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[365] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. The Lakers have had three first overall picks in their history: Elgin Baylor (selected in 1958), Magic Johnson (selected in 1979) and James Worthy (selected in 1982).[368] The Lakers have also had six lottery picks in their history: Eddie Jones (selected tenth overall in 1994), Andrew Bynum (selected tenth overall in 2005), Julius Randle (selected seventh overall in 2014), D'Angelo Russell (selected second overall in 2015), Brandon Ingram (selected second overall in 2016) and Lonzo Ball (selected second overall in 2017).[368] Other draft picks include Jerry West and Gail Goodrich in the 1960s, Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon in the 1970s, A.C. Green and Vlade Divac in the 1980s, Elden Campbell, Nick Van Exel, Derek Fisher and Devean George in the 1990s, and Luke Walton, Sasha Vujačić, and Ronny Turiaf in the 2000s.[368] There have been 29 head coaches for the Lakers franchise. John Kundla coached the team in Minneapolis when they won their first five BAA/NBA championships from 1949 to 1954.[52] Pat Riley is second in franchise history in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins.[369] Phil Jackson broke Riley's regular-season wins record in 2009, and he passed Riley's playoff wins and games coached records in 2010.[369] Jackson, Riley, Kundla, and Bill Sharman have all been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for their coaching careers. George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Jerry West, Pat Riley, Magic Johnson, Kurt Rambis, Byron Scott and Luke Walton have all played and head-coached for the Lakers. Jackson, who had two stints as head coach, was coach from 2005 to 2011. In May 2011, Mike Brown was named his replacement for the 2011–12 season.[370] Brown was fired[371] on November 9, 2012, after a 1–4 start. Assistant coach Bernie Bickerstaff served as interim head coach for five games before the Lakers selected Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. D'Antoni resigned at the end of the 2013–14 season. In July 2014, Byron Scott was hired as head coach.[372] After the 2015–16 season ended, Scott was fired. On April 29, 2016, former Lakers player Luke Walton was named as Scott's replacement,[373] and served as head coach until the end of the 2018–19 season.[374] Frank Vogel was named his successor on a multiyear deal announced on May 13, 2019.[375] Vogel was fired following the conclusion of the 2021–22 season.[376] On June 6, 2022, Darvin Ham was named as Vogel's successor as head coach.[377] However, Ham was fired by the Lakers on May 3, 2024, after the Lakers were eliminated in Game 5 of the first round by the Denver Nuggets. Among his accomplishments was leading the Lakers to their first In-Season Tournament championship.[378] On June 24, 2024, former NBA player JJ Redick was hired as the 29th coach in team history.[379] The Lakers have 41 Hall of Famers (31 players, 5 head coaches, 1 assistant coach, and 4 contributors) who contributed to the organization.[380][381][382] Notes: The Lakers have retired thirteen jersey numbers and an honorary microphone in honor of their players and broadcaster:[392][393][394][395][396] On January 13, 2025, Michael Cooper will have his #21 jersey retired.[397] In addition, several other players and coaches who were instrumental to the franchise's success during its days in Minneapolis have a banner commemorating them as Hall of Fame members of the Minneapolis Lakers, although jersey numbers for these players are not retired by the franchise:[400] For 41 years, Chick Hearn was the team's broadcaster until his death in 2002. He broadcast 3,338 consecutive games between November 21, 1965, and December 16, 2001.[401] Hearn came up with West's \"Mr. Clutch\" nickname.[402] He was a part of the team's \"inner sanctum\" when Cooke was owner, and was consulted on basketball decisions.[403] Paul Sunderland, who had filled in for a couple of games while Hearn recuperated in the 2001–02 season, was named the permanent play-by-play announcer. Stu Lantz was retained as the color commentator.[404] When Sunderland's contract expired in the summer of 2005, the team chose not to renew it.[405] Then, Joel Meyers moved in alongside Lantz as the television announcer, with Spero Dedes and former Laker player Mychal Thompson on the radio.[406] For the 2011–12 season, Bill Macdonald became the new television play-by-play announcer, joining Lantz who remained as the color analyst. Meanwhile, John Ireland joined Mychal Thompson to call the games on radio.[407] Beginning in the 2009–10 season, Lakers radio broadcasts were heard on KSPN (Los Angeles ESPN Radio affiliate) in English and KWKW in Spanish.[406][408] KLAC had the team's radio broadcast rights from the 1976–77 season until the 2008–09 season.[408][409] Until 2011, telecasts had been split between KCAL-TV (road games) and Fox Sports West (home games), unless they are chosen for national broadcasts on ABC.[410] KCAL had been the Lakers' over-the-air television broadcaster since 1977, dating back to when the station was the RKO General-owned KHJ-TV, the longest relationship between an NBA team and a television station. Prior to KHJ, Laker games were televised on KTLA. The Lakers had been on Fox Sports West since 1985, dating to when it was the original Prime Ticket and owned by Buss.[411] On February 14, 2011, Time Warner Cable and the Lakers announced the formation of two new regional sports networks (one in English, one in Spanish) that would exclusively televise the team's games and related programming for 20 years starting with the 2012–13 season.[412] The said networks were originally known as Time Warner Cable SportsNet, before it was renamed Spectrum SportsNet in 2016 upon Charter Communications' purchase of Time Warner Cable.[413]",

It is sometimes called the \"stomach flu\" or the \"stomach bug.\" However, norovirus illness is not related to the flu. The flu is caused by the influenza virus. Norovirus causes acute gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach or intestines. Most people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days; but they can still spread the virus for a few days after. You can get norovirus illness many times in your life because there are many different types of noroviruses. Infection with one type of norovirus may not protect you against other types. It is possible to develop protection against specific types. But it is not known exactly how long protection lasts. This may explain why so many people of all ages get infected during norovirus outbreaks. A person usually develops symptoms 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus. If you have norovirus illness, you can feel extremely ill, and vomit or have diarrhea many times a day. This can lead to dehydration (loss of body fluids), especially in young children, older adults, and people with other illnesses. Symptoms of dehydration include: Anyone can get infected and sick with norovirus and people of all ages get infected during norovirus outbreaks. Your likelihood of getting a norovirus infection is also determined in part by your genes. If eaten raw, oysters and other filter-feeding shellfish can contain viruses and bacteria that can cause illness or death. Anyone who consumes raw shellfish is at risk of contracting norovirus. Children younger than 5 years old, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop severe infections. Norovirus spreads very easily and quickly in different ways. You can get norovirus by: You can still spread norovirus for 2 weeks or more after you feel better. Norovirus is very contagious, but you can take steps to protect yourself and others, including: Diagnostic methods for norovirus focus on detecting viral RNA (genetic material) or viral antigen. Diagnostic tests are available at all public health laboratories and many clinical laboratories. Most people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days. There is no specific medicine to treat people with norovirus illness. Antibiotic drugs will not help treat norovirus infections because they fight bacteria, not viruses. Watch for signs of dehydration (loss of body fluids) in children who have norovirus illness. Children who are dehydrated may cry with few or no tears and be unusually sleepy or fussy. If you have norovirus illness, you should drink plenty of liquids to replace fluid lost from vomiting and diarrhea. This will help prevent dehydration. Sports drinks and other drinks without caffeine or alcohol can help with mild dehydration. However, these drinks may not replace important nutrients and minerals. Oral rehydration fluids that you can get over the counter are most helpful for mild dehydration. Dehydration can lead to serious problems. Severe dehydration may require hospitalization for treatment with fluids given through your vein (intravenous or IV fluids). If you think you or someone you are caring for is severely dehydrated, call your doctor. Norovirus is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea, and foodborne illness in the United States. Always wash your hands and handle food well. Languages Language Assistance",

                "content": "Norovirus infection can cause severe vomiting and diarrhea that start suddenly. Noroviruses are highly contagious. They commonly spread through food or water that is contaminated during preparation or through contaminated surfaces. Noroviruses can also spread through close contact with a person who has norovirus infection. Diarrhea, stomach pain and vomiting typically begin 12 to 48 hours after exposure. Norovirus infection symptoms usually last 1 to 3 days. Most people recover completely without treatment. However, for some people — especially young children, older adults and people with other medical conditions — vomiting and diarrhea can be severely dehydrating and require medical attention. Norovirus infection occurs most frequently in closed and crowded environments. Examples include hospitals, nursing homes, child care centers, schools and cruise ships. Signs and symptoms of norovirus infection may start suddenly and include: Signs and symptoms usually begin 12 to 48 hours after your first exposure to a norovirus and last 1 to 3 days. You can continue to shed virus in your stool for several weeks after recovery. This shedding can last weeks to months if you have another medical condition. Some people with norovirus infection may show no signs or symptoms. However, they're still contagious and can spread the virus to others. Seek medical attention if you develop diarrhea that doesn't go away within several days. Also call your health care provider if you experience severe vomiting, bloody stools, stomach pain or dehydration. Noroviruses are highly contagious. That means the norovirus infection can easily spread to others. The virus is shed in stool and vomit. You can spread the virus from the time you first have symptoms of illness until several days after you recover. Noroviruses can stay on surfaces and objects for days or weeks. You can get norovirus infection by: Noroviruses are difficult to kill because they can withstand hot and cold temperatures and many disinfectants. Risk factors for becoming infected with a norovirus include: For most people, norovirus infection usually clears up within a few days and isn't life-threatening. But in some people — especially young children; older adults; and people with weakened immune systems or other medical conditions or who are pregnant — norovirus infection can be severe. Norovirus infection can cause severe dehydration and even death. Warning signs of dehydration include: Children who are dehydrated might cry with few or no tears. They might be unusually sleepy or fussy. Norovirus infection is highly contagious. There are many types of noroviruses. Anyone can get norovirus infection more than once.

                "content": "Norovirus, also known as Norwalk virus and sometimes referred to as the winter vomiting disease, is the most common cause of gastroenteritis.[1][6] Infection is characterized by non-bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain.[2][3] Fever or headaches may also occur.[2] Symptoms usually develop 12 to 48 hours after being exposed, and recovery typically occurs within one to three days.[2] Complications are uncommon, but may include dehydration, especially in the young, the old, and those with other health problems.[2] The virus is usually spread by the fecal–oral route.[3] This may be through contaminated food or water or person-to-person contact.[3] It may also spread via contaminated surfaces or through air from the vomit of an infected person.[3] Risk factors include unsanitary food preparation and sharing close quarters.[3] Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms.[3] Confirmatory testing is not usually available but may be performed by public health agencies during outbreaks.[3] Prevention involves proper hand washing and disinfection of contaminated surfaces.[4] There is no vaccine or specific treatment for norovirus.[4][5] Management involves supportive care such as drinking sufficient fluids or intravenous fluids.[5] Oral rehydration solutions are the preferred fluids to drink, although other drinks without caffeine or alcohol can help.[5] Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not effective against the norovirus, according to the NHS information page on the subject;[8] this is due to norovirus being a non-enveloped virus. Norovirus results in about 685 million cases of disease and 200,000 deaths globally a year.[6][7] It is common both in the developed and developing world.[3][9] Those under the age of five are most often affected, and in this group it results in about 50,000 deaths in the developing world.[6] Norovirus infections occur more commonly during winter months.[6] It often occurs in outbreaks, especially among those living in close quarters.[3] In the United States, it is the cause of about half of all foodborne disease outbreaks.[3] The virus is named after the city of Norwalk, Ohio, US, where an outbreak occurred in 1968.[10] Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. A person usually develops symptoms of gastroenteritis 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus.[11] General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headaches, and low-grade fevers may occur. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it is not usually dangerous, and most who contract it make a full recovery within two to three days.[1] Norovirus can establish a long-term infection in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with common variable immunodeficiency or with a suppressed immune system after organ transplantation.[12] These infections can be with or without symptoms.[12] In severe cases, persistent infections can lead to norovirus‐associated enteropathy, intestinal villous atrophy, and malabsorption.[12] Noroviruses are transmitted directly from person to person (62–84% of all reported outbreaks)[13] and indirectly via contaminated water and food. Transmission can be aerosolized when those stricken with the illness vomit or by a toilet flush when vomit or diarrhea is present; infection can follow eating food or breathing air near an episode of vomiting, even if cleaned up.[14] The viruses continue to be shed after symptoms have subsided, and shedding can still be detected many weeks after infection.[15] Vomiting, in particular, transmits infection effectively and appears to allow airborne transmission. In one incident, a person who vomited spread the infection across a restaurant, suggesting that many unexplained cases of food poisoning may have their source in vomit.[16] In December 1998, 126 people were dining at six tables; one person vomited onto the floor. Staff quickly cleaned up, and people continued eating. Three days later others started falling ill; 52 people reported a range of symptoms, from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea. The cause was not immediately identified. Researchers plotted the seating arrangement: more than 90% of the people at the same table as the sick person later reported becoming ill. There was a direct correlation between the risk of infection of people at other tables and how close they were to the sick person. More than 70% of the diners at an adjacent table fell ill; at a table on the other side of the restaurant, the infection rate was still 25%. The outbreak was attributed to a Norwalk-like virus (norovirus). Other cases of transmission by vomit were later identified.[17] In one outbreak at an international scout jamboree in the Netherlands, each person with gastroenteritis infected an average of 14 people before increased hygiene measures were put in place. Even after these new measures were enacted, an ill person still infected an average of 2.1 other people.[18] A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study of 11 outbreaks in New York State lists the suspected mode of transmission as person-to-person in seven outbreaks, foodborne in two, waterborne in one, and one unknown. The source of waterborne outbreaks may include water from municipal supplies, wells, recreational lakes, swimming pools, and ice machines.[19] Shellfish and salad ingredients are the foods most often implicated in norovirus outbreaks. Ingestion of shellfish that has not been sufficiently heated – under 75 °C (167 °F) – poses a high risk for norovirus infection.[20][21] Foods other than shellfish may be contaminated by infected food handlers.[22] Many norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by only one infected person.[23] Between March and August 2017, in Quebec, Canada, there was an outbreak of norovirus that sickened more than 700 people. According to an investigation by Canada's CFIA Food Control Agency, the culprit was frozen raspberries imported from Harbin Gaotai Food Co Ltd, a Chinese supplier, and then Canadian authorities issued a recall on raspberries products from Harbin Gaotai.[24] According to the CDC, there was a surge in norovirus cases on thirteen cruise ships in 2023, which marks the highest number of outbreaks since 2012.[25] Noroviruses (NoV) are a genetically diverse group of single-stranded positive-sense RNA, non-enveloped viruses belonging to the family Caliciviridae.[26][27] According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, the genus Norovirus has one species, which is called Norwalk virus.[26] Noroviruses can genetically be classified into at least seven different genogroups (GI, GII, GIII, GIV, GV, GVI, and GVII), which can be further divided into other genetic clusters or genotypes.[28] Noroviruses commonly isolated in cases of acute gastroenteritis belong to two genogroups: genogroup I (GI) includes Norwalk virus, Desert Shield virus, and Southampton virus; and II (GII), which includes Bristol virus, Lordsdale virus, Toronto virus, Mexico virus, Hawaii virus and Snow Mountain virus.[27] Most noroviruses that infect humans belong to genogroups GI and GII.[29] Noroviruses from genogroup II, genotype 4 (abbreviated as GII.4) account for the majority of adult outbreaks of gastroenteritis and often sweep across the globe.[30] Recent examples include US95/96-US strain, associated with global outbreaks in the mid- to late-1990s; Farmington Hills virus associated with outbreaks in Europe and the United States in 2002 and in 2004; and Hunter virus which was associated with outbreaks in Europe, Japan, and Australasia. In 2006, there was another large increase in NoV infection around the globe.[31] Reports have shown a link between the expression of human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) and the susceptibility to norovirus infection. Studies have suggested the capsid of noroviruses may have evolved from selective pressure of human HBGAs.[32] HBGAs are not, however, the receptor or facilitator of norovirus infection. Co-factors such as bile salts may facilitate the infection, making it more intense when introduced during or after the initial infection of the host tissue.[33] Bile salts are produced by the liver in response to eating fatty foods, and they help with the absorption of consumed lipids. It is not yet clear at what specific point in the Norovirus replication cycle bile salts facilitate infection: penetration, uncoating, or maintaining capsid stability.[33] The protein MDA-5 may be the primary immune sensor that detects the presence of noroviruses in the body.[34] Some people have common variations of the MDA-5 gene that could make them more susceptible to norovirus infection.[35] Viruses in Norovirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral geometries. Capsid diameters vary widely, from 23 to 40 nm in diameter. The larger capsids (38–40 nm) exhibit T=3 symmetry and are composed of 180 VP1 proteins. Small capsids (23 nm) show T=1 symmetry, and are composed of 60 VP1 proteins.[36] The virus particles demonstrate an amorphous surface structure when visualized using electron microscopy.[37] Noroviruses contain a linear, non-segmented,[36] positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kilobases, encoding a large polyprotein which is cleaved into six smaller non-structural proteins (NS1/2 to NS7)[38] by the viral 3C-like protease (NS6), a major structural protein (VP1) of about 58~60 kDa and a minor capsid protein (VP2).[39] The most variable region of the viral capsid is the P2 domain, which contains antigen-presenting sites and carbohydrate-receptor binding regions.[40][41][42][43][44] Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 last shared a common ancestor in AD 867.[45] The group 2 and group 4 viruses last shared a common ancestor in approximately AD 1443 (95% highest posterior density AD 1336–1542).[46] Several estimates of the evolution rate have been made varying from 8.98 × 10−3 to 2.03 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year.[citation needed] The estimated mutation rate (1.21×10−2 to 1.41 ×10−2 substitutions per site per year) in this virus is high even compared with other RNA viruses.[47] In addition, a recombination hotspot exists at the ORF1-ORF2 (VP1) junction.[48] Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Positive-stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of replication. Translation takes place by leaky scanning and RNA termination-reinitiation. Humans and other mammals serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are fecal-oral and contamination.[36] When a person becomes infected with norovirus, the virus replicates within the small intestine. The principal symptom is acute gastroenteritis, characterized by nausea, forceful vomiting, watery diarrhea, and abdominal pain, that develops between 12 and 48 hours after exposure and lasts for 24–72 hours.[49] Sometimes there is loss of taste, general lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, cough, and/or low-grade fever. The disease is usually self-limiting.[citation needed] Severe illness is rare; although people are frequently treated at the emergency ward, they are rarely admitted to the hospital. The number of deaths from norovirus in the United States is estimated to be around 570–800[50] each year, with most of these occurring in the very young, the elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems. Symptoms may become life-threatening in these groups if dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is ignored or left untreated.[51] Specific diagnosis of norovirus is routinely made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays or quantitative PCR assays, which give results within a few hours. These assays are very sensitive and can detect as few as 10 virus particles.[52] Tests such as ELISA that use antibodies against a mixture of norovirus strains are available commercially, but lack specificity and sensitivity.[53] After infection, immunity to the same strain of the virus – the genotype – protects against reinfection for between six months to two years.[54] This immunity does not fully protect against infection with the other diverse genotypes of the virus.[54] In Canada, norovirus is a notifiable disease.[55] In both the US and the UK it is not notifiable.[56][57] Hand washing with soap and water is an effective method for reducing the transmission of norovirus pathogens. Alcohol rubs (≥62% isopropyl alcohol) may be used as an adjunct, but are less effective than hand-washing, as norovirus lacks a lipid viral envelope.[58] Surfaces where norovirus particles may be present can be sanitised with a solution of 1.5% to 7.5% of household bleach in water, or other disinfectants effective against norovirus.[49][59][60] In healthcare environments, the prevention of nosocomial infections involves routine and terminal cleaning. Nonflammable alcohol vapor in CO2 systems is used in health care environments where medical electronics would be adversely affected by aerosolized chlorine or other caustic compounds.[61] In 2011, the CDC published a clinical practice guideline addressing strategies for the prevention and control of norovirus gastroenteritis outbreaks in healthcare settings.[62][63] Based on a systematic review of published scientific studies, the guideline presents 51 specific evidence-based recommendations, which were organized into 12 categories: 1) patient cohorting and isolation precautions, 2) hand hygiene, 3) patient transfer and ward closure, 4) food handlers in healthcare, 5) diagnostics, 6) personal protective equipment, 7) environmental cleaning, 8) staff leave and policy, 9) visitors, 10) education, 11) active case-finding, and 12) communication and notification. The guideline also identifies eight high-priority recommendations and suggests several areas in need of future research.[citation needed] LigoCyte announced in 2007 that it was working on a vaccine and had started phase 1 trials.[64] The company has since been taken over by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company.[65] As of 2019[update], a bivalent (NoV GI.1/GII.4) intramuscular vaccine had completed phase 1 trials.[66][67] In 2020 the phase 2b trials were finished.[68][69] The vaccine relies on using a virus-like particle that is made of the norovirus capsid proteins in order to mimic the external structure of the virus. Since there is no RNA in this particle, it is incapable of reproducing and cannot cause an infection.[64] The norovirus can survive for long periods outside a human host depending on the surface and temperature conditions: it can survive for weeks on hard and soft surfaces,[70] and it can survive for months, maybe even years in contaminated still water.[71] A 2006 study found the virus remained on surfaces used for food preparation seven days after contamination.[72] Routine protocols to detect norovirus in clams and oysters by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction are being employed by governmental laboratories such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US.[73] There is no specific medicine to treat people with norovirus illness. Norovirus infection cannot be treated with antibiotics because it is a virus. Treatments aim to avoid complications by measures such as the management of dehydration caused by fluid loss in vomiting and diarrhea,[5] and to mitigate symptoms using antiemetics and antidiarrheals.[74] Norovirus causes about 18% of all cases of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. It is relatively common in developed countries and in low-mortality developing countries (20% and 19% respectively) compared to high-mortality developing countries (14%). Proportionately it causes more illness in people in the community or in hospital outpatients (24% and 20% respectively) as compared with hospital inpatients (17%) in whom other causes are more common.[76] Age and emergence of new norovirus strains do not appear to affect the proportion of gastroenteritis attributable to norovirus.[76] In the United States, the estimated annual number of norovirus cases in 2023[update] was 21 million,[77] representing a rate of 6,270 cases per 100,000 individuals. Norovirus is a common cause of epidemics of gastroenteritis on cruise ships. The CDC, through its Vessel Sanitation Program, records and investigates outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness – mostly caused by norovirus – on cruise ships with both a US and foreign itinerary;[78] there were 12 in 2015, and 10 from 1 January to 9 May 2016. An outbreak may affect over 25% of passengers, and a smaller proportion of crew members.[79] Epidemiological studies have shown that individuals with different ABO(H) (histo-blood group) phenotypes are infected with NoV strains in a genotype-specific manner.[80][81] GII.4 includes global epidemic strains and binds to more histo-blood group antigens than other genogroups.[80] FUT2 fucosyltransferase transfers a fucose sugar to the end of the ABO(H) precursor in gastrointestinal cells and saliva glands. The ABH-antigen produced is thought to act as a receptor for human norovirus: A non-functional fucosyltransferase FUT2 provides high protection from the most common norovirus strain, GII.4.[82] Homozygous carriers of any nonsense mutation in the FUT2 gene are called non-secretors, as no ABH-antigen is produced. Approximately 20% of Caucasians are non-secretors due to G428A and C571T nonsense mutations in FUT2 and therefore have strong – although not absolute – protection from the norovirus GII.4.[83] Non-secretors can still produce ABH antigens in erythrocytes, as the precursor is formed by FUT1.[80] Some norovirus genotypes (GI.3) can infect non-secretors.[84] The norovirus was originally named the \"Norwalk agent\" after Norwalk, Ohio, in the United States, where an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred among children at Bronson Elementary School in November 1968. In 1972, electron microscopy on stored human stool samples identified a virus, which was given the name \"Norwalk virus\". Numerous outbreaks with similar symptoms have been reported since. The cloning and sequencing of the Norwalk virus genome showed that these viruses have a genomic organization consistent with viruses belonging to the family Caliciviridae.[85] The name \"norovirus\" (Norovirus for the genus) was approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) in 2002.[86] In 2011, however, a press release and a newsletter were published by ICTV, which strongly encouraged the media, national health authorities, and the scientific community to use the virus name Norwalk virus, rather than the genus name Norovirus when referring to outbreaks of the disease. This was also a public response by ICTV to the request from an individual in Japan to rename the Norovirus genus because of the possibility of negative associations for people in Japan and elsewhere who have the family name \"Noro\". Before this position of ICTV was made public, ICTV consulted widely with members of the Caliciviridae Study Group and carefully discussed the case.[87] In addition to \"Norwalk agent\" and \"Norwalk virus\", the virus has also been called \"Norwalk-like virus\", \"small, round-structured viruses\" (SRSVs), Spencer flu, and \"Snow Mountain virus\".[88] Common names of the illness caused by noroviruses still in use include \"Roskilde illness\", \"winter vomiting disease\",[89] \"winter vomiting bug\",[90][91] \"viral gastroenteritis\", and \"acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis\".[51]",
