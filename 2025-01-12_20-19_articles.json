With a matchup against the Chargers and star hurler Justin Herbert ‚Äî winners of three straight ‚Äî on the horizon, conditions seemed ripe for mayhem to unfold. As it turned out, chaos was on the cards. However, when the dust settled on the matchup, it was Houston, not Los Angeles, that finished on top. The Texans captured a 32-12 victory over their AFC West foes, punching their ticket to the AFC divisional round in the process. Houston's offense looked weary in the game's opening stages, struggling to mount much of anything as the likes of Nick Bosa, Derwin James, and Alohi Gilman made their presence felt. However, the Will Anderson and Derek Stingley Jr.-led unit was nearly faultless as the night wore on, collecting four interceptions and four sacks on Herbert. MORE CHARGERS-TEXANS: C.J. Stroud, held quiet for much of the first half, finished his contest with 22-of-33 passing, 282 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. He added another six carries and 42 yards on the ground, authoring up a solid, if unspectacular, display. Compared to Herbert, it was a masterpiece. The Chargers' fifth-year starter completed 14-of-32 passes for 242 yards, one touchdown and four interceptions. His four INTs were one more than he threw all season. Houston's next matchup will be determined after the rest of the AFC games on Saturday and Sunday. If both the Bills and Ravens win, as expected, Houston will travel to Kansas City and face the Chiefs. The Texans were far from perfect on Saturday. As long as that defense continues to perform, they might not have to be, though. The Sporting News tracked live updates from Saturday's wild-card duel between the Chargers and the Texans. Check them out below. SN'S PLAYOFFS HQ: Live NFL scores | Full NFL schedule | Updated NFL bracket All times Eastern. 7:50 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! Stingley plucks another Herbert pass out the sky!

Vitally, he stayed in bounds, seemingly forcing the Chargers to burn a timeout. 7:37 p.m.: Stroud moves the chanson the QB sneak. The Texans are rolling with just 4:15 left. 7:36 p.m.: The call on the field stands as given. Houston's offense is back on the field on fourth and short. 7:33 p.m.: Stroud takes it himself and darts the length of the line marker, falling just short of the first down line ‚Äî or did he? Head coach DeMeco Ryans is challenging the spot of the ball. 7:32 p.m.: Houston is working the clock down, with Mixon being called into action more. He's up to seven straight carries as the clock dwindles below six minutes. 7:24 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Herbert finds McConkey, who evades a would-be tackle before racing 86 yards to pay dirt. Unfortunately for the Bolts, the ensuing PAT was swatted away, with Dicker deflecting the ball into Ross' path, who rumbles down the length of the field to tack on two points to Houston's edge.

Herbert and Co. once more are sent back to the sidelines after a brief possession. 6:55 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! After a sordid bit of mayhem, Houston tacks on three to its advantage via Fairbairn's foot. Texans 13, Chargers 6 6:50 p.m.: The interception was overturned! James was deemed to not complete have completed the catch when he came down to the ground. On his ensuing return, he was struck down deep in Los Angeles' territory ‚Äî although he would've technically been ruled down by contact. Mixon delivered an illegal hit while James brought the ball back, prompting a 15-yard penalty for unnecessary. As a result, the Texans will receive the ball back facing second-and-30. What a mouthful... 6:46 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! Stroud fires another pass towards Stover. James is privy to the toss, leaping high to collect Stroud's errant effort. That's Houston's third turnover of the day. It's hard to win in the postseason when you do that. ‚ö°Ô∏è DERWIN JAMES JUNIOR ‚ö°Ô∏èüì∫: #LACvsHOU on CBS/Paramount+üì±: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/zlYVpDZzKw 6:44 p.m.: Stroud, Mixon and tight end Cade Stover have the combined to bring the Texans on the cusp of the red zone...again. 6:35 p.m.: TURNOVER ON DOWNS!

Fairbairn splits the offense from 41. Houston's lead swells as the half nears its completion. Texans 10, Chargers 6 6:11 p.m.: Another completion gives Ka'imi Fairbairn some additional room to work with. 6:08 p.m.: Stroud looks far more comfortable than he did earlier in the game. Just slalomed down the field for 27 yards, placing Houston in field goal position as the half nears its close. 6:07 p.m.: After the Bolts' ensuing drive came to a swift and sudden close, the Texans have a chance to potentially add to their advantage. 6:00 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! The Stroud-Collins partnership is finally starting to bear fruit today. Collins shakes off his marker on third-and-11, spilling out into space on the slant route. Stroud finds him with relative ease, giving the Texans a much-vaunted score before the end of the first half.

The Texans are hoping that moment will breathe life into their offense, which has been dour thus far. 5:45 p.m.: Los Angeles has struggled to capitalize on its time of possession advantage. Despite a pair of early McConkey contributions, the Chargers' latest drive took on the shape of most of their other ones, ending in a punt. 5:41 p.m.: McConkey is making his mark in his first career playoff game. The Georgia alum reeled in Herbert's dart then curled beyond the marker to move the chains on third down. 5:38 p.m.: Another Houston drive falters as Tommy Townsend returns to the field to launch another punt down into Los Angeles territory. 5:33 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! Herbert returns the favor, throwing across his body in the hopes of finding Johnston. It didn't work ‚Äî Kamari Lassiter high-pointed the ball and evaded Johnston's reach to rip the ball out the sky.

However, the drive fell to pieces after a Quentin Johnston drop on third down. Another punt is on the horizon. 5:20 p.m.: Another Texans drive comes to a premature close. Ball headed back to the Chargers. 5:10 p.m.: BLOCKED PUNT! D'Angelo Ross gets a finger tip on JK Scott's punt, sending the ensuing effort sputtering out of bounds. The punt itself landed inside of Houston's 30, so not the worst result for the Bolts. Still, they'll want to keep tabs on Ross going forward. .@HoustonTexans special teams making plays!üì∫: #LACvsHOU on CBS/Paramount+üì±: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/MiPnRX3ZOH 5:00 p.m.: Stroud misses his target bad on third down, only narrowly avoiding an interception.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. HOUSTON (AP) Derek Stingley says the Texans aim to force three turnovers a game. On Saturday against the Los Angeles Chargers, they surpassed that goal with the All-Pro cornerback grabbing two of Justin Herbert's career-high four interceptions to help Houston roll to a 32-12 wild-card playoff victory. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just going out there playing like we‚Äôve got to get the ball to win,‚Äù Stingley said. Eric Murray returned one of the interceptions for a touchdown and C.J. Stroud threw a TD pass in Houston's win. Since the merger, quarterbacks are 55-551-2 when throwing four or more interceptions in the regular season and just 3-33 when doing so in the playoffs. ‚ÄúI let the team down,‚Äù Herbert said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt turn over the ball like that and expect to win. I put the team in a tough position there with four turnovers like that.‚Äù It‚Äôs the second straight year Stroud and the Texans (11-7) won in the first round after they beat Cleveland last season. ‚ÄúIt hasn‚Äôt always been easy this year,‚Äù Stroud said. ‚ÄúBut this is just another thing that we can use to motivate us even more.‚Äù Herbert threw just three interceptions in the regular season and had never thrown more than two in a game before facing a Texans secondary led by Stingley. Rookie Kamari Lassiter had the other pick. The Texans made Herbert uncomfortable in the pocket all day, sacking him four times and hitting him another nine. ‚ÄúOur defense, they dominated today,‚Äù coach DeMeco Ryans said. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs who we want to be. They played our brand of football.‚Äù The Chargers (11-7), who returned to the playoffs under first-year coach Jim Harbaugh, lost in the wild-card round for a second straight time after also losing in the 2022 season to remain without a postseason win since 2018. Harbaugh, who won a national championship with Michigan in Houston last January, took the blame for the loss. ‚ÄúThey were the better team today,\" he said. \"All respect to them. Not being the better team today, I‚Äôm accountable for that. That‚Äôs on me.‚Äù Stroud threw for 282 yards with the touchdown pass to Nico Collins and an interception. Stroud joined Pittsburgh's Ben Roethlisberger, Baltimore's Joe Flacco, the New York Jets' Mark Sanchez, Seattle's Russell Wilson and San Francisco's Brock Purdy as quarterbacks to win playoff starts in each of their first two seasons. Collins finished with seven catches for 122 yards to set a franchise playoff record. Joe Mixon ran for 106 yards and a score. D‚ÄôAngelo Ross returned a blocked extra point for 2 points for Houston in the fourth quarter. Herbert was 14 of 32 for 242 yards with a 40.9 passer rating. Things looked bad early for the Texans, who fumbled on their first offense play and were down 6-0 with about a minute left in the first half. But Stroud threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to Collins to put the Texans on top. Ka‚Äôimi Fairbairn added a 41-yard field goal to give Houston a 10-6 lead into halftime. They were up 13-6 when Murray scored his first career touchdown on a 38-yard interception return late in the third quarter. Herbert was picked off again on the next drive when Stingley grabbed a pass that was tipped off tight end Will Dissly. The third overall pick in the 2022 draft intercepted Herbert again late in the fourth quarter. Herbert found Ladd McConkey for an 86-yard touchdown reception to cut the Chargers' deficit to 23-12 in the fourth quarter. But Cameron Dicker‚Äôs extra-point attempt was blocked and returned by Ross to make it 25-12. A 17-yard run by Mixon extended Houston‚Äôs advantage to 32-12 with about four minutes to go. The Chargers were up by 3 after a field goal on their first drive when John Metchie fumbled after a catch on Houston‚Äôs first offensive play and it was recovered by Derwin James. Dicker added a 39-yard field goal on the ensuing drive to make it 6-0. Deane Leonard intercepted Stroud early in the second quarter, but Lassiter picked off Herbert on the next play to give Houston the ball back. But the Texans couldn‚Äôt move the ball and punted. Stroud and Houston‚Äôs offense finally got something going. Houston was facing third-and-16 from its 17 when Stroud fumbled the snap and it rolled 4 yards behind him. He scooped it up and evaded the rush to find Xavier Hutchinson for a 34-yard gain. ‚ÄúThat was an outstanding play,‚Äù Ryans said. ‚ÄúTo me that was the play of the game that really created momentum for our entire team.‚Äù Harbaugh agreed. ‚ÄúIt grabbed quite a bit of momentum,\" he said. \"It‚Äôs my job, our job, to get the momentum back.‚Äù Stroud connected with Collins on a 37-yard reception two plays later to get the Texans in the red zone. He found Collins again on third-and-11 to cap the 99-yard drive and put Houston on top 7-6 about a minute before halftime. The Texans forced a punt to get the ball back with 27 seconds left in the second quarter. A season-best 27-yard run by Stroud got the Texans to the Los Angeles 36. The quarterback beat his chest and screamed after taking a hard hit at the end of the run. Chargers: LB Denzel Perryman injured an elbow in the first quarter and didn‚Äôt return. ... CB Cam Hart injured a shoulder. The Texans move on to the divisional round for the sixth time, where they‚Äôll try to advance to the AFC championship game for the first time in franchise history. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Copyright 2025 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "content": "The Houston Texans are a professional American football team based in Houston. The Texans compete in the National Football League as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) South division. The team plays its home games at NRG Stadium. The Texans were founded in 1999, and were owned by Bob McNair until his death in 2018; following McNair's death, the majority ownership of the team went to his wife, Janice. The McNairs' son, Cal, became operating head of the franchise upon his father's death, and became principal owner when his mother transferred ownership to him in 2024.[7] The team replaced the city's previous NFL franchise, the Houston Oilers, who played from 1960 to 1996 before moving to Nashville and eventually becoming the Tennessee Titans. The Texans began play as an expansion team in 2002, making them the youngest franchise currently competing in the NFL.[8] While the Texans mainly struggled in the 2000s, their fortunes would take a turn for the better in the 2010s when they won their first division championship in 2011, clinching their first playoff berth.[9][10] The Texans have gone on to win seven more AFC South division championships in 2012, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2023, and 2024. They are the only franchise to have never won a road playoff game along with the only one to have never appeared in a conference championship game; they are also one of four franchises to have never appeared in a Super Bowl,[11] alongside the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, and division rival Jacksonville Jaguars. According to an article by Forbes, the Houston Texans are the eleventh richest team in the NFL with a value of $4.7 billion in August 2022.[12] After the Texas Rangers won the 2023 World Series, the Houston Texans became the only big four professional sports franchise currently based in Texas without a championship. In 1997, Houston entrepreneur Bob McNair had a failed bid to bring a National Hockey League (NHL) expansion team to the city, and Bud Adams relocated the city's NFL team, the Houston Oilers, to Nashville, Tennessee, where they were renamed the Tennessee Titans in 1999. In 1996, the Cleveland Browns had controversially relocated to become the Baltimore Ravens. As part of the settlement between the NFL, the city of Cleveland, and the team owned by Art Modell, the league promised to return football to Cleveland within the next three years. In order to even out the franchises to 32, the NFL contemplated adding another expansion franchise. As Houston was one of the favorites for the extra franchise, along with Toronto and Los Angeles (the latter of whom had lost the Rams and the Raiders in 1995), McNair then decided to join the football project and founded Houston NFL Holdings with partner Steve Patterson. With Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, they would push for a domed stadium as part of the bid to lure the NFL back to Houston. On October 6, 1999, the NFL awarded the 32nd team to Houston at a cost of $700 million.[1] The Houston Texans joined the NFL in the 2002 season, playing at the newly opened Reliant Stadium under head coach Dom Capers.[13] With their opening game victory over the Dallas Cowboys on September 8, 2002, the Texans became the first expansion team to win its opening game since the Minnesota Vikings beat the Chicago Bears in 1961.[14] The Texans went 4‚Äì12 and finished last in the AFC South in their debut season.[15] The team improved to a 5‚Äì11 mark in the 2003 season.[16] The team continued to make progress with a 7‚Äì9 record in the 2004 season.[17] In the 2005 season, the Texans fell to a 2‚Äì14 record for the worst mark in the league.[18] Following the end of the season, the team fired Capers as head coach.[19] They earned the top pick in the 2006 NFL Draft.[20] While the team struggled in its early seasons, results began to improve when native Houstonian Gary Kubiak became the head coach in 2006.[21] The Texans finished with a .500 season (8‚Äì8) in 2007 and 2008, and nearly qualified for the 2009‚Äì10 playoffs with a 9‚Äì7 result in 2009. The Texans started the 2010 season on a 4‚Äì2 record going into a Week 7 bye week, but promptly collapsed 2‚Äì8 in the second half of the season, finishing 6‚Äì10. In the 2011 NFL draft, the Texans acquired Wisconsin star defensive end J. J. Watt 11th overall. The following season, former Cowboys head coach Wade Phillips was hired as the defensive coordinator for the Texans, and the improved defense led to them finishing 10‚Äì6, winning their first AFC South title.[22] The Texans then beat wild card Cincinnati Bengals 31‚Äì10 in the first round of the 2011‚Äì12 playoffs,[23] before a 20‚Äì13 defeat by the Ravens in the Divisional Round.[24] The Texans surged as the team to beat in the AFC South in 2012, starting 5‚Äì0 and holding an 11‚Äì1 record by week 14. However, they lost three of their last four games to finish 12‚Äì4; beating the rival Indianapolis Colts in that four-game stretch allowing them to clinch their 2nd AFC South title. The Texans beat the Bengals again in the wild-card round,[25] but they lost in the Divisional Round to the New England Patriots.[26] In the 2013 NFL draft, the Texans acquired Clemson wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins 27th overall.[27] In 2013, the Texans started 2‚Äì0 but went into a tailspin and lost every game afterwards.[28] Kubiak was fired as head coach after being swept by the rival Jacksonville Jaguars, who themselves started 0‚Äì8.[29] Wade Phillips filled in as head coach, but the Texans' poor form did not change, and they finished 2‚Äì14, tying, with 2005, their worst record in franchise history.[30] The 14-game losing streak is the worst in franchise history. The Texans entered the 2014 season with a 14-game losing streak. Former Penn State head coach Bill O'Brien became the Texans' new head coach, and the third in franchise history, during the offseason.[31][32] In 2014, the Texans won three of their first four games, defeating the Redskins in the season opener while ending the losing streak, the Raiders, and the Bills, losing to the New York Giants. They lost three of their next four games, losing to the Dallas Cowboys, the Indianapolis Colts, and the Pittsburgh Steelers, respectively. The Texans went on to finish 9‚Äì7 in the 2014 season and barely missed the playoffs.[33] In the 2015 season, they were featured on HBO, on the show \"Hard Knocks\".[34] That year, the Texans started with a 2‚Äì5 record. Quarterback Ryan Mallett was released amidst controversy regarding his benching in favor of Brian Hoyer during a loss against the Indianapolis Colts.[35] After a poor start, the Texans finished with a 9‚Äì7 record and won their third AFC South title.[36] However, they were shut out by the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card round 30‚Äì0, ending their championship hopes for the year.[37] On March 9, 2016, the Texans signed former Denver Broncos quarterback Brock Osweiler to a 4-year, $72 million deal.[38] Despite Osweiler's lucrative deal, he struggled significantly during the 2016 season. After throwing two interceptions in Week 15 against the Jaguars, coach Bill O'Brien benched the offseason acquisition in favor of backup quarterback Tom Savage. Savage led a comeback effort against the Jaguars, and was named the starter for the remainder of the season. The Texans clinched their fourth AFC South division title in six years in Savage's first career start against the Bengals in Week 16. They defeated the wildcard Oakland Raiders 27‚Äì14 in the opening round of the playoffs with Osweiler as the starting quarterback due to Savage being out with a concussion.[39] Osweiler started in the Divisional Playoffs game against the New England Patriots, throwing three interceptions in the second half. The Texans lost 34‚Äì16.[40] In the 2017 NFL draft, the Texans traded up to the 12th overall selection to select Clemson star quarterback Deshaun Watson.[41] Watson started six games his rookie year, going 3‚Äì3 and having arguably the greatest and most decorated rookie season by a quarterback in NFL history, eventually rising up to become the Texans' franchise quarterback. However, his success would come up very short, following a Week 8 41‚Äì38 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Watson tore his ACL in practice and was ruled out the remainder of the season, which caused the Texans to have one of their worst seasons.[42] Plagued by a series of unexpected injuries (including a second consecutive season-ending injury to J. J. Watt) and controversy involving the team's suspected violation of the league's concussion protocol, after backup quarterback Tom Savage suffered a seizure following a Week 14 game against the San Francisco 49ers, the Texans went 1‚Äì9 the rest of the season and eventually finish 4‚Äì12 and last in the AFC South in 2017, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2014 and giving Bill O'Brien his first losing season as Texans head coach.[43] In 2018, the Texans started the season 0‚Äì3, losing by a combined 15 points to the New England Patriots, Tennessee Titans, and New York Giants, before winning a 37‚Äì34 overtime shootout on the road in Indianapolis. This win sparked a nine-game winning streak for the Texans, their first since starting 5‚Äì0 in 2012, which included a Week 8 win against the Miami Dolphins that included five touchdown passes from Deshaun Watson.[44] This streak was the longest ever for a team that started the season 0‚Äì3; the previous record was a seven-game win-streak set by the New York Giants in 1918 after starting out 0‚Äì3.[45] On November 23, 2018, the owner of the Houston Texans, Bob McNair, died from skin cancer.[46] On November 26, 2018, McNair's wife, Janice McNair, became the principal owner and Senior Chair of the Houston Texans, while their son, D. Cal McNair, became the chairman and Chief Operating Officer.[47] The Texans finished the season 11‚Äì5, and won another AFC South division championship under Bill O'Brien.[48] They lost 21‚Äì7 in the first round of the playoffs to their AFC South division rival Indianapolis Colts.[49] In 2019, the Texans won the AFC South division championship and qualified for the NFL playoffs on the back of a 10‚Äì6 record.[50] They went on to defeat the Buffalo Bills by a score of 22‚Äì19 in overtime in the AFC wild-card round.[51] However, the Texans' 2019 season came to an end the following week, as they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 51‚Äì31 in the AFC divisional round.[52] The Texans had a 24‚Äì0 lead in the game before the Chiefs came back.[53] On March 22, 2020, the Texans traded away all-pro wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins and a fourth-round pick in the 2020 NFL draft to the Arizona Cardinals. In return, Houston received running back David Johnson, a 2020 second-round pick, and a 2021 fourth-round pick.[54] The move was confusing and controversial among fans and sportswriters alike, as many claimed that the Texans should have received more valuable assets for Hopkins, who was among the best receivers in the NFL.[55] The Texans began the 2020 NFL season with a record of 0‚Äì4, and Bill O'Brien was consequentially fired following a disappointing loss to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 4. Romeo Crennel, who was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns from 2005 to 2008 and of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2011‚Äì12,[56] was named the interim head coach for the remainder of the season.[57] Crennel managed to win more than half of his first 7 games as Houston's head coach, giving Houston a record of 4‚Äì7. However, the Texans ended the season on a five-game losing streak.[58] With a final record of 4‚Äì12, the Texans were unable to make the playoffs.[59] On January 27, 2021, the Texans hired David Culley as the team's head coach.[60] Culley most recently worked as the Baltimore Ravens assistant head coach, wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator. On February 12, 2021, the Texans released all-pro defensive end J.J. Watt. It was confirmed that Watt personally requested owner Cal McNair for his release.[61] On January 13, 2022, the Texans fired David Culley after posting a 4‚Äì13 record[62] as the team's head coach and promoted defensive coordinator Lovie Smith as the team's fifth head coach on February 7, 2022.[63] The team traded away their starting quarterback Deshaun Watson to the Cleveland Browns and a 2024 fifth round pick for three 1st round picks, a 3rd round pick and a 4th round pick on March 20, 2022, due to sexual misconduct lawsuits toward Watson.[64] The Texans opened their 2022 season in a tie game against the Indianapolis Colts, the franchise's first tie in their 20-year existence.[65][66] On January 9, 2023, the Texans announced that they were going in a different direction by firing Lovie Smith after a 3‚Äì13‚Äì1 season.[67] On January 31, 2023, the Texans hired former player and 49ers defensive coordinator DeMeco Ryans as their new head coach, making him the sixth head coach in franchise history.[68] In the 2023 NFL draft the Texans selected Ohio State quarterback C. J. Stroud and traded up to the third pick to select Defensive End Will Anderson Jr..[69] Under Ryans and Stroud, the team saw improved fortunes as they made the playoffs while winning the AFC South for the first time since the 2019 season with a 10‚Äì7 record, becoming the first NFL team to win their division under a rookie head coach and quarterback.[70] The team defeated the Cleveland Browns 45‚Äì14 in the Wild Card Round.[71] The Texans saw their season end in the Divisional Round with a 34‚Äì10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens.[72] Stroud would later be named NFL offensive Rookie of the Year, and Anderson Jr. would be named NFL defensive Rookie of the Year Award.[73][74] Ryans also finished in a tie in total votes for NFL Coach of the Year with Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski though he lost the award in a tiebreaker due to having one less first place vote.[75] The Texans are the youngest expansion team in the NFL, having only been competing in the NFL for 23 seasons since 2002 and have had limited regular season and postseason success. For that reason, they have not had the history or the reputation on which to build classic rivalries like the ones that often exist between older franchises. Despite this, the team has developed some rivalries. Its natural rivals are its fellow AFC South teams, which are the Tennessee Titans, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Indianapolis Colts.[76][77][78] The Tennessee Titans, who were formerly the Houston Oilers before their relocation in 1996, are viewed by many Houston fans as the Texans' chief rival as members of the AFC South ever since the early 2000s. Houstonians have grown their distaste for the Titans due to former owner Bud Adams and his family keeping the rights to the Oilers name and colors. Many Houston fans argue that the history of the Oilers belong to the City of Houston, relating in and out of sports; For example, Houston Police cars used don the iconic Colombia blue and red colors associated with the Oilers, and the ‚ÄúOilers‚Äù namesake relates directly to Houston‚Äôs role in the Oil and Gas Industry. In 2023, Tennessee unveiled Oilers Throwback Uniforms, which they wore to play the Texans. As of 2025, the Titans still occasionally use these uniforms. [79][80] As of the 2023 season, the Titans lead the all-time series 23‚Äì21.[81] Ever since the early 2000s, the Texans also have an AFC South Division rivalry with the Indianapolis Colts, whom the Texans had not defeated until the 2006 season.[82] The first time that the Texans would sweep the Colts was in the 2016 NFL season.[83] More recently, Houston has increased bitterness with the Indianapolis Colts due to their young Houston-native quarterback Andrew Luck having been drafted by the Colts in 2012 and the franchise's first ever sweep of the Colts against Luck in 2016. In 2018 the two teams met in the AFC Wild Card Playoffs, with the Colts winning 21‚Äì7.[84][85][86][87] Having begun play in 1995 and 2002, respectively, the Jaguars and Texans are among two of the most-recently established franchises in the NFL. The Jaguars relocated from the AFC Central to the newly created AFC South where the Texans were placed into and have competed as division rivals since. The Jaguars are the only division rival the Texans have a winning record against as the Texans lead the series 29‚Äì15.[88] The Texans also have an intrastate/interconference rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys, with whom they contest the so-called Governor's Cup every year (a tradition started between the cities prior to the Oilers relocating) either in the preseason or the regular season for bragging rights in the state of Texas. In 2017, the destruction and flooding caused during Hurricane Harvey a few days before their Week 4 pre-season match up time scheduled caused the game to be relocated to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. However, out of concern for the safety of the fans and the condition of the player's families & communities, the game was canceled.[89] As of the 2024 season, the Cowboys lead the all-time series 4‚Äì3.[90] The Texans are the newest team in the league, but they have been embraced by a fair amount of celebrities since joining the NFL in 2002. The team has also adopted a number of former Houston Oilers fans in search of a new home team. Despite the lacking playoff success, there have been a present amount of loyal fans and even various celebrities such as Ryan Trahan, George Foreman, Paul Wall, Rico Rodriguez, and Raini Rodriguez who have been strong supporters of the team.[91][92][93] During the 2010s, the team adopted the moniker \"Bulls on Parade\" in honor of the Rage Against the Machine song, regularly used prior to the team's introduction before entering the field.[94] In the process of naming the new franchise leadership conducted an extensive review and research process; the final list of names was determined after several months of research conducted jointly by Houston NFL 2002 and NFL Properties. This included an online survey asking fans and the community to weigh in which received more than 65,000 responses in one week. On March 2, 2000, it was announced that the team name search had been narrowed down to five choices: Apollos, Bobcats, Stallions, Texans, and Wildcatters.[95] On September 6, 2000, the NFL's 32nd franchise was officially christened the Houston Texans before thousands at a downtown rally in Houston. McNair explained that the name and logo were chosen to \"embody the pride, strength, independence and achievement that make the people of Houston and our area special.\"[96][97] The name \"Texans\" had been used by several now-defunct football teams, including the Canadian Football League franchise in San Antonio; the World Football League franchise in Houston, which moved to Louisiana to become the Shreveport Steamer; the Dallas Texans of the NFL which played in only the 1952 season; and by the precursor of the present-day Kansas City Chiefs, when they were the second incarnation of the Dallas Texans in the American Football League (AFL). Owner Bob McNair received permission from Chiefs' owner Lamar Hunt to use the Texans name for his new team.[22] It is also a subtle homage to the naming style of the NHL team the Montreal Canadiens who also named their team after their respective demonym.[22] Along with the team name, McNair unveiled the team logo, an abstract depiction of a bull's head, split in such a way to resemble the flag of Texas and the state of Texas, including a lone star to stand for the eye, the five points of which representing pride, courage, strength, tradition and independence. McNair described the colors as \"Deep Steel Blue\", \"Battle Red\" and \"Liberty White\".[96] A year later the Texans unveiled their uniforms during another downtown rally.[98] The Texans' helmet is dark blue with the Texans bull logo. The helmet was initially white when the team name and logo were unveiled, but was later changed to dark blue. The uniform design consists of red trim and either dark blue or white jerseys. The team typically wears white pants with its blue jerseys and blue pants with its white jerseys. Starting with the 2006 season, the Texans wore all-white for their home opener, and the team began to wear an all-blue combination for home games vs. the Indianapolis Colts. In 2003, the Texans introduced an alternative red jersey with blue trim; they wear this jersey at one home game each year, usually against a division rival. In 2007, the Texans introduced red pants for the first time, pairing them with the red jerseys for an all-red look. They would wear this look until 2010, but was brought back in 2023. In October 2008 the Texans paired blue socks (instead of the traditional red) with their blue pants and white jerseys, eventually becoming the team's primary road uniform combination. In 2016, the Texans unveiled a new uniform combo against the Jacksonville Jaguars, pairing the red jersey with blue pants and red socks. In 2017, the Texans unveiled a Color Rush uniform, using an all-blue uniform but with minimal white elements. In 2021, the Texans began sporting all-white socks on select home and road games. In 2022, the Texans began using a red alternate helmet with the red uniform. In 2023, the red alternate helmet was worn with the Color Rush uniform in a 21‚Äì16 victory against the Arizona Cardinals.[99] In 2002, the team wore a patch commemorating their inaugural season. Also, they celebrated 10 years as a franchise by wearing an anniversary patch throughout 2012. From 2018 to 2019, the Texans wore a memorial patch to honor Bob McNair after his death.[100] In April 2024, the Texans unveiled redesigned uniforms. The primary dark blue helmets remained, but the home blue uniforms were updated to include the Texans primary crest on the sleeve and new collar stripes, while the road white uniform featured blue and red horn stripes on the sleeves, along with blue numbers with red trim. The white uniform's design also served as the basis for the red alternate uniform, which is paired with a red helmet containing the blue horn stripes. A second alternate uniform is a navy blue base with \"H-Town blue\" accents; numbers are red with \"H-Town blue\" trim. This set is paired with a navy blue alternate helmet containing the \"H-Star\" decal in \"H-Town blue\" with red trim. The inclusion of a second alternate helmet is due to the NFL allowing teams with new uniforms to unveil these helmets in advance this season.[101] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 15 reserve, 16 practice squad (+1 exempt) The Texans have had the top-overall pick in the NFL Draft three times.[102] On November 19, 2017, Andre Johnson was the first-ever inductee into the Texans Ring of Honor.[103] On October 6, 2019, Bob McNair was posthumously the second inductee into the Texans Ring of Honor.[104] On October 1, 2023, J. J. Watt was the third inductee into the Texans Ring of Honor.[105] Only two members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame have spent any portion of their career with Texans, due in part to the requirements to be inducted and the Texans only having been established in 2002. In 2024, Andre Johnson became the first player to be inducted into the Hall of Fame primarily for his time with the Texans.[106] ‚Üí Coaching staff ‚Üí Front office ‚Üí More NFL staffs The Texans have had six full-time head coaches in their franchise history. The team has had two interim head coaches.[108] The team's official mascot is Toro, an anthropomorphic blue bull.[111] The team also has a cheerleading squad simply named the Houston Texans Cheerleaders.[112] Community outreach by the Houston Texans is primarily operated by the Houston Texans Foundation, who works with multiple community partners.[113] The Houston Texans organization is also a supporter of the character education program, Heart of a Champion.[114] In 2017, the 15th annual Houston Texans Charity Golf Classic raised more than $380,000 for the Foundation. More than $27.2 million has been raised for the Foundation since its creation in 2002.[115] Former Texans DE J. J. Watt raised $41.6 million in relief funds for Hurricane Harvey after the storm devastated the city in 2017.[116] Watt ended up winning the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award that season.[117] As of 2023[update], the Texans' flagship radio stations were KILT SportsRadio 610AM and KILT 100.3FM.[118] The AM station has an all-sports format, while the FM station plays contemporary country music. Both are owned by Audacy. Marc Vandermeer is the play-by-play announcer.[119] Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware provides color commentary, and SportsRadio 610 host Rich Lord serves as the sideline reporter.[120][121] Preseason and regular season Monday night games from ESPN are telecast by KTRK, an ABC owned and operated station. Kevin Kugler calls the preseason games on TV, with former Texans defensive end N. D.

                "content": "This is an accepted version of this page The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is an American mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion company based in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is owned and operated by TKO Group Holdings, a majority owned subsidiary of Endeavor Group Holdings.[5][6][7][8] It is the largest MMA promotion in the world as of 2023.[9] It produces events worldwide that showcase 11 weight divisions (eight men's and three women's) and abides by the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts.[10] As of 2024[update], it had held over 700 events. Dana White has been its president since 2001 and CEO since 2023. Under White's stewardship, it has grown into a global multi-billion-dollar enterprise.[11] The UFC was founded by businessman Art Davie and Brazilian martial artist Rorion Gracie,[12] and the first event was held in 1993 at McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado.[13] The purpose of the UFC's early competitions was to identify the most effective martial art in a contest with minimal rules and no weight classes between competitors of different fighting disciplines. In subsequent events, more rigorous rules were created and fighters began adopting effective techniques from more than one discipline, which indirectly helped create a separate style of fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts. The UFC was initially owned by the Semaphore Entertainment Group (SEG) until it had financial issues and it was sold to the brothers Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta in 2001, who formed the company Zuffa to operate the UFC, and placed Dana White as the president of the company.[11][14] In 2016, UFC's parent company, Zuffa, was sold to a group led by Endeavor, then known as William Morris Endeavor (WME‚ÄìIMG), including Silver Lake Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and MSD Capital[15] for US$4.025 billion.[16] In 2021, Endeavor bought out Zuffa's other owners at a valuation of $1.7 billion.[8] The organization had 578 fighters contracted as of January 2023.[17] With a TV deal and expansion in Australia, Asia, Europe,[18][19][20] and new markets within the United States, the UFC has achieved greater mainstream media coverage. It earned US$609 million in 2015,[21] and its next domestic media rights agreement with ESPN was valued at $1.5 billion over a five-year term.[22] In April 2023, Endeavor Group Holdings announced that UFC would merge with the wrestling promotion WWE to form TKO Group Holdings, a new public company majority-owned by Endeavor, with Vince McMahon serving as an executive chairman of the new entity and White remaining as UFC president. The merger was completed on September 12, 2023.[23] Art Davie proposed to John Milius and Rorion Gracie an eight-man single-elimination tournament called \"War of the Worlds\".[24] It was inspired by the \"Gracies in Action\" video-series produced by the Gracie family of Brazil which featured Gracie jiu-jitsu students defeating martial artists of various disciplines such as karate, kung fu, and kickboxing on Vale Tudo matches. The tournament would also feature martial artists from different disciplines facing each other in no-holds-barred combat to determine the best martial art, and would aim to replicate the excitement of the matches Davie saw on the videos.[25] Gracie accepted, as he was interested in showcasing and promoting his family's own jiu-jitsu for a wide audience.[26] Milius, a film director/screenwriter and Gracie student, agreed to be the event's creative director. Davie drafted the business plan, and 28 investors contributed the initial capital to start WOW Promotions to develop the tournament into a television franchise.[27] In 1993, WOW Promotions sought a television partner and approached pay-per-view producers TVKO (HBO) and SET (Showtime), and Campbell McLaren and David Isaacs at Semaphore Entertainment Group (SEG). Both TVKO and SET declined, but SEG‚Äîa pioneer in pay-per-view television that had produced such offbeat events as a tennis match between Jimmy Connors and Martina Navratilova‚Äîbecame WOW's partner in May 1993.[28] UFC promoters initially pitched the event as a real-life fighting video game tournament similar to Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat.[29] SEG contacted video and film art director Jason Cusson to design a fighting arena for the event. Rorion and Davie didn't want a traditional roped ring, citing fears‚Äîby showing old Vale Tudo footage‚Äîthat the fighters could escape through the ropes during grappling and use it as an advantage, or fall off and hurt themselves. SEG's executives agreed, and also wanted a way to visually differentiate their event from professional boxing and professional wrestling. Some ideas included a traditional roped-ring surrounded by netting, a moat with alligators, a raised platform surrounded by razor-wire fence, electrified fencing, men in togas and netting that could be lowered from the ceiling by a pulley. Eventually Cusson designed an arena with eight sides surrounded by chain-link fence, the trademarked Octagon, which became the event's signature setting.[30] Cusson remained the group's production designer through UFC 27.[25] SEG devised the show's name as \"The Ultimate Fighting Championship\".[31] WOW Promotions and SEG produced the first event, later retroactively called UFC 1, at McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado on November 12, 1993. Art Davie was its booker and matchmaker.[32] It proposed to find answers for sports fans' questions such as, \"Can a wrestler beat a boxer?\"[33] As with most martial arts at the time, fighters typically had skills in just one discipline and little experience against opponents with differing skills.[34] The television broadcast featured kickboxer Kevin Rosier, taekwondo practitioner Patrick Smith, savate fighter Gerard Gordeau, karate expert Zane Frazier, shootfighter Ken Shamrock, sumo wrestler Teila Tuli, boxer Art Jimmerson, and 175 lb (79 kg) Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt Royce Gracie‚Äîyounger brother of UFC co-founder Rorion, whom Rorion selected to represent his family. Royce's submission skills proved the most effective in the inaugural tournament, earning him the first ever UFC tournament championship after submitting Jimmerson, Shamrock, and Gordeau in succession.[35] The show was extremely successful, with 86,592 pay-per-view television subscribers.[24] It's disputed whether the promoters intended the event to be a precursor to future events. \"That show was only supposed to be a one-off\", eventual UFC president Dana White said. \"It did so well on pay-per-view they decided to do another, and another. Never in a million years did these guys think they were creating a sport.\"[36] Davie, in his 2014 book Is This Legal?, an account of the creation of the first UFC event, disputes the perception that the UFC was seen by WOW Promotions and SEG as a one-off, since SEG offered a five-year joint development deal to WOW. He says, \"Clearly, both Campbell and Meyrowitz shared my unwavering belief that War of the Worlds[b] would be a continuing series of fighting tournaments‚Äîa franchise, rather than a one-night stand.\"[37] With no weight classes, fighters often faced significantly larger or taller opponents. Keith \"The Giant Killer\" Hackney faced Emmanuel Yarbrough at UFC 3 with a 9-inch height and 400 pounds (180 kg) weight disadvantage.[38] During this early phase of the organization, the UFC showcased a bevy of styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned Royce Gracie, Ken Shamrock, and Patrick Smith, they also featured competitors such as Hall of Famer Dan Severn, Marco Ruas, Gary Goodridge, Don Frye, Kimo Leopoldo, Oleg Taktarov, and Tank Abbott. In April 1995, following UFC 5 in Charlotte, North Carolina, Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions.[39] Although UFC used the tagline \"There are no rules\" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules.[40] In a UFC 4 qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and Guy Mezger agreed not to pull hair‚Äîas they both wore pony tails tied back for the match.[41] The UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event.[42] UFC 5 also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called \"The Superfight\".[43] \"The Superfight\" began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face;[44] it later evolved into a match that could feature either title matches or non-title matches. The \"Superfight\" would eventually completely phase out tournament matches. On the other hand, the first \"Superfight\" at UFC 5 was also considered a failure. In the first minute of the fight Shamrock knocked Royce to the ground and landed inside his guard. For the next 30 minutes Shamrock was inside Royce's guard, with the two throwing punches and headbutts at each other but without any change or action, with the crowd booing the fighters. After 30 minutes the fight was stopped as it had exceeded the time limit allocated for the pay-per-view and was given another 5 minutes of extra time due to protests from the spectators. The fight was over after 36 minutes and a draw was declared.[45] Because of this controversial fight, the UFC would later start to introduce time limits, judges to decide draws, and authorized referees to stand up fighters and restart the bout if they have too much inactivity.[45] In 1996, the UFC had its first event outside continental United States with UFC 8 in Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico, and in 1997, UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan was its first foreign event. The violent nature of the burgeoning sport quickly drew the attention of U.S. authorities.[46] In 1996, U.S. Senator John McCain saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent. He led a campaign to ban the UFC, calling it \"human cockfighting\", and sent letters to the governors of all 50 US states asking them to ban it.[47] Thirty-six states enacted laws that banned \"no-holds-barred\" fighting, including New York, which enacted the ban on the eve of UFC 12, forcing it to relocate to Dothan, Alabama.[48] The UFC continued to air on DirecTV PPV, though its audience remained minuscule compared to the era's larger cable pay-per-view platforms. In response to the criticism, the UFC increased cooperation with state athletic commissions and modified its rules to remove the less palatable elements of fights while retaining the core elements of striking and grappling. UFC 12 saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of fish-hooking. For UFC 14, gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. UFC 15 saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes. With five-minute rounds introduced at UFC 21, the UFC gradually rebranded itself as a sport rather than a spectacle.[49] The implementation of rules changed the game of many fighters, for example Mark Coleman made potent use of headbutts for his ground-and-pound tactics, could not use them effectively anymore.[50] Led by UFC commissioner Jeff Blatnick and referee John McCarthy, the UFC continued to work with state athletic commissions.[51] Blatnick, McCarthy, and matchmaker Joe Silva created a manual of policies, procedures, codes of conduct, and rules to help in getting the UFC sanctioned by the athletic commissions, many of which exist to this day.[51] Blatnick and McCarthy traveled around the country, educating regulators and changing perceptions about a sport that was thought to be bloodthirsty and inhumane.[51] By April 2000, their movement had clearly made an impact.[51] California was set to become the first state in the U.S. to sign off on a set of codified rules that governed MMA.[51] Soon after, New Jersey adopted the language.[51] As the UFC continued to work with the athletic commissions, events took place in smaller U.S. markets, and venues, such as the Lake Charles Civic Center. The markets included states that are largely rural and less known for holding professional sporting events, such as Iowa, Mississippi, Louisiana, Wyoming, and Alabama. SEG could not secure home-video releases for UFC 23 through UFC 29. With other mixed martial arts promotions working towards U.S. sanctioning, the International Fighting Championships (IFC) secured the first U.S. sanctioned mixed martial arts event, which occurred in New Jersey on September 30, 2000. Just two months later, the UFC held its first sanctioned event, UFC 28, under the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board's \"Unified Rules\".[52] After the long battle to secure sanctioning, SEG stood on the brink of bankruptcy, when Station Casinos executives Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta and their business partner Dana White approached them in 2000, with an offer to purchase the UFC. A month later, in January 2001, the Fertittas bought the UFC for $2 million and created Zuffa, LLC as the parent entity controlling the UFC.[53] \"I had my attorneys tell me that I was crazy because I wasn't buying anything. I was paying $2 million and they were saying 'What are you getting?'\" Lorenzo Fertitta revealed to Fighters Only magazine,[54] recalling the lack of assets he acquired in the purchase. \"And I said 'What you don't understand is I'm getting the most valuable thing that I could possibly have, which is those three letters: UFC. That is what's going to make this thing work. Everybody knows that brand, whether they like it or they don't like it, they react to it.'\"[54] Along with the trademark, they acquired a wooden octagon and around a dozen fighter's contracts. Later on, they negotiated a deal to buy UFC's DVD rights from Lionsgate for an additional two million dollars.[53] With ties to the Nevada State Athletic Commission (Lorenzo Fertitta was a former member of the NSAC), Zuffa secured sanctioning in Nevada in 2001.[55] Shortly thereafter, the UFC returned to pay-per-view cable television, with UFC 33 featuring three championship bouts. The UFC slowly rose in popularity after the Zuffa purchase, due partly to greater advertising,[56] corporate sponsorship, the return to cable pay-per-view, and subsequent home video and DVD releases. White later said that \"Nobody took us seriously, except Donald Trump. Donald was the first to recognize the potential that we saw in the UFC, and encouraged us to build our business\".[57] With larger live gates at casino venues like the Trump Taj Mahal and the MGM Grand Garden Arena, the UFC secured its first television deal with Fox Sports Net. The Best Damn Sports Show Period aired the first mixed martial arts match on American cable television in June 2002, as well as the main event showcasing Chuck Liddell vs. Vitor Belfort at UFC 37.5.[58] Later, FSN would air highlight shows from the UFC. UFC 40 proved to be the most critical event to date in the Zuffa era. The event was a near sellout of 13,022 at the MGM Grand Arena and sold 150,000 pay-per-view buys, a rate roughly double that of the previous Zuffa events. The event featured a card headlined by a championship match between then-current UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz and former UFC Superfight Champion Ken Shamrock, who had previously left to professionally wrestle in WWE before returning to MMA. It was the first time the UFC hit such a high mark since being forced \"underground\" in 1997.[59] UFC 40 also garnered mainstream attention from media outlets such as ESPN and USA Today, something that was unfathomable for mixed martial arts at that point in time.[60] Many have suggested that the success of UFC 40 and the anticipation for Ortiz vs. Shamrock saved the UFC from bankruptcy; the buyrates of the previous Zuffa shows averaged a mere 45,000 buys per event, and the company was suffering deep monetary losses.[60] The success of UFC 40 provided a glimmer of hope for the UFC, and kept alive the hope that mixed martial arts could become big.[61] Beyond the rivalry itself, the success of UFC 40 was due in part to the marketing and outreach power of crossover athletes ‚Äì from Pro Wrestling to MMA and MMA to Pro Wrestling ‚Äì a practice with roots in Japan's Pride Fighting Championships.[62] Long time UFC referee John McCarthy said that he felt UFC 40 was the turning point in whether or not the sport of MMA would survive in America. \"When that show (UFC 40) happened, I honestly felt like it was going to make it. Throughout the years, things were happening, and everything always looked bleak. It always looked like, this is it, this is going to be the last time. This is going to be the last year. But, when I was standing in the Octagon at UFC 40, I remember standing there before the Ortiz/Shamrock fight and looking around. The energy of that fight, it was phenomenal, and it was the first time I honestly said, it's going to make it.\" ‚Äì\"Big\" John McCarthy[63] Despite the success of UFC 40, the UFC was still experiencing financial deficits. By 2004, Zuffa had $34 million in losses since they purchased the UFC.[64] Faced with the prospect of folding, the UFC stepped outside the bounds of pay-per-view and made a foray into television. After being featured in a reality television series, American Casino,[65] and seeing how well the series worked as a promotion vehicle, the Fertitta brothers developed the idea of UFC creating its own reality series. Their idea, The Ultimate Fighter (TUF), was a reality television show featuring up-and-coming MMA fighters in competition for a six-figure UFC contract, with fighters eliminated from competition via exhibition mixed martial arts matches. It was pitched to several networks, each one rejecting the idea outright. Not until they approached Spike TV, with an offer to pay the $10 million production costs themselves, did they find an outlet.[64] In January 2005, Spike TV launched The Ultimate Fighter 1 (TUF 1) in the timeslot following WWE Raw. The show became an instant success, culminating with a notable season finale brawl featuring light heavyweight finalists Forrest Griffin and Stephan Bonnar going toe-to-toe for the right to earn the six-figure contract. The live broadcast of the season finale drew a very impressive 1.9 overall rating. Dana White credits TUF 1 for saving the UFC, and claims that the contract for the second season was made outside of the venue on a napkin immediately after the finale.[66][67] On the heels of the Griffin/Bonnar finale, a second season of The Ultimate Fighter launched in August 2005, and two more seasons appeared in 2006. Spike and the UFC continued to create and air new seasons until the show moved to FX in 2012.[68] Following the success of The Ultimate Fighter, Spike also picked up UFC Unleashed, an hour-long weekly show featuring select fights from previous events. Spike also signed on to broadcast live UFC Fight Night, a series of fight events debuting in August 2005, and Countdown specials to promote upcoming UFC pay-per-view cards. After a very successful run on Spike and with the upcoming announcement of the UFC's new relationship with Fox, Spike officials made a statement regarding the end of their partnership with the UFC, \"The Ultimate Fighter season 14 in September will be our last... Our 6-year partnership with the UFC has been incredibly beneficial in building both our brands, and we wish them all the best in the future.\"[69] With the announcement of UFC's partnership with Fox in August 2011, The Ultimate Fighter, which entered its 14th season in that September, moved to the FX network to air on Friday nights starting with season 15 in the Spring of 2012. Along with the network change, episodes are now edited and broadcast within a week of recording instead of a several-month delay, and elimination fights are aired live.[70] With increased visibility, the UFC's pay-per-view buy numbers exploded. UFC 52, the first event after the first season of The Ultimate Fighter featuring eventual-UFC Hall of Famer: Chuck \"The Iceman\" Liddell, avenging his defeat to fellow eventual-Hall of Famer, Randy Couture, drew a pay-per-view audience of 300,000,[71] doubling its previous benchmark of 150,000 set at UFC 40. Following the second season of The Ultimate Fighter, the UFC's match between Liddell and Couture drew an estimated 410,000 pay-per-view buys at UFC 57. For the rest of 2006, pay-per-view buy rates continued to skyrocket, with 620,000 buys for UFC 60: Hughes vs. Gracie ‚Äîfeaturing Royce Gracie's first UFC fight in 11 years‚Äîand 775,000 buys for UFC 61 featuring the highly anticipated rematch between Ken Shamrock and Tito Ortiz, the coaches of The Ultimate Fighter 3.[72] The organization hit a milestone with UFC 66, pitting Ortiz in a rematch against Liddell with over 1 million buys.[73] The surge in popularity prompted the UFC to beef up its executive team. In March 2006, the UFC announced that it had hired Marc Ratner, former executive director of the Nevada Athletic Commission,[74] as Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. Ratner, once an ally of Senator McCain's campaign against no holds barred fighting, lobbied numerous athletic commissions[75] to help raise the UFC's media profile in an attempt to legalize mixed martial arts in jurisdictions inside and outside the United States that had yet to sanction the sport. In December 2006, Zuffa acquired the northern California-based promotion World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC) in order to stop the International Fight League (IFL) from making a deal with Versus (now NBC Sports Network). At the time, the UFC had an exclusive deal with Spike, so the purchase of the WEC allowed Zuffa to block the IFL from Versus without violating their contract.[76] The WEC showcased lighter weight classes in MMA, whereas the UFC featured heavier weight classes.[77] In December 2006, Zuffa also acquired their cross-town, Las Vegas rival World Fighting Alliance (WFA). The WFA had signed major fighters at the time, most notably Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson and Lyoto Machida, but their events turned out to be a financial disaster. Zuffa bought select assets from WFA, including select fighter contracts, as well as trademarks and other intellectual property.[78] The sport's popularity was also noticed by the sports betting community as BodogLife.com, an online gambling site, stated in July 2007 that in 2007 UFC would surpass boxing for the first time in terms of betting revenues.[79] In fact, the UFC had already broken the pay-per-view industry's all-time records for a single year of business, generating over $222,766,000 in revenue in 2006, surpassing both WWE and boxing.[80][81] The UFC continued its rapid rise from near obscurity with Roger Huerta gracing the cover of Sports Illustrated and Chuck Liddell on the front of ESPN The Magazine in May 2007.[82] In Japan, Mixed Martial Arts took a separate, yet convergent evolution, with origins in \"shoot wrestling\", a form of professional wrestling which had more realistic-looking moves and matches while deemphasizing theatrical elements. Promotions like Shooto and Pancrase discarded the scripts and were already putting on hybrid fighting shows with real fights by the time the UFC was founded.[84][85] This culminated in the creation of Pride Fighting Championships in 1997. At its height, Pride was the world's most popular MMA promotion, and helped to popularize the sport in Japan and in the world. Having high attendances on large sports arenas and watched by millions of spectators through free-to-air and pay-per-view television. Meanwhile, the UFC was struggling with political persecution, low pay-per-view sales, and doing events in backwater casinos.[83] Most of UFC's best fighters would leave to fight in Japan instead due better pay and prestige.[83] However, on 2006, Pride started to have financial issues due the termination of lucrative contracts with Japanese TV due a scandal revealing the strong ties between Pride and the yakuza.[83] On March 27, 2007, the UFC and Pride announced an agreement in which the majority owners of the UFC, Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, would purchase the Pride brand.[86][87] Initial intentions were for the organizations to be run separately but aligned together with plans to co-promote cards featuring the champions and top contenders from both organizations, making comparisons to the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger and the creation of a \"Super Bowl\" of MMA.[83] However, after purchasing Pride, Dana White felt that the Pride model was not sustainable[88] and that the brand became \"toxic\" in Japan, being difficult to find a new television deal.[83] The organization instead folded, with many former Pride fighters such as Ant√¥nio Rodrigo \"Minotauro\" Nogueira, Maur√≠cio \"Shogun\" Rua, Dan Henderson, Mirko \"Cro Cop\" Filipoviƒá, Wanderlei Silva, and others already being realigned under the UFC brand.[89] On October 4, 2007, Pride Worldwide closed its Japanese office, laying off 20 people who were working there since the closing of its parent company Dream Stage Entertainment (DSE).[90] On June 18, 2008, Lorenzo Fertitta accommodated the UFC's growth by announcing his resignation from Station Casinos in order to devote his energies to the international business development of Zuffa, particularly the UFC. The move proved to be pivotal, as Fertitta helped strike TV deals in China, France, Mexico, and Germany as well as open alternative revenue streams with a new UFC video game and UFC action figures, among other projects.[91] Popularity surged in 2009 with UFC 100 and the 10 events preceding it including UFC 90, 91, 92, 94, and 98. UFC 100 was a success, garnering 1.6 million buys[92] under the drawing power of former NCAA wrestling and WWE Champion Brock Lesnar and his rematch with former UFC Heavyweight Champion Frank Mir, Canadian Georges St-Pierre going head-to-head with Brazilian[93] Thiago Alves, and American Dan Henderson opposing British Michael Bisping at middleweight after the two were rival coaches on The Ultimate Fighter: United States vs. United Kingdom. UFC 100 drew interest from ESPN, which provided coverage of the event in the days preceding and following it.[94] ESPN would eventually devote additional coverage of the UFC and other MMA news with the television debut of MMA Live on ESPN2 in May 2010.[95] The buzz from UFC 100 was hampered significantly in the second half of 2009 after a rash of injuries and other health-related issues[96][97]‚Äîincluding Brock Lesnar's life-threatening bout with diverticulitis[98]‚Äîforcing the organization to continuously scramble and reshuffle its lineup for several events. However, the momentum gradually began to pick up in the first quarter of 2010 after victories from defending champions Georges St-Pierre and Anderson Silva, as well as Lyoto Machida's first career defeat to \"Shogun\" Rua for the UFC Light Heavyweight title. These fights segued into a very popular clash between former UFC Champions and rivals Rashad Evans and Quinton Jackson‚Äîrival coaches on The Ultimate Fighter 10: Heavyweights‚Äîat UFC 114, featuring the UFC's first main event headlined by black fighters.[99] The event scored over 1 million pay per view buys[100] as Evans secured a unanimous decision victory. This momentum carried into the summer of 2010 at UFC 116, which featured the return of Brock Lesnar defending his UFC Heavyweight title against the undefeated interim-champion Shane Carwin before 1.25 million PPV viewers.[101] Lesnar survived an early barrage of Carwin's punches in a contest that was nearly stopped by referee Josh Rosenthal.[102] However, Lesnar recovered in the second round to submit Carwin via arm-triangle choke to retain the undisputed UFC Heavyweight Championship. The event as a whole was critically acclaimed in the media[103][104][105] for living up to the hype with a number of exciting fights. After a fifth round, last-minute victory by UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva over Chael Sonnen at UFC 117, Lesnar finally surrendered his belt to the undefeated Cain Velasquez via 1st-round TKO at UFC 121. The fight produced Velasquez's eighth knockout or technical knockout in his first nine MMA fights.[106] UFC 129 featured Georges St-Pierre vs. Jake Shields at the Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and is currently the largest UFC event in North American history,[107][108] which coincided with a two-day UFC Fan Expo at the Direct Energy Centre.[109][110] The event sold out 55,000 tickets for gate revenues exceeding $11 million,[111] shattering previous MMA attendance and gate records in North America.[111] On November 5, 2016, the UFC had their first exhibition in New York City after years of being delayed by government officials and red tape with a dramatic first match, Conor McGregor vs. Eddie Alvarez.[112] Zuffa, the parent company of the UFC, purchased World Extreme Cagefighting in late 2006 and held the first WEC event under new ownership on January 20, 2007.[113] Soon thereafter the WEC made its home on the Versus Network with its first event debuting on that network in June 2007.[114] On October 28, 2010, Zuffa announced that WEC would merge with the UFC. The WEC held its final card on December 16, 2010. As a result of the merger, the UFC absorbed WEC's bantamweight, featherweight and lightweight weight divisions and their respective fighters. The UFC also made the last WEC Featherweight and Bantamweight Champions, Jos√© Aldo and Dominick Cruz respectively, the inaugural UFC Champions of their new weight divisions.[115] Reed Harris, who started World Extreme Cagefighting with Scott Adams, had mixed emotions on the merger. \"It's kind of like when your kid goes off to college: at first you're not happy, but after you think about it for a while, you're really happy,\" Harris said following the announcement. \"At the end of the day, I never imagined this thing would be where we're at today. I'm extremely proud and happy that I was involved with something that will now be part of what may be, some day, the largest sports organization in the world.\"[116] On March 12, 2011, Dana White announced that Zuffa had purchased Strikeforce.[117] White said that Strikeforce will operate as an independent promotion, and that CEO Scott Coker will continue to run the promotion. Coker announced the return of Fedor Emelianenko on an unspecified July or August event and said that Zuffa-owned company would continue to co-promote with M-1 Global.[118] After an extension was reached to continue Strikeforce through 2012, the promotion's heavyweight division (sans Heavyweight Grand Prix finalists) was merged into the UFC, and the promotion's Challengers series was ended. The final Strikeforce show was Strikeforce: Marquardt vs. Saffiedine on January 12, 2013, after which the promotion was dissolved and all fighter contracts were either ended or absorbed into the UFC. On August 18, 2011, The Ultimate Fighting Championship and Fox announced a seven-year broadcast deal through the Fox Sports subsidiary, effectively ending the UFC's Spike TV and Versus (now NBC Sports Network) partnership. The deal includes four events on the main Fox network, 32 live Friday night fights per year on their cable network FX, 24 events following The Ultimate Fighter reality show and six separate Fight Night events. The promotion's first broadcast television event ‚Äì UFC on Fox: Velasquez vs. dos Santos ‚Äì broke form by showcasing only one fight to television viewers. In the main event, Junior dos Santos abruptly dethroned then-undefeated UFC heavyweight champion Cain Velasquez by knock-out at 1:04 in the first round. The telecast peaked with 8.8 million viewers tuning into the fight with an average audience of 5.7 million, making it by far the most-watched MMA event of all-time and the most-watched combat sports event since 2003's HBO bout between Lennox Lewis and Vitali Klitschko.[133] One of the other programming opportunities that emerged was a weekly UFC magazine-style show. When asked about potential for a weekly magazine-style series, UFC CEO Lorenzo Fertitta responded, \"Not only weekly, but potentially, multiple times per week you'll have a UFC magazine (show).\"[134] The UFC maintained production control of its product including use of its broadcast team, Mike Goldberg and Joe Rogan. Fox Sports produced pre- and post-shows. On November 16, 2012, the eve of UFC 154: St. Pierre vs. Condit, Dana White confirmed the UFC would feature women's MMA with the signing of its first female fighter, Strikeforce bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey.[135] She subsequently became the first female UFC champion, the first Olympic medalist with a UFC title, and the first woman to defend a UFC title. She would successfully defend her title six times. On December 11, 2013, the UFC purchased the contracts of 11 female fighters from Invicta Fighting Championships to launch their 115-pound Strawweight division. Eight of the Invicta fighters took part in the 20th season of The Ultimate Fighter, The Ultimate Fighter: Team Pettis vs. Team Melendez, along with eight additional fighters signed up for the tournament via open tryouts.[136] Season winner, Invicta FC's Strawweight Champion, Carla Esparza became the first UFC women's strawweight champion, defeating Rose Namajunas in the finale. Other fighters on the show included Felice Herrig, Tecia Torres, Joanne Calderwood, Bec Hyatt, Randa Markos, Jessica Penne, and Joanna Jƒôdrzejczyk.[137] The first UFC event to be held outside the contiguous United States was UFC 8 in Puerto Rico, a US territory, in 1996. Canada has hosted events 18 times, starting with UFC 83 in 2008 and most recently in 2024 with UFC 297.[138] UFC's second biggest event to date was also in Canada, as UFC 129 held at Rogers Centre featured a record-breaking attendance of 55,724.[139] The United Kingdom has been home to 18 events. The first was UFC 38 held in London in 2002. UFC returned to the United Kingdom in 2007 with UFC 70, and visited Northern Ireland for UFC 72. The UK's most recent event was in Manchester, England with UFC 304 in 2024. Ireland has held UFC 93 in 2009 and UFC Fight Night: McGregor vs. Brandao 5 years later.[140] In continental Europe, Germany has hosted 6 times, the first being UFC 99 in 2009, UFC 122 in 2010, UFC Fight Night: Munoz vs. Mousasi in 2014, UFC Fight Night: Jƒôdrzejczyk vs. Penne in 2015, UFC Fight Night: Arlovski vs. Barnett in 2016,[141] and most recently, UFC Fight Night: Shogun vs. Smith in 2018. Sweden has hosted 3 times, starting with UFC on Fuel TV: Gustafsson vs. Silva in 2012, and recently with UFC on Fox: Gustafsson vs. Johnson in 2015.[142][143] Poland had its first event with UFC Fight Night: Gonzaga vs. Cro Cop 2 in 2015.[144] The first Brazilian event was UFC Brazil: Ultimate Brazil, held in S√£o Paulo in 1998. The promotion did not return to Brazil until 2011 for UFC 134, but since then, the country has hosted a further 20 events. Their most recent visit was UFC Fight Night: Condit vs. Alves.[145][146] In 2014, Mexico became the second country in Latin America to host an event with UFC 180,[147] followed by a second event, UFC 188, in 2015.[148] Seven UFC events have been held in Australia, beginning with UFC 110 in 2010 and most recently in December 2018 with UFC Fight Night 142.[149] New Zealand held its first event in 2014, UFC Fight Night: Te Huna vs. Marquardt.[150] Its most recent event was UFC Fight Night: Felder vs. Hooker in February 2020. In Asia, the UFC has visited 5 countries. Japan had its first visit in 1997 for UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan. The UFC only returned to the country in 2012, with UFC 144. Their last visit was in 2014 for UFC Fight Night: Hunt vs. Nelson, the seventh event there.[151] The promotion has also featured 3 visits to the United Arab Emirates. The first was in 2010 for UFC 112 the second in 2014 for UFC Fight Night: Nogueira vs. Nelson[152] and the third in 2024 for UFC on ABC: Sandhagen vs. Nurmagomedov.[153] The promotion has also visited Macau in 3 occasions: China's special administrative region was first visited in 2012 with UFC on Fuel TV: Franklin vs. Le and last visited in 2014 for UFC Fight Night: Bisping vs. Le.[154] The promotion has also visited Singapore with UFC Fight Night: Saffiedine vs. Lim in 2014.[155] The Philippines was the most recent Asian country that the UFC has visited, with UFC Fight Night: Edgar vs. Faber in 2015.[156] The Ultimate Fighter has had international editions as well: Brazil (since 2012), Australia (vs. United Kingdom ‚Äì 2012), China (2013), Canada (vs. Australia ‚Äì 2014), and Latin America (2014). On February 27, 2014, the Nevada State Athletic Commission banned the use of Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT). The UFC followed suit and banned the use of TRT for any of their events, including international markets where the UFC oversees regulatory efforts.[157] In December 2014, an antitrust lawsuit was filed against Zuffa by several fighters, claiming the organization restricts control over fighters' careers and earning potential.[158] The case moved to Nevada federal court, where Zuffa was denied its motion to stay discovery for 15 years of its financial records.[159][160] This caused an ongoing debate and struggle over how UFC sensitive information should be handled, and who may view it. Especially concerning MMAFA founder, Rob Maysey who has taken the lead in representing the former athletes and has stated he hopes to achieve reforms similar to the Ali Act (2000).[161] Later that year, a 12‚Äì16 month investigation began that was expected to last until sometime between September 2016 to January 2017.[162] Thus far, both sides have provided over 100,000 documents.[163] It is estimated that the UFC shares between 16% and 22% of its revenue with fighters, which is vastly lower than sports leagues such as the NBA, MLB, and NHL, which share approximately half of the revenue with their athletes.[164] There have been several ongoing lawsuits over the contractual treatment of UFC fighters. One of the most recent cases was filed in 2020 by a group of fighters led by Cung Le and Nate Quarry. They alleged that the UFC violated antitrust laws by engaging in anti-competitive practices that kept fighter pay artificially low. The plaintiffs argued that the UFC's practice of using long-term exclusive contracts and \"champion's clauses\" (which extend a fighter's contract automatically if they win a title) was intended to suppress fighter pay and prevent them from negotiating with other promotions. They also claimed that the UFC engaged in various other anti-competitive practices, such as blocking fighters from using their own image and likeness rights and taking a significant portion of revenue from merchandise sales. The case was initially dismissed by a judge in 2020, but the fighters appealed the decision and in 2021 the appeals court revived the lawsuit and sent it back to the lower court for further proceedings. On October 1, 2023, Zuffa's appeal to the Ninth Circuit court in its antitrust lawsuit has been denied.[165][166] On August 9, 2023, U.S. District Judge Richard Boulware granted class action status to more than 1,200 former UFC fighters who competed between December 2010 and June 2017 and are suing for $800 million upward to $1.6 billion in wages, as the lawsuit claims Zuffa had abused its power to suppress UFC fighters' wages. The anti-trust law also permits private plaintiffs to be able to recover three times the damages suffered, meaning the UFC may ultimately pay several billions of dollars worth of damages.[167] The case has a scheduled April 8, 2024 trial date.[168][169] On March 20, 2024, TKO, UFC parent company reached an agreement to settle all claims in the class action lawsuits for $335 million where the settlement amount will be deductible for tax purposes.[170] However, on July 31, 2024, Judge Richard Boulware ruled that the case would be heard by a jury and denied the preliminary approval for a settlement and reset a tentative date for trial of October 28.[171][172] Other lawsuits have also been filed against the UFC, including one by former fighter Leslie Smith, who claimed that the UFC violated federal labor laws by classifying fighters as independent contractors instead of employees. The case was dismissed in 2019, but Smith has appealed the decision.[173][174] In May 2016, ESPN originally reported that the UFC's parent company Zuffa, LLC was in talks to sell the company for $3.5 billion to $4 billion. In 2015, the UFC had a reported EBITDA of $200‚Äì250 million. No official comment was made from the UFC or Dana White regarding the sale. Companies initially interested in the sale were Dalian Wanda Group, China Media Capital, and WME‚ÄìIMG (Endeavor).[175] On July 9, 2016, it was officially announced that the UFC would be sold to a group led by WME‚ÄìIMG, its owner Silver Lake Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and MSD Capital, for $4.025 billion. At the time, it marked the largest-ever acquisition in sports. Flash Entertainment (owned by the government of Abu Dhabi) retained its 10% minority stake in the company. White, who owned 9% of the UFC, stayed, having been given a stake in the new business.[176][177] White remained president. Fertitta stepped down as chairman and CEO.[178] WME‚ÄìIMG was renamed Endeavor in September 2017.[179][7][6] Three years into the Endeavor era, White revealed that an undisclosed company bid $5 billion but Fertittas chose WME‚ÄìIMG due to a connection they already made with its CEO Ari Emanuel.[180] In October 2016, MMAJunkie obtained a UFC financial report released by Endeavor, detailing that the promotion had reached a year-to-year high of $609 million in revenue during 2015. 76% of the total was credited to \"content\" revenue, covering media rights, PPV buys and UFC Fight Pass subscriptions; in turn, 42% of content revenue was credited to pay-per-view buys, followed by U.S. and international media rights.[21] In May 2018, UFC reached new U.S. media rights deals with Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International and ESPN Inc., succeeding those with 21st Century Fox, which began in January 2019. The five-year contracts are cumulatively valued at $300 million per-year for digital and linear rights, roughly doubling the amount paid by Fox in the final year of its previous contract, and include 42 events on ESPN platforms per-year. ESPN linear networks will televise preliminary cards for UFC PPV events, and 10 UFC on ESPN Fight Night events per-year. The subscription streaming service ESPN+ will broadcast 20 exclusive events per-year under the branding UFC on ESPN+ Fight Night; regardless of network, all Fight Night events will feature a full, 12-fight card, and their preliminaries will air exclusively on ESPN+. The ESPN+ service will also hold on-demand rights to UFC library and archive content, new seasons of Dana White's Contender Series, and other new original content. UFC Fight Pass will be purchasable as an add-on for ESPN+ to stream pay-per-view events.[181][182][183][184][185] On March 18, 2019, it was announced that ESPN had reached a two-year extension of the contract. In addition, it was announced that in the United States, future UFC PPVs will only be sold through ESPN+ to its subscribers, and will no longer be sold via traditional television providers beginning with UFC 236. At the same time, the standard price for UFC PPVs was lowered to $59.99 (from $64.99), and new subscribers will be able to purchase a bundle of UFC PPV for a year of ESPN+ too.[186] On July 18, 2018, it was announced that UFC had entered into a partnership with Russian MMA promoter M-1 Global. M-1 Global will serve as a farm league to scout Russian fighters for UFC and will participate in organizing UFC events in Russia. The deal also gave M-1 champions the opportunity to sign with UFC.[187][188] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UFC went on with its March 13, 2020 event, UFC Fight Night: Lee vs. Oliveira in Bras√≠lia, Brazil, behind closed doors.[189] On March 16, the organization announced that the next three events, UFC Fight Night: Woodley vs. Edwards, UFC on ESPN: Ngannou vs. Rozenstruik, and UFC Fight Night: Overeem vs. Harris, would be postponed to future dates.[190] In regards to its next pay-per-view, UFC 249 on April 18, UFC president Dana White stated that the event would likely go on, but at a new venue behind closed doors. It was originally to be held at Barclays Center, but a stay-at-home order was issued by the New York state government.[190] On March 18, the New York State Athletic Commission also withdrew its sanctioning for the event.[191] Due to international travel restrictions and other withdrawals, a revised card for UFC 249 was unveiled on April 6 with a location still TBD.[192][193] The next day, White disclosed that he had booked an unspecified venue for two months, in order to host both UFC 249 and other future events involving U.S. fighters. He also disclosed plans to secure a private island, known as \"Fight Island\", to host events with international fighters.[194] The new UFC 249 venue was subsequently revealed to be Tachi Palace‚Äîa tribal casino in Lemoore, California; as it is on tribal land, it also fell outside of the jurisdiction of the California State Athletic Commission, meaning that events held there could be self-sanctioned.[195] On April 9, the UFC announced that UFC 249 had been cancelled, and all other UFC events would be suspended until further notice. White cited interventions from high-ranking staff of the UFC's U.S. media rightsholders, ESPN Inc. and parent The Walt Disney Company, as well as Governor Newsom.[196][197] The New York Post reported that Governor of California Gavin Newsom had contacted Disney chairman and former CEO Bob Iger, urging ESPN and the UFC to not hold the event.[198] Following the decree that professional sports were deemed as \"essential services\" in Florida, UFC 249 took place on May 9, 2020, at VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, Florida with no fans in attendance. Precautionary health and safety measures proposed by the UFC satisfied the Florida State Boxing Commission, which regulates MMA in the state. UFC Fight Night: Smith vs. Teixeira and UFC on ESPN: Overeem vs. Harris were scheduled to take place at the same venue on May 13 and 16, respectively.[199] On Friday, May 8, the UFC announced middleweight fighter Ronaldo Souza was removed from his bout with Uriah Hall at UFC 249 and quarantined after he tested positive for COVID-19, along with his cornermen, despite following the protocols enforced by the UFC. No other athletes or staff tested positive for the disease.[200] In April 2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the UFC held its UFC 261 event, again at the VyStar Arena in Jacksonville, but with a 100-% sold-out capacity, where attendees were not required to wear masks.[201][202][203] Public health experts criticized the event, citing the risks to attendees, as well as to the wider community.[204] In March 2021, there was strong pressure on the UFC to use new fighter gloves after a severe eye poke ended the final bout at UFC Fight Night: Edwards vs. Muhammad.[205][206] The official UFC gloves are constructed in a way that leaves the fighters fingers extended forward, whereas there are alternative gloves, which the UFC has not used, which are curved at the knuckle and keep a fighter's fingers tucked down.[205] Fighters, trainers and commentators called for new gloves, citing the harms posed to fighters from the standard UFC gloves.[205] On April 29, 2021, Endeavor successfully launched an initial public offering (IPO) and became a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[207] Endeavor subsequently used some of the proceeds from the IPO to buy out Zuffa's other shareholders at a value of $1.7 billion, making Zuffa a wholly-owned subsidiary of Endeavor.[8] On November 5, 2022, controversy arose when the call for a sports betting fraud investigation was made on a fight involving Darrick Minner a student of James Krause, who is a UFC coach and avid bettor, and Shayilan Nuerdanbieke at UFC Fight Night: Rodriguez vs. Lemos. The UFC was informed by sources that suspicious betting patterns had been observed on the fight.[208] Minner became a large betting underdog just hours before the fight, and the cause of the suspicion came when Minner threw a kick with an apparently injured leg, then kicked with it again after showing signs of injury before being finished by technical knockout shortly thereafter. On November 6, the UFC released a statement that its official betting partner would look into the matter, but that none of the fighters, coaches, or officials related to the fight were suspected of any wrongdoing.[209] On November 18, the Nevada State Athletic Commission informed the UFC and Krause that Krause's license was suspended and would remain so during the course of the investigation. The UFC then announced that any fighter who chose to continue to be coached by Krause or who continued to train in his gym, would not be permitted to participate in UFC events pending the outcome of the aforementioned government investigations.[210] Following the controversy, UFC introduced rules that banned athletes, coaches, and their close family from betting on UFC events.[211] On September 12, 2023, Endeavor merged with professional wrestling promotion WWE to form a new publicly traded company under the stock symbol \"TKO\", which will be overseen by Endeavor's CEO Ari Emanuel. WWE's shareholders will hold a 49% stake in the new company, with Vince McMahon had served as an executive chairman who resigned on January 26, 2024, after Janel Grant, a former WWE employee, filed a lawsuit against McMahon for sex trafficking and sexual assault;[212] the merger agreement valued UFC at $12.1 billion. White serves as the CEO for UFC, though his role remains the same as during the Endeavor period.[5] On April 2, 2024, it was announced by TKO that Endeavor was privately taken 100% by its largest investor, Silver Lake, three years after Endeavor three-year run as a public company where Endeavor purchased the UFC for just over $4 billion in 2016.[213][214] On October 23, 2024, TKO Group Holdings acquired the event planning and hospitality service On Location as well as IMG (a sports and media agency, producer and distributor previously housed at Endeavor) from Endeavor in $3.25 billion deal Under the terms of the deal, Endeavor \"will receive approximately 26.14 million common\" shares of TKO stock and \"will subscribe for an equal number of shares of TKO's Class B common stock.\"Once the deal closes, Endeavor will own 59-percent of TKO with remaining shareholders controlling the other 41-percent of TKO stock.[215] The UFC Apex is a live events and production facility. The facility was officially opened on June 18, 2019.[216] In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, several UFC events (including UFC 250) were held at Apex behind closed doors.[217][218][219] The Octagon at the Apex is notable for being smaller than the Octagon used at all other UFC events, with 25-foot width rather than the usual 30-feet.[220] The UFC Performance Institute is the official mixed martial arts school for UFC.[221] The building is located in Las Vegas, Nevada opposite the UFC Apex.[222][223] The institute was opened in 2017, and is the world's first mixed martial arts center for innovation, research and training.[224][225][226] As many as 400 MMA athletes have visited the center, as well as NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB athletes.[227] In June 2019, a second facility was opened in Shanghai, China.[228] In 2021, UFC was named the official \"high performance advisor\" of the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC), under which the Performance Institute in Shanghai would be designated as an official high performance training facility of the COC, and would offer access to its resources for Chinese athletes training to compete in the Olympic Games.[229] In February 2024, the third Performance Institute was opened in Mexico City, Mexico.[230] During the early years of mixed martial arts, when Pride Fighting Championships along with the Ultimate Fighting Championship were early premierships of the sport, it has been documented that there was a noteworthy lack of rules and regulations regarding drug testing for performance-enhancing drugs.[231][232][233] This led to a widespread debate and discussion regarding how prevalent the use of steroids were in the sport, as well as a long list of competitors in the UFC and other major organizations facing failed drug tests.[234] This was further highlighted by continued problems with UFC champions, including Jon Jones and Anderson Silva, failing drug tests.[235][236] So in February 2015, UFC announced a more aggressive year round, random-testing approach for its competitors to begin in July 2015.[237][238][239] UFC announced a partnership with United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) on June 3, 2015, as the UFC's official, independent anti-doping agency. The UFC USADA testing program became effective on July 1, 2015, and includes a minimum of 2,750 drug tests per year with an average of five tests per fighter, and punishments for fighters who fail the tests.[240] Under the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, fighters are subject to random tests at any time and place on all in- and out-of-competition blood and urine samples collected by USADA. Fighters must participate in the testing pool for at least six months prior to a fight in order to qualify for a UFC event.[240] In February 2017, UFC made changes to the anti-doping policy, effective April 1, 2017, as follows: (1) Fighters who are new to the UFC with no previous contract would be subject to a one-month testing rule. The same rule applies to returning fighters who were terminated or whose contracts were not renewed at the decision of the UFC. Previously, returning or terminated fighters were required to undergo four months of testings prior to competing in a fight. (2) Returning fighters who have chosen to retire, go on hiatus, or had a non-renewal of their contract, are required to be in a six-month testing pool prior to competition. (3) No doping violation is handed down to newly signed UFC fighters who voluntarily disclose the use of a prohibited substance prior to testing. (4) \"In-competition\" testing begins at noon on the weigh-in day and ends one hour after a fighter clears a post-fight medical for non-selected post-fight testing. For fighters who are subjected to post-fight testing the in-competition testing ends after any post-fight testing is done.[241][242][243] In September 2018, it was indicated no announcements would be made on fighters who have been flagged for a potential doping violation until the entire adjudication processes are conducted with the results of the potential doping violation.[244][245] This came after several cases of fighters, such as Anderson Silva, Junior dos Santos, Josh Barnett and Cris Cyborg, being flagged for potential doping violations, but cleared after they were proved of unintentional use of performance enhancing drugs (usually in the form of contaminated supplements).[246] On November 25, 2019, news surfaced that the UFC and USADA had revised their policies, providing a list of certified supplements that will not lead to sanctions should contaminated samples occur.[247] In January 2021, USADA announced that marijuana would no longer be included in the list of banned substances and they would not penalize any fighter for testing positive for it either before, during, or after a fight. The only exception would be if a fighter was visibly impaired on fight night.[248] Fighters are subject to be suspended up to four years depending on the banned substance used. The common banned substances detected by USADA from suspended fighters are 7-keto-DHEA for weight loss, Anastrozole for estrogen blocker, Clenbuterol for thinning blood to increase oxygen, EPO for stimulating the production of red blood cells which would increase oxygen to muscles, Higenamine for increase heart contraction and speeding up heart rate, Tamoxifen for estrogen blocker, Furosemide, Hydrochlorothiazide for diuretic agent to mask potential doping evidence, Meldonium for stimulating the production of red blood cells which would increase oxygen to muscles, Cocaine, Fentanyl for substances of abuse, Boldenone, Turinabol- (steroid for horses), Drostanolone, hGH, Ibutamoren, Ipamorelin, LGD-4033, Metandienone, Ostarine, Stanozolol, Trenbolone for increased muscle mass and strength, Androstenedione, Androsta, Clomiphene, Dehydrochloromethyltestosterone, and Testosterone for increased testosterone.[249] In 2015, USADA conducted 353 tests and 2291 tests in 2016 on 586 UFC fighters with Anderson Silva tested the most of a total of 15 times.[250] In 2017 and 2018 a total of 2818 and 2888 tests were conducted by USADA respectively.[251] As of May 16, 2019, a total of 76 UFC fighters had been sanctioned by USADA since the UFC USADA testing program started.[252] On October 11, 2023, USADA announced that its partnership with the UFC would end on January 1, 2024.[253] With the UFC's partnership with USADA coming to an end in 2023, the UFC announced a new partnership with Drug Free Sport International, the same company that oversees the anti-doping programs of the NCAA, MLB, NFL, and NBA. The administration of the UFC Anti-Doping Program, including sanctioning decisions, will be handled exclusively and independently by Combat Sports Anti-Doping (CSAD), where the former FBI agent George Piro would serve as the independent administrator of the UFC's anti-doping program.[254] This partnership is set to begin in 2024, after their current contract with USADA expires on December 31, 2023. The UFC announced that former FBI agent George Piro would serve as the independent administrator of the UFC's anti-doping program.[254] UFC has been one of the largest and most aggressive spenders among anti-piracy political lobbyists in the United States since the end of the 2000s.[255] One thing in particular that sets them apart from other sports leagues is that, in addition to supporting efforts of stricter piracy laws, they have also on numerous occasions gone after selected individuals in addition to pirate hosting websites.[256][257] Some of the most notable cases have included, a well publicized lawsuit with Justin.tv in 2011[258][259][260] and a $32 million settlement involving a New York man in 2014.[261][262] UFC has always maintained the stance that the large amounts of illegal streams of their events causes massive financial losses.[263] In response to having such a stringent stance it has been extremely controversial and has caused a number of debates within the mixed martial arts community on its effectiveness.[264] As a result, the UFC began experimenting on an online subscription model known as UFC Fight Pass in 2014. It is unclear how beneficial the service has been since its emphasis has been largely minimal next to UFC's partnership with Fox and noticeable decline in average PPV buyrates, highlighted by the S&P downgrading Zuffa's credit rating in late 2014.[265] On May 9, 2011, it was announced that UFC would be providing year-round customized insurance coverage for any injury suffered by their or Strikeforce athlete.[266][267][268][269][270][271][272] The policy covers any injuries that occur during competition, training, and non-training related accidents. The policy was underwritten by Houston-based specialty insurance group HCC Insurance Holdings and went into effect on June 1, 2011.[272] The details of the policy include: An insurance policy is not a first for mixed martial arts or combat sports as a whole. Former promotions such as the International Fight League, offered insurance to its athletes. However Zuffa's policy is the first to cover a large group of combat sport athletes.[270] According to UFC president Dana White, the policy was a goal of the company since Zuffa first purchased the UFC in 2001. In addition UFC chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Fertitta stated that the policy took three years to establish while trying to find possible insurers.[266] Prior to the introduction of this policy, Zuffa provided up to $100,000 for an athlete on each event to cover injuries sustained during competition. However, if an athlete was injured outside of competition they would have to pay for their own medical expenses.[272] Notable incidents where UFC athletes were injured outside of competition include, The current rules used in the UFC were first established by the New Jersey Athletic Control Board in 2000, in consultation with the UFC and other MMA promotions in the United States.[273] The first UFC event under the new rules was UFC 28, held before Zuffa's takeover. New Jersey's Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts has since been established throughout the country by other state athletic commissions, including Nevada and California.[273] The UFC has, however, kept close ties with state commissions, especially the Nevada State Athletic Commission, of which Lorenzo Fertitta is a former board member.[274] On December 16, 2014, a class action lawsuit was filed against UFC by fighters Cung Le, Jon Fitch and Nate Quarry.[275][276] Within a few days, Javier Vazquez and Dennis Hallman filed a second class action.[277] And on December 24, Brandon Vera and Pablo Garza filed a third lawsuit.[278] Shortly after the initial news spreading, UFC quickly responded following the first class action with the statement that, \"The UFC will vigorously defend itself and its business practices.\"[279] This soon led other promoters such as Scott Coker, President of Bellator MMA, expressing an interest in the outcome of the lawsuit, while rejecting his organization as being labeled a \"minor league\" as was done several times in the initial filing.[280] By the end of December 2014, the UFC made a formal statement stating, \"We are proud of the company we have built, confident in our legal position, and intend to prevail in this lawsuit.\"[281] On February 7, 2015, a fourth lawsuit was filed against the UFC, this one by Mac Danzig and Gabe Ruediger.[282][283] It was around this time that UFC motioned to move the hearing date from May 7 to March 26, as well as to move the venue from Northern California to Las Vegas, where they are headquartered.[284] A few weeks later, UFC motioned to have the lawsuits dismissed, in four separate documents they claim, \"The Complaints' vague and conclusory allegations fall far short of the Supreme Court's requirements in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, for pleading specific facts showing a plausible antitrust claim.\"[285] Shortly thereafter, a fifth lawsuit was added by Kyle Kingsbury and Darren Uyenoyama on March 20, 2015.[286] On April 12, the plaintiff athletes filed an opposition to February's motion to dismiss and transfer.[287] Following the May 7 hearing regarding the motion to change venue, a Californian federal judge granted UFC the motion to change venue to Las Vegas after citing contract agreements from the former employees.[288] As a result of the change of venue to Nevada, UFC was denied its motion to remain a discovery for 15 years of its financial records.[289][290] This would prompt a debate, especially by MMAFA founder Rob Maysey, on who should have access to the UFC's sensitive information and how that information should be viewed.[291] Both sides have argued for different criteria, so as not to put them at an disadvantage. However, UFC has requested a two-tiered system of confidentiality: confidential and highly confidential. They have stated they feel that Maysey's access to highly confidential information could have an influential impact on him and his role in the MMAFA. Meanwhile, Maysey has openly stated his goal is to represent the fighters and ultimately try to get a reform similar to the Ali Act of 2000.[292] Moving forward to September 25, 2015, due to the gradual nature and complications regarding the lawsuit; UFC requested another dismissal of the case and asked that it be thrown out of Las Vegas federal court. In a surprise bench ruling, this was ultimately denied, which promoted the UFC to release a formal response.[293][294][295] The following week, magistrate judge Peggy Leen ruled that the UFC could not prevent plaintiffs attorney Rob Maysey from viewing its most highly confidential and sensitive business and financial information. This has officially caused an expert discovery that is estimated to last from 12 to 16 months (September 2016 to January 2017).[296] In doing so, both parties will have to hand over various highly confidential and sensitive documents. The goal of the expert discovery is to determine three key factors for antitrust liability to all hold true: (1) Does the UFC have monopoly power? (2) Did the UFC acquire or maintain such power through exclusionary conduct? (3) Did the UFC cause antitrust injury since having a monopoly is not always illegal in the United States? This is expected to involve a wide range of important figures (past and present) in both mixed martial arts and boxing, including most top ranked UFC staff, Scott Coker, Bjorn Rebney, Ray Sefo, Frank Shamrock, Fedor Emelianenko, Randy Couture, Ben Askren, Mark Cuban, Oscar De La Hoya, Bob Arum, Lou DiBella, Bob Meyrowitz, Ken Hershman and even various PRIDE FC executives. Following this ruling through the end of 2015, both sides have provided well over 100,000 documents.[297] Starting in January, the UFC defense team filed its official answer, denying the fighters' antitrust claims. In an amended complaint, which contained nearly identical legal and economic substance to the original version from December 2014. The only major difference being the number of plaintiff fighters has declined from eleven to six.[298] Pablo Garza, Gabe Ruediger, Darren Uyenoyama, Dennis Hallman, and Mac Danzig all dropped out of the lawsuit while the original three plaintiffs, Cung Le, Nate Quarry, and Jon Fitch, remain along with Brandon Vera, Javier Vazquez, and Kyle Kingsbury. In addition, UFC has stood by its point of protecting its brand. Additionally, the UFC inadvertently produced PRIDE FC acquisition materials.[299] Following this in October, UFC made a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, which was ultimately denied. By this point of the lawsuit, there was considerably less notable coverage of the case. Aside from the occasional legal filings, the first of which being in February 2018 in which the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification which faced opposition from UFC. Furthered in September, when the plaintiffs filed their opposition to UFC's motion for summary judgment.[300] Before finally on December 5, 2018, when the plaintiffs held an informational session to cover the status of the lawsuit in Las Vegas, Nevada.[301] All of which led to some major breaking news in regards to financial information about UFC being revealed once hearings started place in August and September. At this point the case included 12 plaintiffs attorneys, two from Bellator MMA, and two from Top Rank. As they intend to look into the business practices used by UFC throughout the years towards other MMA promotions throughout the 2000s. Who often have placed some level of blame of their demise on UFC. Some of the most notable revelations included: The Ultimate Fighting Championship has been accused of monopolistic business practices both in casual criticism[309][310][311][312] and in formal lawsuits for a number of years. There are numerous fighters who have accused the company of various wrongdoing's regarding issues including unequal pay, predatory actions toward rival promotions, lack of a pension or union safety net, and other perceived unethical business practices. These perceptions have been most highlighted by a Federal Trade Commission investigation that took place between 2011 and 2012. As well as in a series of class action lawsuits filed against the company in late 2014 and early 2015. In July 2024, the parties in the Le v Zuffa and Johnson vs. Zuffa lawsuits had a proposed $335 million settlement rejected by Judge Richard Franklin Boulware II of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. Subsequently, in September 2024, a new $375 million settlement was proposed.[313] On October 21, 2024, Judge Richard Boulware of Nevada granted preliminary approval for a $375 million settlement in the \"Le vs. Zuffa\" antitrust lawsuit for monopolistic practices. As part of the settlement, around $240 million to $260 million will be distributed to eligible fighters, specifically those who competed in at least one UFC bout from December 2010 to June 2017. These payments are expected to be made over the next year. Additionally, $40 million from the settlement will be set aside for administrative and legal expenses. The preliminary approval pertains solely to the \"Le vs. Zuffa\" case. A second, related antitrust lawsuit, \"Johnson vs. Zuffa\", which covers fighters who competed in the UFC from 2017 to the present, remains unresolved and continues to proceed separately.[314][315] In the months following the March 2011 acquisition of rival promotion Strikeforce, rumours began to circulate that a possible investigation by the FTC would take place.[316] These rumours later came to be true when it was officially announced around the end of January 2012 that the FTC had in fact conducted an investigation, and found no wrongdoings regarding the UFC being a monopoly.[317][318][319] Throughout the existence of the International Fight League (IFL) between 2006 and 2008, both UFC and the IFL had competed in a hostile relationship. UFC accused the IFL and sued them for illegally using proprietary information obtained by hiring executives from their organization. The IFL responded with their own suit claiming that UFC was threatening potential partners not to work with the IFL, including Fox Sports Net (a deal with Fox Sports was later signed before resolution of the suit[320]). The tension between the IFL and the UFC worsened with accusations that the IFL had attempted to buy out several top UFC fighters. In July 2008, there were reports of the IFL's possible purchase by the UFC.[321] That same month, Joe Favorito, former IFL senior vice president, cited financial troubles for the closing of the company on July 31, 2008. Anonymous sources stated that UFC had bought the IFL.[322] Other reports cited the UFC's airing of IFL footage on its programming, and the signing of previous IFL fighters, as an indirect confirmation of the purchase.[323] On December 11, 2006, the UFC acquired the assets of the World Fighting Alliance, and formed WFA Enterprises, LLC. as a subsidiary to handle these assets, including select fighter contracts.[324] On the same day, it was reported that UFC was formalizing plans to buy World Extreme Cagefighting, to be run as a separate promotion.[needs update] Following the purchase of the World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC), UFC made several changes to the promotion. This included modifying the WEC's cage, transferring to a focus on lighter weight classes, giving it the ability to host events in Las Vegas, and having the championships of fighters who were contracted UFC fighters vacated. From 2007 to the end of 2010, the WEC was run as a separate promotion under the UFC banner, airing events 28 to 53 on Versus in the US and on The Score in Canada. On October 28, 2010, Dana White announced that the WEC would be absorbed into the UFC in early 2011.[325] On March 27, 2007, it was announced that the UFC's Frank Fertitta III and Lorenzo Fertitta were acquiring the assets of Pride Fighting Championships, the UFC's largest rival, from Dream Stage Entertainment. To handle the take over, the Fertitta brothers created a new corporate entity to handle the assets, Pride FC Worldwide Holdings LLC. With common ownership in place, Zuffa and Pride Worldwide would be working closely together.[326] Although goals of reviving Pride were not realized, many of Pride's assets, including contracts with fighters and intellectual property, are now regularly utilized by the UFC. On March 12, 2011, it was announced that the UFC had purchased Strikeforce[327][328][329][330][331] in a deal made with partial owner Silicon Valley Sports and Entertainment.[327][332] The amount of money involved has not been officially disclosed, however, it has been reported that the deal was worth $40 million.[333] The deal included licensing rights, fighter contracts, and the Strikeforce video library.[334][327] Strikeforce continued to operate as a separate company, similar to that of the WEC, until January 12, 2013. After the final show was held in Oklahoma City, the promotion was dissolved and several fighter contracts were absorbed into the UFC. When United Glory was originally formed in 2006, it was known as Ultimate Glory before a lawsuit with UFC forced a name change.[335] In June 2014 the UFC announced that they had signed a multi-year, multi-event broadcast deal to show and archive all Invicta Fighting Championships events on UFC Fight Pass.[336][337] This has allowed the UFC to further expand its women's divisions by adding a strawweight division in July 2014, and signing Invicta fighters such as Carla Esparza and Felice Herrig. In June 2014 the UFC announced that they had signed a development deal with the recently revived, Vale Tudo Japan. A brand that was brought back in 2012 by the long running, Shooto promotion.[338][339] The UFC plans on promoting and operating a new tournament series that will focus on 135 and 145 pound divisions. There were plans of a The Ultimate Fighter-like TV show to help promote these tournaments but it is unclear on what the status remains on it.[340][341] The current rules for the Ultimate Fighting Championship were originally established by the New Jersey Athletic Control Board.[342] The set of \"Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts\" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard de facto set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.[11] UFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a championship title, or is a fight card's \"main event\" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes. Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with UFC 138 on November 5, 2011, non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. UFC 263 marked the first time in UFC history that a non-title bout other than the main-event was scheduled for 5 rounds. UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth \"sudden victory\" round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.[343] The UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named \"The Octagon\". Originally, SEG trademarked the concept as well as the term and prevented other mixed martial arts promotions from using the same type of cage, but in 2001 Zuffa gave permission for other promotions to use octagonal cages, reasoning that the young sport needed uniformity to continue to win official sanctioning. Today Zuffa reserves exclusive use of the name \"The Octagon\".[344] The UFC cage is an octagonal structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl. The standard octagon has a diameter of 30 ft (9.1 m) with a 6 ft (1.8 m) high fence.[345][346] The cage sits atop a platform, raising it 4 ft (1.2 m) from the ground. It has foam padding around the top of the fence and between each of the eight sections. It also has two entry-exit gates opposite each other.[347][345] The mat (also referred to as the canvas[348][349]), painted with sponsorship logos and art, is replaced for each event. For smaller venues and events, the UFC often uses a smaller cage, which is only 25 ft (7.6 m) across.[350][351][345] All competitors fight in approved shorts, without shoes. Tops are only approved for female competitors. Required safety equipment include padded gloves, mouthguard, and protective cups held in place with a jockstrap for males.[352] The open-fingered gloves have at least 1\" of padding around the knuckles, (110 to 170 g / 4 to 6 ounces) that allow fingers to grab. To ensure compliance, fighters are checked by a state athletic committee official before being allowed to enter the cage/ring.[353] Originally the attire for UFC was very open. Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes. Multi-time tournament champion Royce Gracie wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while Art Jimmerson appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove. As of UFC 133 there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after Dennis Hallman wore one in his fight against Brian Ebersole. UFC president Dana White was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary \"getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible\" bonus of $70,000 to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.[354] On December 2, 2014, the UFC and Reebok held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015. Financial terms of the six-year partnership were not released, but UFC officials said that though the agreement represents the most valuable non-broadcast contract the company has ever signed, the UFC will not directly profit from the new deal. Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the \"vast majority of the revenue\" from the deal ‚Äì taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program ‚Äì will be paid directly to UFC fighters.[355] Payment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter's spot in the official UFC rankings, with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate.[355] The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card.[355] In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the idea of the ranking and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1‚Äì5 fights, 6‚Äì10 fights, 11‚Äì15 fights, and 16‚Äì20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation.[356] The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to their nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.[357] The new deal meant that beginning with fight week for UFC 189 in Las Vegas, existing sponsors no longer appear on fighter clothing ‚Äì not only on fight night but also at all pre-fight media appearances ‚Äì and in-cage sponsor banners have also eliminated. Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots ‚Äì similar to those seen with European soccer clubs ‚Äì that the UFC may eventually sell to \"a major, global brand\" down the road.[355] On July 11, 2020, UFC announced Venum as the exclusive outfitting partner from April 2021: UFC on ABC: Vettori vs. Holland was the first event with Venum outfits.[358] UFC announced in October 2021, that Avex Brasil, local producer of Venum brand apparel, has been named the exclusive manufacturer and distributor of UFC Replica Fight Kits and Fight Week apparel sold through retailers in Brazil. Under the terms of the agreement, Avex Brasil will manufacture officially licensed UFC replica fight kits and fight week apparel for men and women and distribute the product through the country.[359] On April 12, 2024, UFC announced a new glove where changes were made to reduce hand injuries and eye pokes (every 14 fights with an average delay of 50 seconds), while maintaining dexterity and not affecting performance. The new gloves were already tested during the ten weeks of the Dana White's Contender Series 2023 and gloves will be used starting June 2024. New features of the gloves include: (1) a wristband locking system to prevent grabbing of the gloves; (2) all seams are now on the palm side with a lack of seams on top of the hands to minimize abrasions and cuts; (3) removal of finger binding that allows the hand to close maturely to reduce eyes pokes, abrasions, and cuts; (4) padding to the sides of the index and pinky finger of the glove to protect bone; (5) ergonomic curved wristband for better fit around the wrist scooped or angled finger holes to eliminate bunching on the inside of the fisted hand lining; (6) and thicker foam padding for maximum flexibility and protection with an updated law profile hook and loop that minimizes snag and reduces weight; they have an authentication and data chip which allows the UFC to identify a pair of gloves to a fighter in a specific fight.[360][361] The gloves come in XXXS to XXXXL sizes with weight lighter by 1 to 1.5 ounces compared to the previous gloves; the new glove weighs between 3 and 4.9 oz.[362] New gloves include five different glove colors: gun-metal gloves will be used for traditional UFC fights; gold gloves with an octagon trim for championship fights and main event bouts; black gloves for \"The Ultimate Fighter\"; blue gloves for Dana White's Contender Series; and red gloves for Road to the UFC tournaments.[363][364] On November 12, it was reported that the UFC had notified fighters competing in upcoming events, starting from UFC 309, that the organization will reintroduce its previous glove design, which had been replaced at UFC 302 in June. UFC President Dana White cited frequent complaints from fighters as being the reason for the change, even though the new design had only been in use for six months.[365] Matches may end via: In the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total points be equal (see, e.g., UFC 41 Penn vs. Uno, or UFC 43 Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of win judgments from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.[367] The ten-point must system is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10‚Äì10 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.) Scores of 10‚Äì8 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10‚Äì7 rounds are very rare, with only five known instances in UFC history‚Äîif a round is lopsided enough that a 10‚Äì7 score would be justified, the referee will usually declare a technical knockout and stop the fight as a safety precaution.[368][369] The Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:[370] When a foul is charged, the referee, in their discretion, may deduct one or more points as a penalty. If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.[371] Fights that occur on The Ultimate Fighter are classified as exhibition matches under NSAC sanctioning, and thus do not count toward a fighter's professional record. Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.[378] For two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round (\"sudden victory\") is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges' decision will be based on that final round.[379] These exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.[citation needed] The UFC currently uses nine weight classes:[380] Updated as of December 7, 2024, after UFC 310. Non-title fights have a one-pound leniency. In title fights, the participants must weigh no more than that permitted for the relevant weight division. The Commission may also approve catch weight bouts, subject to their review and discretion. For example, the Commission may still decide to allow the contest the maximum weight allowed is 177 pounds if it feels that the contest would still be fair, safe, and competitive.[380] In addition, there are five weight classes specified in the Unified Rules which the UFC does not currently use: Super Lightweight (165 pounds), Super Welterweight (175 pounds), Super Middleweight (195 pounds), Cruiserweight (225 pounds), and Super Heavyweight (>265 pounds). As of 20 October 2020, the UFC roster consisted of fighters from 71 countries.[396] UFC fighters are paid a substantially lower share of revenue than athletes in comparable sports,[397][398] and other large MMA promotions.[399] UFC fighters are paid per fight,[400] with amounts depending on how well-known the fighters are and how well sponsored a fighter and an event is. Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. Despite not being officially confirmed by the UFC, Justin Gaethje revealed in January 2019 that headlining an event nets an additional $25,000 per fighter.[401] While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at UFC 202, Conor McGregor made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent Nate Diaz made a reported $2 million. The combined $5 million made between the fighters was the largest combined fight purse in UFC history.[402] Cash bonuses are also awarded for \"Fight of the Night\" and \"Performance of the Night\" (formerly awarded separately as \"Knockout of the Night\").[403] The size of these bonuses can sometimes be US$80,000 (but are normally US$50,000). For less well-known fighters, they can be several times larger than the contracted amount for the fight.[404] Contracted amounts generally have to be declared to the state athletic commission; however, the UFC also pays undisclosed locker-room bonuses to fighters.[405] In early 2021, Dana White revealed that these bonuses vary from $4,000 to $25,000.[406] In recent years, UFC fighters' contracts and merchandising rights have been the subject of dispute between fighters (represented by growing the Mixed Martial Arts Fighters Association) and UFC, which has attempted to defend existing regulations.[407] UFC is contractually bound to offer every fighter three fights per calendar year and if they don't, the organization has to pay the fighter for the lacking fights. For example, if the UFC offers a fighter only one fight during the year, they have to pay the fighter for two additional fights. However, if a fight is offered but turned down by the fighter, it is still counted as an offered fight from the contractual viewpoint.[408] Starting at UFC 273, three \"Fan Bonus Of The Night\", for every pay-per-view event, will be awarded by Crypto.com, as part of Crypto.com UFC sponsorship incentive fight kits deal,[409] for every pay-per-view event starting UFC 273. Viewers could vote up to three times per pay-per-view on Crypto.com/FanBonus, starting from the opening of the PPV preliminary card and ending an hour after the conclusion of the main card. The bonuses will be paid in bitcoin in US dollars ranging from US$30,000 for first place, US$20,000 for second place, and US$10,000 for third place.[410] As of January 27, 2020, it was announced through Twitter by Bruno Massami that the UFC has decided to separate its pound-for-pound ranking. Men and women will have their own pound-for-pound rankings.[411] Rankings updated on December 17, 2024, after UFC on ESPN: Covington vs. Buckley.[412] Rankings updated on October 29, 2024, after UFC 308.[412] MMA journalists and fans have criticized the UFC for putting on too many shows and thus diluting the quality of their product.[426] Comedian, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Taekwondo black belt[427] Joe Rogan teams up with play-by-play announcer Jon Anik, UFC Hall of Famer Daniel Cormier and Megan Olivi to provide commentary during broadcasts of most UFC events in the US. For 20 years[c] Rogan and Mike Goldberg provided commentary at live events.[428] The \"Veteran Voice of the Octagon\" is announcer Bruce Buffer.[429] Arianny Celeste, Rachelle Leah, Brittney Palmer, Carly Baker, Vanessa Hanson, Chrissy Blair, Jhenny Andrade, Camila Oliveira, Luciana Andrade, Jamilette Gaxiola, and Red Dela Cruz are Octagon girls.[430] Each fighter is assigned a cutman by the promotion who cares for the fighter before the fight and in between rounds. Jacob \"Stitch\" Duran was one of the best known cutmen working for the organization.[431] Matches are made by matchmakers, and VP of Talent Relations, Joe Silva and Sean Shelby.[432] Induction Induction Induction Induction In January 2007, Zuffa and video game developer/publisher THQ announced a license agreement giving THQ worldwide rights to develop titles under the UFC brand. The agreement gives THQ exclusive rights to current and next-generation consoles as well as to PC and handheld titles. Also included are \"certain wireless rights\" which were not detailed. The licensing agreement was set to expire in 2011, although it appeared to have been extended to 2017. On June 4, 2012, THQ announced they will be giving the license of UFC Undisputed to EA.[512] The first UFC action figure collectibles were released by Round 5 Corporation in May 2008.[513] Series one of their figures includes Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson, Matt Hughes, Tito Ortiz, and Randy Couture. Series two (released on November 10, 2008) includes Wanderlei Silva, Sean Sherk, Rich Franklin, and Anderson Silva.[514] In July 2009, Round 5 acquired the UFC license through Jakks Pacific and subsequently released five more series under the UFC and Pride brands. Two packs were released in August 2010 and include a UFC Octagon cage and Pride ring display stand. Limited edition versions include fabric walk-out tees or paint variations and are limited in number with foil and holographic packaging variances. Special edition and exclusive versions have been released at various UFC Fan Expo events.[515] On June 10, 2008, it was announced that UFC had signed an exclusive four-year contract with Jakks Pacific to create action figures for UFC. As of 2009[update] the schedule envisages the release of these figures in November 2009. They have currently been 8 series released and they feature special Legends, Pride, and WEC style figures as well. Three 2 packs series have also been released, as well as several expo and internet exclusives. There are also several different octagon cage playsets that have been released, including the \"Octagon Playset\", \"Official Scale Octagon Playset\", and \"Electronic Reaction Octagon Playset\". A Pridestyle ring playset was also originally planned; however, no news have been given on its status or release date since then.[516][517][518] In 2020, the UFC and toy company Jazwares entered into an agreement to release a new line of UFC action figures.[523] The first wave of Jazwares' UFC figures were scheduled to be released in Fall 2020. Various UFC events have been released onto DVD. UFC 23 through UFC 29 were not released in the US on home video or DVD by SEG. They have since been released onto boxsets which feature around 10 events each set, in chronological order.[524] UFC on-demand content launched for Xbox 360 on December 20, 2011. Subscribers were able to view pay-per-view events in high definition, connect with friends to predict fight results, and have the ability to compare fighter statistics and records.[525] The UFC Fight Pass application was also planned for PlayStation 4 in early 2015.[526] In 2015, UFC Fight Pass became available on the Xbox One.[527] In December 2022, a PlayStation version of the app was released. In August 2021, the UFC began to release NFTs to commemorate big fights, milestones and moments via their official trading card partner, Panini America.[528] The UFC's PPV events are broadcast live on pay-per-view in the US and BT Sport In the UK; BT Sports first ever live event was August 3, 2013 UFC 163 headlined by Jos√© Aldo and The Korean Zombie.[529] BT Sport were the first major broadcaster in the UK for the UFC where previously they had small coverage on Bravo, Setanta Sports[530] and finally ESPN UK in August, 2012[531] until the BT Sport deal was in place. Events are broadcast live on Fighting Sports Network in Pay TV (Cable and Satellite) of SKY Satellite. Free TV Channels in Mexico, Fox Sports and Fox Premium in Pay TV (Cable and Satellite) Central America are broadcast with tape-delay. In Brazil, events are broadcast live on open television through Rede Bandeirantes, which transmits the Fight Night events and preliminary cards of main events, while the numbered events are on Fight Pass.[532] Previously, Rede Globo broadcast it from 2011 on its own Combate Channel, until 2022.[532] In Southeast Asia (exclude the Philippines), Hong Kong, and Papua New Guinea, UFC events are broadcast on Fox Movies Premium (2012‚Äì2013)[533] and Fox Sports[534] (2013‚Äì2021).[535] In India, events are broadcast on Sony Ten 2, Sony Ten 1, Sony Ten 1 HD and Sony Ten 2 HD.[536] In the Philippines, UFC was also aired on Balls (now ABS-CBN Sports + Action HD) from 2009 until 2015, since moved to Sports5 (including TV5, AksyonTV and Hyper on Channel 91 (SD) and 261 (HD) via Cignal) starting January 3, 2016 until December 31, 2018, and is currently airing on TAP Digital Media Ventures Corporation-owned sports cable television channel Premier Sports since October 2021.[537][538][539][540] In Indonesia, UFC events are currently broadcast on tvOne starting January 15, 2018;[541] previously, this events was also broadcast on RCTI,[542] iNews[543] since 2012 until the end of 2017.[544] On April 13, 2019, UFC's event was broadcast on Abu Dhabi Media.[545] In Poland since 2018 the official broadcaster of UFC it's Polsat Sport.[546] Previously the UFC events in this nation are broadcast by Orange Sport and Extreme Sports Channel. The main Polish broadcasters of UFC telecasts, are Andrzej Janisz and ≈Åukasz \"Juras\" Jurkowski. In 2024, Rogers successfully bid for the rights to broadcast UFC in Canada on its Sportsnet channels. The UFC was previously on Sportsnet and French broadcaster TVA from September 2011 through the end of 2014 in Canada.[547] In Russian, UFC events are broadcast on Match TV, a Russian sports channel owned by Gazprom Media, starting 2022.[548]",

                "content": "List of UFC events is a list of events held and scheduled by the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a mixed martial arts promotion based in the United States. UFC's first event, UFC 1, took place on November 12, 1993. Each UFC event contains several fights. Traditionally, every event starts off with a preliminary card followed by a main card, with the last fight being known as the main event. UFC events are separated into nine different formats: Most of the \"numbered\" events have taken place on pay-per-view, though there have been a few exceptions for reasons such as tape-delay. Events such as UFC 72, which took place in Belfast, Northern Ireland, were sold on pay-per-view, but due to tape-delay, purchase rates were not as high as events that aired at a traditional starting time.[1] As such, events taking part in significantly different time zones, including UFC 70, UFC 75, UFC 89, UFC 95, UFC 105, UFC 120, UFC 122, and UFC 138, were given a same-night airing in U.S. prime time on Spike.[2] Historically, the UFC has also aired preliminary fights prior to the main fight cards, either on television via Spike, FX, and Fuel TV, or online via Facebook and YouTube. Beginning in August 2013, starting with UFC Fight Night: Shogun vs. Sonnen, the UFC began airing non-PPV events on either Fox Sports 1 or Fox Sports 2.[3] In January 2014, as part of the organization's global expansion, the UFC began airing various international events exclusively on their subscription-based digital network, UFC Fight Pass.[4] In July 2009, the UFC held its unofficial 100th \"numbered event\"; however, officially, despite being called UFC 100, it was actually the 101st numbered event (not to mention the 133rd event overall). The UFC signed a deal with Fox Sports Net, after Fox agreed to broadcast one fight in June 2002, during its \"All-Star Summer\" that month.[5] UFC 37 and 38 had already been scheduled and promoted, but as UFC 38 was the promotion's debut in the United Kingdom, they created UFC 37.5; an event that featured the first ever mixed martial arts fight available on cable television.[5] As of UFC Fight Night: Dern vs. Ribas 2, which took place on January 11, 2025, there have been 717 UFC events held in 166 cities in 30 countries. In May 2017, the UFC announced White would hold Dana White's Tuesday Night Contender Series weekly on UFC Fight Pass (becoming, from January 2019 on, exclusive content on ESPN+ in the United States). As with the earlier web series Looking for a Fight, the goal of the series is for White to scout talent for the UFC.[6][7] It was stated ahead of the license being approved that ‚Äúthis is not the UFC, this is not the UFC brand,‚Äù but instead a promotion that will allow up and coming fighters the chance to showcase their talents in hopes that one day they may compete in the UFC.[8] Brazil (total: 40) Canada (total: 34) United Kingdom (total: 29) United Arab Emirates (total: 20) Australia (total: 18) Japan (total: 9) China (total: 7) Mexico (total: 7) Germany (total: 6) Singapore (total: 6) Sweden (total: 6) France (total: 3) Ireland (total: 3) New Zealand (total: 3) Russia (total: 3) Netherlands (total: 2) Poland (total: 2) South Korea (total: 2) Argentina (total: 1) Chile (total: 1) Croatia (total: 1) Czech Republic (total: 1) Denmark (total: 1) Philippines (total: 1) Puerto Rico (total: 1) Saudi Arabia (total: 1) Uruguay (total: 1)",

                "title": "FA Cup - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Football Association Challenge Cup, more commonly known as the FA Cup, is an annual knockout football competition in domestic English football. First played during the 1871‚Äì72 season, it is the oldest national football competition in the world.[1] It is organised by and named after The Football Association (The FA). A concurrent Women's FA Cup has been held since 1970. The competition is open to all eligible clubs down to level 9 of the English football league system, with level 10 clubs acting as stand-ins in the event of non-entries from above.[2] A record 763 clubs competed in 2011‚Äì12. The tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by the semi-finals and the final. Entrants are not seeded, although a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds ‚Äì the minimum number of games needed to win, depending on which round a team enters the competition, ranges from six to fourteen. The first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition, and are contested by clubs in the National League System, levels 5 to 10 of the English football system, more commonly called non-League. 32 of these teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper, meeting the first of the 48 professional teams from Leagues One and Two. The last entrants are the 20 Premier League and 24 Championship clubs, into the draw for the third round proper.[2] In the modern era, only one non-League team has ever reached the quarter-finals, and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final.[note 1] As a result, significant focus is given to the smaller teams who progress furthest, especially if they achieve an unlikely \"giant-killing\" victory. Winners receive the FA Cup trophy, of which there have been two designs and five actual cups; the latest is a 2014 replica of the second design, introduced in 1911. Winners also qualify for the UEFA Europa League and a place in the upcoming FA Community Shield. Arsenal are the most successful club with fourteen titles, most recently in 2020, and their former manager Ars√®ne Wenger is the competition's most successful, having won seven finals with the team. Manchester United are the current holders, having defeated local rivals Manchester City 2‚Äì1 in the 2024 final. In 1863, the newly founded Football Association (the FA) published the Laws of the Game of Association Football, unifying the various different rules in use before then. On 20 July 1871, in the offices of The Sportsman newspaper, the FA Secretary C. W. Alcock proposed to the FA committee that \"it is desirable that a Challenge Cup should be established in connection with the Association for which all clubs belonging to the Association should be invited to compete\". The inaugural FA Cup tournament kicked off in November 1871. After thirteen games in all, Wanderers were crowned the winners in the final, on 16 March 1872. Wanderers retained the trophy the following year. The modern cup was beginning to be established by the 1888‚Äì89 season, when qualifying rounds were introduced.[3] Following the 1914‚Äì15 edition, the competition was suspended in mid air due to the First World War, and did not resume until 1919‚Äì20. The 1923 FA Cup Final, commonly known as the \"White Horse Final\", was the first final to be played in the newly opened Wembley Stadium (known at the time as the Empire Stadium). The 1927 final saw \"Abide with Me\" being sung for the first time at the Cup final, which has become a pre-match tradition.[4] Due to the outbreak of World War II, the competition was not played between the 1938‚Äì39 and 1945‚Äì46 editions. Due to the wartime breaks, the competition did not celebrate its centenary year until 1980‚Äì81. After some confusion over the rules in its first competition, the FA decided that any drawn match would lead to a replay, with teams competing in further replays until a game was eventually won.[5] Alvechurch and Oxford City contested the most replayed tie in the 1971‚Äì72 qualification, in a tie which went to 6 matches.[5] Multiple replays were scrapped for the competition proper in 1991‚Äì92, and the qualifying rounds in 1997‚Äì98.[5] Replays were removed altogether from the semi-final and final matches in 2000, from the quarter-finals in 2016‚Äì17, the fifth round in 2019‚Äì20[5] and the first round onwards from 2024 to 2025.[6] Redevelopment of Wembley saw the final played outside of England for the first time, the 2001‚Äì2006 finals being played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The final returned to Wembley in 2007, followed by the semi-finals from 2008. An application window is open to clubs before entry lists, round byes and scheduling are announced in July. All clubs in the top four levels (the Premier League and the three divisions of the English Football League) are automatically eligible. Clubs from Level 5‚Äì9 (non-league football) are also eligible provided they play in either the FA Trophy or FA Vase competitions in the current season. All participating clubs must also have a stadium suitable for the competition and The Association may reject applications at its discretion.[2] Previously, Level 10 clubs were a prominent feature in early qualifying rounds. The gradual remodelling of the National League System to a 'perfect' 1‚Äì2‚Äì4‚Äì8‚Äì16 system, with a first phase in 2018‚Äì19, a final phase in 2021‚Äì22 (which included the promotion of 107 clubs), and played to a full quota in 2022‚Äì23 has resulted in a larger number of teams playing in Level 7‚Äì9.[7][8][9] Consequently, for the FA Cup, entries equal the number in tiers 1‚Äì9 and is cut off to those below.[2] Though still able to apply, Level 10 clubs are used as alternatives \"subject to availability\" in the event of a non/rejected applicant (with vacancies filled by Level 10 applicants with the best PPG in the previous league season).[2] The total number of entries in the FA Cup has changed as Non-League football has gradually been expanded and reorganised over time. In the 2004‚Äì05 season, 660 clubs entered the competition, beating the long-standing record of 656 from the 1921‚Äì22 season. In 2005‚Äì06 this increased to 674 entrants, in 2006‚Äì07 to 687, in 2007‚Äì08 to 731 clubs, in 2008‚Äì09 and 2009‚Äì10 to 762.[10] The total number of entries has also varied naturally from year-to-year as new clubs form and others dissolve at unequal rates. Though most leagues in the National League System maintain the same number of teams via reprieves, inevitably entry-level divisions (typically at tier 10) have to be impacted when a club leaves the pyramid.[11] Therefore, for example, 759 teams entered in 2010‚Äì11, a record 763 in 2011‚Äì12, 758 in 2012‚Äì13, 737 in 2013‚Äì14 and 736 in 2014‚Äì15.[10] However, since 2021‚Äì22, The FA has cut off automatic eligibility to the 10th tier (to appear only subject to availability) and instead set the size of the draw to match the more stable number of teams in Level 1‚Äì9.[12] This means that the competition may now see a standardised number of entries from one year to the next.[13] This number is currently 732 but could rise to 748 for 2023‚Äì24 with plans for a new SWPL 9th tier division to share the South West with the existing Western League.[14] It is very rare for top clubs to miss the competition, although it can happen in exceptional circumstances. Manchester United did not defend their title in 1999‚Äì2000, as they were already in the inaugural Club World Championship. The club stated that entering both tournaments would overload their fixture schedule and make it more difficult to defend their Champions League and Premier League titles. The club claimed that they did not want to devalue the FA Cup by fielding a weaker side. The move benefited United as they received a two-week break and won the 1999‚Äì2000 league title by an 18-point margin, although they did not progress past the group stage of the Club World Championship. The withdrawal from the FA Cup, however, drew considerable criticism as this weakened the tournament's prestige and Sir Alex Ferguson later admitted his regret regarding their handling of the situation.[15][16][17] Welsh sides that play in English leagues are eligible, although since the creation of the League of Wales there are only five clubs remaining: Cardiff City (the only non-English team to win the tournament, in 1927), Swansea City, Newport County, Wrexham, and Merthyr Town. In the early years other teams from Wales, Ireland and Scotland also took part in the competition, with Glasgow side Queen's Park losing the final to Blackburn Rovers in 1884 and 1885 before being barred from entering by the Scottish Football Association. Entries from clubs affiliated to \"offshore\" associations are also eligible subject to consideration on an annual basis, with special provisions that may apply.[2] In the 2013‚Äì14 season the first Channel Island club entered the competition when Guernsey F.C. competed.[18] The first game played in the Channel Islands ‚Äì and thus the southernmost FA Cup tie played ‚Äì took place on 7 August 2021 between Jersey Bulls and Horsham YMCA. A third club, F.C. Isle of Man, was also eligible to play in 2022‚Äì23, but in the end all Crown Dependency teams either did not appear on the entry list or later withdrew.[19][20] Beginning in August, the competition proceeds as a knockout tournament throughout, consisting of twelve rounds, a semi-final and then a final, in May. A system of byes ensures clubs above level 9 enter the competition at later stages. There is no seeding, the fixtures in each round being determined by a random draw. Fixtures ending in a tie are replayed once only (from the 2024‚Äì25 campaign, prior to the first round proper).[21][22] The first six rounds are qualifiers, with the draws organised on a regional basis. The next six rounds are the \"proper\" rounds where all clubs are in one draw. All entrants from Level 9 begin the competition in the extra preliminary round, and any Level 10 team filling in for a vacancy.[2] Teams from Level 8 are ranked on their PPG in the previous season, except newly promoted teams automatically ranked towards the bottom and newly relegated teams ranked to the top; teams are then split between entering at either the Extra-Preliminary or preliminary round so as to ensure the right balance of fixtures throughout the competition.[2] From there, clubs from higher levels are added in later rounds, as per the table below. The months in which rounds are played are traditional, with exact dates subject to each calendar. The number of new entries, winners from previous rounds, and division of Level 8 teams in the two preliminary rounds are based on an entry list of 732 modelled on the English league system as of 2022‚Äì23. From 2023 to 2024, the entry list could rise to 746 in line with sixteen additional clubs at Level 9 meaning that the extra preliminary round will have 444 teams with only 50 Level 8 clubs entering at the preliminary round.[14] previous round Level 9 clubs Level 8 clubs (96 lowest ranked) The qualifying rounds are regionalised to reduce the travel costs for smaller non-league sides. The first and second proper rounds were also previously split into Northern and Southern sections, but this practice was ended after the 1997‚Äì98 competition. [citation needed] The final is normally held the Saturday after the Premier League season finishes in May. The only seasons in recent times when this pattern was not followed were: 1999‚Äì2000, when most rounds were played a few weeks earlier than normal as an experiment; 2010‚Äì11 and 2012‚Äì13 when the FA Cup Final was played before the Premier League season had finished, to allow Wembley Stadium to be ready for the UEFA Champions League final,[23] and in 2011‚Äì12 to allow England time to prepare for that summer's European Championships;[24] 2019‚Äì20 when the final was delayed until August due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom,[25][26] and the 2021-22 when the final was held a week before the end of the league. The 2025 Final is also scheduled to take place the week before the end of the league.[27] The draws for the Extra Preliminary, Preliminary, and first qualifying rounds used to all occur at the same time. Thereafter, the draw for each subsequent round is not made until after the scheduled dates for the previous round, meaning that in the case of replays, clubs will often know their future opponents in advance. The draw for each of the proper rounds is broadcast live on television, usually taking place at the conclusion of live coverage of one of the games of the previous round. Public interest is particularly high during the draw for the third round, which is where the top-ranked teams are added to the draw. In rounds up to and including the fourth round proper, fixtures resulting in a draw (after normal time) go to a replay, played at the venue of the away team, at a later date; if that replay is still tied, the winner is settled by a period of extra time, and if still necessary, a penalty shootout. Since 2016‚Äì17, ties have been settled on the day from the quarter-finals onwards, using extra time and penalties. From 2018‚Äì19, Fifth round ties are also settled by extra time and penalties. Beginning with the 2024‚Äì25 competition, replays have been scrapped from the first round onwards.[28] The decision to scrap replays received criticism from a number of lower-tier clubs and government officials.[29] Until 1990‚Äì91, further replays would be played until one team was victorious. In 1971‚Äì72, a fourth qualifying round game between Alvechurch and Oxford City was played six times until Alvechurch won in the fifth replay.[30] In their 1975 campaign, Fulham played 12 games over six rounds, which remains the most games played by a team to reach a final.[31] Replays were traditionally played three or four days after the original game, but from 1991‚Äì92 they were staged at least 10 days later on police advice for the rounds proper. This led to penalty shoot-outs being introduced, the first of which came on 26 November 1991 when Rotherham United eliminated Scunthorpe United.[32] From 1980‚Äì81 to 1998‚Äì99, the semi-finals went to extra time on the day if the score after 90 minutes was a draw. If the score was still level after extra time, the match would go to a replay. Replays for the semi-finals were scrapped for 1999‚Äì2000; the last semi-final to go into a replay was in 1998‚Äì99, when Manchester United beat rivals Arsenal 2‚Äì1 after extra time, following a 0‚Äì0 draw in the original match. The first FA Cup Final to go to extra time and a replay was the 1875 final, between the Royal Engineers and the Old Etonians. The initial tie finished 1‚Äì1 but the Royal Engineers won the replay 2‚Äì0 in normal time. The last replayed final was the 1993 FA Cup Final, when Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday fought a 1‚Äì1 draw. The replay saw Arsenal win the FA Cup, 2‚Äì1 after extra time. The last quarter-final to go to a replay was Manchester United vs West Ham United in the 2015‚Äì16 FA Cup. The original game at Old Trafford ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw, while Manchester United won the replay at the Boleyn Ground, 2‚Äì1. It was also the last FA Cup game ever played at the Boleyn Ground.[33] The last fifth round replay saw Tottenham Hotspur defeat Rochdale 6‚Äì1 at Wembley in the 2017‚Äì18 FA Cup after the first match at Spotland Stadium ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw.[34] The FA Cup winners qualify for the following season's UEFA Europa League (formerly named the UEFA Cup; from its launch in 1960 until 1998, they entered the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners' Cup instead). This European place applies even if the team is relegated or is not in the English top flight. In the past, if the FA Cup winning team also qualified for the following season's Champions League or Europa League through their league or European performance, then the losing FA Cup finalists were given the European berth of the League Cup winners and the League Cup winners would be given the league berth instead (in the Cup Winners' Cup era, teams qualifying for the UEFA Cup via other competitions would be promoted to the Cup Winners' Cup instead). FA Cup winners enter the Europa League at the group stage. Losing finalists, if they had not qualified for Europe via the league, began earlier, at the play-off or third qualifying round stage.[35] From the 2015‚Äì16 UEFA Europa League season, however, UEFA does not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition.[36] If the winner of the FA Cup has already qualified for a European Competition through their Premier League position, the FA Cup berth is then given to the highest placed team in the Premier League who has not yet qualified for a European Competition. The FA Cup winners also qualify for the following season's single-match FA Community Shield, the traditional season opener played against the previous season's Premier League champions (or the Premier League runners-up if the FA Cup winners also won the league ‚Äì the double). Fixtures in the 12 rounds of the competition are usually played at the home ground of one of the two teams. The semi-finals and final are played at a neutral venue ‚Äì the rebuilt Wembley Stadium. In the matches for the 12 competition rounds, the team who plays at home is decided when the fixtures are drawn ‚Äì simply the first team drawn out for each fixture. Occasionally games may have to be moved to other grounds due to other events taking place, security reasons or a ground not being suitable to host popular teams. However, since 2003, clubs cannot move grounds to the away side's for capacity or financial reasons. If any move has to be made, it has to be to a neutral venue and any additional monies earned by the move goes into the central pot.[37] In the event of a draw, the replay is played at the ground of the team who originally played away from home. In the days when multiple replays were possible, the second replay (and any further replays) were played at neutral grounds. The clubs involved could alternatively agree to toss for home advantage in the second replay. The semi-finals have been played exclusively at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium since 2008, one year after it opened and after it had already hosted a final (in 2007). For the first decade of the competition, the Kennington Oval was used as the semi-final venue. In the period between this first decade and the reopening of Wembley, semi-finals were played at high-capacity neutral venues around England; usually the home grounds of teams not involved in that semi-final, chosen to be roughly equidistant between the two teams for fairness of travel. The top three most used venues in this period were Villa Park in Birmingham (55 times), Hillsborough in Sheffield (34 times) and Old Trafford in Manchester (23 times). The original Wembley Stadium was also used seven times for semi-final, between 1991 and 2000 (the last held there), but not always for fixtures featuring London teams. In 2005, both were held at the Millennium Stadium. In 2003 the FA decided to permanently use the new Wembley for semi-finals to recoup debts in financing the new stadium.[38] This was controversial, with the move seen as both unfair to fans of teams located far from London, and taking some of the prestige away from a Wembley final.[39] In defending the move, the FA has also cited the extra capacity Wembley offers, although the 2013 fixture between Millwall and Wigan Athletic led to the unprecedented step of placing 6,000 tickets on sale to neutral fans after the game failed to sell out.[40] A fan poll by The Guardian in 2013 found 86% opposition to Wembley semi-finals.[40] The final has been played at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium since it opened, in 2007.[41] The rebuilding process meant that between 2001 and 2006 they were hosted at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in Wales. Prior to rebuilding, the final was hosted by the original Wembley Stadium since it opened in 1923 (being originally named the Empire Stadium). One exception to this 78-year series of Empire Stadium finals (including five replays) was the 1970 replay between Leeds United and Chelsea, held at Old Trafford in Manchester. In the 51 years prior to the Empire Stadium opening, the final (including 8 replays) was held in a variety of locations, predominantly in London, and mainly at the Kennington Oval and then Crystal Palace. It was played 22 times at The Oval (the inaugural competition in 1872, and then all but two times until 1892). After The Oval, Crystal Palace hosted 21 finals from 1895 to 1914, broken up by four replays elsewhere. The other London venues were Stamford Bridge from 1920 to 1922 (the last three finals before the move to Empire Stadium); and the University of Oxford's Lillie Bridge in Fulham for the second ever final, in 1873. The other venues used sparingly in this period were all outside of London, as follows: The FA permitted artificial turf (3G) pitches in all rounds of the competition from the 2014‚Äì15 edition and beyond.[42] Under the 2015‚Äì16 rules, the pitch must be of FIFA One Star quality, or Two Star for ties if they involve one of the 92 professional clubs.[2] This followed approval two years previously for their use in the qualifying rounds only ‚Äì if a team with a 3G pitch progressed to the competition proper, they had to switch their tie to the ground of another eligible entrant with a natural grass pitch.[43] Having been strong proponents of the surface, the first match in the proper rounds to be played on a 3G surface was a televised first round replay at Maidstone United's Gallagher Stadium on 20 November 2014.[44] The winners of the competition receive the FA Cup. It is only loaned to the club by the FA; under the current (2015‚Äì16) rules it must be returned by 1 March, or earlier if given seven days' notice.[2] Traditionally, the holders had the Cup until the following year's presentation, although more recently the trophy has been taken on publicity tours by the FA in between finals.[45] The trophy comes in three parts ‚Äì the cup itself, plus a lid and a base. There have been two designs of trophy in use, but five physical trophies have been presented. The original trophy, known as the \"little tin idol\", was 18 inches high and made by Martin, Hall & Co. It was stolen in 1895 and never recovered, and so was replaced by an exact replica, used until 1910. The FA decided to change the design after the 1909 winners, Manchester United, made their own replica, leading the FA to realise they did not own the copyright.[46] This new, larger design was by Fattorini and Sons, and was used from 1911.[46] In order to preserve this original, from 1992 it was replaced by an exact replica, although this had to be replaced after just over two decades, after showing wear and tear from being handled more than in previous eras. This third replica, first used in 2014, was built heavier to withstand the increased handling.[45] Of the four surviving trophies, only the 1895 replica has entered private ownership.[47] The name of the winning team is engraved on the silver band around the base as soon as the final has finished, in order to be ready in time for the presentation ceremony.[45] This means the engraver has just five minutes to perform a task which would take 20 under normal conditions, although time is saved by engraving the year on during the match, and sketching the presumed winner.[48] During the final, the trophy is decorated with ribbons in the colours of both finalists, with the loser's ribbons being removed at the end of the game.[49] The tradition of tying ribbons started after Tottenham Hotspur won the 1901 FA Cup Final and the wife of a Spurs director decided to tie blue and white ribbons to the handles of the cup.[50] Traditionally, at Wembley finals, the presentation is made at the Royal Box, with players, led by the captain, mounting a staircase to a gangway in front of the box and returning by a second staircase on the other side of the box. At Cardiff the presentation was made on a podium on the pitch. The tradition of presenting the trophy immediately after the game did not start until the 1882 final; after the first final in 1872 the trophy was not presented to the winners, Wanderers, until a reception held four weeks later in the Pall Mall Restaurant in London.[51] Under the original rules, the trophy was to be permanently presented to any club which won the competition three times, although when inaugural winners Wanderers achieved this feat by the 1876 final, the rules were changed by FA Secretary CW Alcock (who was also captain of Wanderers in their first victory).[52] Portsmouth have the distinction of being the football club which has held the FA Cup trophy for the longest uninterrupted period - seven years. Portsmouth had defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers 4‚Äì1 in the 1939 FA Cup Final and were awarded the trophy as 1938‚Äì39 FA Cup winners. But with the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the regular Football League and FA Cup competitions for the 1939‚Äì40 season were cancelled for the duration of the war. Portsmouth's manager Jack Tinn was rumoured to have kept the FA Cup trophy 'safe under his bed' throughout the duration of the war, but this is an urban myth. Because the naval city of Portsmouth was a primary strategic military target for German Luftwaffe bombing, the FA Cup trophy was actually taken ten miles to the north of Portsmouth, to the nearby Hampshire village of Lovedean, and there it resided in a quaint thatched roof country pub called The Bird in Hand for the seven years of the war.[53] After the conclusion of World War II, the FA Cup trophy was presented back to the Football Association by the club in time for the 1946 FA Cup Final. The first trophy, the 'little tin idol', was made by Martin, Hall & Co at a cost of ¬£20.[54] It was stolen from a Birmingham shoe shop window belonging to William Shillcock while held by Aston Villa on 11 September 1895 and was never seen again. Despite a ¬£10 reward for information, the crime was never solved. As it happened while it was in their care, the FA fined Villa ¬£25 to pay for a replacement. Just over 60 years later, 80 year old career criminal Henry (Harry) James Burge claimed to have committed the theft, confessing to a newspaper, with the story being published in the Sunday Pictorial newspaper on 23 February 1958. He claimed to have carried out the robbery with two other men, although when discrepancies with a contemporaneous report in the Birmingham Post newspaper (the crime pre-dated written police reports) in his account of the means of entry and other items stolen, detectives decided there was no realistic possibility of a conviction and the case was closed. Burge claimed the cup had been melted down to make counterfeit half-crown coins, which matched known intelligence of the time, in which stolen silver was being used to forge coins which were then laundered through betting shops at a local racecourse, although Burge had no history of forgery in a record of 42 previous convictions for which he had spent 42 years in prison. He had been further imprisoned in 1957 for seven years for theft from cars. Released in 1961, he died in 1964.[55] After the theft, a replica of the trophy was made, which was used until a redesign of the trophy in 1911. The 1895 replica was then presented to the FA's long-serving president Lord Kinnaird.[46] Kinnaird died in 1923, and his family kept it in their possession, out of view, until putting it up for auction in 2005.[56] It was sold at Christie's auction house on 19 May 2005 for ¬£420,000 (¬£478,400 including auction fees and taxes).[46] The sale price set a new world record for a piece of football memorabilia, surpassing the ¬£254,000 paid for the Jules Rimet World Cup Trophy in 1997.[47] The successful bidder was David Gold, the then joint chairman of Birmingham City; claiming the FA and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country, Gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation.[47] Accordingly, Gold presented the trophy to the National Football Museum in Preston on 20 April 2006, where it went on immediate public display.[56] It later moved with the museum to its new location in Manchester.[46] In November 2012, it was ceremonially presented to Royal Engineers, after they beat Wanderers 7‚Äì1 in a charity replay of the first FA Cup final. In September 2020, Gold sold the replica trophy for ¬£760,000 through the Bonhams auction house.[57] In January 2021, it was revealed that the trophy had been purchased by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the owner of Manchester City, who stated that it would be returned on loan to the National Football Museum.[58] The redesigned trophy first used in 1911 was larger at 61.5 cm (24.2 inches) high, and was designed and manufactured by Fattorini & Sons of Bradford, coincidentally being won by Bradford City in its first outing.[45][46] On the 27 March 2016 episode of the BBC television programme Antiques Roadshow, this trophy was valued at ¬£1 million by expert Alastair Dickenson, although he suggested that, due to the design featuring depictions of grapes and vines, it may not have been specifically produced for the FA, but was instead an off-the-shelf design originally meant to be a wine or champagne cooler.[46] This was later disproved when Thomas Fattorini was invited to the Antiques Roadshow to \"ambush\" Alastair Dickenson with the competition winning design by Fattorini & Sons. The show was filmed at Baddesley Clinton and subsequently aired on 23 October 2016. A smaller but otherwise identical replica was also made by the company Thomas Fattorini for the North Wales Coast FA Cup trophy which is contested annually by members of that regional Association.[59] The 1992 replica was made by Toye, Kenning and Spencer.[60] A copy of this trophy was also produced, in case anything happened to the primary trophy.[61] The 2014 replica was made by Thomas Lyte, handcrafted in sterling 925 silver over 250 hours. A weight increase for greater durability has taken it to 6.3 kilograms (14 lb).[45] Each club in the final receives 40 winners or runners-up medals to be distributed among players, staff and officials. The traditional styles of gold-cased medals ‚Äì the winners' medal, which had remained largely unchanged since the 1890s, and runners-up medals, which were last updated in 1946 ‚Äì were replaced for the 2021 final by new designs of gold winners' medals and silver runners-up medals suspended on a ribbon.[62] Since the start of the 1994‚Äì95 season, the FA Cup has been sponsored. However, to protect the identity of the competition, the sponsored name has always included 'The FA Cup' in addition to the sponsor's name, unlike sponsorship deals for the League Cup where the word 'cup' is preceded by only the sponsor's name. Sponsorship deals run for four years, though ‚Äì as in the case of E.ON ‚Äì one-year extensions may be agreed. Emirates Airline has been the sponsor since 2015, initially renaming the competition as 'The Emirates FA Cup', unlike previous editions, which included 'The FA Cup in association with E.ON' and 'The FA Cup with Budweiser'.[63] The Emirates sponsorship deal, originally scheduled to terminate in 2018, was later extended three times until 2021, 2024, 2028.[64] From 2006 to 2013, Umbro supplied match balls for all FA Cup matches. They were replaced at the start of the 2013‚Äì14 season by Nike, who produced the competition's official match ball for five seasons. Mitre took over for the 2018‚Äì19 season, beginning a three-year partnership with the FA.[71] The possibility of unlikely victories in the earlier rounds of the competition, where lower ranked teams beat higher placed opposition in what is known as a \"giant killing\", is much anticipated by the public. Such upsets are considered an integral part of the tradition and prestige of the competition, and the attention gained by giant-killing teams can be as great as that for winners of the cup.[79] Almost every club in the League Pyramid has a fondly remembered giant-killing act in its history.[80] It is considered particularly newsworthy when a top Premier League team suffers an upset defeat, or where the giant-killer is a non-league club, i.e. from outside The Football League. One analysis of four years of FA Cup results showed that it was 99.85 per cent likely that at least one team would beat one from its next higher division in a given year. The probability drops to 48.8 per cent for a two-division gap, and 39.28 per cent for a three-division gap.[80] The Football League was founded in 1888, 16 years after the first FA Cup competition. Before its establishment as the dominant football competition in England, teams from rival leagues did make the final of the FA Cup. The Wednesday (later Sheffield Wednesday) in 1890 reached the final as a member of the Football Alliance, two years before that competition merged with the Football League.[81] Later, with the Football League predominantly in the North and Midlands of England, leading clubs of the Southern Football League were of a level with Football League teams, and in 1901 Southern League members Tottenham Hotspur became the only non-League side to win the Cup,[82] while fellow Southern League team Southampton were losing finalists in 1900 and 1902. In 1920‚Äì21, the Football League expanded to incorporate teams from the Southern League's first division, and the following year it added a further division consisting of leading northern and midlands clubs. This consolidated the Football League's position as the leading competition in English football, and established the hierarchy in which non-League clubs in the English football league system competing in the FA Cup would face Football League teams as clear underdogs. Since the expansion of the Football League in 1921, the best performance of a team from outside the Football League was National League side Lincoln City's run to the quarter-finals of the 2016‚Äì17 FA Cup, during which they defeated Championship side Brighton 3‚Äì1 in the fourth round and Premier League side Burnley 1‚Äì0 in the fifth, before falling to ultimate Cup champions Arsenal 5‚Äì0 at the Emirates. Lincoln's defeat of Burnley was only the third (and most recent) FA Cup victory for a non-league team over a top-flight side since 1989.[83] Giant-killings can also be applied where the defeated team is from lower down the Football League, particularly where the defeated club is very notable or the winning team particularly obscure. Liverpool, having already won five league titles in their history, were in the Second Division in 1959 when they lost 2‚Äì1 to Worcester City of the Southern League.[84] The best-known non-league giant-killing came in the 1971‚Äì72 FA Cup, when non-league Hereford United defeated First Division Newcastle United.[85] Hereford were trailing 1‚Äì0 with less than seven minutes left in the Third round proper replay, when Hereford's Ronnie Radford scored the equaliser ‚Äì a goal still shown regularly when FA Cup fixtures are broadcast.[86] Hereford finished the shocking comeback by defeating Newcastle 2‚Äì1 in the match. They finished that season as runners-up of the Southern League, behind Chelmsford City, and were voted into the Football League at the expense of Barrow. Some small clubs gain a reputation for being \"cup specialists\" after two or more giant killing feats within a few years.[80] Yeovil Town hold the record for the most victories over league opposition as a non-league team, having recorded 20 wins through the years before they achieved promotion into The Football League in 2003.[87] The record for a club which has never entered the Football League is held by Altrincham, with 17 wins against league teams. For non-League teams, reaching the third round proper ‚Äì where all Level 1 sides now enter ‚Äì is considered a major achievement. In the 2008‚Äì09 FA Cup, a record eight non-League teams achieved this feat.[88] As of the 2023‚Äì24 season, only eleven non-League teams have reached the fifth round proper (last 16) since 1925,[89] and only Lincoln City have progressed to the quarter-finals (last 8), during the 2016‚Äì17 edition of the tournament.[90] Chasetown, while playing at Level 8 of English football during the 2007‚Äì08 competition, were the lowest-ranked team to ever play in the third round proper (final 64, of 731 teams entered that season). Chasetown was then a member of the Southern League Division One Midlands (a lower level within the Southern Football League), when they lost to Football League Championship (Level 2) team Cardiff City, the eventual FA Cup runners-up that year.[91] Their success earned the lowly organisation over ¬£60,000 in prize money. Marine matched this in the 2020‚Äì21 competition as a member of the Northern Premier League Division One North West, and were drawn against Premier League (Level 1) team Tottenham Hotspur, to whom they lost 5‚Äì0. During the 2023‚Äì24 season, Maidstone United in the National League South (Level 6) had an 8‚Äìgame cup run, reaching the fifth round when they won 2‚Äì1 away at EFL Championship (Level 2) side Ipswich Town.[92] Their run ended at the fifth round after losing 5‚Äì0 away to another EFL Championship side Coventry City.[93] They became the eleventh non‚ÄìLeague team to reach the fifth round, and the lowest-ranked team to do so since Blyth Spartans (Level 7) in 1977‚Äì78. Maidstone's co‚Äìowner Oliver Ash stated that their cup run had earned the club 'something like ¬£700,000 before tax'.[94] Giant-killings can apply to matches between league clubs, particularly where teams from tier 4 have defeated tier 1 sides. In games between League sides, one of the most notable results was the 1992 victory by Wrexham, bottom of the previous season's League (avoiding relegation due to expansion of The Football League), over reigning champions Arsenal. Another similar shock was when Shrewsbury Town beat Everton 2‚Äì1 in 2003. Everton finished seventh in the Premier League and Shrewsbury Town were relegated to the Football Conference that same season. During the 2022‚Äì23 tournament, Grimsby Town who were 16th in EFL League Two won 2‚Äì1 away at Premier League side Southampton to advance into the quarter finals.[95] Since its establishment, the FA Cup has been won by 44 clubs. Teams shown in italics are no longer in existence. Additionally, Queen's Park ceased to be eligible to enter the FA Cup after a Scottish Football Association ruling in 1887.[96] Four clubs have won consecutive FA Cups on more than one occasion: Wanderers (1872, 1873 and 1876, 1877, 1878), Blackburn Rovers (1884, 1885, 1886 and 1890, 1891), Tottenham Hotspur (1961, 1962 and 1981, 1982) and Arsenal (2002, 2003 and 2014, 2015). The record for most titles for a manager is held by Ars√®ne Wenger, who won the FA Cup with Arsenal seven times (1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2014, 2015, 2017). Wenger is also the only manager to have won the Cup at the old Wembley Stadium, the Millennium Stadium, and the new Wembley Stadium. Manchester City (2019) are the only club to have achieved a domestic treble of league, FA Cup and League Cup, having beaten Chelsea 4‚Äì3 on penalties in the League Cup Final, finished at the top of the Premier League, and beaten Watford 6‚Äì0 in the FA Cup Final. Manchester United (1999) and Manchester City (2023) are the only two English teams to have won the continental treble of league, FA Cup, and Champions League. They are two of only nine European sides to do so. Liverpool won the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup in (2001) to complete a cup treble. Eight clubs have won the FA Cup as part of a league and cup double, namely Preston North End (1889), Aston Villa (1897), Tottenham Hotspur (1961), Arsenal (1971, 1998, 2002), Liverpool (1986), Manchester United (1994, 1996, 1999), Chelsea (2010) and Manchester City (2019, 2023). In 1993, Arsenal became the first side to win both the FA Cup and the League Cup in the same season when they beat Sheffield Wednesday in both finals. Liverpool (2001, 2022), Chelsea (2007) and Manchester City (2019) have since repeated this feat. In 2012, Chelsea won both the FA Cup and the Champions League. The FA Cup has only been won by a non-English team once. Cardiff City achieved this in 1927 when they beat Arsenal in the final at Wembley. They had previously made it to the final only to lose to Sheffield United in 1925 and lost another final to Portsmouth in 2008. Cardiff City are also the only team to win the national cups of two countries in the same season, having also won the Welsh Cup in 1927. The Scottish team Queen's Park reached and lost the final in both 1884 and 1885. Since the creation of the Football League in 1888, the final has never been contested by two teams from outside the top division, and there have only been eight winners who were not in the top flight: Notts County (1894); Tottenham Hotspur (1901); Wolverhampton Wanderers (1908); Barnsley (1912); West Bromwich Albion (1931); Sunderland (1973), Southampton (1976) and West Ham United (1980). With the exception of Tottenham, these clubs were all playing in the second tier (the old Second Division) ‚Äì Tottenham were playing in the Southern League and were only elected to the Football League in 1908, meaning they are the only non-League winners of the FA Cup since the League's creation. Other than Tottenham's victory, only 24 finalists have come from outside English football's top tier, with a record of 7 wins and 17 runners-up: and none at all from the third tier or lower, Southampton (1902, then in the Southern League) being the last finalist from outside the top two tiers. Sunderland's win in 1973 was considered a major upset, having beaten Leeds United who finished third in the top flight that season,[98] as was West Ham's victory over Arsenal in 1980 as the Gunners were in their third successive FA Cup Final and were the cup holders and just having finished 4th in the First Division, whereas West Ham had ended the season 7th in Division 2. This also marked the last time (as of 2023‚Äì24) a team from outside the top division won the FA Cup. Uniquely, in 2008 three of the four semi-finalists (Barnsley, Cardiff City and West Bromwich) were from outside the top division, although the eventual winner was the last remaining top-flight team, Portsmouth.[99] West Bromwich (1931) are the only team to have won the FA Cup and earned promotion to the top flight in the same season; whereas Wigan Athletic (2013) are the only team to have won the Cup and been relegated from the top flight in the same season. The FA Cup Final is one of 10 events reserved for live broadcast on UK terrestrial television under the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events. In the early years of coverage the BBC had exclusive radio coverage with a picture of the pitch marked in the Radio Times with numbered squares to help the listener follow the match on the radio. The first FA Cup Final on Radio was in 1926 between Bolton Wanderers and Manchester City but this was only broadcast in Manchester, the first national final on BBC Radio was between Arsenal and Cardiff City in 1927. The first final on BBC Television was in 1937 in a match which featured Sunderland and Preston North End but this was not televised in full. The following season's final between Preston and Huddersfield Town was covered in full by the BBC. When ITV was formed in 1955 they shared final coverage with the BBC in one of the only club matches shown live on television, during the 1970s and 1980s coverage became more elaborate with BBC and ITV trying to steal viewers from the others by starting coverage earlier and earlier some starting as early as 9 a.m. which was six hours before kick off. The sharing of rights between BBC and ITV continued from 1955 to 1988, when ITV lost coverage to the BBC. From 1988 to 1997, the BBC was the exclusive broadcaster of the competition on terrestrial television and covered the competition from the third round onwards, showing one live match per round alongside highlights. In 1990, British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) obtained rights to the competition, and showed a live match from rounds 1 and 2. This continued to be the case after Sky took over BSB in 1991. From 1997 to 2001, Sky owned the coverage showing one match per round, with the free-to-air rights sublicensed to ITV who showed an additional match from the third round onwards.[100]: 44 The BBC continued with highlights on Match of the Day. From 2001 to 2008, BBC and Sky again shared coverage with BBC having two or three matches per round and Sky having one or two. Until the 2008‚Äì09 season, the BBC and Sky Sports shared television coverage, with the BBC showing three matches in the earlier rounds. Some analysts argued the decision to move away from the Sky and, in particular, the BBC undermined the FA Cup in the eyes of the public. From 2008‚Äì09 to 2013‚Äì14, FA Cup matches were shown live by ITV across England and Wales, with UTV broadcasting to Northern Ireland. Scottish member STV refused to show them, and instead the regularly advertised programming that otherwise would mostly have been shown across the UK (new and repeated network entertainment and drama content, films, local productions etc.) would continue as normal in a delayed or exclusive fashion while the rest of the ITV network aired the football. ITV showed 16 FA Cup games per season, including the first pick of live matches from each of the first to sixth rounds of the competition, plus one semi-final exclusively live. The final was also shown live on ITV. Under the same 2008 contract, Setanta Sports showed three games and one replay in each round from round three to five, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final. The channel also broadcast ITV's matches, albeit with their own commentary teams, exclusively to Scotland, after STV's decision to replace the games with regular programming. Setanta entered administration in June 2009 and as a result the FA terminated Setanta's deal to broadcast FA-sanctioned competitions and England internationals.[101] The early rounds of the 2008‚Äì09 competition were covered for the first time by ITV's online service, ITV Local. The first match of the competition, between Wantage Town and Brading Town, was broadcast live online. Highlights of eight games of each round were broadcast as catch up on ITV Local.[102][103] Since ITV Local closed, this coverage did not continue. As a result of Setanta going out of business ITV showed the competition exclusively in the 2009‚Äì10 season with between three and four matches per round, all quarter finals, semi-finals and final live as the FA could not find a pay TV broadcaster in time. Many expected BSkyB to make a bid to show some of the remaining FA Cup games for the remainder of the 2009‚Äì10 season which would include a semi-final and shared rights to the final. In October 2009, The FA announced that ITV would show an additional match in the First and second rounds on ITV, with one replay match shown on ITV4. One match and one replay match from the first two rounds will broadcast on The FA website for free, in a similar situation to the 2010 World Cup Qualifier between Ukraine and England.[104] The 2009‚Äì10 first-round match between Oldham Athletic and Leeds United was the first FA Cup match to be streamed online live.[105] ESPN bought the competition for the 2010‚Äì11 to 2012‚Äì13 season and during this time Rebecca Lowe became the first woman to host the FA Cup Final in the UK. ESPN took over the package Setanta held for the FA Cup from the 2010‚Äì11 season.[106] The 2011 final was also shown live on Sky 3D in addition to ESPN (who provided the 3D coverage for Sky 3D) and ITV.[107] Following the sale of ESPN's UK and Ireland channels to BT, ESPN's rights package transferred to BT Sport from the 2013‚Äì14 season.[108] STV would continue to broadcast regular programming in place of FA Cup games, live draws and highlights shows throughout this period, although it did the broadcast the 2014 final live. ITV lost the rights to the FA Cup beginning with the 2014‚Äì15 FA Cup, terrestrial rights returned to BBC Sport, with the final being shown on BBC One while BT Sport hold the pay TV rights. Under this deal, the BBC will show around the same number of games as ITV and still having the first pick for each round.[109] Matches involving Welsh clubs are sometimes exclusively broadcast on Welsh language channel S4C, which is also available to view across the rest of the United Kingdom on satellite and cable television, and through the channel's website.[110] A similar arrangement is shared with BBC Cymru Wales when the corporation obtained the rights from 2014 to 2015, potentially giving the BBC an extra match per round.[111] On 23 May 2019, it was announced that ITV would replace BT Sport in broadcasting the FA Cup from the 2021‚Äì22 season, this new deal will see BBC and ITV become joint broadcasters of the tournament for the first time since 1988, this will mean for the first time that all FA Cup matches would all be exclusively broadcast on free-to-air television.[112] In addition, full coverage of the tournament returned to STV in Scotland, after the broadcaster replaced content from the competition with regular network programmes (and local content made in Scotland, plus films and specials) during the 2008 to 2014 period that ITV last held the rights. BBC Radio 5 Live and Talksport provides radio coverage including several full live commentaries per round, with additional commentaries broadcast on BBC Local Radio.",

                "title": "Australian Open - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Australian Open is a tennis tournament organised by Tennis Australia annually at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It is chronologically the first of the four Grand Slam tennis events every year, held before the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. The Australian Open typically starts around the middle of January and continues for two weeks, overlapping with the Australia Day holiday on January 26.[d] It features men's and women's singles, men's, women's, and mixed doubles, juniors‚Äô championships, wheelchair, legends, and exhibition events. Until 1987, it was played on grass courts, but since then three types of hardcourt surfaces have been used: green-coloured Rebound Ace up to 2007 and blue Plexicushion from 2008 to 2019. Since 2020, it has been played on blue GreenSet.[1] First held in 1905 as the Australasian championships, the Australian Open has grown to become one of the biggest sporting events in the Southern Hemisphere.[2] Nicknamed \"the happy slam\",[3] the Australian Open is the highest attended Grand Slam event, with more than 1,100,000 people attending the 2024 tournament, including qualifying. It was also the first Grand Slam tournament to feature indoor play during wet weather or extreme heat with its three primary courts, Rod Laver Arena, John Cain Arena and the refurbished Margaret Court Arena equipped with retractable roofs. The Australian Open is known for its fast-paced and aggressive style of play. The tournament has been held at the Melbourne Park complex since 1988 and is a major contributor to the Victorian economy; the 2020 Australian Open injected $387.7 million into the state's economy, while over the preceding decade, the Australian Open had contributed more than $2.71 billion in economic benefits to Victoria and generated 1775 jobs for the state, with these jobs being predominantly in the accommodation, hotels, caf√©s and trade services sectors.[4] The Australian Open is managed by Tennis Australia, formerly the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia (LTAA), and was first played at the Warehouseman's Cricket Ground in Melbourne in November 1905. The facility, now known as the Albert Reserve Tennis Centre, was a grass court.[5] The tournament was first known as the Australasian Championships. It became the Australian Championships in 1927. Then, in 1969, it became the Australian Open.[6] Since 1905, it has been staged 110 times in five Australian cities: Melbourne (66 times), Sydney (17 times), Adelaide (15 times), Brisbane (7 times), Perth (3 times), and two New Zealand cities: Christchurch (1906) and Hastings (1912).[6] Although it began in 1905, the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) did not designate it a major championship until 1924, following a meeting held in 1923. The tournament committee changed the tournament structure to include seeding at that time.[7] In the period of 1916‚Äì1918, no tournament was organised due to World War I.[8] During World War II, the tournament was not held from 1941 to 1945.[9] In 1972, it was decided to stage the tournament in Melbourne each year because it attracted the biggest patronage of any Australian city.[5] The tournament was played at the Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club from 1972 until its move to the new Flinders Park complex in 1988. The new facilities at Flinders Park were envisaged to meet the demands of a tournament that had outgrown Kooyong's capacity. The move to Flinders Park was an immediate success, with a 90 percent increase in attendance in 1988 (266,436) on the previous year at Kooyong (140,000).[10] Because of Australia's geographic remoteness, very few foreign players entered this tournament in the early 20th century. In the 1920s, the trip by ship from Europe to Australia took about 45 days. The first tennis players who came by boat were the US Davis Cup players in November 1946.[10] Even inside Australia, many players could not travel easily. When the tournament was held in Perth, no one from Victoria or New South Wales crossed by train, a distance of about 3,000 kilometres (1,900 mi) between the East and West coasts. In Christchurch in 1906, of a small field of 10 players, only two Australians attended and the tournament was won by a New Zealander.[11] The first tournaments of the Australasian Championships suffered from the competition of the other Australasian tournaments. Before 1905, all Australian states, and New Zealand, had their own championships; the first being organised in 1880 in Melbourne and called the Championship of the Colony of Victoria (later the Championship of Victoria).[12] In those years, the best two players ‚Äì Australian Norman Brookes (whose name is now written on the men's singles cup) and New Zealander Anthony Wilding ‚Äì almost did not play this tournament. Brookes took part once and won in 1911, and Wilding entered and won the competition twice (1906 and 1909). Their meetings in the Victorian Championships (or at Wimbledon) helped to determine the best Australasian players. Even when the Australasian Championships were held in Hastings, New Zealand, in 1912, Wilding, though three times Wimbledon champion, did not come back to his home country. It was a recurring problem for all players of the era. Brookes went to Europe only three times, where he reached the Wimbledon Challenge Round once and then won Wimbledon twice. Thus, many players had never played the Austral(as)ian amateur or open championships: the Doherty brothers, William Larned, Maurice McLoughlin, Beals Wright, Bill Johnston, Bill Tilden, Ren√© Lacoste, Henri Cochet, Bobby Riggs, Jack Kramer, Ted Schroeder, Pancho Gonzales, Budge Patty, and others, while Brookes, Ellsworth Vines, Jaroslav Drobn√Ω, came just once. Even in the 1960s and 1970s, when travel was less difficult, leading players such as Manuel Santana, Jan Kode≈°, Manuel Orantes, Ilie NƒÉstase (who only came once, when 35 years old) and Bj√∂rn Borg came rarely or not at all. Beginning in 1969, when the first Australian Open was held on the Milton Courts at Brisbane, the tournament was open to all players, including professionals who were not allowed to play the traditional circuit.[13] Nevertheless, except for the 1969 and 1971 tournaments, many of the best players missed this championship until 1982, because of the remoteness, the inconvenient dates (around Christmas and New Year's Day) and the low prize money. In 1970, George MacCall's National Tennis League, which employed Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Andr√©s Gimeno, Pancho Gonzales, Roy Emerson and Fred Stolle, prevented its players from entering the tournament because the guarantees were insufficient. The tournament was won by Arthur Ashe.[14] In 1983, Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and Mats Wilander entered the tournament. Wilander won the singles title[15] and both his Davis Cup singles rubbers in the Swedish loss to Australia at Kooyong shortly after.[16] Following the 1983 Australian Open, the International Tennis Federation prompted the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia to change the site of the tournament, because the Kooyong stadium was then inappropriate to serve such a big event. In 1988 the tournament was first held at Flinders Park (later renamed Melbourne Park).[17] The change of the venue also led to a change of the court surface from grass to a hard court surface known as Rebound Ace.[18] Mats Wilander was the only player to win the tournament on both grass and hard courts. In 2008, after being used for 20 years, the Rebound Ace was replaced by a cushioned, medium-paced,[19] acrylic surface known as Plexicushion Prestige. Roger Federer and Serena Williams are the only players to win the Australian Open on both Rebound Ace and Plexicushion Prestige. The main benefits of the new surface are better consistency and less retention of heat because of a thinner top layer.[18] This change was accompanied by changes in the surfaces of all lead-up tournaments to the Australian Open. The change was controversial because of the new surface's similarity to DecoTurf, the surface used by the US Open.[20] Before the Melbourne Park stadium era, tournament dates fluctuated as well, in particular in the early years because of the climate of each site or exceptional events. For example, the 1919 tournament was held in January 1920 (the 1920 tournament was played in March) and the 1923 tournament in Brisbane took place in August when the weather was not too hot and wet. After a first 1977 tournament was held in December 1976 ‚Äì January 1977, the organisers chose to move the next tournament forward a few days, then a second 1977 tournament was played (ended on 31 December), but this failed to attract the best players. From 1982 to 1985, the tournament was played in mid-December. Then it was decided to move the next tournament to mid-January (January 1987), which meant no tournament was organised in 1986. Since 1987, the Australian Open date has not changed (except for 2021, when it was postponed by three weeks to February due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Some top players, including Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, have said in the past that the tournament is held too soon after the Christmas and New Year holidays, and expressed a desire to consider shifting the tournament to February.[21] Such a change, however, would move the tournament outside Australia's summer school holiday period, potentially impacting attendance figures. Prior to 1996, the Australian Open rewarded fewer ATP rankings points than the other three Grand Slam tournaments. The reason cited by the ATP was the prize money offered by the Australian Open was far less than the other three majors.[22] New South Wales and overseas authorities proposed becoming the new hosts of the tournament in 2008, though such a move never materialised.[23][24] In any case, it was around this time the Melbourne Park precinct commenced upgrades which enhanced facilities for players and spectators.[25] Notably a retractable roof was placed over Margaret Court Arena, making the Open the first of the four Grand Slams to have retractable roofs available on three of their main courts.[26] The player and administrative facilities, as well as access points for spectators, were improved and the tournament site expanded its footprint out of Melbourne Park into nearby Birrarung Marr.[27] A fourth major show court, seating 5,000 people was completed in late 2021, along with the rest of decade-long redevelopment, which included the Centrepiece ballroom, function and media building, as well as other upgraded facilities for players, administrators and spectators.[28] In December 2018, tournament organisers announced the Australian Open would follow the examples set by Wimbledon and the US Open and introduce tie-breaks in the final sets of men's and women's singles matches. Unlike Wimbledon and the US Open, which initiated conventional tie-breaks at 12‚Äì12 games and 6‚Äì6 games respectively, the Australian Open utilises a first to 10 points breaker at 6 games all.[29] In 2020, the tournament organisers decided to replace the official court manufacturer to GreenSet, though retained the iconic blue cushioned acrylic hardcourt.[30] In 2021, in an effort to reduce the number of staff on-site due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all matches used electronic line judging. It marked the first-ever Grand Slam tournament to exclusively use electronic line judging; the 2020 US Open used it for matches outside of the two main stadium courts.[31][32] The Australian Open produced a range of NFTs in 2022.[33][34] Starting in 2024, the Australian Open began on a Sunday, one day earlier than usual. Day sessions on Rod Laver Arena and Margaret Court Arena featured a minimum of two matches (down from three) in an effort to reduce the possibility of matches finishing in the early hours of the following morning. The Australian Open is played at Melbourne Park, which is located in the Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Precinct; the event moved to this site in 1988. Currently three of the courts have retractable roofs, allowing play to continue during rain and extreme heat. As of 2017, spectators can also observe play at Show Courts 2 and 3, which have capacities of 3,000 each,[35] as well as at Courts 4‚Äì15, 19 and 20 with the aid of temporary seating grandstands of capacity anywhere from 50 to 2,500.[36] Construction of a new 5,000 seat capacity stadium began in 2019 as part of a $271 million redevelopment of the precinct.[37] The new stadium, Kia Arena, was unveiled by Australian Open officials on 22 November 2021.[38][28] From 2008 to 2019, all of the courts used during the Australian Open were hard courts with Plexicushion acrylic surfaces (though Melbourne Park does have eight practice clay courts which are not used for the tournament). This replaced the Rebound Ace surface used from the opening of Melbourne Park. The ITF rated the surface's speed as medium.[39] Since 2020, the courts have used a GreenSet surface. Ranking points for the men (ATP) and women (WTA) have varied at the Australian Open through the years but presently players receive the following points: The prize money awarded in the men's and women's singles tournaments is distributed equally. The total prize money for the 2024 tournament in Australian dollars is AUD $86,500,000.[45] The prize money distribution is as follows:[e] The names of the tournament winners are inscribed on the perpetual trophy cups. In 2013 ABC Bullion, a Pallion company, was awarded the rights to make the Cups. The cups are produced by W. J. Sanders a sister division within Pallion and takes over 250 hours to produce.[46][47][48] From 1973 to 2018, the Seven Network served as the host broadcaster of the Australian Open. In March 2018, it was announced that the Nine Network had acquired the rights to the tournament beginning in 2020, for a period of five years. The network later bought the rights for the 2019 tournament as well.[53] The Open's broadcast rights are lucrative in the country, as it occurs near the end of the Summer non-ratings season ‚Äî which gives its broadcaster opportunities to promote their upcoming programming lineup.[54][55] As of 2022, Nine has extended its rights to the Australian Open until 2029.[56] In Europe the tournament is broadcast on Eurosport. Other broadcasters in the region have included the BBC in the United Kingdom, SRG in Switzerland, NOS in Netherlands and RTS in Serbia. In the United Kingdom, the BBC dropped its live coverage of the 2016 tournament just a month before the start due to budget cuts, leaving Eurosport as the exclusive live broadcaster.[57] Elsewhere, beIN Sports broadcasts it into the Middle East and northern Africa, and SuperSport in sub-Sahara Africa. In the United States, the tournament is broadcast on ESPN2, ESPN3 and the Tennis Channel, with limited highlights airing on ABC.[58][59] The championship matches are televised live on ESPN. While it is broadcast on ESPN International in Central and Latin America. It is broadcast on TSN in Canada. In the Asia‚ÄìPacific region, the tournament is broadcast on five television networks in China, including national broadcaster CCTV, provincial networks Beijing TV, Shanghai Dragon TV and Guangdong TV and English language Star Sports, as well as online on iQIYI Sports. Elsewhere in the region, it is broadcast in Japan by national broadcaster NHK, and pay-TV network Wowow. In the Indian subcontinent, Sony Six has broadcast since 2015 and, in the rest of Asia, it is broadcast on Fox Sports Asia until the network's shutdown in 2021 and the rights is acquired by beIN Sports from 2022 except for Vietnam which will be broadcast on K+.[60][61] The Australian Open is the most attended Grand Slam tournament.[62] The tournament in 2024 set a new attendance record of 1,110,657 while the single-day attendance record is 94,854, recorded on the 21 January 2023.[62] The following record of attendance begins in 1987, when the tournament moved from being held in December to in January (the immediate preceding tournament was December 1985). 1987 was the last year that the Kooyong Tennis Club hosted the tournament; since 1988 it has been held at Melbourne Park. The average growth rate over the period covered below is more than 7%. Note that these figures include attendances for the week of qualifying and pre-main tournament events.",

The LA wildfires are poised to become one of the costliest natural disasters in US history, with estimated losses already surpassing $135 billion. The total losses could reach as high as $150 billion, making it one of the most expensive wildfires the country has ever seen, BBC has reported. Though wildfires occur naturally, scientists claim that human-caused climate change is altering weather and changing the dynamics of the blazes. Two wet years in Southern California have given way to a very dry one, leaving ample fuel dry and primed to burn.

                "content": "Rory Callum Sykes, former Kiddy Kapers actor, died of carbon monoxide poisoning at his family‚Äôs estate in Malibu Copy link twitter facebook whatsapp email Copy link twitter facebook whatsapp email A British former child star has died in the wildfires tearing through Los Angeles. Rory Callum Sykes, who appeared on the TV programme Kiddy Kapers in the 1990s, died of carbon monoxide poisoning at his family‚Äôs estate in Malibu on Wednesday, his mother said. Shelley Sykes said she attempted to save her 32-year-old son, who was born with cerebral palsy, by putting out the flames on his cottage, but found that their water had been turned off. She rushed off to get help from the local fire department, but returned to find the cottage had been destroyed. ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòMom leave me‚Äô and no mom can leave their kid. And I‚Äôve got a broken arm, I couldn‚Äôt lift him, I couldn‚Äôt move him,‚Äù Ms Sykes told Australia‚Äôs 10 News First. In a message on social media, she described herself as ‚Äútotally heartbroken‚Äù about the death of her ‚Äúbeautiful son‚Äù. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt put out the cinders on his roof with a hose because the water was switched off by Las Virgenes Municipal Water,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúEven the 50 brave fire fighters had no water all day!‚Äù‚ÄúHe was my baby and he died needlessly,‚Äù she added. Ms Sykes is said to be considering taking legal action over her son‚Äôs death, although it is unclear whether this is against local authorities or the water company. After trying and failing to reach the emergency services on 911, she left her 17-acre estate and drove some 400 metres to find help for the 32-year-old. When she returned to the property accompanied by firefighters, she found the cottage had been burned to the ground. Ms Sykes was later told that her son had died of carbon monoxide poisoning. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want any pain for my baby,‚Äù she told 10 News First through tears. Rory Sykes has reportedly not yet been included in the official death toll from the wildfires, which currently stands at 13. That number is thought likely to rise once cadaver dogs go through the neighbourhoods which have been devastated by the flames. Gavin Newsom, the California governor, has announced an independent investigation after fire hydrants used to tackle the wildfires ran dry this week. Water tanks emptied owing to what officials described as ‚Äútremendous demand‚Äù, while some residents vainly attempted to beat back the flames with water from their swimming pools or garden hoses. Mr Sykes was the host of Kiddy Kapers, a British children‚Äôs TV show filmed in Yorkshire and released in 1998 that involved child actors creating art and watching artists at work. However, he mostly found fame for his speeches on overcoming disability, working with speaker Tony Robbins to discuss overcoming challenges at the age of eight. Later, his mother also wrote a book about her son titled ‚ÄúCallum‚Äôs Cure: a triumph of positive parenting‚Äù. Mr Sykes was also the co-founder of Happy Charity, a nonprofit initiative that, according to its site, offers ‚Äúhope, happiness and health to those that are hurting‚Äù. On his own website, Rory Sykes described himself as a motivational speaker and consultant for organisations including the Cerebral Palsy Alliance and Tony Robbins Foundation.‚Äú[He] was born blind with cerebral palsy and had difficulty walking. He overcame so much with surgeries & therapies to regain his sight & to be able to learn to walk,‚Äù said Ms Sykes in the book about her son‚Äôs recovery. ‚ÄúDespite the pain, he still enthused about travelling the world with me from Africa to Antarctica.‚Äù She continued: ‚ÄúHe will be incredibly missed by [his] mama his pet peacocks Edgee & Mickie & all his online fans around the world.‚Äù Rory Sykes was born in Britain but moved to Sydney in Australia before relocating to Malibu. Appearing with his mother on the Australian TV programme ‚ÄúMornings with Kerri-Anne‚Äù in 2003, he discussed going on a trip to the US to speak at a motivational conference. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter what happens to you in life, it‚Äôs what you do about it that counts,‚Äù he told viewers. Las Virgenes Municipal Water has been approached for comment by The Telegraph. Copy link twitter facebook whatsapp email",

                "title": "Green Bay Packers - Wikipedia",
                "content": "National Football League (1921‚Äìpresent) The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Packers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) North division. They are the third-oldest franchise in the NFL, established in 1919,[11][12] and are the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team based in the United States.[a][13] Since 1957, home games have been played at Lambeau Field. They hold the record for the most wins in NFL history.[14][15] The Packers are the last of the \"small-town teams\" that were common in the NFL during the league's early days of the 1920s and 1930s.[16] Founded in 1919 by Earl \"Curly\" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun, the franchise traces its lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896. Between 1919 and 1920, the Packers competed against other semi-pro clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest, before joining the American Professional Football Association (APFA), the forerunner of today's NFL, in 1921. In 1933, the Packers began playing part of their home slate in Milwaukee until changes at Lambeau Field in 1995 made it more lucrative to stay in Green Bay full-time; Milwaukee is still considered a home media market for the team.[17][18][19] Although Green Bay is the smallest major league professional sports market in North America,[a][20] Forbes ranked the Packers as the world's 27th-most-valuable sports franchise in 2019, with a value of $2.63 billion.[21] The Packers have won 13 league championships, the most in NFL history, with nine pre-Super Bowl NFL titles and four Super Bowl victories. The Packers, under coach Vince Lombardi, won the first two Super Bowls in 1966 and 1967; they were the only NFL team to defeat the American Football League (AFL) before the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger. After Lombardi retired, the Super Bowl trophy was named for him, but the team struggled through the 1970s and 1980s. Since 1993, the team has enjoyed much regular-season success, making the playoffs 23 times and winning two Super Bowls in 1996 under head coach Mike Holmgren and 2010 under head coach Mike McCarthy.[22][23] The Packers have the most wins (826) and the second-highest win‚Äìloss record (.571) in NFL history, including both regular season and playoff games.[24][25][26] The Packers are longstanding adversaries of the Chicago Bears, Minnesota Vikings, and Detroit Lions, who today form the NFL's NFC North division (formerly known as the NFC Central Division). They have played more than 100 games against each of those teams, and have a winning overall record against all of them, a distinction only shared with the Kansas City Chiefs, Dallas Cowboys, and Miami Dolphins. The Bears‚ÄìPackers rivalry is one of the oldest rivalries in U.S. professional sports history, dating to 1921. The Green Bay Packers were founded on August 11, 1919,[1] by former high-school football rivals Earl \"Curly\" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun.[27] Lambeau solicited funds for uniforms from his employer, the Indian Packing Company, a meat packing company.[28] He was given $500 ($8,800 today) for uniforms and equipment, on the condition that the team be named after its sponsor.[29] The Green Bay Packers have played in their original city longer than any other team in the NFL. On August 27, 1921, the Packers were granted a franchise in the American Professional Football Association, a new national pro football league that had been formed the previous year. The APFA changed its name to the National Football League a year later. Financial troubles plagued the team, and the franchise was forfeited within the year before Lambeau found new financial backers and regained the franchise the next year. These backers, known as \"The Hungry Five\", formed the Green Bay Football Corporation.[30] After a near-miss in 1927, Lambeau's squad claimed the Packers' first NFL title in 1929 with an undefeated 12‚Äì0‚Äì1 campaign, behind a stifling defense which registered eight shutouts.[31] Green Bay would repeat as league champions in 1930 and 1931, bettering teams from New York, Chicago and throughout the league, with all-time greats and future Hall of Famers Mike Michalske, Johnny (Blood) McNally, Cal Hubbard and Green Bay native Arnie Herber.[32][33] Among the many impressive accomplishments of these years was the Packers' streak of 29 consecutive home games without defeat, an NFL record which still stands.[34] The arrival of the end Don Hutson from Alabama in 1935 gave Lambeau and the Packers the most feared and dynamic offensive weapon in the game. Credited with inventing pass patterns, Hutson would lead the league in receptions in eight seasons and spur the Packers to NFL championships in 1936, 1939 and 1944. An Iron Man, Hutson played both ways, leading the league in interceptions as a safety in 1940. Hutson claimed 18 NFL records when he retired in 1945, many of which still stand.[35] In 1951, his number 14 was the first to be retired by the Packers, and he was inducted as a charter member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963.[36][37] After Hutson's retirement, Lambeau could not stop the Packers' slide. He purchased a large lodge near Green Bay for team members and families to live in. Rockwood Lodge was the home of the 1946‚Äì49 Packers. The 1947 and 1948 seasons produced a record of 12‚Äì10‚Äì1, and 1949 was even worse at 3‚Äì9. The lodge burned down on January 24, 1950, and insurance money paid for many of the Packers' debts.[38] Curly Lambeau departed after the 1949 season. Gene Ronzani and Lisle Blackbourn could not coach the Packers back to their former magic, even as a new stadium was unveiled in 1957.[39][40] The losing would descend to the disastrous 1958 campaign under coach Ray \"Scooter\" McLean, whose lone 1‚Äì10‚Äì1 year at the helm is the worst in Packers history.[41] Former New York Giants assistant Vince Lombardi was hired as Packers head coach and general manager on February 2, 1959.[42] Few suspected the hiring represented the beginning of a remarkable, immediate turnaround. Under Lombardi, the Packers would become the team of the 1960s, winning five championships over seven years, including victories in the first two Super Bowls. During the Lombardi era, the stars of the Packers' offense included Bart Starr, Jim Taylor, Carroll Dale, Paul Hornung (as halfback and placekicker), Forrest Gregg, and Jerry Kramer. The defense included Willie Davis, Henry Jordan, Willie Wood, Ray Nitschke, Dave Robinson, and Herb Adderley. The Packers' first regular-season game under Lombardi was on September 27, 1959, a 9‚Äì6 victory over the Chicago Bears in Green Bay. After winning their first three, the Packers lost the next five before finishing strong by sweeping their final four. The 7‚Äì5 record represented the Packers' first winning season since 1947, enough to earn rookie head coach Lombardi the NFL Coach of the Year.[43][44] The next year, the Packers, led by Paul Hornung's 176 points, won the NFL West title and played in the NFL Championship against the Philadelphia Eagles at Philadelphia.[45][46] In a see-saw game, the Packers trailed by only four points when All-Pro Eagle linebacker Chuck Bednarik tackled Jim Taylor just nine yards short of the goal line as time expired.[47] The Packers returned to the NFL Championship game the following season and faced the New York Giants in the first league title game to be played in Green Bay. The Packers scored 24-second-quarter points, including a championship-record 19 by Paul Hornung, on special \"loan\" from the Army (one touchdown, four extra points, and three field goals), powering the Packers to a 37‚Äì0 rout of the Giants, their first NFL Championship since 1944.[48][49] It was in 1961 that Green Bay became known as \"Titletown\".[50] The Packers stormed back in the 1962 season, jumping out to a 10‚Äì0 start on their way to a 13‚Äì1 season.[51] This consistent level of success would lead to Lombardi's Packers becoming one of the most prominent teams of their era, and to be featured as the face of the NFL on the cover of Time on December 21, 1962, as part of the magazine's cover story on \"The Sport of the '60s\".[52] Shortly after Time's article, the Packers faced the Giants in a much more brutal championship game than the previous year, but the Packers prevailed on the kicking of Jerry Kramer and the determined running of Jim Taylor. The Packers defeated the Giants in New York, 16‚Äì7.[53] The 1963 team went 11‚Äì2‚Äì1 but finished second in the NFL West.[54] The 1964 went 8‚Äì5‚Äì1 and finished second in the NFL West.[55] The Packers returned to the championship game in 1965 following a two-year absence when they defeated the Colts in a playoff for the Western Conference title.[56] That game would be remembered for Don Chandler's controversial tying field goal in which the ball allegedly went wide right, but the officials signaled \"good\".[57] The 13‚Äì10 overtime win earned the Packers a trip to the NFL Championship game, where Hornung and Taylor ran through the defending champion Cleveland Browns, helping the Packers win, 23‚Äì12, to earn their third NFL Championship under Lombardi and ninth overall.[58] Goalpost uprights would be made taller the next year.[59] The 1966 season saw the Packers led to the first-ever Super Bowl by MVP quarterback Bart Starr.[60] The team went 12‚Äì2, and as time wound down in the NFL Championship against the Dallas Cowboys, the Packers clung to a 34‚Äì27 lead.[61] Dallas had the ball on the Packers' two-yard line, threatening to tie the ballgame. But on fourth down the Packers' Tom Brown intercepted Don Meredith's pass in the end zone to seal the win.[62] The team crowned its season by rolling over the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs 35‚Äì10 in Super Bowl I.[63] The 1967 season was the last for Lombardi as the Packers' head coach.[64] The NFL Championship game, a rematch of the 1966 contest against Dallas, became indelibly known as the \"Ice Bowl\" as a result of the brutally cold conditions at Lambeau Field.[65] Still the coldest NFL game ever played, it remains one of the most famous football games at any level in the history of the sport.[66] With 16 seconds left, Bart Starr's touchdown on a quarterback sneak brought the Packers a 21‚Äì17 victory and their still unequaled third straight NFL Championship.[67] They then won Super Bowl II with a 33‚Äì14 victory over the Oakland Raiders.[68] Lombardi stepped down as head coach after the game, and Phil Bengtson was named his successor.[69] Lombardi remained as general manager for one season but left in 1969 to become head coach and minority owner of the Washington Redskins.[70] After Lombardi died of cancer on September 3, 1970, the NFL renamed the Super Bowl trophy the Vince Lombardi Trophy in recognition of his accomplishments with the Packers.[71] The city of Green Bay renamed Highland Avenue in his honor in 1968, placing Lambeau Field at 1265 Lombardi Avenue ever since.[72] For about a quarter-century after Lombardi's departure, the Packers had relatively little on-field success. In the 24 seasons from 1968 to 1991, they had only five seasons with a winning record, one being the shortened 1982 strike season.[73][74] They appeared in the playoffs twice, with a 1‚Äì2 record. The period saw five different head coaches‚ÄîPhil Bengtson, Dan Devine, Bart Starr, Forrest Gregg, and Lindy Infante‚Äîtwo of whom, Starr and Gregg, were Lombardi's era stars, while Bengtson was a former Packer coach. Each led the Packers to a worse record than his predecessor. Poor personnel decisions were rife, notoriously the 1974 trade by acting general manager Dan Devine which sent five 1975 or 1976 draft picks (two first-rounders, two-second-rounders and a third) to the Los Angeles Rams for aging quarterback John Hadl, who would spend only 11‚ÅÑ2 seasons in Green Bay.[75] Another came in the 1989 NFL draft, when offensive lineman Tony Mandarich was taken with the second overall pick ahead of future Hall of Fame inductees Barry Sanders, Derrick Thomas, and Deion Sanders.[76] Though rated highly by nearly every professional scout at the time, Mandarich's performance failed to meet expectations, earning him ESPN's ranking as the third \"biggest sports flop\" in the last 25 years.[77] The Packers' performance in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s led to a shakeup, with Ron Wolf hired as general manager and given full control of the team's football operations to start the 1991 season.[78] In 1992, Wolf hired San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Mike Holmgren as the Packers' new head coach.[79] Soon afterward, Wolf acquired quarterback Brett Favre from the Atlanta Falcons for a first-round pick.[80] Favre got the Packers their first win of the 1992 season, stepping in for injured quarterback Don Majkowski and leading a comeback over the Cincinnati Bengals.[81] He started the following week, a win against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and never missed another start for Green Bay through the end of the 2007 season. He would go on to break the record for consecutive starts by an NFL quarterback, starting 297 consecutive games including stints with the New York Jets and Minnesota Vikings with the streak finally coming to an end late in the 2010 season.[82] The Packers had a 9‚Äì7 record in 1992 and began to turn heads around the league when they signed perhaps the most prized free agent in NFL history in Reggie White on the defense in 1993.[83] White believed that Wolf, Holmgren, and Favre had the team heading in the right direction with a \"total commitment to winning\". With White on board, the Packers made it to the second round of the playoffs during both the 1993 and 1994 seasons but lost their 2nd-round matches to their playoff rival, the Dallas Cowboys, playing in Dallas on both occasions.[84][85] In 1995, the Packers won the NFC Central Division championship for the first time since 1972. After a home playoff 37‚Äì20 win against Favre's former team, the Atlanta Falcons, the Packers defeated the defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers 27‚Äì17 in San Francisco on the road to advance to the NFC Championship Game, where they lost again to the Dallas Cowboys 38‚Äì27.[86][87] In 1996, the Packers' turnaround was complete. The team posted a league-best 13‚Äì3 record in the regular season, dominating the competition and securing home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.[88] They were ranked no. 1 in offense with Brett Favre leading the way, no. 1 in defense with Reggie White as the leader of the defense, and no. 1 in special teams with former Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard returning punts and kickoffs for touchdowns.[89] After relatively easy wins against the San Francisco 49ers in a muddy 35‚Äì14 beatdown and Carolina Panthers 30‚Äì13, the Packers advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time in 29 years. In Super Bowl XXXI, Green Bay defeated the New England Patriots 35‚Äì21 to win their 12th championship. Desmond Howard was named MVP of the game for his kickoff return for a touchdown that ended the Patriots' bid for a comeback.[90] Then-Packers president Bob Harlan credited Wolf, Holmgren, Favre, and White for ultimately changing the fortunes of the organization and turning the Green Bay Packers into a model NFL franchise. A 2007 panel of football experts at ESPN ranked the 1996 Packers the 6th-greatest team ever to play in the Super Bowl. The following season the Packers recorded another 13‚Äì3 record and won their second consecutive NFC championship.[91] After defeating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 21‚Äì7 and San Francisco 49ers 23‚Äì10 in the playoffs, the Packers returned to the Super Bowl as an 11‚Å†1/2‚Å† point favorite. The team ended up losing in an upset to John Elway and the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXII, by the score of 31‚Äì24.[92] In 1998, the Packers went 11‚Äì5 and met the San Francisco 49ers in the first round of the NFC playoffs. It was the fourth consecutive year these teams had met in the playoffs and the sixth overall contest since the 1995 season. The Packers had won all previous games, and the media speculated that another 49ers loss would result in the dismissal of San Francisco head coach Steve Mariucci. Unlike the previous playoff matches, this game was hotly contested, with the teams frequently exchanging leads. With 4:19 left in the 4th quarter, Brett Favre and the Packers embarked on an 89-yard drive, which concluded with a Favre touchdown pass to receiver Antonio Freeman. This play appeared to give Green Bay the victory. But San Francisco quarterback Steve Young led the 49ers on an improbable touchdown drive, which culminated when Terrell Owens caught Young's pass between several defenders to give the 49ers a lead with three seconds remaining. Afterward, the game was mired in controversy. Many argued that during the 49ers game-winning drive, Niners receiver Jerry Rice fumbled the ball but officials stated he was down by contact. Television replays confirmed the fumble, but referees were unable to review the play; the next season the NFL reinstituted an instant replay system.[93] In the end, this game turned out to be the end of an era in Green Bay. Days later Mike Holmgren left the Packers to become vice president, general manager, and head coach of the Seattle Seahawks. Much of Holmgren's coaching staff went with him, and Reggie White also retired after the season (but later played one season for the Carolina Panthers in 2000). In 1999, the team struggled to find an identity after the departure of so many of the individuals responsible for their Super Bowl run. Ray Rhodes was hired in 1999 as the team's new head coach.[94] Rhodes had served around the league as a highly regarded defensive coordinator and more recently experienced moderate success as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1995 to 1998. Ron Wolf believed that Rhodes' experience and player-friendly demeanor would fit nicely in Green Bay's veteran locker room, but Rhodes was fired after one 8‚Äì8 season.[95] Wolf visited team practice late in the 1999 season and believed that players had become too comfortable with Rhodes' style, and said the atmosphere resembled a country club. In 2000, Wolf replaced Rhodes with Mike Sherman.[96] Sherman had never been a head coach at any level of football and was relatively unknown in NFL circles. He had only coached in professional football for three years starting as the Packers' tight ends coach in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, he followed Mike Holmgren to Seattle and became the Seahawks' offensive coordinator, although Sherman did not call the plays during games. Despite Sherman's apparent anonymity, Wolf was blown away in the interview process by the coach's organizational skills and attention to detail. Sherman's inaugural season started slowly, but the Packers won their final four games to achieve a 9‚Äì7 record. Brett Favre praised the atmosphere Sherman had cultivated in Green Bay's locker room and fans were optimistic about the team's future. In the offseason, however, Wolf suddenly announced his own resignation as general manager to take effect after the April 2001 draft. Packers' president Bob Harlan was surprised by Wolf's decision and felt unsure of how to replace him. Harlan preferred the structure Green Bay had employed since 1991; a general manager who ran football operations and hired a subservient head coach. But with the momentum and locker room chemistry that was built during the 2000 season, Harlan was reluctant to bring in a new individual with a potentially different philosophy. Wolf recommended that Harlan give the job to Sherman. Though Harlan was wary of the structure in principle, he agreed with Wolf that it was the best solution. In 2001, Sherman assumed the duties of both general manager and head coach. From 2001 to 2004, Sherman coached the Packers to respectable regular-season success, led by the spectacular play of Brett Favre, Ahman Green, and a formidable offensive line. But Sherman's teams faltered in the playoffs. Before 2003, the Packers had never lost a home playoff game since the NFL instituted a post-season in 1933 (they were 13‚Äì0, with 11 of the wins at Lambeau and two more in Milwaukee.). That ended on January 4, 2003, when the Atlanta Falcons defeated the Packers 27‚Äì7 in an NFC Wild Card game. The Packers would also lose at home in the playoffs to the Minnesota Vikings two years later. By the end of the 2004 season, the Packers' team depth appeared to be diminishing. Sherman also seemed overworked and reportedly had trouble communicating with players on the practice field with whom he was also negotiating contracts. Harlan felt the dual roles were too much for one man to handle and removed Sherman from the general manager position in early 2005 while retaining him as a head coach. Harlan hired the Seattle Seahawks' vice president of operations Ted Thompson as the new executive vice president, general manager, and director of football operations. The relationship between Thompson and Sherman appeared strained, as Thompson immediately began rebuilding Green Bay's roster. Following a dismal 4‚Äì12 season, Thompson fired Sherman.[97] In 2006, Thompson hired Mike McCarthy, the former offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers and New Orleans Saints, as his new head coach.[98] McCarthy had also previously served as the quarterbacks coach for the Packers in 1999. In McCarthy's debut year coaching the Packers, the team began the season with a 4‚Äì8 record. Then, Brett Favre sustained injuries, as did the backup quarterback, Aaron Rodgers. Despite the injuries, McCarthy coached the team to four consecutive wins, finishing with an 8‚Äì8 record.[99][100] After missing the playoffs in 2006, Brett Favre announced that he would return for the 2007 season; under McCarthy, it would turn out to be one of his best.[101] The Packers won 10 of their first 11 games and finished 13‚Äì3, earning a first-round bye in the playoffs. That was sufficient to propel McCarthy to secure the best record among active coaches through their first 25 games.[102] The Packers' passing offense, led by Favre and a very skilled wide receiver group, finished second in the NFC, behind the Dallas Cowboys, and third overall in the league. Running back Ryan Grant, acquired for a sixth-round draft pick from the New York Giants, became the featured back in Green Bay and rushed for 956 yards and 8 touchdowns in the final 10 games of the regular season. In the divisional playoff round, in a heavy snowstorm, the Packers beat the Seattle Seahawks 42‚Äì20. Grant rushed for 201 yards and three touchdowns, while Favre tossed an additional three touchdown passes to receiver Donald Driver (as well as a snowball, which Favre memorably threw at Driver in celebration).[103] On January 20, 2008, Green Bay appeared in their first NFC Championship Game in 10 years facing the New York Giants in Green Bay. The game was lost 23‚Äì20 on an overtime field goal by Lawrence Tynes. This would be Brett Favre's final game as a Green Bay Packer with his final pass being an interception in overtime.[104] Mike McCarthy coached the NFC team during the 2008 Pro Bowl in Hawaii. Al Harris and Aaron Kampman were also picked to play for the NFC Pro Bowl team as starters. Donald Driver was named as a third-string wideout on the Pro Bowl roster. Brett Favre was named the first-string quarterback for the NFC, but he declined to play in the Pro Bowl and was replaced on the roster by Tampa Bay quarterback Jeff Garcia. The Packers also had several first alternates, including offensive tackle Chad Clifton and linebacker Nick Barnett. In December 2007, Ted Thompson was signed to a 5-year contract extension with the Packers.[105] In addition, on February 5, 2008, head coach Mike McCarthy signed a 5-year contract extension.[106] On March 4, 2008, Brett Favre announced his retirement.[107] Within five months, however, he filed for reinstatement with the NFL on July 29. Favre's petition was granted by Commissioner Roger Goodell, effective August 4, 2008.[108] On August 6, 2008, it was announced that Brett Favre was traded to the New York Jets for a conditional draft pick in 2009.[109] The Packers began their 2008 season with their 2005 first-round draft pick, quarterback Aaron Rodgers, under center, as the first QB other than Favre to start for the Packers in 16 years. Rodgers played well in his first year starting for the Packers, throwing for over 4,000 yards and 28 touchdowns. However, injuries plagued the Packers' defense, as they lost 7 close games by 4 points or fewer, finishing with a 6‚Äì10 record.[110] After the season, eight assistant coaches were dismissed by the organization, including Bob Sanders, the team's defensive coordinator, who was replaced by Dom Capers.[111] In March 2009, the organization assured fans that Brett Favre's jersey number would be retired, but not during the 2009 season. In April 2009, the Packers selected nose tackle B. J. Raji of Boston College as the team's first pick in the draft. The team then traded three draft picks (including the pick the Packers acquired from the Jets for Brett Favre) for another first-round pick, selecting linebacker Clay Matthews III of the University of Southern California. During the 2009 NFL season, two matchups between the franchise and its former quarterback Brett Favre were highly anticipated after Favre's arrival with the division-rival Vikings in August. The first encounter took place in Week 4, on a Monday Night Football game that broke several TV audience records. The scheduling of this game was made possible when Baseball Commissioner and Packer board of directors member Bud Selig forced baseball's Minnesota Twins to play 2 games within 12 hours. The Vikings won the game 30‚Äì23. Brett Favre threw 3 TDs, no interceptions, and had a passer rating of 135.[112] The teams met for a second time in Week 8, Favre leading the Vikings to a second win, 38‚Äì26, in Green Bay. Rodgers was heavily pressured in both games, being sacked 14 times total, but still played well, throwing five touchdowns and only one interception. The next week, the Packers were upset by the winless Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Following a players-only meeting, the team found some stability on the offensive line with the return of right tackle Mark Tauscher bringing a minor halt to sacks to Rodgers and opening the running game to Ryan Grant and the other running backs. Green Bay finished the season strongly, winning 7 out of their last 8 games, including winning their 16th regular-season finale in the past 17 seasons, and earning an NFC wild-card playoff bid with an 11‚Äì5 regular-season record.[113] The Packers defense was ranked No. 2 and the offense was ranked No. 6 with rookies Brad Jones and Clay Matthews III becoming sensations at linebacker and young players like James Jones, Brandon Jackson, Jermichael Finley and Jordy Nelson becoming threats on offense. Rodgers also became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for at least 4,000 yards in each of his first two seasons as a starter. Also, cornerback Charles Woodson won NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors after recording 9 interceptions, forcing four fumbles, 3 touchdowns, and registering 74 tackles and 2 sacks. In fact, Woodson's 9 interceptions were more than the 8 collected by all Packer opponents that season. Though the defense was ranked high, injuries to Al Harris, Tramon Williams, Will Blackmon, Atari Bigby and Brandon Underwood severely limited the depth of the secondary and teams like the Minnesota Vikings and Pittsburgh Steelers used that to their advantage by unleashing aerial assaults against inexperienced players with the NFL's best receivers. The season ended with an overtime loss in a wild card round shootout at the Arizona Cardinals, 51‚Äì45.[114] It was the second time McCarthy led the Packers to the postseason.[115] While they weren't as successful as their 90s counterparts in the postseason, the 2000s were by no means a dark time for the Packers.[116] The team finished the decade with the 5th highest winning percentage.[117] The team lost Johnny Jolly to a season long suspension after he violated the NFL drug policy.[118] Their running corps suffered a blow when RB Ryan Grant sustained a season ending ankle injury in Week 1.[119] By the end of the season, the team had 16 people on injured reserve, including 7 starters: running back Ryan Grant, tight end Jermichael Finley, inside linebacker Nick Barnett, safety Morgan Burnett, inside linebacker Brandon Chillar, right tackle Mark Tauscher, and outside linebacker Brad Jones. Key injuries didn't stop Mike McCarthy's team from finishing the regular season with a 10‚Äì6 record.[120] In week 7, the team faced the Minnesota Vikings, then led by former Packers quarterback Brett Favre. Green Bay beat Favre's new team 28‚Äì24 when Favre's final pass to Randy Moss in the end zone flew incomplete. In week 17, the Packers clinched their playoff berth with a 10‚Äì3 victory over the Chicago Bears at Lambeau Field, aided in large part by Nick Collins' interception of Jay Cutler's throw that allowed Green Bay to run out the clock.[121][122] The Packers 10‚Äì6 record allowed them to clinch the No. 6 seed in the NFC playoffs. They first faced No. 3 seeded Philadelphia, winning 21‚Äì16. In the Divisional round, they defeated No. 1 seed Atlanta 48‚Äì21. They then played the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field in the NFC Championship Game‚Äîonly the second playoff meeting between the two storied rivals (the other a 33‚Äì14 Chicago victory which sent them to the 1941 NFL Championship Game). McCarthy's Packers won 21‚Äì14 to move on to Super Bowl XLV, having secured a 3‚Äì0 record in the postseason.[123] On the evening before the Super Bowl, McCarthy had each player fitted for a championship ring.[124] Aware of the motivational tactic, team president Mark Murphy instructed his organization to begin designing the ring.[125] The following day on February 6, 2011, they defeated the AFC champion Pittsburgh Steelers 31‚Äì25, becoming the first No. 6 seed from the NFC to win a Super Bowl. It was the first time the Packers had won the Lombardi Trophy since 1996.[126] Aaron Rodgers was named Super Bowl MVP.[127][128] During Super Bowl XLV, McCarthy's team initially enjoyed a comfortable 21‚Äì3 lead over the Steelers. Then, Charles Woodson had to leave the game with a broken collarbone and the Steelers' Hines Ward found the endzone to make the score 21‚Äì10 by halftime. During the third quarter, Pittsburgh scored 7 more points to make the score 21‚Äì17. In the fourth quarter, Green Bay's Clay Matthews tackled Pittsburgh's Rashard Mendenhall, and Desmond Bishop recovered the ball for a key turnover.[129][130] In 2011, coming off their victory in Super Bowl XLV, the Packers won their first 13 games, eventually finishing the season 15‚Äì1. The 15 victories marked the franchise record for wins in a season and tied for the second-most regular-season wins in NFL history, behind only the 2007 Patriots who went 16‚Äì0. Following the season, Aaron Rodgers would be named the NFL's MVP, his first such award. During that year, McCarthy's offensive strategies aided Rodgers in throwing for 4,643 yards and 45 touchdowns.[131] These strategies also propelled the Packers to lead the NFL in scoring that year.[132] Despite receiving homefield advantage, Green Bay lost their first postseason game to eventual Super Bowl XLVI champion New York Giants, 37‚Äì20.[133] Finishing the 2012 season with an 11‚Äì5 record and their second straight division title, the Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC wild-card round 24‚Äì10, but lost in the divisional round of the playoffs to the eventual NFC Champion San Francisco 49ers by a score of 45‚Äì31.[134] The Packers offense finished the season fifth in points and 11th in yards per game. Under McCarthy, Rodgers passed for 4,295 yards.[135] The defense finished 11th in points allowed and 22nd in yards allowed per game. The Packers topped the first-ever AP Pro32 rankings, a new pro football version of the AP Top 25 college football and basketball polls.[136] In 2013, the Packers started 5‚Äì2, leading up to a Week 9 match up against the Bears. It was in that game that the Packers lost Aaron Rodgers to a broken collarbone;[137] Rodgers would miss the next six games, during which the club would go 2‚Äì3‚Äì1 under three different quarterbacks: Seneca Wallace (injured during first start), Scott Tolzien (benched), and Matt Flynn. Despite having a 7‚Äì7‚Äì1 record, the Packers were still in a position to win the NFC North division, if they were able to win their final game. With Rodgers returning, the Packers managed to beat the Bears in a Week 9 rematch, 33‚Äì28. Finishing at 8‚Äì7‚Äì1, the Packers won their division and were awarded a home playoff game. It was the fifth consecutive time that McCarthy led his team to a playoff appearance.[138] However, despite Rodgers' return, the Packers would lose to the San Francisco 49ers 20‚Äì23 in the first round of the playoffs.[139] The Packers recorded their 700th victory, against the Bears, in Week 4.[140] The team went undefeated at home for the first time since the 2011 season; they also led the league in scoring, with 486 points, the second-most in franchise history. The 2014 season also marked the first time since 2009 that the team had a 4,000-yard passer, two 1,000-yard receivers, and a 1,000-yard rusher. McCarthy led an offense that finished sixth in the league in total offense.[141] After winning against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 16, McCarthy (99 wins) passed Hall of Famer Vince Lombardi (98) on the all-time wins list for the Packers.[142] Overall, the team went 12‚Äì4, clinching the No. 2 seed in the NFC and a fourth consecutive NFC North division title, making the playoffs for the sixth straight season, tying a franchise record. The Packers beat the Cowboys in the divisional round, advancing to the NFC Championship to face the Seattle Seahawks. After leading throughout most of regulation, the Packers lost 28‚Äì22 in a historic overtime rally by Seattle.[143] Following the season, quarterback Aaron Rodgers was named the league's Most Valuable Player for the second time.[144] During Week 2 of the preseason against the Pittsburgh Steelers, wide receiver Jordy Nelson caught an eight-yard pass from Aaron Rodgers but then fell to the turf without contact. A few days later, it was revealed that Nelson had torn his ACL. He would remain inactive for the rest of the 2015 season.[145] Even without Nelson, the Packers managed to get off to a 6‚Äì0 start, but the Packers then lost four of their next five games, falling to 7‚Äì4.[146] On December 3, against the Detroit Lions, the Packers quickly fell to a 20‚Äì0 deficit going into halftime. Green Bay started to make a comeback in the second half thanks to a touchdown by Davante Adams and a 27-yard touchdown run by Aaron Rodgers to bring the game within two points at 23‚Äì21. The Packers then got the ball back in their possession with 23 seconds left in the game. While attempting a \"lateral\" play, Rodgers was sacked with no time remaining but then a flag was thrown for a facemask penalty on Detroit. The Packers now had one more un-timed play, which Aaron Rodgers threw a 61-yard Hail Mary touchdown to tight end Richard Rodgers II.[147] It was the longest Hail Mary touchdown pass thrown in NFL history.[148] Up until week 14, McCarthy delegated playcalling duties to associate head coach Tom Clements. However, the team's struggling offense made McCarthy decide to take back play-calling duties. During that first game that McCarthy resumed play calling, the Packers ran the ball for 230 yards in 44 carries.[149] Green Bay then finished the season 10‚Äì6 and 2nd in the NFC North behind the Minnesota Vikings. The Packers beat the Washington Redskins in the NFC wild-card game to advance to the divisional round with the Arizona Cardinals. A similar play to tie the game against the Cardinals happened between Aaron Rodgers and Jeff Janis. Janis caught a 41-yard touchdown from Rodgers which sent the game into overtime. However, the Packers fell to Arizona 26‚Äì20, ending their season.[150] After a 4‚Äì6 start to the season, the Packers went on a six-game winning streak to finish the regular season with a 10‚Äì6 record. The team clinched the NFC North for the fifth time in six years with their Week 17 win over the Detroit Lions. After the regular season, the success of his team made McCarthy the fourth head coach in NFL history to guide his team to eight or more consecutive playoff appearances.[151] They routed the fifth-seeded New York Giants, 38‚Äì13, in the wild-card round of the playoffs and upset the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys, 34‚Äì31, in the divisional round of the playoffs, but their season came to an end when they were beaten by the second-seeded Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship Game, 44‚Äì21.[152][153][154] The Green Bay Packers began the 2017 regular season with a 4‚Äì2 record.[155] On October 15, during a week 6 game against the Minnesota Vikings, Aaron Rodgers was driven to the ground by Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr after throwing a pass. Rodgers suffered a broken collarbone during the play,[156] and the Packers placed him on injured reserve on October 20, with the stipulation that he could return in eight weeks (following NFL rules), especially if the injury healed quickly and the Packers were still in playoff contention.[157] Rodgers did indeed return to the field for a week 15 game against the Carolina Panthers on December 17, but the Packers were eliminated from the playoff hunt after a 31‚Äì24 loss. The team placed Rodgers back on injured reserve after the game, a move that prompted several teams to complain that the Packers had violated the NFL's rules about reactivating injured players.[158] During Rodgers' absence, backup quarterback Brett Hundley stepped into the starting role for the first time in his professional career, but struggled to replicate Rodgers' success, despite a Pro Bowl-caliber season by receiver Davante Adams.[159] In a 23‚Äì0 loss to the Baltimore Ravens in week 11, the Packers suffered their first shutout at Lambeau Field in 11 years (the last time was a 35‚Äì0 loss to the New England Patriots in 2006).[160] The Packers finished the season at 7‚Äì9, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2008. Off the field, the Packers organization opened the Titletown District adjacent to Lambeau Field. This shopping, entertainment, and restaurant district includes a public plaza, park, and various commercial businesses.[161] In 2018, the Packers again failed to qualify for the playoffs, finishing third in the NFC North with a record of 6‚Äì9‚Äì1.[162][163] Following a Week 13 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, Mike McCarthy was released as head coach, replaced by Offensive Coordinator Joe Philbin on an interim basis.[164][165][166] McCarthy left Green Bay having tallied a 125‚Äì77‚Äì2 (.618) regular season record, as well as a postseason record of 10‚Äì8 (.556). His total record with the Packers was 135‚Äì85‚Äì2. McCarthy had brought the team to nine playoff berths and facilitated one Super Bowl win.[167] Following the season, Matt LaFleur, the Offensive Coordinator of the Tennessee Titans the prior season, was hired as the Packers' new coach.[168] Under first-year head coach Matt LaFleur, Aaron Rodgers and the Packers opened the season by defeating the Chicago Bears in the season's opening game, the first time since 2003 that the league-wide kickoff game did not feature the defending Super Bowl champions, with the Packers and Bears being selected for their historic rivalry in the NFL's 100th season.[169] The Packers returned to the playoffs for the first time since 2016, finishing with a record of 13‚Äì3 and securing a first-round bye as the NFC's second seed.[170] They defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28‚Äì23 in the NFC Divisional round to advance to the NFC Championship game, where they were defeated 37‚Äì20 by the San Francisco 49ers.[171] In 2020, the Green Bay Packers won the NFC North Division for the second consecutive year.[172] They also earned a first-round bye, with the top seed in the NFC. They defeated the Los Angeles Rams 32‚Äì18 in the Divisional Round,[173] but fell to the underdog Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC championship[174]- their fourth straight loss in the game in five appearances under Rodgers. Rodgers won his third MVP award during the season.[175] The next year, they clinched the top seed in the NFC again, with a 13‚Äì4 record, before losing 13‚Äì10 to the 49ers in the Divisional round. The special teams unit was consistently the worst in the NFL during the season, though their defense was noted as an improvement from previous seasons.[176] The special teams was especially costly in the postseason game as a field goal attempt and punt were both blocked, the latter of which the 49ers returned for a touchdown.[177] The defense did not allow any touchdowns in that game, as the only other points the 49ers scored were off two field goals. Matt LaFleur became the first coach to have three straight 13-win seasons, however, none of them ended with a trip to the Super Bowl.[178] For his performance in the season, Aaron Rodgers won his fourth MVP award- the second most for any quarterback, only behind Peyton Manning who has five.[179] In the 2022 season, the Green Bay Packers struggled and were eliminated from advancing to the NFL's wild-card playoffs when they lost their last regular-season game 20‚Äì16 to the Detroit Lions.[180] This was the first time the team missed the playoffs during Matt LaFleur's coaching stint. The team finished with an 8‚Äì9 record.[181] The 2023 season was the first without longtime quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who was traded to the New York Jets during the offseason.[182] Jordan Love, who was drafted to the Green Bay Packers in 2020,[183] took over as starting quarterback. The team finished with an 9‚Äì8 record which secured 2nd place in the NFC North division, and the 7th seed in the NFC.[184] The Packers defeated the 2nd seed Dallas Cowboys 48‚Äì32 in their Wild-Card matchup, becoming the first 7th seed team to win a playoff game.[185] The Packers would go on to lose to the 1st seed San Francisco 49ers 24‚Äì21 in the Divisional round.[186] Following the loss, the team announced that Defensive coordinator Joe Barry would not return next season.[187] The Packers are the only community-owned franchise in North America's four traditional major leagues.[a][13][188][189] Rather than being the property of an individual, partnership, or corporate entity, they are held by stockholders, more than 537,000 in total as of 2022. No one is allowed to hold more than 200,000 shares.[5] It is this broad-based community support and non-profit structure[190] which has kept the team in Green Bay for nearly a century even though it is the smallest market in North American professional sports.[a] The city of Green Bay had a population of only 107,395 as of the 2020 census,[191] and 600,000 in its television market, significantly less than the average NFL figures. The team, however, has long had an extended fan base throughout Wisconsin and parts of the Midwest, thanks in part to playing one pre-season and three regular-season home games each year in Milwaukee through 1995. It was only when baseball-only Miller Park preempted football there that the Packers' home slate became played entirely in Green Bay. As of 2021, there have been six stock sales to fund Packer operations over the team's history, beginning with $5,000 being raised through 1,000 shares offered at $5 apiece in 1923.[192] The latest was in November 2021, where they sold almost 200,000 shares.[193] The original \"Articles of Incorporation for the Green Bay Football Corporation\", enacted in 1923, specified that should the franchise be sold, any post-expenses money would have gone to the Sullivan-Wallen Post of the American Legion to build \"a proper soldier's memorial\". This stipulation was included to ensure there could never be any financial inducement for shareholders to move the club from Green Bay. At the November 1997 annual meeting, shareholders voted to change the beneficiary from the Sullivan-Wallen Post to the Green Bay Packers Foundation, which makes donations to many charities and institutions throughout Wisconsin.[194] Even though it is referred to as \"common stock\" in corporate offering documents, a share of Packers stock does not share the same rights traditionally associated with common or preferred stock. It does not include an equity interest, does not pay dividends, cannot be traded, has no securities-law protection, and brings no season ticket purchase privileges. All shareholders receive are voting rights, an invitation to the corporation's annual meeting, and an opportunity to buy exclusive shareholder-only merchandise.[190] Shares of stock cannot be resold, except back to the team for a fraction of the original price. While new shares can be given as gifts, transfers are technically allowed only between immediate family members once ownership has been established.[194] Green Bay is the only team with this form of ownership structure in the NFL, which does not comply with current league rules stipulating a maximum of 32 owners per team, with one holding a minimum 30% stake. The Packers' corporation was grandfathered when the NFL's current ownership policy was established in the 1980s.[195] As a publicly held nonprofit, the Packers are also the only American major-league sports franchise to release its financial balance sheet every year. Green Bay Packers, Inc., is governed by a seven-member executive committee elected from a 45-member board of directors. It consists of a president, vice president, treasurer, secretary, and three members-at-large; only the president is compensated. Responsibilities include directing corporate management, approving major capital expenditures, establishing broad policy, and monitoring management performance. The team's elected president normally represents the Packers in NFL owner's meetings. During his time as coach, Vince Lombardi generally represented the team at league meetings in his role as general manager, except at owners-only meetings, where president Dominic Olejniczak appeared.[1] The team created the Green Bay Packers Foundation in December 1986. It assists in a wide variety of activities and programs benefiting education, civic affairs, health services, human services and youth-related programs.[196] At the team's 1997 annual stockholders meeting the foundation was designated in place of a Sullivan-Wallen Post soldiers memorial as the recipient of any residual assets upon the team's sale or dissolution. The Packers have an exceptionally loyal fan base. Regardless of team performance, every game played in Green Bay‚Äîpreseason, regular season, and playoffs‚Äîhas been sold out since 1960.[197] Despite the Packers having by far the smallest local TV market, the team consistently ranks as one of the most popular in the NFL.[198] They also have one of the longest season ticket waiting lists in professional sports: 140,000 names long, more than there are seats at Lambeau Field.[199][200][201] The average wait is said to be over 30 years,[202] but with only 90 or so tickets turned over annually it would be 955 years before the newest name on the list got theirs.[200] As a result, season tickets are willed to next of kin, and newborns are placed optimistically on the waiting list.[203] Packers fans are often referred to as cheeseheads,[204] a nickname for Wisconsin residents reflecting the state's bountiful cheese production first leveled as an insult at a 1987 game between the Chicago White Sox and Milwaukee Brewers. Instead, it came to be a statewide source of pride, and particularly since 1994 has been embraced by Packers fans.[204] Bright orange triangular cheesehead hats are a fixture wherever the team plays. During training camp in the summer months, held outside the Don Hutson Center, young Packers fans can bring their bikes and have their favorite players ride them from the locker room to practice at Ray Nitschke Field. This old tradition began around the time of Lambeau Field's construction in 1957. Gary Knafelc, a Packers end at the time, said, \"I think it was just that kids wanted us to ride their bikes. I can remember kids saying, 'Hey, ride my bike.'\"[205] The team holds an annual scrimmage called Family Night, typically an intra-squad affair, at Lambeau Field. During 2004 and 2005 sellout crowds of over 60,000 fans showed up, with an all-time mark of 62,492 set in 2005 when the Buffalo Bills appeared.[206] In August 2008, ESPN.com ranked Packers fans as second-best in the NFL.[207] The team initially finished tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers (who finished ahead of the Packers) as having the best fans, but the tie was broken by ESPN's own John Clayton, a Pittsburgh native. Needing to outfit his new squad, team founder Curly Lambeau solicited funds from his employer, the Indian Packing Company. He was given $500 for uniforms and equipment in return for the team being named for its sponsor. An early newspaper article referred to the fledglings as \"the Indians\", but by the time they played their first game \"Packers\" had taken hold. Indian Packing was purchased in 1920 by the Acme Packing Company. Acme continued to support the team, which played its first NFL season with \"ACME PACKERS\" emblazoned on its jerseys. Lambeau, a Notre Dame alumnus, borrowed its Irish's navy blue and gold team colors, much as George Halas borrowed his Illinois alma mater's for the Chicago Bears. As a result, the early Packers were often referred to as the \"Bays\" or the \"Blues\" (and even occasionally as \"the Big Bay Blues\"). By 1950, Green Bay replaced navy blue with kelly green but kept what was by then a lighter shade of athletic gold. Navy blue was kept as a secondary color, seen primarily on sideline capes, but was quietly dropped on all official materials shortly after that. In 1958, this kelly green was replaced by a darker hunter green; it and athletic gold have served as the team colors since. The team's current uniform combination of forest green or white jerseys and metallic gold pants was adopted soon after Vince Lombardi arrived in 1959. However, to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary in 1994, the Packers joined in a league-wide donning of \"throwback\" jerseys, back to navy blue and gold. The team would go throwback again for two Thanksgiving Day games against the Detroit Lions, in blue and gold 1930s-era uniforms in 2001, and 1960s green and gold (only slightly different from the current ones) in 2003.[209] In 1951, the team finally stopped wearing leather helmets, adopting the metallic gold plastic headgear it has used ever since. The oval \"G\" logo was added in 1961 when Lombardi asked Packers equipment manager Gerald \"Dad\" Braisher to design a logo. Braisher tasked his assistant, St. Norbert College art student John Gordon. Satisfied with a football-shaped letter \"G\", the pair presented it to Lombardi, who then approved the addition.[210][211][212] Tiki Barber falsely reported[213] it to stand for \"greatness\" without a reliable source to back up his claims. Other reputable media outlets then published similar stories using Barber's false claim as a source.[214] The Packers' Assistant Director of PR and Corporate Communications had the following to say: \"There's nothing in our history that suggests there's any truth to this. The Packers Hall of Fame archivist said the same thing.\"[215] The team used several different logos before 1961, but the \"G\" is the only logo that has ever appeared on the helmet.[216][217] The Packers hold the trademark on the \"G\" logo, and have granted limited permission to other organizations to utilize a similar logo, such as the University of Georgia and Grambling State University, in addition to the city of Green Bay itself as part of its civic logo.[218] Adopted in 1964, the Georgia \"G\", though different in design and color, was similar to the Packers' \"G\". Then-Georgia head coach Vince Dooley thought it best to clear the use of Georgia's new emblem with the Packers.[219] While several NFL teams choose to wear white jerseys at home early in the season due to white's ability to reflect the late summer sun rays, the Packers have done so only twice, during the opening two games of the 1989 season. In 2016, the Packers debuted their Color Rush uniform, wearing white pants and socks with a white uniform.[220] This set has been worn five times, four of them at home and two against the Chicago Bears. In 2024, the all-white Color Rush uniform would be paired with a new alternate white helmet, which is essentially the primary helmet minus the gold elements.[221] Although alternate gold jerseys with green numbers are sold on a retail basis, the team currently has no plans to introduce such a jersey to be used in actual games. During the 2010 season, the Packers paid tribute to their historical roots with a throwback jersey modeled after that worn by the club in 1929, during its first championship season. The jersey was navy blue with a gold circle and navy numbers, again making the Packers \"the Blues\".[222][223] These were then changed in 2015 to the navy blue throwback worn from 1937 to 1949, featuring gold shoulders and numbers.[224] In 2021, the Packers changed their throwback thirds to an all-green design, resembling the uniforms worn from 1950 to 1953.[225] Originally, the Packers wore brown helmets with the throwbacks, but in 2013, they started wearing their gold helmets without any decals due to the then-implementation of the NFL's one-shell rule; this rule has been abolished in 2022. As a result, they changed their throwbacks in both 2015 and 2021 to properly recreate those original uniforms, which had gold helmets with them. Upon the NFL's switch of uniform suppliers in 2012 to Nike from Reebok,[226] the Packers refused any changes to their uniform in any way outside of the required supplier's logo and new league uniform logos, declining all of Nike's \"Elite 51\" enhancements, including retaining the traditional striped collar of the jersey rather than Nike's new collar design.[227] The Packers and Chicago Bears have been rivals since their team's inception in 1920, becoming one of the oldest and most storied rivalries in the league's history. The Packers currently lead the series 107‚Äì95‚Äì6,[228] and the teams have met twice in the postseason. The Bears won the 1941 meeting, 33‚Äì14, and eventually defeated the New York Giants in the 1941 NFL Championship Game, and the Packers won the 2011 meeting, 21‚Äì14, en route to a Super Bowl XLV win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. The teams' first meeting was a victory for the Bears (known as the Staleys at the time) in 1921 in a shutout, 20‚Äì0. The Packers claimed their first win over the Bears in 1925, 14‚Äì10. The 1924 matchup (which ended in a 3‚Äì0 win for Chicago) was notable for featuring the first-ever ejection of players in a game in NFL history, as Frank Hanny of the Bears and Walter Voss of the Packers were ejected for punching each other.[229] The rivalry also featured one of the last successful fair catch kicks in 1968, when Bears kicker Mac Percival kicked the game-winning field goal.[230] As of the 2023 season, the Packers lead the all-time series 107‚Äì95‚Äì6.[231] The rivalry between the Packers and Minnesota Vikings began in 1961, similar to their other divisional rivalries. It is also considered to be one of the most intense rivalries in the NFL, due to the intensity of most of the matchups over the years, As is the case with many of their respective state's college teams sharing a rivalry; (Minnesota and Wisconsin) have a rivalry in multiple sports, seen between the Big Ten rivals, the University of Wisconsin and University of Minnesota. Events such as Randy Moss mooning the Green Bay crowd in the first playoff game between these two teams (won by the Vikings), and former Packer great Brett Favre's move to the Vikings have created more resentment between these teams. The Packers lead the all-time series 66‚Äì59‚Äì3, despite the two teams splitting their two playoff contests.[232] The Packers' rivalry with the Detroit Lions has been another one of the oldest regular matchups in the NFL. They first met in 1930 when the Lions were known as the Portsmouth Spartans and based in Portsmouth, Ohio. The team eventually moved to Detroit for the 1934 season. The Lions and Packers have been division rivals since 1933 and have always met at least twice a season since 1932, without any canceled games between both rivals. The Packers lead the series 106‚Äì76‚Äì7 as of the end of the 2022 season, the first time in NFL history that a team has recorded 100 wins over an opponent.[233] The rivalry between the Packers and Dallas Cowboys has resulted in several notable games in league history, including the \"Ice Bowl\" and other games impacting the playoff race.[234] The rivalry heated up during the 2010s, with several of their games impacting the NFC playoff race during that decade. During the Brett Favre era in Green Bay, the Cowboys dominated the rivalry, going 9‚Äì2 (including 9‚Äì0 in Dallas) against the Packers when Favre was the quarterback. However, in the Aaron Rodgers era from 2008 to 2022, the Packers have dominated the rivalry, as Rodgers had an 8‚Äì2 record against the Cowboys with Green Bay, including a perfect 3‚Äì0 record in Dallas. The Packers lead the all-time series 22‚Äì17. The Packers lead 5‚Äì4 in the playoffs, with the last playoff match taking place in January 2024 at AT&T Stadium in the Wild Card round with a 48‚Äì32 Packers win.[235] The rivalry between the Packers and the San Francisco 49ers ignited during the 1990s, with the two teams facing each other in four consecutive playoff games. The Packers won four of five playoff games against the 49ers with Brett Favre as its quarterback, with four of those games pitting Favre against the 49ers' Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young. Since 2012, the 49ers have defeated the Aaron Rodgers-led Packers four times in the playoffs.[236] The Packers currently lead the series 38‚Äì33‚Äì1, but the 49ers have won the last four postseason meetings to take a 5‚Äì4 lead.[237][238] Following Seattle's relocation to the NFC in 2002, the Packers have faced the Seattle Seahawks multiple times in the playoffs, developing an intense rivalry as well. Some notable moments include the clubs' first playoff meeting in 2003 in which Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck threw a game-losing pick-six in overtime after guaranteeing a game-winning drive,[239] the Fail Mary, and Russell Wilson overcoming four interceptions and a 16‚Äì0 Packers lead to lead Seattle to a 28‚Äì22 overtime win to advance to Super Bowl XLIX.[240] As of the 2023 season, the Packers lead the all-time series 15‚Äì9.[241] The series between the Packers and New York Giants has been one of the oldest regular matchups in the league as the two teams first met in 1928. The two teams have played since 1970 in the National Football Conference, and they play each other in the regular season either every three years or depending on its NFC division placement, and in the postseason, The Packers lead the all-time series 34‚Äì27‚Äì2 and postseason series 5‚Äì3.[242] The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Packers were division rivals from 1977 to 2002 when both were in the NFC Central division. The teams have played several notable games, including a Snow Bowl game in 1985, a playoff game in 1998 and the NFC Championship Game in 2021.[243] As of the 2023 season, the Packers lead the series 34‚Äì23‚Äì1.[244] After their early seasons at Bellevue Park and Hagemeister Park, the Packers played home games in City Stadium from 1925 to 1956.[245] The team won its first six NFL championships there. By the 1950s, the wooden 25,000-seat arena was considered outmoded.[246] The NFL threatened to move the franchise to Milwaukee full-time unless it got a better stadium.[247] The city responded by building a new 32,150 seat City Stadium for the team, the first built exclusively for an NFL team, which opened in time for the 1957 season.[248] It was renamed Lambeau Field in 1965 to honor Curly Lambeau, who had died earlier in the year.[249] Expanded seven times before the end of the 1990s, Lambeau Field capacity reached 60,890. In 2003, it was extensively renovated to expand seating, modernize stadium facilities, and add an atrium area. Even with a current seating capacity of 72,928, ticket demand far outpaces supply, as all Packers games have been sold out since 1960. About 86,000 names are on the waiting list for season tickets.[200] The Packers played part of their home slate in Milwaukee starting in 1933, including two to three home games each year in Milwaukee's County Stadium from 1953 to 1994. Indeed, County Stadium had been built partly to entice the Packers to move to Milwaukee full-time. The Packers worked to capture their growing fan base in Milwaukee and the larger crowds. By the 1960s, the threat of an American Football League franchise in Milwaukee prompted the Packers to stay, including scheduling a Western Conference Championship game in 1967. County Stadium was built primarily as a baseball stadium and made only the bare minimum adjustments to accommodate football. At its height, it only seated 56,000 people, just barely above the NFL minimum; many of those seats were badly obstructed. The field was just barely large enough to fit a football field. Both teams shared the same sideline (separated by a piece of tape) and the end zones extended onto the warning track. By 1994, improvements and seating expansions at Lambeau, along with the Brewers preparing to campaign for their new stadium prompted the Packers to play their full slate in Green Bay for the first time in 62 years. Former season ticketholders for the Milwaukee package continue to receive preference for one pre-season and the second and fifth regular-season games at Lambeau Field each season, along with playoff games through a lottery under the \"Gold Package\" plan.[250] The Packers have three practice facilities across the street from Lambeau Field in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin: the Don Hutson Center, an indoor facility; Ray Nitschke Field, an outdoor field with artificial FieldTurf; and Clarke Hinkle Field, an outdoor field with natural grass.[251] The Packers Pro Shop has been the official retail store of the Packers since 1989. The primary retail store is located at Lambeau Field, having been expanded numerous times since it opened. The Pro Shop reported sales of over $7 million in 2015.[252][253] This is a partial list of the Packers' last five completed seasons. For the full season-by-season franchise results, see List of Green Bay Packers seasons.[254] Note: The Finish, Wins, Losses, and Ties columns list regular season results and exclude any postseason play. As of January 2023 The Packers have been league champions a record 13 times,[25] topping their nearest rival, the Chicago Bears, by four. The first three were decided by league standing, the next six by the NFL Title Game, and the last four by Super Bowl victories. The Packers are also the only team to win three consecutive NFL titles, having accomplished this twice‚Äîfrom 1929 to 1931 under Lambeau, and from 1965 to 1967 under Lombardi. Starting in 1966, the NFL began holding the Super Bowl. The Packers have won four Super Bowls.[259] From 1933 to 1969, the NFL held a championship game to decide their champion. The Packers won 8 NFL Championship Games. From 1966 to 1969, the NFL Championship Game was followed by the Super Bowl.[260] The Packers have won three NFC Championship Games, with twice as many losses. NFC Championships did not exist before the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger in 1970.[261] From 1920 to 1932, the NFL championship was awarded based on standings, with no championship game taking place. The Packers won three such championships.[262] The Packers have won 21 divisional championships. Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 5 reserve, 15 practice squad (+2 exempt) The Packers have the second most members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame with 30, 25 of which were inducted as Packers. They trail only the Chicago Bears with 37 Hall of Famers, 30 of which were inducted as Bears.[263] Many Packers players and coaches are also enshrined in the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame.[264] In 2018 Ron Wolf, the most recent Packers contributor to be honored, was inducted.[265] In nearly nine decades of Packers football, the Packers have formally retired six numbers.[266] All six Packers are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and their numbers and names are displayed on the green facade of Lambeau Field's north endzone as well as in the Lambeau Field Atrium. The Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame was the first hall of fame built to honor a single professional American football team. John P. Holloway, a Brown County administrator and arena director, and William L. Brault, a Green Bay restaurateur and Packers fan, co-founded the Packer Hall of Fame museum[267] in 1966. As of 2019, the Packers Hall of Fame has inducted 162 people, 24 of whom have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[268] ‚Üí Coaching staff ‚Üí Front office ‚Üí More NFL staffs [269] *Interim head coaches The Packers are unique in having their market area cover two media markets, both Green Bay and Milwaukee. NFL blackout restrictions for the team apply within both areas. However, Packers games have not been blacked out locally since 1972 (the last year home game local telecasts were prohibited regardless of sellout status) due to strong home attendance and popularity. As mentioned above, every Packers home game‚Äîpreseason, regular season and playoffs‚Äîhas been sold out since 1960.[270] The flagship station of the Packers Radio Network is Good Karma Brands's WTMJ in Milwaukee, which was the former flagship of the Journal Broadcast Group before its merger with E. W. Scripps Company in April 2015; Scripps itself sold their Milwaukee radio assets to GKB in November 2018, and the team then brought their broadcast operations in-house, thus the personnel is directly employed by the team. WTMJ has aired Packers games since 1929, the longest association between a radio station and an NFL team to date, and the only rights deal in American professional sports where a station outside of the team's main metro area is the radio flagship. While this might be unusual, the station can be heard at city-grade strength at all hours in Green Bay proper. Games air in Green Bay on WTAQ (1360/97.5) and WIXX-FM (101.1), and WAPL (105.7) and WHBY (1150) in Appleton and the Fox Cities.[271] Wayne Larrivee is the play-by-play announcer and Larry McCarren is the color analyst. Larrivee joined the team after many years as the Chicago Bears' announcer.[272] Jim Irwin and Max McGee were the longtime radio announcers before Larrivee and McCarren. When victory is assured for the Packers, either a game-winning touchdown, interception or a crucial 4th down defensive stop, Larrivee's trademark declaration of \"And there is your dagger!\" signifies the event. In limited circumstances where the Milwaukee Brewers are in either playoff or post-season contention and their play-by-play takes priority, WTMJ's sister FM station WKTI (94.5) currently airs Packer games to avert game conflicts. Surrounding pre-game programming is also carried on sister station WAUK (540), an ESPN Radio affiliate and former competitor which produced unofficial Packers programming for years. On October 27, 2021, the Packers announced that it would end its longtime association with WTMJ at the end of the season, with iHeartMedia's sports radio station WRNW (97.3) becoming the team's Milwaukee radio affiliate in 2022.[273] The TV rights for pre-season games not nationally broadcast are held by E. W. Scripps Company-owned television stations WGBA-TV (channel 26) in Green Bay and WTMJ-TV (channel 4) in Milwaukee;[274] the game broadcasts are distributed to 19 further TV stations in Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Missouri, and Alaska, as well as Spanish-language WYTU-LD \"Telemundo Wisconsin\" in Milwaukee.[275] The deal marked a change in affiliate in Green Bay from WFRV-TV; in the wake of the 2012 deal, McCarren resigned his duties as sports director of WFRV to move to WTMJ/WGBA as a Packers analyst, becoming WGBA's official sports director on April 1, 2013.[276][277] McCarren left WGBA in 2015 and became a team employee.[278] The team's intra-squad Lambeau scrimmage at the beginning of the season, marketed as Packers Family Night, was produced for over a decade by WLUK-TV in Green Bay and broadcast by the state's Fox affiliates through the 2016 season.[279] In 2017, Scripps and the Packers Television Network began to originate the Packers Family Night broadcast.[280] Preseason television games are announced by Kevin Harlan, son of former Packers president Bob Harlan, and color commentator Rich Gannon.[275] Regular-season and postseason games not aired on a broadcast network are simulcast on broadcast stations in the Green Bay and Milwaukee markets. On the television sitcom That '70s Show, in season 7 episode 14, Donna Pinciotti gave the gang‚Äîincluding Red Forman, a long-time Packers fan‚Äîsix free tickets to Lambeau Field for a game against the Chicago Bears. Eric comes back wearing a Walter Payton number 34 Bears jersey, which caused the Lambeau Field crowd to boo Eric and make negative comments towards him. Eric doesn't understand football in general. In the season 8 finale, Red declined to move to Florida after Steven Hyde bought him season tickets.[281] In 2015, five members of the Packers (David Bakhtiari, Don Barclay, T. J. Lang, Clay Matthews, and Josh Sitton) made an appearance as an a cappella group in the musical comedy Pitch Perfect 2. Aaron Rodgers' brother Jordan also appeared.[282] That same year, Rodgers himself appeared in an episode of the sketch comedy television series Key & Peele, along with Ha Ha Clinton-Dix.[283] In the television series Danny Phantom, the main antagonist, Vlad Masters/Vlad Plasmius, is a Packers \"Fanatic\". His prized possession is a football autographed by Ray Nitschke, and his dream is to own the team.[284] In the 1998 film There's Something about Mary, Mary, played by actress Cameron Diaz, consistently talks about her boyfriend \"Brett\". It is revealed towards the end of the film that \"Brett\" is then-Packers' quarterback Brett Favre.[285]",

The Palisades fire continues to threaten Brentwood and Encino, where an all-out aerial assault continues. At the Brentwood location of popular Italian eatery Jon & Vinny‚Äôs, staff complained of headaches and sore throats in a text message group chat. But the conflagration has spread into the Mandeville Canyon neighbourhood, sparking evacuation orders for swathes of Brentwood, a ritzy enclave where Arnold Schwarzenegger, Disney chief executive Bob Iger and NBA star LeBron James have homes. Aerial crews have been bombarding the flaming hills with water and fire retardant to hold back the Palisades fire, which has expanded an additional 1,000 acres and is now menacing Brentwood.

                "content": "Brentwood is a town in Essex, England, in the London commuter belt 20 miles (30 km) north-east of Charing Cross and close to the M25 motorway. The population of the built-up area was 55,340 in 2021.[1] Brentwood is a town with a shopping area along the High Street, a Roman road which became one of the main roads between London and East Anglia. Beyond the town centre are residential developments surrounded by open countryside and woodland; some of this countryside lies within only a few hundred yards of the town centre. Brentwood Cathedral is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brentwood. Since 1978, Brentwood has been twinned with Roth in Germany and with Montbazon in France since 1994.[2] It also has a relationship with Brentwood, Tennessee in the United States. The name was assumed by some in the 1700s to derive from a corruption of the words 'burnt' and 'wood', with the name Burntwood still visible on some 18th-century maps. However, brent was the middle English for \"burnt\". The name describes the presumed reason for settlement in the part of the Forest of Essex (later Epping Forest) that would have covered the area, where a major occupation was charcoal burning. Although a Bronze Age axe has been found in Brentwood and there are clear signs of an entrenched encampment in Weald Country Park, it is considered unlikely that there was any significant early settlement of the area. At the time, most of Essex was covered by the Great Forest. It is believed that despite the Roman road between London and Colchester passing through the town, the Saxons were the earliest settlers of the area.[3] The borough was on a crossroads, where the Roman road from Colchester to London crossed the route the pilgrims took over the River Thames to Canterbury. A chapel was built in or around 1221, and in 1227 a market charter was granted. Its growth may have been stimulated by the cult of St. Thomas the Martyr, to whom the chapel was dedicated: the 13th-century ruin of Thomas Becket Chapel was a popular stopping point for pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. The ruin stands in the centre of the high street and the nearby parish church of Brentwood, built in the 1880s, retains the dedication to St. Thomas of Canterbury.[4][5] Pilgrims Hatch, or 'Pilgrims' gate', was probably named from pilgrims who crossed through on their way to the chapel. It is likely, however, that Brentwood's development was due chiefly to its main road position, its market, and its convenient location as an administrative centre. Early industries were connected mainly with textile and garment making, brewing, and brickmaking.[6] During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, Brentwood was the meeting place for some of the instigators, such as John Ball and Jack Straw. They apparently met regularly in local pubs and inns. The first event of the Peasants' Revolt occurred in Brentwood, when men from Fobbing, Corringham and Stanford were summoned by the commissioner Thomas Bampton to Brentwood to answer as to who had avoided paying the poll tax. Bampton insisted that the peasants pay what was demanded of them. The peasants refused to pay and a riot ensued as Bampton attempted to arrest the peasants. The peasants moved to kill Bampton, but he managed to escape to London. The rioters then, fearing the repercussions of what they had done, fled into the forest. After the riot the peasants sent word to the rest of the country and initiated the Peasants' Revolt.[7] The Essex assizes were sometimes held here, as well as at Chelmsford. One such pub was The White Hart [8] (now a nightclub). One of the oldest buildings in Brentwood; it is believed to have been built in 1480 although apocryphal evidence suggests a hostelry might have stood on the site as much as a hundred years earlier and been visited in 1392 by Richard II, whose coat of arms included a White Hart. The ground floor was originally stabling and in the mid-1700s the owners ran their own coach service to London. On 13 September 2009, the building and roof suffered significant damage during a fire.[9] The building now shows little of its original historic interest, Marygreen Manor, a 16th-century building on London Road, is mentioned in Samuel Pepys' diaries and is said to have been often visited by the Tudor monarch Henry VIII when Henry Roper, Gentleman Pursuant to Queen Catherine of Aragon, lived there in 1514. It is now a hotel and restaurant.[10] In 1686 Brentwood's inns were estimated to provide 110 beds and stabling for 183 horses.[11] There were 11 inns in the town in 1788. Protestant martyr William Hunter was burnt at the stake in Brentwood in 1555. A monument to him was erected by subscription in 1861 at Wilson's Corner. Brentwood School was founded in 1557 and established in 1558, in Ingrave Road and behind the greens on Shenfield Road by Sir Anthony Browne and the site of Hunter's execution in commemorated by a plaque in the school. Thomas Munn, 'gentleman brickmaker' of Brentwood, met a less noble end when he was hanged for robbing the Yarmouth mail and his body was exhibited in chains at Gallows Corner,[12] a road junction a few miles from Brentwood, in Romford. A ducking stool was mentioned in 1584.[6] As the Roman road grew busier, Brentwood became a major coaching stop for stagecoaches, with plenty of inns for overnight accommodation as the horses were rested. A 'stage' was approximately ten miles, and being about 20 miles (32 km) from London, Brentwood would have been a second stop for travellers to East Anglia. This has not changed; there is an above average number of pubs in the area - possibly due to the army being stationed at Warley Barracks until 1958. Some of the pubs date back to the 15th and 16th centuries. Brentwood was also significant as a hub for the London postal service, with a major post office since the 18th century. The major post office on the high street was closed in the 2008 budget cuts; Brentwood residents now must rely on sub-post offices.[13] Daniel Defoe wrote about Brentwood as being \"...full of good inns, and chiefly maintained by the excessive multitude of carriers and passengers,[14] which are constantly passing this way to London, with droves of cattle, provisions and manufactures.\" The 'Brentwood Ring', the earliest Christian ring ever to have been discovered in Britain was found in Brentwood in the late 1940s. It now resides at the British Museum in London.[15] The only other ring of its type in existence can be found at the Vatican Museum in Rome.[16] In 1917, the Roman Catholic church on Ingrave Road was awarded cathedral status. Between 1989 and 1991 the building was modified to an Italianate Classical style. Brentwood Cathedral is currently the seat of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Brentwood. Nearby Ingatestone Hall is noted for its Roman Catholic connections through the Petre family. The hall is a 16th-century manor house built by Sir William Petre at Yenge-atte-Stone.[17] The staunch Petres played a significant role in the preservation of the Catholic faith in England. Sir William was assistant to Thomas Cromwell when Henry VIII sought to dissolve the monasteries and ascended to the confidential post of Secretary of State, throughout the revolutionary changes of four Tudor monarchs: Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I.[18] Queen Mary, in 1553, on her way to claim her crown in London, stopped at Ingatestone Hall; later, Queen Elizabeth I spent several nights at the hall on her royal progress of 1561. Today, Ingatestone Hall, like all other large Tudor houses, is an expression of wealth and status and retains many of the features of a 16th-century knightly residence, despite alterations by descendants who still live in the house.[19] Ingatestone Hall represented the exterior of Bleak House in the 2005 television adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel, and also appeared in an episode of the television series Lovejoy. It is open to the public for tours, concerts, and performances; the hall and grounds can be rented for weddings and other occasions.[20] Brentwood was the location of Warley Hospital, a psychiatric hospital, from 1853 to 2001. A British East India Company elephant training school was based in Brentwood and this remained an active army base as a depot for the Essex Regiment until 1959,[6] when much of the site was redeveloped as the European headquarters for the Ford Motor Company. A few buildings remain from the Barracks ‚Äì the regimental chapel, the gymnasium (now home to Brentwood Trampoline Club) and the officers' mess (now Marillac Hospital). The military has associations with Warley going back over 200 years. It also had strategic importance during the time of the Spanish Armada - it was used as a meeting place for contingents from eight eastern and midland counties (900 horsemen assembled here) to then travel on to Tilbury. The local common was used as a military camp in 1742, and became a permanent feature as Warley Barracks in 1804. During World War II, over 1,000 bombs were dropped on Brentwood, with 19 flying bombs (V1), 32 long-range rockets (V2) and many incendiary bombs and parachute mines. 5,038 houses were destroyed, 389 people were injured and 43 died. The 15th- and 16th-century pubs, however, survived. Brentwood had been considered a safe enough haven to evacuate London children here - 6,000 children arrived in September 1939 alone. The town is increasingly suburban, but it does have a very rural feel, with trees, fields and open spaces all around the town; Shenfield Common is also less than one mile from town centre shops. Brentwood's high street has also been subject to major redevelopment works costing between ¬£3 million and ¬£7 million.[21][22][23] This included the demolition of the Sir Charles Napier pub to build an additional lane to improve traffic flow at the west end of the high street, and re-laying the pavements and road surface in the high street itself.[24] There is a proposal for creating \"Dunton Garden Suburb\" on land between Basildon and Brentwood. This proposal may have 6,000 homes, together with retail, commercial and leisure uses. This is a joint proposal of the two councils and a public consultation ended in March 2015.[25] The proposal has met with criticism from all political parties[26] and the residents group Residents Against Inappropriate Development[27] Secondary schools include Brentwood County High School, Brentwood School, St Martin's School and Becket Keys Church of England School. Primary schools include St Helens Catholic Junior School, St Peters C of E, St Thomas of Canterbury C of E, Warley Primary, Willowbrook Primary, Holly Trees Primary, Hogarth Primary and Larchwood Primary School The Ford Motor Company's United Kingdom headquarters were located in the suburb of Warley until 2018. [28] From the financial services sector, Equity Insurance Group, comprising Equity Red Star (of Lloyd's of London), affinity provider Equity Direct Broking Limited and motorcycle insurance broker Bike Team, is headquartered in the town centre. General insurance broker Brents was established in the town in 1963.[29] The Bank of New York Mellon also has a substantial presence in Brentwood, as does LV=, employing 350 people there. The previous headquarters of electronics company Amstrad were located in Brentwood. The television show The Apprentice used overhead views of the Canary Wharf business district in London as an accompaniment to interior shots of the previous Amstrad offices, Amstrad House, which has since been converted into a Premier Inn hotel.[30] Well-known businesses that used to operate in the town include vacuum flask manufacturer Thermos, and Nissen whose UK factory and headquarters were established in the town by Ted Blake in the mid-1960s but closed in the 1980s. There are two tiers of local government covering Brentwood, at district (borough) and county level: Brentwood Borough Council, based at Brentwood Town Hall and Essex County Council, based in Chelmsford. Brentwood was historically a chapelry in the parish of South Weald, becoming a separate civil parish in 1866. The parish originally covered 460 acres (1.9 km2). In 1891 the population was 4,949. When elected parish and district councils were established in 1894 the parish was included in the Billericay Rural District.[31] Brentwood gained independence from the rural district in 1899 when the parish was made an urban district. The urban district was substantially enlarged in 1934, when the neighbouring parishes of Childerditch, East Horndon, Hutton, Ingrave, Little Warley, Shenfield, South Weald and West Horndon were all abolished and absorbed into Brentwood (with some adjustments to the boundaries with other neighbouring parishes).[32] Brentwood Urban District was abolished in 1974 and replaced by the larger Brentwood District, gaining the neighbouring rural parishes of Blackmore, Doddinghurst, Ingatestone and Fryerning, Kelvedon Hatch, Mountnessing, Navestock and Stondon Massey.[33] No successor parish was created for the former urban district.[34] The enlarged district has an area of 36,378 acres (147.22 km2) and was awarded borough status in 1993.[35] For elections to Westminster, Brentwood forms part of the Brentwood and Ongar constituency. The Brentwood Theatre and The Hermitage are the main cultural buildings in Brentwood, located on the same site in the town centre. Brentwood Theatre is a fully fitted community theatre that serves more than 40 non-professional performing arts groups.[36] Owned and maintained by an independent charity, Brentwood Theatre receives no regular arts funding or subsidy. The Hermitage is used as the centre for Brentwood Youth Service. The Hermitage youth service operates its own cafe, youth club and a live music venue called The Hermit, which has had hosted bands such as Mot√∂rhead and InMe. InMe were heavily supported in their early years by the venue, whose purpose is to promote and encourage youth bands. It also plays host to private events such as a weekly jazz club that was run by the saxophonist Spike Robinson until his death. Both venues co-host the Brentwood Blues Festival, a music event that has played host to the Blockheads and Bill Wyman. Local TV coverage is provided by BBC London and ITV London which is received from the Crystal Palace TV transmitter. [37] Some areas of town can also receive BBC East and ITV Anglia from the Sudbury TV transmitter. [38] Local radio stations are BBC Essex on 95.3 FM, Heart Essex on 96.3 FM, and Phoenix FM, a community radio station that serves the Brentwood area. The station was formed in August 1996 and broadcast ten trial broadcasts under a restricted service licence, each lasting 28 days, the first starting on 29 December 1996 and the last ending on 25 February 2006. On 23 March 2007, the station started to broadcast permanently on 98.0 FM, featuring popular music, local musicians and acts, local events, and interviews with key local figures. The Brentwood Art Trail has become a popular annual summer event which was developed to create an arts experience whereby art created by local people can be recognised and appreciated. Brentwood is also home to the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, which perform at many events throughout the year. It is a successful band and attracts youngsters from the age of 10 from Brentwood and surrounding areas. It was the first British band to ever take part in the Tournament of Roses Parade[39] in Pasadena, California and the first youth band to play the Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo on Moscow's Red Square. It meets twice a week in Warley.[40] Among the many theatre companies in the region, Brentwood Operatic Society and Shenfield Operatic Society are two that represent the many groups providing excellent theatrical productions for the community. Brentwood Operatic Society also trains young actors with its BOSSY Youth acting program,[41] headed by Gaynor Wilson, who formerly directed actor Stephen Moyer. David Pickthall serves as musical director[42] when not scoring films and television shows for the BBC, directing British orchestras, and composing. The award-winning composer wrote two operas and three musicals, published worldwide by Samuel French Ltd. He is also the musical voice of the villainous penguin in the Oscar-winning Wallace & Grommit: The Wrong Trousers. Brentwood's Orchestras for Young People was founded in 1990 and grew to include five ensembles for orchestral instrumentalists of school age, who perform regularly in and around the town. Regular rehearsals and workshops introduce the musicians to a wide variety of music, from well-known classical pieces to modern music.[43] The Brentwood Performing Arts Festival has now been accepted into membership by the British and International Federation of Festivals of which Queen Elizabeth II is patron. With this, the Festival has achieved recognition as the Festival of Performing Arts for Brentwood. The town is the venue of the Brentwood International Chess Congress which was set up in 2006 and first ran 17‚Äì18 February 2007. The congress attracted 235 competitors who included three Grandmasters and five International Masters. The prize fund is relatively generous in comparison to many other similar congresses, being around ¬£4,000. In 2007 it was the largest chess competition to be held in Essex and was organised by Brentwood Chess Club. Although close to the extremities of Greater London, Brentwood is surrounded by open countryside and woodland. This has been cited as showing the success of the Metropolitan Green Belt in halting the outward spread of London's built-up area.[44] Brentwood has a number of public open spaces including King George V Playing Field, Shenfield Common, and two country parks at South Weald and Thorndon. Weald Country Park was first chosen to hold the 2012 Olympics mountain biking but was declared to be \"too easy\" a course. Brentwood does however host a number of Criterium Cycle Races that attract many of Britain's greatest cyclists. The town has two large sports centres providing access to a range of sports including badminton, squash, swimming, and football. There are a number of golf courses, including a 70-par municipal course very close to the town centre at Hartswood[45] as well as others in the surrounding countryside. A number of cricket clubs exist in and around the town although the County Ground, closest to the town centre,[46] no longer hosts Essex matches. Brentwood is also home to non-league football club Brentwood Town F.C. and basketball team London Leopards, who both play at the Brentwood Centre Arena. The town is also home to London league club Brentwood RLFC, the only rugby league club in west Essex. Brentwood Hockey Club is also based in the town at the Old County Ground and fielded 6 men's and 5 ladies' league teams for the 2014‚Äì15 season. Brentwood Running Club (established in 1987 as Thrift Green Trotters), aims to encourage local runners to improve their fitness whilst having fun and meeting like-minded runners. The Club night is on Wednesdays, meeting at 7:30PM at the Brentwood Centre. A Beginners' group following the 13-week 'Couch to 5k' programme is run twice a year. [47] In 2022, a new track and field athletics club was established using the track located at Brentwood School. With more than 250 active members, Brentwood Beagles Athletics Club takes athletes from the age of five through to all masters aged athletes across all track and field, road running and cross country disciplines and event groups. In their first year of operation they have already had athletes competing nationally and also representing the county in a range of events. First year wins and trophies include the U13G 2022/23 Essex XC Relay Champions, six county championship medals, a number of Essex Schools Vests, County vests and national medals. In September 2022, the Beagles appointed former Chief Executive of Brentwood Borough Council, Bob McLintock, as their inaugural President.[48] Although no longer manufactured here, Brentwood became the centre of trampolining in the United Kingdom between 1965 and 1981 after George Nissen brought the new sport to the town in 1949 and eventually manufactured trampolines in the town, continuing to do so for many years after they ceased production in the US for fear of litigation. Ted Blake, a long-term Brentwood resident, was managing director of Nissen UK from its inception until shortly before it closed and became a leading figure worldwide in the development of modern trampolining. Brentwood still has a thriving trampolining community but no longer a local factory.[49] The town also has a large volleyball club and the only handball club in Essex.[50] Brentwood School pupils: Brentwood is served by a number of bus services, many being operated by First Essex. The other main bus service providers include Arriva Herts & Essex Ensignbus, and Stagecoach London. London Buses route 498 links Romford with Brentwood and operates daily. The A12, which runs between London and Lowestoft, by-passes the town to the north and the London orbital M25 motorway is located 1.2 miles (2 km) to the south-west of the town. The A128, which links Ongar with Orsett, travels through the centre of the town. The A129 travels through the north and east of the town, connecting Brentwood with Billericay and Hadleigh. The A1023 passes through Brentwood, connecting the town with the A12. Brentwood railway station is located to the south of the town centre and is served by frequent Elizabeth line services between Shenfield and London Paddington via Liverpool Street, with two trains per hour continuing to Heathrow Terminal 5. Also within the Borough of Brentwood are Ingatestone and Shenfield stations, which provide fast services to Liverpool Street and East Anglia; West Horndon hosts services between London Fenchurch Street and Shoeburyness. The nearest London Underground stations are situated just outside of the Borough of Brentwood, at Newbury Park (Central line) and Upminster (District line).",

                "content": "Football Manchester City vs Salford City. The FA Cup Third Round. 5:45pm, Saturday 11th January 2025. Etihad Stadium. Report as James McAtee scores a hat-trick in Manchester City's 8-0 drubbing of Salford City; Jeremy Doku dazzles with two goals and two assists during FA Cup third-round waltz for 2024 beaten finalists; Jack Grealish (pen), Nico O'Reilly and Divin Mubama also on target Saturday 11 January 2025 22:39, UK Manchester City sauntered into the fourth round of the FA Cup as James McAtee scored a hat-trick in an 8-0 drubbing of League Two side Salford City at the Etihad Stadium. Jeremy Doku weighed in with two goals while Jack Grealish ended his long scoring drought and youngsters Divin Mubama and Nico O'Reilly also struck in a one-sided encounter at the Etihad Stadium. It was a brutal exhibition by a much-changed City, whose fans revelled in the beating dished out to their 'Class of 92'-owned visitors. Gary Neville, one of that group of famous former Manchester United players, was taunted mercilessly as the goals flew in. The England full-back turned pundit and businessman was not actually present to witness the rout, but colleagues Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes were on hand to see it unfold in agonising detail from the stands. Ryan Giggs, the sporting director who also has a backroom role, was also at close hand in the technical area as the biggest game in Salford's history quickly turned sour. City made nine changes from the side that overran West Ham last weekend and took the opportunity to hand a debut to 20-year-old Mubama and further experience to 19-year-olds O'Reilly and Jahmai Simpson-Pusey. FA Cup fixtures & results Live on Sky Sports this week Simpson-Pusey was one of only two specialist defenders in the side along with the experienced Nathan Ake but, with a bench stacked with quality, Pep Guardiola had plenty of insurance should things have gone wrong. Yet Erling Haaland, Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden needed only to look on as City quickly established control. The hosts took the lead after only eight minutes as Matheus Nunes seized possession and fed Grealish, who played the ball wide for Doku to sweep past Matty Young from a tight angle. The second came after 20 minutes as Savinho played in Nunes and he pulled back for Mubama to slide in for a simple finish. Salford had chances to reply as City eased off the pressure, with Kylian Kouassi shooting at Ederson after a good run and later fluffing a shot from an excellent cross by Hakeeb Adelakun. Kevin Berkoe also snatched at an effort but City simply moved up through the gears in response. Doku weaved his way to the byline and O'Reilly firmly drove home his first senior goal before the break. Grealish, without a goal in club football since December 2023, got back on the scoresheet four minutes after the break. The England international might have scored from open play after Mubama raced onto a poor backpass to set him up, but he made no mistake from the spot after being felled by Ossama Ashley. City's fifth came from a fluid move soon after as Nunes released Doku and his first-time cross was deftly guided in by McAtee. Things quickly started to spiral out of control for Salford, who conceded a second penalty when Doku's shot struck the arm of captain Curtis Tilt. Doku this time sent Young the wrong way, and the keeper was beaten again when substitute Foden's driven ball was well-controlled and tucked away by McAtee. McAtee completed his treble nine minutes from time when he turned in a Grealish cross. Man City hat-trick hero James McAtee told the BBC: \"I was quite frustrated in the first half, wasn't seeing much of the ball. When the first one went in, my confidence was up and I kept scoring. \"I've been here since I was 10 and it's a special moment for me. Something I'll remember forever. I don't think I needed to prove myself but to get out there and show people what I can do, it's a good moment for me.\" Man Ciy boss Pep Guardiola told the BBC: \"Jack [Grealish] made a good assist as well, not just the goal. He scored a goal, made an assist. Jack's a special player, not always one to score a lot of goals but it depends on him. \"If he can perform well, he'll take the opportunity to keep going and going. All the players depend on the performance in training sessions and when they have minutes to play. It's simple, not just for Jack, for all of them. \"I've been manager here for more than 500 games and we've made an incredible 487 or 488 games. Then we had 11, 12 or 13 bad games. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"The problem that we've had is that we've had an incredible amount of injuries so we could not train and we could not compete. It's so difficult but step by step, people are coming back. \"This season or maybe next season, new players come in and you have to fight for your position. When someone pushes you, you have competition and you give your best.\" Salford boss Karl Robinson told the BBC: \"You always know you're at the mercy of the quality of the competition. \"Man City and Pep have never disrespected anybody and they showed us why they are what they are and why he is who he is. It's about dusting ourselves off, we've come on so much in 12 months and to be where we are in the league. \"We have one goal and that is to get out of this league. This is a glimmer of what we want to be and we know we've got so much to improve and we know where we want to be.\" Tom from Southampton became a millionaire for free with Super 6!

The later games finished like so: The mid-afternoon games went as follows: And the five earlier games: Advertisement Coventry City, last year‚Äôs semi-finalists, are through to the fourth round of this season‚Äôs FA Cup! Coventry overcame Sheffield Wednesday 4-3 on penalties after an entertaining 1-1 draw. And that brings today‚Äôs action to a close. Getty Images Pep Guardiola has revealed that Kyle Walker has asked to leave Manchester City, opening the door to a potential exit during the January transfer window. Asked why Walker was not in the squad for Saturday‚Äôs clash, Guardiola took a moment before saying: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not easy for me to say because he should say, but he‚Äôs not here, so two days ago Kyle asked to explore the options to play abroad at the end of his career. ‚ÄúHe asked two years ago after the treble, Bayern Munich I think wanted him but the offer was not good enough and I and the club (told) him how important he is. You cannot understand the success we have had these years without Kyle, it‚Äôs impossible, he gave us something we didn‚Äôt have, he‚Äôs been amazing. ‚ÄúBut now in his mind he would like to explore already to go to another country to play the last years for many reasons, and for that reason I played other players whose mind is here.‚Äù Although Guardiola did not explain exactly why Walker has asked to leave before the end of the season, he did suggest that Walker no longer feels like he can play at his best level at City. ‚ÄúMaybe I am wrong but still I am pretty convinced that there is not one person in our jobs, whatever job, that doesn‚Äôt want to be where they can‚Äôt perform or be what they want to be,‚Äù said Guardiola. ‚ÄúHe asked just to explore, it doesn‚Äôt mean it is going to happen because you never know. I respect him a lot because I am more than grateful for what he has done for us, he has been important with the England national team, important for our team but he said, ‚ÄòI want to explore in my mind and my heart‚Äô. Honestly I don‚Äôt know if it will happen.‚Äù GO FURTHER Kyle Walker has asked to leave Manchester City, says Pep Guardiola Salford City manager Karl Robinson, speaking to BBC Match of the Day after the game, said: \"Manchester City and Pep Guardiola have never disrespected anybody and tonight they showed us why they are what they are and why he is who he is. \"It's about dusting ourselves off... this is a glimmer of what we want to be and we know we've got so much to improve and we know where we want to be. \"I said to the players I would have taken eight goals conceded in seven games, I just didn't expect them to all come in one! We're proud of them, I really am. They never let me down. We'll learn because of today. \"You take it on the chin. You hope for these glamour ties and we managed to get it. This was never a game we would look at and use as a disappointment moving forward. We make sure we plan properly for our next game.\" Getty Images A lovely moment for James McAtee as the Salford-born star was mobbed by delighted team-mates after his third. The 22-year-old quadrupled his overall tally for Manchester City today, going from one senior goal for City to four. Not bad for a day's work. Getty Images In the third late kick-off today, Coventry City had led fellow Championship side Sheffield Wednesday since midway through the first half, when Liam Kitching scored. But Wednesday have pulled one back in the 90th minute! Anthony Musaba with it, netting after a corner while Coventry were down to 10 men with Luis Binks off the pitch due to a cut eye. Frustrating for the hosts. Into extra time we go... Advertisement Getty Images A full-time score from one of the three later kick-offs: Leeds United 1, Harrogate Town 0. A really creditable performance from the League Two underdogs against the Championship heavyweights, but Largie Ramazani's header just before the hour mark sees Daniel Farke's men progress. Getty Images Traditionally, players who score a hat-trick can take the match ball home with them. And by the looks of it, James McAtee isn't letting anyone else get near it! Getty Images A round of applause from the Salford players to the fans, and vice versa. The players gave their best efforts on the field against massively tough opposition, and fair play to the supporters, who were excellently loud throughout despite what was unfolding in front of them. They certainly didn't disgrace themselves. Getty Images/The Athletic Manchester City cruise to a dominant 8-0 victory against Salford led by James McAtee's first senior hat-trick. City progress to the fourth round of the FA Cup with ease. Getty Images Hat-trick hero James McAtee, speaking to the BBC post-match, said: \"I was quite frustrated in the first half, wasn't seeing much of the ball. When the first one went in, my confidence was up and I kept scoring. \"I've been here since I was 10 and it's a special moment for me. Something I'll remember forever. \"I don't think I needed to prove myself but to get out there and show people what I can do, it's a good moment for me.\" Advertisement Getty Images No stoppage time needed, the referee showing mercy even when City wouldn't. It might've been nine but Gundogan had one cleared off the line with the last kick. Great day for McAtee, who was rightly named man-of-the-match after that hat-trick. Now to see if it earns him more minutes... Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola gives counterpart Karl Robinson a warm embrace. Nice to see. Getty Images That's the ball game! A combination of Matty Young and Curtis Tilt keep out Ilkay Gundogan's effort on the line to prevent it becoming nine. And referee Josh Smith blows his whistle to confirm City's passage into fourth round. Salford tried very hard but ultimately came up short. 88' Manchester City 8-0 Salford With the end of the game in sight, three positive moments for Salford. They bring on 16-year-old Will Wright, the 6ft 3ins teenager. What a moment for the kid. He was born in 2008! Then, on the pitch, Jon Taylor is played in, one-on-one, and shoots powerfully towards the near post, well tipped behind by Ederson, side netting. From the corner, Conor McAleny volleys the initial header away goalwards... side netting. Both decent efforts, both tricked the away fans into cheering, thinking it had gone in. No suck luck. On either occasion. Getty Images 84' Manchester City 8-0 Salford It's McAtee's third today, and his second with his weaker right foot. City passed it around on the edge of the Salford area, Gundogan out to Grealish, who was the spare man on the left side. He cut it back across the box, the ball was a bit in front of McAtee but he slid in and the ball bobbled in messily at the far post. What a day for the 22-year-old from... Salford. Advertisement 81' Manchester City 8-0 Salford It is eight! A day for Salford to forget. One that James McAtee, though, will probably never forget. It's a home hat-trick for the midfielder! Getty Images A superb performance from Jeremy Doku. A man-of-the-match showing, for me. Getty Images A lot of City fans in the South Stand celebrated that seventh goal by looking up to Salford's away section in the top tier and waving goodbye to the many streaming out. There's been cries of 'we want 10'. And now here comes the Poznan. Given the United links, it's no mercy.",

                "content": "Liverpool is a cathedral and port city and metropolitan borough in Merseyside, England, which had a population of 496,770 in 2022.[3] It is on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary, near the Irish Sea, 178 miles (286 km) northwest of London. Liverpool is the fifth largest city in the United Kingdom and the administrative headquarters of the Liverpool City Region, a combined authority area with a population of over 1.5 million.[5] Established as a borough in Lancashire in 1207, Liverpool became significant in the late 17th century when the Port of Liverpool was heavily involved in the Atlantic slave trade. The port also imported cotton for the Lancashire textile mills, and became a major departure point for English and Irish emigrants to North America. Liverpool rose to global economic importance at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century and was home to the first intercity railway, the first non-combustible warehouse system (the Royal Albert Dock), and a pioneering elevated electrical railway; it was granted city status in 1880 and was moved from Lancashire to the newly created county of Merseyside in 1974. It entered a period of decline in the mid-20th century, but has experienced regeneration since the European Union selected it as the European Capital of Culture in 2008,[a] which was reported to have generated over ¬£800 million for the local economy within a year.[6][7] The economy of Liverpool is diversified and encompasses tourism, culture, maritime, hospitality, healthcare, life sciences, advanced manufacturing, creative, and digital sectors.[8][9][10] The city is home to the UK's second highest number of art galleries, national museums, listed buildings, and parks and open spaces, with only London having more.[11] It is often used as a filming location due to its architecture, and was the fifth most visited UK city by foreign tourists in 2022.[12] It has produced numerous musicians, most notably the Beatles, and artists from the city have had more UK No. 1 hit singles than anywhere else.[13] It has also produced academics, actors, artists, comedians, filmmakers, poets, scientists, sportspeople, and writers. It is the home of Premier League football teams Everton and Liverpool. The world's oldest still-operating mainline train station, Liverpool Lime Street, is in the city centre; it is also served by the underground Merseyrail network. The city's port was the fourth largest in the UK in 2023, with numerous shipping and freight lines having headquarters and offices there.[14] Residents of Liverpool are often called \"Scousers\" in reference to scouse, a local stew made popular by sailors in the city, while \"Scouse\" is also the most common name given to the local accent. The city's cultural and ethnic diversity is a result of attracting immigrants, especially from Ireland, Scandinavia, and Wales; it is also the home of a large black and Chinese community, and the first mosque in England.[15] The name comes from the Old English lifer, meaning thick or muddy water, and p≈çl, meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as Liuerpul.[16][17] According to the Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names, \"The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained\".[18] The place appearing as Leyrpole, in a legal record of 1418, may also refer to Liverpool.[19] Other origins of the name have been suggested, including \"elverpool\", a reference to the large number of eels in the Mersey.[20] The adjective \"Liverpudlian\" was first recorded in 1833.[17] Although the Old English origin of the name Liverpool is beyond dispute, claims are sometimes made that the name Liverpool is of Welsh origin, but these are without foundation. The Welsh name for Liverpool is Lerpwl, from a former English local form Leerpool. This is a reduction of the form \"Leverpool\" with the loss of the intervocalic [v] (seen in other English names and words e.g. Daventry (Northamptonshire) > Danetry, never-do-well > ne‚Äôer-do-well). In the 19th century, some Welsh publications used the name \"Lle'r Pwll\" (\"(the) place (of) the pool\"), a reinterpretation of Lerpwl, probably in the belief that \"Lle'r Pwll\" was the original form. Another name, which is widely known even today, is Llynlleifiad, again a 19th-century coining. \"Llyn\" is pool, but \"lleifiad\" has no obvious meaning. G. Melville Richards (1910‚Äì1973), a pioneer of scientific toponymy in Wales, in \"Place Names of North Wales\",[21] does not attempt to explain it beyond noting that \"lleifiad\" is used as a Welsh equivalent of \"Liver\". A derivative form of a learned borrowing into Welsh (*llaf) of Latin lƒÅma (slough, bog, fen) to give \"lleifiad\" is possible, but unproven. In the Middle Ages, Liverpool existed firstly as farmland within the West Derby Hundred[22] before growing in to a small town of farmers, fishermen and tradesmen and tactical army base for King John of England. The town was planned with its own castle, although due to outbreaks of disease and its subordinance to the nearby Roman port of Chester, the town's growth and prosperity stagnated until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Substantial growth took place in the mid-late 18th century when the town became the most heavily involved European port in the Atlantic slave trade.[23] King John's letters patent of 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool (then spelt as Liuerpul). There is no evidence that the place had previously been a centre of any trade. The creation of the borough was probably due to King John deciding it would be a convenient place to embark men and supplies for his Irish campaigns, in particular John's Irish campaign of 1209.[24][25] The original street plan of Liverpool is said to have been designed by King John near the same time it was granted a royal charter, making it a borough. The original seven streets were laid out in the shape of a double cross: Bank Street (now Water Street), Castle Street, Chapel Street, Dale Street, Juggler Street (now High Street), Moor Street (now Tithebarn Street) and Whiteacre Street (now Old Hall Street).[25] Liverpool Castle was built before 1235, it survived until it was demolished in the 1720s.[26] By the middle of the 16th century, the population was still around 600, although this was likely to have fallen from an earlier peak of 1000 people due to slow trade and the effects of the plague.[27][28][29] In the 17th century, there was slow progress in trade and population growth. Battles for control of the town were waged during the English Civil War, including a brief siege in 1644.[30] In 1699, the same year as its first recorded slave ship, Liverpool Merchant, set sail for Africa,[31] Liverpool was made a parish by Act of Parliament. But arguably, the legislation of 1695 that reformed the Liverpool council was of more significance to its subsequent development.[32] Since Roman times nearby Chester on the River Dee had been the region's principal port on the Irish Sea. However, as the Dee began to silt up, maritime trade from Chester became increasingly difficult and shifted towards Liverpool on the neighbouring River Mersey. The first of the Liverpool docks was constructed in 1715, and the system of docks gradually grew into a large interconnected system.[33] As trade from the West Indies, including sugar, surpassed that of Ireland and Europe, and as the River Dee continued to silt up, Liverpool began to grow with increasing rapidity. The first commercial wet dock was built in Liverpool in 1715.[34][35] Substantial profits from the slave trade and tobacco helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow, although several prominent local men, including William Rathbone, William Roscoe and Edward Rushton, were at the forefront of the local abolitionist movement.[36] The 19th century saw Liverpool rise to global economic importance. Pioneering, world first, technology and civic facilities launched in the city to serve the accelerating population which was fuelled by an influx of ethnic and religious communities from all around the world. By the start of the 19th century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool, and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, Liverpool and Manchester became the first cities to have an intercity rail link, through the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when Irish migrants began arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the Great Famine. While many Irish settled during this time in the city, a large percentage also emigrated to the United States or moved to the industrial centres of Lancashire, Yorkshire and the Midlands.[37] In her poetical illustration \"Liverpool\" (1832), which celebrates the city's worldwide commerce, Letitia Elizabeth Landon refers specifically to the Macgregor Laird expedition to the Niger River, at that time in progress.[38] This is to a painting by Samuel Austin, Liverpool, from the Mersey.[39] Britain was a major market for cotton imported from the Deep South of the United States, which fed the textile industry in the country. Given the crucial place cotton held in the city's economy, during the American Civil War Liverpool was, in the words of historian Sven Beckert, \"the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself.\"[40] Liverpool merchants helped to bring out cotton from ports blockaded by the Union Navy, built ships of war for the Confederacy, and supplied the South with military equipment and credit.[41] During the war, the Confederate Navy ship, the CSS Alabama, was built at Birkenhead on the Mersey, and the CSS Shenandoah surrendered there (being the final surrender at the end of the war). The city was also the center of Confederate purchasing war materiel, including arms and ammunition, uniforms, and naval supplies to be smuggled by British blockade runners to the South.[42] For periods during the 19th century, the wealth of Liverpool exceeded that of London,[43] and Liverpool's Custom House was the single largest contributor to the British Exchequer.[44] Liverpool was the only British city ever to have its own Whitehall office.[45] During this century, at least 40% of the world's entire trade passed through Liverpool.[46] In the early 19th century, Liverpool played a major role in the Antarctic sealing industry, in recognition of which Liverpool Beach in the South Shetland Islands is named after the city.[47] As early as 1851, the city was described as \"the New York of Europe\".[48] During the late 19th and early 20th century, Liverpool was attracting immigrants from across Europe. This resulted in the construction of a diverse array of religious buildings in the city for the new ethnic and religious groups, many of which are still in use today. The Deutsche Kirche Liverpool, Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas, Gustav Adolf Church and Princes Road Synagogue were all established in the 1800s to serve Liverpool's growing German, Greek, Nordic and Jewish communities, respectively. One of Liverpool's oldest surviving churches, St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, served the Polish community in its final years as a place of worship. The 20th century saw Liverpool's established rank as a global economic powerhouse challenged. Its strategic location as an international seaport made it particularly vulnerable in two World wars. Economic depressions (both in the United Kingdom and across the world), changing housing patterns and containerisation in the maritime industry contributed to a downtrend in the city's productivity and prosperity. Despite this, the city's influence on global popular culture excelled and by the end of the century, the continuing process of urban renewal paved the way for the redefined modern city of the 21st century. The period after the Great War was marked by social unrest, as society grappled with the massive war losses of young men, as well as trying to re-integrate veterans into civilian life and the economy. Unemployment and poor living standards greeted many ex-servicemen. Union organising and strikes took place in numerous locations, including a police strike in Liverpool among the City Police. Numerous colonial soldiers and sailors from Africa and India, who had served with the British Armed Forces, settled in Liverpool and other port cities. In June 1919, they were subject to attack by whites in racial riots; residents in the port included Swedish immigrants, and both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and housing. In this period, race riots also took place in other port cities.[49] The Housing Act 1919 resulted in mass council housing being built across Liverpool during the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1920s and 1930s, as much as 15% of the city's population (around 140,000 people) was relocated from the inner-city to new purpose built, lower density suburban housing estates, based on the belief that this would improve their standard of living, though the overall benefits have been contested.[50][51] Numerous private homes were also built during this era. During the Great Depression of the early 1930s, unemployment peaked at around 30% in the city. Liverpool was the site of Britain's first provincial airport, operating from 1930. During the Second World War, the critical strategic importance of Liverpool was recognised by both Hitler and Churchill. The city was heavily bombed by the Germans, suffering a blitz second only to London's.[52] The pivotal Battle of the Atlantic was planned, fought and won from Liverpool.[53] The Luftwaffe made 80 air raids on Merseyside, killing 2,500 people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the Seaforth Dock, the largest dock project in Britain. Since 1952, Liverpool has been twinned with Cologne, Germany, a city which also suffered severe aerial bombing during the war. In the 1950s and 1960s, much of the immediate reconstruction that took place in the city centre proved to be deeply unpopular. The historic portions of the city that had survived German bombing suffered extensive destruction during urban renewal. It has been argued that the so-called \"Shankland Plan\" of the 1960s, named after the town planner Graeme Shankland, led to compromised town planning and vast road-building schemes that devastated and divided inner city neighbourhoods. Concrete brutalist architecture, compromised visions, botched projects and grand designs that were never realised became the subject of condemnation. Historian Raphael Samuel labelled Graeme Shankland \"the butcher of Liverpool\".[54][55][56][57] A significant West Indian black community has existed in the city since the first two decades of the 20th century. Like most British cities and industrialised towns, Liverpool became home to a significant number of Commonwealth immigrants, beginning after World War I with colonial soldiers and sailors who had served in the area. More immigrants arrived after World War II, mostly settling in older inner-city areas such as Toxteth, where housing was less expensive. The black population of Liverpool was recorded at 1.90% in 2011. In the 2021 Census, 5.2% described themselves as black African, Caribbean, mixed white and black African, mixed white and Caribbean or 'other black'.[58][59] In the 1960s, Liverpool was the centre of the \"Merseybeat\" sound, which became synonymous with the Beatles and fellow Liverpudlian rock bands. Influenced by American rhythm and blues and rock music, they also in turn strongly affected American music. The Beatles became internationally known in the early 1960s and performed around the world together; they were, and continue to be, the most commercially successful and musically influential band in popular history. Their co-founder, singer, and composer John Lennon was killed in New York City in 1980. Liverpool Airport was renamed after him in 2002, the first British airport to be named in honour of an individual.[60][61] Previously part of Lancashire, and a county borough from 1889, Liverpool became a metropolitan borough within the newly created metropolitan county of Merseyside, in 1974. From the mid-1970s onwards, Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries declined due to restructuring of shipping and heavy industry, causing massive losses of jobs. The advent of containerisation meant that the city's docks became largely obsolete, and dock workers were made unemployed. By the early 1980s, unemployment rates in Liverpool were among the highest in the UK,[62] standing at 17% by January 1982 although, this was about half the level of unemployment that had affected the city during the Great Depression some 50 years previously.[63] During this period, Liverpool became a hub of fierce left-wing opposition to the central government in London.[64] Liverpool in the 1980s has been labelled as Britain's 'shock city'. Once the acclaimed second city of the British Empire which rivalled the capital city in global significance, Liverpool had collapsed in to its 'nadir' at the depths of post-colonial, post-industrial Britain.[65][66] In the late 20th century, Liverpool's economy began to recover. The late 1980s saw the opening of a regenerated Albert Dock which proved to be a catalyst for further regeneration.[67] In the mid-1990s, the city enjoyed growth rates higher than the national average. At the end of the 20th century, Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration, a process that continues today. Ongoing regeneration combined with the hosting of internationally significant events has helped to re-purpose Liverpool as one of the most visited, tourist orientated, cities in the United Kingdom. City leaders are focussing on long-term strategies to grow the city's population and economy, while national government explores the continuous potential for devolution in the city. In 2002, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited Liverpool to mark the Golden Jubilee. On speaking to an audience at Liverpool Town Hall, the Queen recognised Liverpool as \"one of the most distinctive and energetic parts of the United Kingdom\", and paid tribute to the city's \"major orchestras, world-class museums and galleries\". She also acknowledged Liverpool's bid to become the European Capital of Culture.[68][69] To celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002, the conservation charity Plantlife organised a competition to choose county flowers; the sea-holly was Liverpool's final choice. The initiative was designed to highlight growing threats to the UK's flower species and also ask the public about which flowers best represented their county.[70] Capitalising on the popularity of 1960s rock groups, such as the Beatles, as well as the city's world-class art galleries, museums and landmarks, tourism and culture have become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy. In 2004, property developer Grosvenor started the Paradise Project, a ¬£920 million development based on Paradise Street. This produced one of the most significant changes to Liverpool's city centre since the post-war reconstruction. Renamed as 'Liverpool One,' the centre opened in May 2008. In 2007, events and celebrations took place in honour of the 800th anniversary of the founding of the borough of Liverpool. Liverpool was designated as a joint European Capital of Culture for 2008. The celebrations included the erection of La Princesse, a large mechanical spider 20 metres high and weighing 37 tonnes, which represented the \"eight legs\" of Liverpool: honour, history, music, the Mersey, the ports, governance, sunshine and culture. La Princesse roamed the streets of the city during the festivities, and concluded by entering the Queensway Tunnel. Spearheaded by the multi-billion-pound Liverpool ONE development, regeneration continued throughout the 2010s. Some of the most significant redevelopment projects included new buildings in the Commercial District, King's Dock, Mann Island, around Lime Street, the Baltic Triangle, RopeWalks, and Edge Lane.[71][72][73] Changes to Liverpool's governance took place in 2014. The local authority of Liverpool City Council decided to pool its power and resources with surrounding boroughs through the formation of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority in a form of devolution. With a devolved budget granted by central government, the authority now oversees and invests in foremost strategic affairs throughout the Liverpool City Region, including major regeneration projects. The authority, along with Liverpool City Council itself, has embarked on long-term plans to grow the population and economy of the city.[74][75][76][77] By the 2020s, urban regeneration throughout the city continues. Liverpool Waters, a mixed-use development in the city's disused northern docklands, has been identified as one of the largest megaprojects in the UK's history. Everton's new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock was regarded as the largest single-site private sector development in the United Kingdom at the time of construction.[78][79] Major events, business and political conferences regularly take place in the city and form an important part of the economy. In June 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron launched the International Festival for Business in Liverpool, the world's largest business event in 2014,[80] and the largest in the UK since the Festival of Britain in 1951.[81] The Labour Party has chosen Liverpool numerous times since the mid 2010s for their annual Labour Party Conference. Liverpool hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2023. Liverpool has been a centre of invention and innovation. Railways, transatlantic steamships, municipal trams,[82] and electric trains were all pioneered in Liverpool as modes of mass transit. In 1829 and 1836, the first railway tunnels in the world were constructed under Liverpool (Wapping Tunnel). From 1950 to 1951, the world's first scheduled passenger helicopter service ran between Liverpool and Cardiff.[83] The first School for the Blind,[84] Mechanics' Institute,[85] High School for Girls,[86][87] council house,[88] and Juvenile Court[89] were all founded in Liverpool. Charities such as the RSPCA,[90] NSPCC,[91] Age Concern,[92] Relate, and Citizen's Advice Bureau[93] all evolved from work in the city. The first lifeboat station, public bath and wash-house,[94] sanitary act,[95] medical officer for health (William Henry Duncan), district nurse, slum clearance,[96] purpose-built ambulance,[97] X-ray medical diagnosis,[98] school of tropical medicine (Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine), motorised municipal fire-engine,[99] free school meal,[100] cancer research centre,[101] and zoonosis research centre[102] all originated in Liverpool. The first British Nobel Prize was awarded in 1902 to Ronald Ross, professor at the School of Tropical Medicine, the first school of its kind in the world.[103] Orthopaedic surgery was pioneered in Liverpool by Hugh Owen Thomas,[104] and modern medical anaesthetics by Thomas Cecil Gray. The world's first integrated sewer system was constructed in Liverpool by James Newlands, appointed in 1847 as the UK's first borough engineer.[105][106] Liverpool also founded the UK's first Underwriters' Association[107] and the first Institute of Accountants. The Western world's first financial derivatives (cotton futures) were traded on the Liverpool Cotton Exchange in the late 1700s.[108] In the arts, Liverpool was home to the first lending library (The Lyceum), athenaeum society (Liverpool Athenaeum), arts centre (Bluecoat Chambers),[109] and public art conservation centre (National Conservation Centre).[110] It is also home to the UK's oldest surviving classical orchestra (Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra)[111] and repertory theatre (Liverpool Playhouse).[112] In 1864, Peter Ellis built the world's first iron-framed, curtain-walled office building, Oriel Chambers, which was a prototype of the skyscraper. The UK's first purpose-built department store was Compton House, completed in 1867 for the retailer J.R. Jeffrey.[113] It was the largest store in the world at the time.[114] Between 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by John Hulley and Charles Pierre Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook.[115][116] The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics.[117] In 1865, Hulley co-founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the Olympic Charter. A concept devised by retail entrepreneur David Lewis, the first Christmas grotto opened in Lewis's department store in Liverpool in 1879.[118] Sir Alfred Lewis Jones, a shipowner, introduced bananas to the UK via Liverpool's docks in 1884.[119] The Mersey Railway, opened in 1886, incorporated the world's first tunnel under a tidal estuary[120] and the world's first deep-level underground stations (Liverpool James Street railway station). In 1889, borough engineer John Alexander Brodie invented the football goal net. He was also a pioneer in the use of pre-fabricated housing[122] and oversaw the construction of the UK's first ring road (A5058) and intercity highway (East Lancashire Road), as well as the Queensway Tunnel linking Liverpool and Birkenhead. Described as \"the eighth wonder of the world\" at the time of its construction, it was the longest underwater tunnel in the world for 24 years. In 1897, the Lumi√®re brothers filmed Liverpool,[123] including what is believed to be the world's first tracking shot,[124] taken from the Liverpool Overhead Railway, the world's first elevated electrified railway. The Overhead Railway was the first railway in the world to use electric multiple units, employ automatic signalling, and install an escalator. Liverpool inventor Frank Hornby was a visionary in toy development and manufacture, producing three of the most popular lines of toys in the 20th century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways (both in 1901), and Dinky Toys in 1934.[125] The British Interplanetary Society, founded in Liverpool in 1933 by Phillip Ellaby Cleator, is the world's oldest existing organisation devoted to the promotion of spaceflight. Its journal, the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, is the longest-running astronautical publication in the world.[126] In 1999, Liverpool was the first city outside London to be awarded blue plaques by English Heritage in recognition of the \"significant contribution made by its sons and daughters in all walks of life\".[127] For the purposes of local government, Liverpool is classified as a metropolitan borough with city status. The metropolitan borough is located within both the county of Merseyside and the Liverpool City Region. Each of these geographical areas is treated as an administrative area with different levels of local governance applying to each. Liverpool City Council is the governing body solely for the Metropolitan Borough of Liverpool and performs functions that are standard of an English Unitary Authority. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region reserve major strategic powers over such things as transport, economic development and regeneration for the city along with the 5 surrounding boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Combined Authority has competency over areas which have been devolved by national government and are specific to the city region.[128] Nevertheless, there are a few exceptions to local governance apart from these two structures. Liverpool was administered by Merseyside County Council between 1974 and 1986 and some residual aspects of organisation which date back to this time have survived. When the County Council was disbanded in 1986, most civic functions were transferred to Liverpool City Council. However, several authorities such as the police and fire and rescue service, continue to be run at a county-wide level. The county of Merseyside, therefore, continues to exist as an administrative area for a few limited services only, while the capability and capacity of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority is evolving over time.[129] The city also elects five members of Parliament (MPs) to the Westminster Parliament, all Labour as of the 2024 general election. Liverpool City Council operates under a constitution comprising 85 city councillors who are directly elected by the Liverpool electorate every 4 years and represent a variety of different political parties. The city councillors make decisions about local services for the city's people. At each election, the political party that wins the majority of the 85 council seats leads the council for the following 4 years. The local leader of this party assumes the role of Leader of the City Council who then chairs a Cabinet of 9 councillors who are assigned specific responsibilities known as 'portfolios'. The incumbent Leader of Liverpool City Council is Councillor Liam Robinson, who represents the Labour Party, which secured a large majority at the 2023 local election,[131] the Leader is also a member of the Mayor of the Liverpool City Regions cabinet (Separate from the City Council Cabinet), at present Robinson holds the portfolio of Cabinet Member for Innovation. The City Council's decisions and scrutiny of activities are undertaken by a number of different committees and panels which include the Overview and Scrutiny Committees, Scrutiny Panels, Regulatory Committees and other committees. The day-to-day management of the council is carried out by the management team which includes the Chief Executive and several directors and senior officers. The management team works with the Cabinet and councillors to deliver strategic direction and priorities such as the budget and the City Plan.[132][133] Every four years, the city elects 85 councillors from 64 local council wards.[134] During the 2023 Liverpool City Council election, the Labour Party consolidated its control of Liverpool City Council, following on from the previous elections. Out of the total 85 City Council seats up for election, The Labour Party won 61 seats (53.13% of the electorate's total votes), the Liberal Democrats won 15 seats (21.61% of the votes), the Green Party won 3 seats (9.76% of the votes), the Liverpool Community Independents won 3 seats (4.64% of the votes) and the Liberal Party won the remaining 3 seats (3.21% of the votes). The Conservative Party, the political party in power at national government, had no representation on Liverpool City Council. Only 27.27% of the eligible Liverpool electorate turned out to vote.[135] Throughout most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was a municipal stronghold of Toryism. However, support for the Conservative Party in recent times has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the monetarist economic policies of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher. After the 1979 general election, many have claimed that her victory contributed to longstanding high unemployment and decline in the city.[136] Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's key strongholds; however, the city has also seen hard times under Labour governments. Particularly in the Winter of Discontent (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes along with the rest of the United Kingdom, but also when it suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied for long periods.[137] In recent years, Liverpool City Council began an extensive improvement program designed to ensure that the authority makes efficient use of taxpayer's money and to encourage more business and investment in the city. Grosvenor Group, the property company responsible for Liverpool One, commended the changes as an \"opportunity for bold thinking in liverpool\".[138] In 2021, a highly critical government inspection and subsequent report of Liverpool City Council (referred to as the Caller report) identified multiple shortcomings at Liverpool City Council. The Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Robert Jenrick sent government commissioners to oversee the City Council's highways, regeneration, property management, governance and financial decision-making. The authority was compelled to commit to a three-year improvement plan in which the entire structure of the council would be overhauled. As a result of the intervention, major structural changes at the City Council took place by the 2023 United Kingdom local elections, which were labelled \"the most unpredictable [elections] in the city's history\". The number of electoral wards in the city was doubled from 30 to 64, while the overall number of City Councillors up for election was reduced from 90 to 85. In future, the council would also change to 'all out' elections every four years whereby every single City Councillor would be eligible for re-election at the same time. The role of elected city mayor was also abolished and the Council reverted to the previous Leader and Cabinet style of leadership. The outcome of the elections were seen not only as a test of how the general public would respond to the government intervention in the city, but also to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government as a whole.[139][140][141][142] Councillor Liam Robinson became the new Leader of Liverpool City Council at the 2023 City Council election. The Liverpool Strategic Futures Advisory Panel, chaired by the Mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram, and including several high-profile figures with experience in local government, was established. The panel was tasked with directing the council's long-term future outside of government intervention measures and to advise on plans and priorities that the city should pursue.[143] In February 2008, Liverpool City Council was reported to be the worst-performing council in the country, receiving just a one-star rating (classified as inadequate). The main cause of the poor rating was attributed to the council's poor handling of tax-payer money, including the accumulation of a ¬£20m shortfall while the city held the title of European Capital of Culture.[144] In April 2024, the Office for Local Government released a ranking of local authorities, placing Liverpool City Council 317th out of a possible 318.[145] The Lord Mayor of Liverpool is an ancient ceremonial role. Councillors within Liverpool City Council (not the general public) elect the Lord Mayor annually, who then serves a one-year term. The Lord Mayor is styled as the \"first citizen\" and is chosen to represent the city at civic functions and engagements, promote it to the wider world, support local charities and community groups, attend religious events, meet delegates from Liverpool's twin cities, chair council meetings and confer Honorary Freemen and associations.[146] The Lord Mayor is also the presiding officer for Liverpool City Council full meetings. . Liverpool is one of the six constituent boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Mayor of the Liverpool City Region is directly every four years by residents of those six boroughs and oversees the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. The Combined Authority is the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and is tasked with taking major strategic decisions on issues such as transport and investment, economic development, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure. The current Mayor is Steve Rotheram. Liverpool is included within five parliamentary constituencies, through which MPs are elected to represent the city in Westminster: Liverpool Riverside, Liverpool Walton, Liverpool Wavertree, Liverpool West Derby and Garston and Halewood.[147] At the last general election, all were won by Labour with representation being from Kim Johnson, Dan Carden, Paula Barker and Ian Byrne respectively.[148] Due to boundary changes prior to the 2010 election, the Liverpool Garston constituency was merged with most of Knowsley South to form the Garston and Halewood cross-boundary seat. At the most recent 2024 election, this seat was won by Maria Eagle of the Labour Party.[148] Liverpool has been described as having \"the most splendid setting of any English city.\"[149] At 53¬∞24‚Ä≤0‚Ä≥N 2¬∞59‚Ä≤0‚Ä≥WÔªø / Ôªø53.40000¬∞N 2.98333¬∞WÔªø / 53.40000; -2.98333 (53.4, ‚àí2.98), 176 miles (283 kilometres) northwest of London, located on the Liverpool Bay of the Irish Sea, Liverpool is built across a ridge of sandstone hills rising up to a height of around 230 feet (70 m) above sea-level at Everton Hill, which represents the southern boundary of the West Lancashire Coastal Plain. The Mersey Estuary separates Liverpool from the Wirral Peninsula. The boundaries of Liverpool are adjacent to Bootle, Crosby and Maghull in south Sefton to the north, and Kirkby, Huyton, Prescot and Halewood in Knowsley to the east. Liverpool experiences a temperate maritime climate (K√∂ppen: Cfb), like much of the British Isles, with relatively mild summers, cool winters and rainfall spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Rainfall and temperature records had been kept at Bidston Hill since 1867, but records for atmospheric pressure go back as far as at least 1846.[150] Bidston closed down in 2002 but the Met Office also has a weather station at Crosby. Since records began in 1867, temperatures have ranged from ‚àí17.6 ¬∞C (0.3 ¬∞F) on 21 December 2010 to 34.5 ¬∞C (94.1 ¬∞F) on 2 August 1990, although Liverpool Airport recorded a temperature of 35.0 ¬∞C (95.0 ¬∞F) on 19 July 2006.[151] The lowest amount of sunshine on record was 16.5 hours in December 1927 whereas the most was 314.5 hours in July 2013.[152][153] Tornado activity or funnel cloud formation is very rare in and around the Liverpool area and tornadoes that do form are usually weak. Recent tornadoes or funnel clouds in Merseyside have been seen in 1998 and 2014.[154][155] During the period 1981‚Äì2010, Crosby recorded an average of 32.8 days of air frost per year, which is low for the United Kingdom.[156] Snow is fairly common during the winter although heavy snow is rare. Snow generally falls between November and March but can occasionally fall earlier and later. In recent times, the earliest snowfall was on 1 October 2008[157] while the latest occurred on 15 May 2012.[158] Although historically, the earliest snowfall occurred on 10 September 1908[159] and the latest on 2 June 1975.[160] Rainfall, although light, is quite a common occurrence in Liverpool, with the wettest month on record being August 1956, which recorded 221.2 mm (8.71 in) of rain and the driest being February 1932, with 0.9 mm (0.035 in).[161] The driest year on record was 1991, with 480.5 mm (18.92 in) of rainfall and the wettest was 1872, with 1,159.9 mm (45.67 in).[162] Suburbs and districts of Liverpool include: In 2010, Liverpool City Council and the Primary Care Trust commissioned the Mersey Forest to complete \"A Green Infrastructure Strategy\" for the city.[171] Liverpool is a core urban element of a green belt region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, which is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.[172] Due to being already highly built up, the city contains limited portions of protected green belt area within greenfield throughout the borough at Fazakerley, Croxteth Hall and country park and Craven Wood, Woodfields Park and nearby golf courses in Netherley, small greenfield tracts east of the Speke area by the St Ambrose primary school, and the small hamlet of Oglet and the surrounding area south of Liverpool Airport.[173] The green belt was first drawn up in 1983 under Merseyside County Council[174] and the size in the city amounts to 530 hectares (5.3 km2; 2.0 sq mi).[175] Since the mid-20th century, Scouser has become the predominant demonym for the inhabitants of Liverpool, and is strongly associated with the Scouse accent and dialect of the city.[176] The Scouse accent is described as progressively diverging from the Lancastrian accent in the late 19th century.[177][178][179][180][181] The etymology of Scouser is derived from the traditional dish Scouse brought to the area by sailors travelling through Liverpool's port.[182][181][183] Prior to the establishment of Scouser as there have been a number of different terms used to refer to inhabitants of Liverpool of varying popularity and longevity: Professor Tony Crowley argues that up until the 1950s, inhabitants of Liverpool were generally referred to by a number of demonyms. He argues that there was a debate in the mid 20th century between the two rival terms of 'Liverpolitan' and 'Liverpudlian'. The debate surrounded the lexicology of these terms and their connotations of social class.[183][187] Professor John Belchem suggests that a series of other nicknames such as 'Dick Liver', 'Dicky Sam' and 'whacker' were used, but gradually fell out of use. Belchem and Philip Boland suggest that comedic radio presenters and entertainers brought the Liverpool identity to a national audience, which in turn encouraged locals to be gradually more known as 'scousers'. By the time that Frank Shaw's My Liverpool, a Celebration of 'Scousetown' was published in 1971, Belchem argues that 'Scouser' had firmly become the dominant demonym.[176][188][189] The city of Liverpool is at the core of a much larger and more populous metropolitan area, however, at the most recent UK Census in 2021, the area governed by Liverpool City Council had a population of 486,100, a 4.2% increase from the previous Census in 2011. This figure increased to 500,500 people by 2022, according to data from Liverpool City Council. Taking in to account how local government is organised within the cities and metropolitan areas of England, the Liverpool was the fifth largest of England's 'core cities' and had the second overall highest population density of those, by 2021.[201][202] The population of the city has steadily risen since the 2001 Census. As well as having a growing population, the population density also grew at the 2021 Census compared to the previous Census. Since 2011, its population size ranked 10th out of 309 local authority areas.[203] The population of the city is comparatively younger than that of England as a whole. Family life in the city is also growing at odds with the North West England region as a whole: At the 2021 Census, the percentage of households including a couple without children increased in Liverpool, but fell across the North West. The percentage of people aged 16 years and over (excluding full-time students) who were employed also increased in Liverpool compared to the overall North West region where it fell. The 2021 Census also showed that Liverpool's ethnic and international population was growing. The number of residents in the city born outside of England has increased since the previous Census, while the number of residents who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK has also increased at a faster rate than England as a whole. The overall share of the city's population who identified as Asian and Black increased, while the percentage who identified as white decreased in the city compared with previous Census.[204] It has been argued that the city can claim to have one of the strongest Irish heritages in the United Kingdom, with as many as 75 percent (estimated) of Liverpool's population with some form of Irish ancestry.[205] The growing population of Liverpool in the 21st century reverses a trend which took place between the 1930s and 2001, when the population of the city proper effectively halved. At the 1931 United Kingdom census, Liverpool's population reached an all-time high of 846,302. Following this peak, in response to central government policy, the Council authority of Liverpool then built and owned large several 'new town' council estates in the suburbs within Liverpool's metropolitan area. Tens of thousands of people were systematically relocated to new housing in areas such as Halton, Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral, Cheshire West and Chester, West Lancashire, Warrington and as far as North Wales. Such a mass relocation and population loss during this time was common practice for many British cities, including London and Manchester, In contrast, satellite towns such as Kirkby, Skelmersdale and Runcorn saw a corresponding rise in their populations (Kirkby being the fastest growing town in Britain during the 1960s).[206][207][204][208] Liverpool is typically grouped with the wider Merseyside (plus Halton) area for the purpose of defining its metropolitan footprint, and there are several methodologies. Sometimes, this metropolitan area is broadened to encompass urban settlements in the neighbouring counties of Lancashire and Cheshire.[209][210] The Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom uses the international standardised International Territorial Levels (ITLs) to divide up the economic territory of the UK. This enables the ONS to calculate regional and local statistics and data. The ONS uses a series of codes to identify these areas. In order of hierarchy from largest area to smallest area, Liverpool is part of the following regions:[211][212][213] North West England (code TLD) At the 2021 Census, the ITL 1 region of North West England had a usual resident population of 7,417,300.[214] Merseyside (code TLD7) The ITL 2 region of Merseyside is defined as the area comprising East Merseyside (TLD71) plus Liverpool (TLD72), Sefton (TLD73) and Wirral (TLD74). At the 2021 Census, the population of this area was as follows:[215] East Merseyside (TLD71): Liverpool (TLD72) = 486,100 Sefton (TLD73) = 279,300 Wirral (TLD74) = 320,200 Therefore, the total population of the ITL 2 Merseyside region was 1,551,500 based on the 2021 Census. The smallest ITL 3 area classed as Liverpool (code TLD72), therefore, had a population of 486,100 at the 2021 Census. At the 2021 Census, the ONS used a refreshed concept of built-up areas (BUAs) based on the physical built environment, using satellite imagery to recognise developed land, such as cities, towns, and villages. This allows the ONS to investigate economic and social statistics based on actual settlements where most people live. Data from the 2021 Census is not directly comparable with 2011 Census data due to this revised methodology. Using the population figures of BUAs at the 2021 Census (excluding London), Liverpool Built-up Area is the third largest in England with some 506,565 usual residents (behind only Birmingham and Leeds). Liverpool's built-up area is, therefore, larger than the major English cities of Bristol, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham and Sheffield.[216] Excluding London, the Liverpool City Region was the 4th largest combined authority area in England, by 2021. The population is approximately 1.6 million. The Liverpool City Region is a political and economic partnership between local authorities including Liverpool, plus the Metropolitan boroughs of Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens, Wirral and the Borough of Halton. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority exercises strategic governance powers for the region in many areas. The economic data of the Liverpool city region is of particular policy interest to the Office for National Statistics, particularly as the British Government continuously explores the potential to negotiate increased devolved powers for each combined authority area.[217][218][219][220] A 2011 report, Liverpool City Region ‚Äì Building on its Strengths, by Lord Heseltine and Terry Leahy, stated that \"what is now called Liverpool City Region has a population of around 1.5 million\", but also referred to \"an urban region that spreads from Wrexham and Flintshire to Chester, Warrington, West Lancashire and across to Southport\", with a population of 2.3 million.[221] In 2006, in an attempt to harmonise the series of metropolitan areas across the European Union, ESPON (now European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion) released a study defining a \"Liverpool/Birkenhead Metropolitan area\" with an estimated population of 2,241,000 people. The metro area comprised a functional urban area consisting of a contiguous urban sprawl, labour pool, and commuter Travel to work areas. The analysis defined this metropolitan area as Liverpool itself, combined with the surrounding areas of Birkenhead, Wigan/Ashton, Warrington, Widnes/Runcorn, Chester, Southport, Ellesmere Port, Ormskirk and Skelmersdale.[222] Liverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered as one large polynuclear metropolitan area,[223][224][225] or megalopolis. In recent decades, Liverpool's population is becoming more multicultural. According to the 2021 census, 77% of all Liverpool residents described their ethnic group as White English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British. The remaining 23% were described as non-White English/British. Between 2011 and 2021, there was population growth across all ethnic groups, except 'White English/British' and 'Any Other', where there were overall losses. The number of 'Other White residents' in Liverpool also increased by almost 12,000 people, with notable increases in the 'Other Asian', 'Arab', and 'Other Mixed/Multiple' population categories. The non-White English/British population as a percentage of the total population across the 'newly organised city electoral wards' ranged from 5% in the Orrell Park ward to 69% in the Princes Park ward. 9 out of 10 Liverpool residents regarded English as their main language. The highest non-English languages in the city were Arabic (5,743 main speakers) followed by Polish (4,809 main speakers). Overall, almost 45,000 residents had a main language that was not English.[226] According to a 2014 survey, the ten most popular surnames of Liverpool and their occurrence in the population are:[228][229] Liverpool is home to Britain's oldest Black community, dating to at least the 1730s. Some Liverpudlians can trace their black ancestry in the city back ten generations.[230] Early Black settlers in the city included seamen, the children of traders sent to be educated, and freed slaves, since slaves entering the country after 1722 were deemed free men.[231] Since the 20th century, Liverpool is also noted for its large African-Caribbean,[4] Ghanaian,[232] and Somali[233] communities, formed of more recent African-descended immigrants and their subsequent generations. The city is also home to the oldest Chinese community in Europe; the first residents of the city's Chinatown arrived as seamen in the 19th century.[234] The traditional Chinese gateway erected in Liverpool's Chinatown is the largest such gateway outside China. Liverpool also has a long-standing Filipino community. Lita Roza, a singer from Liverpool who was the first woman to achieve a UK number one hit, had Filipino ancestry. The city is also known for its large Irish and Welsh populations.[235] In 1813, 10 per cent of Liverpool's population was Welsh, leading to the city becoming known as \"the capital of North Wales.\"[235] During, and in the decades following, the Great Irish Famine in the mid-19th century, up to two million Irish people travelled to Liverpool within one decade, with many subsequently departing for the United States.[236] By 1851, more than 20 per cent of the population of Liverpool was Irish.[237] At the 2001 Census, 1.17 per cent of the population were Welsh-born and 0.75 per cent were born in the Republic of Ireland, while 0.54 per cent were born in Northern Ireland,[238] but many more Liverpudlians are of legacy Welsh or Irish ancestry.[239] Other contemporary ethnicities include Indian,[4] Latin American,[240] Malaysian,[241] and Yemeni[242] communities, which number several thousand each. The thousands of migrants and sailors passing through Liverpool resulted in a religious diversity that is still apparent today. This is reflected in the equally diverse collection of religious buildings,[244] including two Christian cathedrals. Liverpool is known to be England's 'most Catholic city', with a Catholic population much larger than in other parts of England.[245] This is mainly due to high historic Irish migration to the city and their descendants since.[246] The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican Our Lady and St Nicholas, colloquially known as \"the sailors church\", which has existed near the waterfront since 1257. It regularly plays host to Catholic masses. Other notable churches include the Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas (built in the Neo-Byzantine architecture style), and the Gustav Adolf Church (the Swedish Seamen's Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles). Liverpool's wealth as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous cathedrals in the 20th century. The Anglican Cathedral, which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and plays host to the annual Liverpool Shakespeare Festival, has one of the longest naves, largest organs and heaviest and highest peals of bells in the world. The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral, on Mount Pleasant next to Liverpool Science Park, was initially planned to be even larger. Of Sir Edwin Lutyens's original design, only the crypt was completed. The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by Sir Frederick Gibberd. While this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens' original design, it still incorporates the largest panel of stained glass in the world. The road running between the two cathedrals is called Hope Street. The cathedral has long been colloquially referred to as \"Paddy's Wigwam\" due to its shape.[247] Liverpool contains several synagogues, of which the Grade I listed Moorish Revival Princes Road Synagogue is architecturally the most notable. Princes Road is widely considered to be the most magnificent of Britain's Moorish Revival synagogues and one of the finest buildings in Liverpool.[248] Liverpool has a thriving Jewish community with a further two orthodox Synagogues, one in the Allerton district of the city and a second in the Childwall district of the city where a significant Jewish community reside. A third orthodox Synagogue in the Greenbank Park area of L17 has recently closed and is a listed 1930s structure. There is also a Lubavitch Chabad House and a reform Synagogue. Liverpool has had a Jewish community since the mid-18th century. The Jewish population of Liverpool is around 5,000.[249] The Liverpool Talmudical College existed from 1914 until 1990, when its classes moved to the Childwall Synagogue.[citation needed] Liverpool also has a Hindu community, with a Mandir on Edge Lane, Edge Hill. The Shri Radha Krishna Temple from the Hindu Cultural Organisation in Liverpool is located there.[250] Liverpool also has the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Wavertree[251] and a Bah√° º√≠ Centre in the same area.[252] The city had the earliest Mosque in England and possibly the UK, founded in 1887 by William Abdullah Quilliam, a lawyer who had converted to Islam who set up the Liverpool Muslim Institute in a terraced house on West Derby Road.[253] Apart from the first mosque in England which now houses a museum,[254][255] the largest and main one, Al-Rahma mosque, was also the third purpose-built mosque in the United Kingdom.[256] The second largest mosque in Liverpool is the Masjid Al-Taiseer.[257] Other mosques in the city include the Bait ul Lateef Ahmadiyya Mosque,[258] Hamza Center (Community Center),[259] Islamic community centre,[260] Liverpool Mosque and Islamic Institute,[261] Liverpool Towhid Centre,[262] Masjid Annour,[263] and the Shah Jalal Mosque.[264] Liverpool forms an integral part of North West England's economy, the third largest regional economy in the United Kingdom. The city is also a major contributor to the economy of Liverpool City Region, worth over ¬£40 billion per year.[268][269][270] The local authority area governed by Liverpool City Council accounts for 39% of the Liverpool city region's total jobs, 40% of its total GVA and 35% of its total businesses. At the local authority level, the city's GVA (balanced) at current basic prices was ¬£14.3 billion in 2021. Its GDP at current market prices was ¬£15.9 billion. This equates to ¬£32,841 per head of the population.[271][272] At the 2021 United Kingdom census, 51.1% of Liverpool's population aged 16 years and over was classed as employed, 44.2% economically inactive and 4.8% unemployed. Of those employed, the most popular industries providing the employment were human health and social work activities (18.7%), wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motor cycles (15%), education (10.8%), public administration and defence; compulsory social security (7.3%), accommodation and food service activities (6.8%), construction (6.5%), transport and storage (5.8%), manufacturing (5.5%) and professional, scientific and technical activities (5.2%).[273] According to the ONS Business Register and Employment Survey 2021, some industries within Liverpool perform strongly compared to other local authorities in Great Britain. In terms of absolute number of jobs per industry in Great Britain's local authority areas, Liverpool features in the national top 10 for human health and social work activities; arts, entertainment and recreation; public administration and defence; compulsory social security; accommodation and food service activities and real estate activities. Liverpool features in the national top 20 for number of jobs in education; construction; wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; transportation and storage; financial and insurance activities and professional, scientific and technical activities.[274] In 2023, Liverpool City Council set out an economic growth plan for the city over the following 20 years. The City Council will have particular focus on economic sectors such as the visitor economy (tourism), culture, life sciences, digital and creative sectors, and advanced car manufacturing.[275] According to the International passenger Survey, from the ONS, Liverpool was one of the top 5 most visited cities in the UK by overseas tourists in 2022. As of the same year, the city's tourist industry was worth a total of ¬£3.5 billion annually and was part of a larger city region tourist industry worth ¬£5 billion. A consistent calendar of major events, as well as a plethora of cultural attractions, continue to provide a significant draw for tourists. Tourism related to the Beatles is worth an estimated ¬£100m to the Liverpool economy each year alone. Liverpool One, as well as a growing retail offer overall, has led to the city being one of the most prominent destinations for shopping in the UK. Liverpool Cruise Terminal, which is situated close to the Pier Head, enables tourists to berth in the centre of the city.[276][277][278][279][280][281][282] Liverpool is home to the Knowledge Quarter, a 450-acre city centre district that hosts some of the world's most influential institutions in science, health, technology, education, music and the creative performing arts. The UK government has also identified the city as a 'pharmaceutical production superpower' and one of the UK's leading regions for bioprocessing. The accolade led to the government choosing the city for England's second ever 'Investment Zone' in 2023. This will involve millions of pounds being invested over the coming years in to science orientated districts including the Knowledge Quarter and the so-called 'pharma cluster' in the city suburb of Speke. The two clusters form an internationally significant role in infectious disease control. Liverpool City Council also plan to invest in the city's Baltic Triangle, which is renowned in the creative and digital industries.[283][284][285][286][287][288] Car manufacturing also takes place in the city at the Jaguar Land Rover Halewood plant, where the Range Rover Evoque model is assembled. In 2023, Jaguar Land Rover announced that the Halewood plant would begin to shift its focus to electric car production.[289][290] Historically, the economy of Liverpool was centred on the city's port and manufacturing base. Today, the Port of Liverpool is the UK's fourth largest port by tonnage of freight, handling over 30 million tonnes in 2020. The city is also the UK's largest port for transatlantic trade, handling 45% of the country's trade from the United States. In 2023, the city was chosen by the British government to be a designated Freeport to encourage growing international commerce. The Liverpool2 container terminal, completed in 2022, has greatly increased the volume of cargo which Liverpool is able to handle and has facilitated the world's biggest container vessels.[291][292][293][294][295][296][297] Liverpool is also home to numerous UK headquarters, or the major strategic branch offices, of many shipping and freight lines including: Atlantic Container Line,[298] Bibby Line,[299] Borchard Lines Ltd,[300] CMA CGM,[301] Hapag-Lloyd,[302] Independent Container Line,[303] Irish Ferries,[304] Maersk Line,[305] Mediterranean Shipping Company[306] and Zim Integrated Shipping Services.[307] Liverpool's rich architectural base has helped the city become the second most filmed city in the UK outside London. As well as being a featured location in its own right, it often doubles up for Chicago, London, Moscow, New York City, Paris and Rome. The Depot studios, close to the city centre, provide space for film and TV productions.[308][309] Major economic projects planned for the city include the revitalisation of disused land in the North docks/Ten Streets area, Liverpool Waters and a new purpose built TV studio at the former Littlewoods Pools building, adjacent to the Depot.[310][311][312] The Liverpool City Region GDP in 2021 was ¬£40.479 billion. The 6 contributing boroughs to this GDP were as follows:[313] The policy agenda of the British Government is to continuously monitor the economy and productivity of the UK's core cities within the context of their respective city regions. The government's longer-term plan is to assess each area's potential for increased devolution and transfer of additional powers and budgets from central government in Whitehall to their corresponding combined authorities. As such, official statistics about Liverpool's economy within the context of the Liverpool City Region, are closely monitored by the Office for National Statistics. This allows policy and decision makers to more accurately assess the 'functional economic area' of the city, which is not bound by traditional local government geographies.[314][315][316][317][318] As of 2023, there are 10 city regions in England with Combined Authorities. The economy of Liverpool's combined authority area in comparison to the other city regions is as follows: Liverpool's long commercial history has given rise to a considerable variety of architectural styles found within the city, ranging from 16th century Tudor buildings to modern-day contemporary architecture.[320] The majority of buildings in the city date from the late-18th century onwards, the period during which the city grew into one of the foremost powers in the British Empire.[321] There are over 2,500 listed buildings in Liverpool, of which 27 are Grade I listed[322] and 85 are Grade II* listed.[323] The city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from Westminster and significant number of Georgian houses still exist.[324][325] This richness of architecture has subsequently seen Liverpool described by English Heritage, as England's finest Victorian city.[326] The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Known as the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City, the sites were added in recognition of the city's role in the development of international trade and docking technology.[327] However, this status was revoked in July 2021, when UNESCO resolved that recent and proposed developments, such as the Bramley-Moore Dock Stadium and Liverpool Waters projects, had resulted in the \"serious deterioration\" of the area's significance.[328] As a major British port, the docks in Liverpool have historically been central to the city's development. Several major docking firsts have occurred in the city including the construction of the world's first enclosed wet dock (the Old Dock) in 1715 and the first ever hydraulic lifting cranes.[329] The best-known dock in Liverpool is the Royal Albert Dock, which was constructed in 1846 and today comprises the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in Britain.[330] Built under the guidance of Jesse Hartley, it was considered to be one of the most advanced docks anywhere in the world upon completion and is often attributed with helping the city to become one of the most important ports in the world. Today, the Royal Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two hotels as well as the Merseyside Maritime Museum, International Slavery Museum, Tate Liverpool and The Beatles Story. North of the city centre is Stanley Dock, home to the Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse, which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in terms of area[331] and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building.[332] One of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the Pier Head, renowned for the trio of buildings ‚Äì the Royal Liver Building, the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building ‚Äì which sit upon it. Collectively referred to as the Three Graces, these buildings stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. Built in a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol of 'maritime Liverpool' and are regarded by many as contributing to one of the most impressive waterfronts in the world.[333][334][335][336] In the 21st century, several areas along Liverpool's waterfront have undergone significant redevelopment. Among the notable developments are the Museum of Liverpool, the construction of the Liverpool Arena, ACC Liverpool and Exhibition Centre Liverpool on King's Dock, Alexandra Tower and 1 Princes Dock on Prince's Dock and Liverpool Marina around Coburg and Brunswick Docks. The Wheel of Liverpool opened on 25 March 2010.[337][338] However, plans to redevelop parts of Liverpool city centre have been marred by controversy. In December 2016, a newly formed company called North Point Global Ltd. was given the rights to develop part of the docks under the \"New Chinatown\" working name. Though heavily advertised in Liverpool, Hong Kong and Chinese cities with high-profile advertisements and videos, the \"New Chinatown\" development failed to materialise.[339] In January 2018, the Liverpool Echo and Asia Times revealed that the site remained sans any construction. North Point Global as well as its subcontractor \"Bilt\" had both declared bankruptcy, and the small investors (mostly middle class couples) who had already paid money for the apartments had lost most of their savings in them.[340] Liverpool's historic position as one of the most important trading ports in the world has meant that over time many grand buildings have been constructed in the city as headquarters for shipping firms, insurance companies, banks and other large firms. The great wealth this brought then allowed for the development of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators to 'run the city with pride'.[341] The commercial district is centred on the Castle Street, Dale Street and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with many of the area's roads still following their medieval layout. Having developed predominantly over a period of three centuries, the area is regarded as one of the most important architectural locations in the city, as recognised by its inclusion in Liverpool's former World Heritage site.[342] The oldest building in the area is the Grade I listed Liverpool Town Hall, which is located at the top of Castle Street and dates from 1754. Often regarded as the city's finest piece of Georgian architecture, the building is known as one of the most extravagantly decorated civic buildings anywhere in Britain.[343][344] Also on Castle Street is the Grade I listed Bank of England Building, constructed between 1845 and 1848, as one of only three provincial branches of the national bank.[343] Among the other buildings in the area are the Tower Buildings, Albion House (the former White Star Line headquarters), the Municipal Buildings and Oriel Chambers,[345] which is considered to be one of the earliest Modernist style buildings ever built.[346] The area around William Brown Street is referred to as the city's 'Cultural Quarter', owing to the presence of numerous civic buildings, including the William Brown Library, Walker Art Gallery, Picton Reading Rooms and World Museum Liverpool. The area is dominated by neo-classical architecture, of which the most prominent, St George's Hall,[347] is widely regarded as the best example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe.[348] A Grade I listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with \"S.P.Q.L.\" (Latin senatus populusque Liverpudliensis), meaning \"the senate and people of Liverpool\". William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments and sculptures, including Wellington's Column and the Steble Fountain. Many others are located around the area, particularly in St John's Gardens, which was specifically developed for this purpose.[349] The William Brown Street area has been likened to a modern recreation of the Roman Forum.[350] While the majority of Liverpool's architecture dates from the mid-18th century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One of the oldest surviving buildings is Speke Hall, a Tudor manor house located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598.[351] The building is one of the few remaining timber framed Tudor houses left in the north of England and is particularly noted for its Victorian interiors, which were added in the mid-19th century.[352] In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former manor houses including Croxteth Hall and Woolton Hall, which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively.[353] The oldest building within the city centre is the Grade I listed Bluecoat Chambers,[354] which was built between 1717 and 1718. Constructed in British Queen Anne style architecture,[355][356] the building was influenced in part by the work of Christopher Wren[357] and was originally the home of the Bluecoat School (who later moved to a larger site in Wavertree in the south of the city). Since 1908, it has acted as a centre for arts in Liverpool.[355] Liverpool is noted for having two Cathedrals, each of which imposes over the landscape around it.[358] The Anglican Cathedral, which was constructed between 1904 and 1978, is the largest Cathedral in Britain[359] and the fifth largest in the world. Designed and built in Gothic style, it is regarded as one of the greatest buildings to have been constructed during the 20th century[360] and was described by former British Poet Laureate, John Betjeman, as \"one of the great buildings of the world\".[361] The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral was constructed between 1962 and 1967 and is known as one of the first cathedrals to break the traditional longitudinal design.[362] In the 21st century, many parts of Liverpool's city centre have undergone significant redevelopment and regeneration after years of decline. So far, the largest of these developments has been Liverpool One, which saw almost ¬£1 billion invested in the redevelopment of 42 acres (17 hectares) of land, providing new retail, commercial, residential and leisure space.[363] Around the north of the city centre, several new skyscrapers have also been constructed including the RIBA award-winning Unity Buildings and West Tower, which at 140m is Liverpool's tallest building. Many redevelopment schemes are also in progress including Circus,[364] King's Dock,[365] Paddington Village[366] and Liverpool Waters.[367] There are many other notable buildings in Liverpool, including the art deco former terminal building of Speke Airport, the University of Liverpool's Victoria Building, (which provided the inspiration for the term Red Brick University), and the Adelphi Hotel, which was in the past considered to be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world.[368] The Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England describes Merseyside's Victorian Parks as collectively the \"most important in the country\".[369] Liverpool has ten listed parks and cemeteries, including two Grade I and five Grade II*, more than any other English city apart from London.[370] Liverpool has an extensive transport infrastructure that connects the city with its metropolitan area, the rest of the United Kingdom, Europe and the world. Various modes of transport provide considerable connections by road, rail, air and sea. The local network of buses, trains and ferries is managed by Merseytravel on behalf of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and the Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region. The Mayor and Combined Authority have control of a devolved transport budget and associated transport powers for this local system. The city's major port and international airport provide global links for both passengers and freight.[371][372] The city sits at the centre of a much larger metropolitan area. The city's suburbs run contiguously into the neighbouring boroughs defined by the ONS as the Liverpool Built-up Area. The wider City Region and Merseyside in general is densely urbanised and divided by several motorways and major roads. The city is served by a network motorways. The three motorways in closest proximity are the M58 to the north, and M62 and M57 to the east. To the north, the M58 motorway runs 12 miles and provides links to the neighbouring counties of Lancashire and Greater Manchester, finally joining with the M6 west of Wigan.[373] To the east, the M62 runs across the north of the UK, ultimately connecting Liverpool with Hull on the opposite coast, and along the route to several large cities including Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. The M62 also provides a connection to both the M6 and M1 motorways, providing indirect links to more distant areas including Birmingham, London, Nottingham, Preston and Sheffield.[374][375] To the east, but running north-south, the M57 acts as a 10-mile ring road for the city itself and links the M62 and M58 motorways, as well as the A580 East Lancashire Road providing a link directly to the A5300 that links to the bridges that cross the Mersey to the south of the city.[376] To the south, Liverpool is connected to Widnes and Warrington via the A562 and A5300 and across the River Mersey to Runcorn in Cheshire, via the Silver Jubilee and Mersey Gateway bridges. The M56 motorway then provides routes into parts of the neighbouring counties, with connections to the Wirral and North Wales, and a direct route to Manchester Airport.[377] The Kingsway and Queensway Tunnels connect Liverpool with the settlements on the Wirral Peninsula across the Mersey to the west, including Birkenhead, and Wallasey. The A41 road and M53 motorway, which both begin in Birkenhead, link to Cheshire and Shropshire and via the A55, to North Wales.[378] Liverpool is served by two separate rail networks. The local rail network is managed and run by Merseyrail and provides links throughout the Liverpool city region and beyond (see Local travel below). The national network, which is managed by Network Rail, provides Liverpool with connections to major towns and cities across England. The city's primary main line station is Lime Street station, which is the terminus for several lines into the city. The station is served by a number of different train operating companies including Avanti West Coast, East Midlands Railway, London North Eastern Railway, Northern Rail, TransPennine Express and West Midlands Trains.[380][381] Between them, the station is connected with direct train services to numerous destinations including London (in 2 hours 8 minutes with Pendolino trains), Birmingham, Glasgow, Hull, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Norwich, Nottingham, Preston, Scarborough, Sheffield and York.[382][383][384][385] Opened in 1836, Lime Street station is the world's oldest mainline terminus station still in use.[386] In the south of the city, Liverpool South Parkway provides a connection to the city's airport. The Port of Liverpool connects passengers and freight to Liverpool from all around the world. Passenger ferry services depart from the city across the Irish Sea to Belfast and the Isle of Man. Services are provided by several companies, including the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, P&O Ferries and Stena Line. The Liverpool Cruise Terminal handles over 200,000 passengers and crew annually and is located alongside the Pier Head in the city centre. Berthing facilities for long-distance passenger cruises are provided and served by a large number of different cruise lines. Ports in Australia, France, Faroe Islands, Iceland, North America, Norway, Spain and the Caribbean are served by the facility.[387][388][389] The cruise lines that call at Liverpool cruise terminal include the following: As of 2022[update], the Port of Liverpool is the fourth busiest port in the UK by freight tonnage, handling 33 million tonnes of freight cargo.[409] It is the main port in the country for transatlantic trade and the largest port on the west coast of the UK. The Royal Seaforth and Liverpool2 container terminals are the port's two main terminals and handle a wide variety of cargo including containers, liquid and dry bulk cargoes such as coal and grain, biomass and roll-on/roll-off cargoes such as cars and trucks.[410][411][412][413][414][415] Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs into Liverpool city centre via Liverpool Canal Link at Pier Head since 2009.[416] Liverpool John Lennon Airport, which is located in the south of the city, provides Liverpool with direct air connections across the United Kingdom and Europe. It offers direct services to over 60 airports worldwide and to over 100 destinations via one-stop connections in Frankfurt, Dublin and Reykjav√≠k. The airport is primarily served by low-cost airlines namely Aer Lingus, easyJet, Jet2.com, Loganair, Lufthansa, Play, Ryanair, Wider√∏e and Wizz Air, although it does provide facilities for private aircraft.[417][418][419][420][421] Liverpool's urban railway network, known as Merseyrail, is one of the busiest and most extensive in the country. The network provides approximately 30 million passenger journeys per year, across a system of 69 stations throughout Liverpool's metropolitan area, within the formal boundaries of the Liverpool city region and adjacent areas of Cheshire and Lancashire.[422][423][424][425] The network consists of three lines: the Northern Line, which runs to Southport, Ormskirk, Headbolt Lane and Hunts Cross; the Wirral Line, which runs through the Mersey Railway Tunnel and has branches to New Brighton, West Kirby, Chester and Ellesmere Port; and the City Line, which begins at Lime Street, providing links to St Helens, Wigan, Preston, Warrington and Manchester.[426][427] The network is predominantly electric and covers 75 miles (120 kilometres) of track.[428][429] Trains are owned and operated by the Merseyrail franchise and managed by Merseytravel under the direction of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. Local services on the City Line are operated by Northern rather than Merseyrail, although the line itself remains part of the Merseyrail network. Within Liverpool city centre, four stations and over 6+1‚ÅÑ2 miles (10.5 kilometres) of tunnels are underground.[428] Hamilton Square and Liverpool James Street are the oldest deep level underground stations in the world.[430] In 2023, for the first time in UK history, battery-powered passenger trains launched on Merseyrail tracks from the newly opened Headbolt Lane station in Kirkby. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority's long term \"Merseyrail for All\" plan is to reduce dependency on live third rail and promote battery power in order to further expand Merseyrail to previously inaccessible places across the city region and as far as Manchester, Wrexham, Warrington and Preston.[431][432] Local bus services within and around Liverpool are managed by Merseytravel[433] and are run by several different companies, including Arriva and Stagecoach. The two principal termini for local buses are Queen Square bus station (located near Lime Street railway station) for services north and east of the city, and Liverpool One bus station (located near the Royal Albert Dock) for services to the south and east.[434] Cross-river services to the Wirral use roadside terminus points in Castle Street and Sir Thomas Street. A night bus service also operates on Saturdays providing services from the city centre across Liverpool and wider region.[435] Tour bus services are provided by Maghull Coaches which allow tourists to hop-on-hop-off and view historical landmarks and attractions, as well as Liverpool F.C. and Beatles related locations.[436][437] National Express services operate from the Liverpool One bus station to and from destinations across the UK.[438] In 2023, the Liverpool city region confirmed plans to become the second place outside London to implement bus franchising. Local leaders have argued that it will improve services by transferring control over fares, ticketing and routes from bus companies to the Combined Authority. The full implementation of bus franchising will take place by the end of 2028.[439][440] The cross-river ferry service in Liverpool, known as the Mersey Ferry, is managed and operated by Merseytravel, with services operating between the Pier Head in Liverpool city centre and both Woodside in Birkenhead and Seacombe in Wallasey. Services operate at intervals ranging from 20 minutes, at peak times, to every hour during the middle of the day and at weekends.[441] Despite remaining an important transport link between the city and the Wirral Peninsula, the Mersey Ferry has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction within the city, with daytime River Explorer Cruises providing passengers with an historical overview of the River Mersey and surrounding areas.[442] A scooter-sharing system and electric bicycle scheme operates throughout Liverpool which allows residents and visitors to move around the city on rented scooters and bicycles. The scheme is operated by Swedish technology company Voi, and riders are able to pick up and drop off bikes and scooters at various locations around the city.[443][444][445] National Cycle Route 56, National Cycle Route 62 and National Cycle Route 810 run through Liverpool. As with other large cities, Liverpool is an important cultural centre within the United Kingdom, incorporating music, performing arts, museums and art galleries, literature and nightlife among others. In 2008, the cultural heritage of the city was celebrated with the city holding the title of European Capital of Culture, during which time a wide range of cultural celebrations took place in the city, including Go Superlambananas! and La Princesse. Liverpool has also held Europe's largest music and poetry event, the Welsh national Eisteddfod, three times, despite being in England, in 1884, 1900, and 1929. Liverpool is internationally known for music and is recognised by Guinness World Records as the \"World Capital City of Pop\".[447] Musicians from the city have produced 58 No. 1 singles, more than any other city in the world.[448] Both the most successful male band and girl group in global music history have contained Liverpudlian members. Liverpool is most famous as the birthplace of the Beatles and during the 1960s was at the forefront of the Beat Music movement, which would eventually lead to the British Invasion. Many notable musicians of the time originated in the city including Billy J. Kramer, Cilla Black, Gerry and the Pacemakers and The Searchers. The influence of musicians from Liverpool, coupled with other cultural exploits of the time, such as the Liverpool poets, prompted American poet Allen Ginsberg to proclaim that the city was \"the centre of consciousness of the human universe\".[449] Other musicians from Liverpool include Billy Fury, A Flock of Seagulls, Echo & the Bunnymen, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Frankie Vaughan, Anathema, Ladytron, The Zutons, Cast, Atomic Kitten and Rebecca Ferguson. The La's 1990 hit single \"There She Goes\" was described by Rolling Stone as a \"founding piece of Britpop's foundation.\"[450] The city is also home to the oldest surviving professional symphony orchestra in the UK, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, which is based in the Philharmonic Hall.[451] The chief conductor of the orchestra is Vasily Petrenko.[452] Sir Edward Elgar dedicated his Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 to the Liverpool Orchestral Society, and the piece had its first performance in the city in 1901.[453] Among Liverpool's curiosities, the Austrian √©migr√© Fritz Spiegl is notable. He not only became a world expert on the etymology of Scouse, but composed the music to Z-cars and the Radio 4 UK Theme. Well established festivals in the city include Africa Oy√© and Brazilica which are the UK's largest free African and Brazilian music festivals respectively.[454][455] The dance music festival Creamfields was established by the Liverpool-based Cream clubbing brand which started life as a weekly event at Nation nightclub. There are numerous music venues located across the city, however, the Liverpool Arena is by far the largest. Opened in 2008, the 11,000-seat arena hosted the MTV Europe Music Awards the same year, and since then has played host to world-renowned acts such as Andrea Bocelli, Beyonc√©, Elton John, Kanye West, Kasabian, The Killers, Lady Gaga, Oasis, Pink, Rihanna, and UB40. On 7 October 2022, the [[publisherBBCrporation and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) announced that Liverpool would host the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 on behalf of the previous year's winning country Ukraine, which was unable to meet the demands of hosting the event due to security concerns caused by the Russian invasion of the country. The contest was held at Liverpool Arena, and consisted of two semi-finals on 9 and 11 May and a final on 13 May 2023. This was the first time that the contest took place in the city, and was also a record-extending ninth time that the UK has hosted the contest, having last done so in Birmingham in 1998.[456] Liverpool has more galleries and national museums than any other city in the United Kingdom apart from London.[11] National Museums Liverpool is the only English national collection based wholly outside London.[457] The Tate Liverpool gallery houses the modern art collection of the Tate in the North of England and was, until the opening of Tate Modern, the largest exhibition space dedicated to modern art in the United Kingdom. The FACT centre hosts touring multimedia exhibitions, while the Walker Art Gallery houses one of the most impressive permanent collections of Pre-Raphaelite art in the world.[458] Sudley House contains another major collection of pre-20th-century art.[459] Liverpool University's Victoria Building was re-opened as a public art gallery and museum to display the university's artwork and historical collections which include the largest display of art by Audubon outside the US.[460] A number of artists have also come from the city, including painter George Stubbs who was born in Liverpool in 1724. The Liverpool Biennial festival of arts runs from mid-September to late November and comprises three main sections; the International, The Independents and New Contemporaries although fringe events are timed to coincide.[461] It was during the 2004 festival that Yoko Ono's work \"My mummy was beautiful\" invited controversy when photographs of a woman's breast and crotch were exhibited on the main shopping street.[462] Felicia Hemans (n√©e Browne) was born in Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1793, although she later moved to Flintshire, in Wales. Felicia was born in Liverpool, a granddaughter of the Venetian consul in that city. Her father's business soon brought the family to Denbighshire in North Wales, where she spent her youth. They made their home near Abergele and St. Asaph (Flintshire), and it is clear that she came to regard herself as Welsh by adoption, later referring to Wales as \"Land of my childhood, my home and my dead\". Her first poems, dedicated to the Prince of Wales, were published in Liverpool in 1808, when she was only fourteen, arousing the interest of Percy Bysshe Shelley, who briefly corresponded with her. [463] An engraving of a painting of The Wishing Gate. by S. F. Serres was published in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834 with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon to which she adds the note 'I believe that to this haunted gate, a common superstition is attached, namely, that to wish, and to have that wish fulfilled, is the result of such wish being uttered while passing'. It stood on the North Shore before the docks were built and was a place where farewells could be waved to departing voyagers.[464] A number of notable authors have visited Liverpool, including Daniel Defoe, Washington Irving, Charles Dickens, Thomas De Quincey, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Hugh Walpole. Defoe, after visiting the city, described it, as \"one of the wonders of Britain in his 'Tour through England and Wales'\".[465] Melville's novel Redburn deals with the first seagoing voyage of 19 years old Wellingborough Redburn between New York and Liverpool in 1839. Largely autobiographical, the middle sections of the book are set in Liverpool and describe the young merchantman's wanderings, and his reflections.[463] From 1842 to 1869, Dickens visited the city to give public readings of his novels.[466] Hawthorne was stationed in Liverpool as United States consul between 1853 and 1856.[467] Hopkins served as priest at St Francis Xavier Church, Langdale St., Liverpool, between 1879 and 81.[468] Although he is not known to have ever visited Liverpool, Jung famously had a vivid dream of the city which he analysed in one of his works.[469] Her Benny, a novel telling the tragic story of Liverpool street urchins in the 1870s, written by Methodist preacher Silas K. Hocking, was a best-seller and the first book to sell a million copies in the author's lifetime.[470] The prolific writer of adventure novels, Harold Edward Bindloss (1866‚Äì1945), was born in Liverpool. The writer, docker and political activist George Garrett was born in Seacombe, on the Wirral Peninsula in 1896 and was brought up in Liverpool's South end, around Park Road, the son of a fierce Liverpool‚ÄìIrish Catholic mother and a staunch 'Orange' stevedore father. In the 1920s and 1930s, his organisation within the Seamen's Vigilance Committees, unemployed demonstrations, and hunger marches from Liverpool became part of a wider cultural force. He spoke at reconciliation meetings in sectarian Liverpool, and helped found the Unity Theatre in the 1930s as part of the Popular Front against the rise of fascism, particularly its echoes in the Spanish Civil War. Garrett died in 1966.[471] The novelist and playwright James Hanley (1897‚Äì1985) was born in Kirkdale, Liverpool, in 1897 (not Dublin, nor 1901 as he generally implied) to a working-class family.[472] Hanley grew up close to the docks and much of his early writing is about seamen. The Furys (1935) is first in a sequence of five loosely autobiographical novels about working-class life in Liverpool. James Hanley's brother, novelist Gerald Hanley (1916‚Äì92) was also born in Liverpool (not County Cork, Ireland, as he claimed).[473] While he published a number of novels he also wrote radio plays for the BBC as well as some film scripts, most notably The Blue Max (1966).[474] He was also one of several scriptwriters for a life of Gandhi (1964).[475] Novelist Beryl Bainbridge (1932‚Äì2010) was born in Liverpool and raised in nearby Formby. She was primarily known for her works of psychological fiction, often set among the English working classes. Bainbridge won the Whitbread Awards prize for best novel in 1977 and 1996 and was nominated five times for the Booker Prize. The Times newspaper named Bainbridge among their list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".[476] J. G. Farrell was born in Liverpool in 1935 but left at the outbreak of war in 1939.[477] A novelist of Irish descent, Farrell gained prominence for his historical fiction, most notably his Empire Trilogy (Troubles, The Siege of Krishnapur and The Singapore Grip), dealing with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. However, his career ended when he drowned in Ireland in 1979 at the age of 44. Helen Forrester was the pen name of June Bhatia (n√©e Huband) (1919‚Äì2011),[478][479] who was known for her books about her early childhood in Liverpool during the Great Depression, including Twopence to Cross the Mersey (1974), as well as several works of fiction. During the late 1960s the city became well known for the Liverpool poets, who include Roger McGough and the late Adrian Henri. An anthology of poems, The Mersey Sound, written by Henri, McGough and Brian Patten, has sold well since it was first being published in 1967. Liverpool has produced several noted writers of horror fiction, often set on Merseyside ‚Äì Ramsey Campbell, Clive Barker and Peter Atkins among them. A collection of Liverpudlian horror fiction, Spook City was edited by a Liverpool expatriate, Angus Mackenzie, and introduced by Doug Bradley, also from Liverpool.[480] Bradley is famed for portraying Barker's creation Pinhead in the Hellraiser series of films. Liverpool also has a long history of performing arts, reflected in several annual theatre festivals such as the Liverpool Shakespeare Festival, which takes place inside Liverpool Cathedral and in the adjacent historic St James' Gardens every summer; the Everyword Festival of new theatre writing, the only one of its kind in the country;[481] Physical Fest, an international festival of physical theatre;[482] the annual festivals organised by Liverpool John Moores University's drama department and the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts; and other festivals by the large number of theatres in the city, such as the Empire, Everyman,[483][484] Playhouse,[485][486] Royal Court, and Unity theatres. Notable actors and actresses from Liverpool include Arthur Askey, Tom Baker, Kim Cattrall, Jodie Comer, Stephen Graham, Rex Harrison, Jason Isaacs, Tina Malone, the McGann brothers (Joe, Mark, Paul, and Stephen), David Morrissey, Elizabeth Morton, Peter Serafinowicz, Elisabeth Sladen, Alison Steadman, and Rita Tushingham. Actors and actresses from elsewhere in the world have strong ties to the city, such as Canadian actor Mike Myers (whose parents were both from Liverpool) and American actress Halle Berry (whose mother was from Liverpool). Liverpool has a thriving and varied nightlife. The majority of the city's late-night restaurants, bars, pubs, nightclubs, music venues and comedy clubs are located in a number of distinct districts. In 2023, figures from global data company Square show that night-time spending in bars and restaurants in Liverpool city centre outperformed all major UK cities, including London.[487] Figures by the Liverpool BID Company suggest that the busiest nights of the week in Liverpool city centre are Friday and Saturday. Using cameras to track the flow of people in key locations between 7 pm and 4 am, at least 1.5 million people pass through the city centre every Friday night and almost 2 million people on Saturday nights. The data demonstrates that Monday night is the quietest night of the week in the city centre and footfall then increases every single night to reach its peak on Saturday nights. 125,889 people worked in the city's night time economy as of 2022, according to the Liverpool BID Company.[488][489][490] Liverpool's nightlife is concentrated in a number of districts including Ropewalks which comprises Concert Square, St. Peter's Square and the adjoining Seel Street and Duke Street. Other popular areas include Hardman Street, the Cavern Quarter, Baltic Triangle, Royal Albert Dock and the city's Pride Quarter, which is home to a large number of LGBT venues.[491][492] In the city's suburbs, Lark Lane in Aigburth is noted for an abundance of bars and late-night venues.[493][494] In Liverpool primary and secondary education is available in various forms supported by the state including secular, Church of England, Jewish, and Roman Catholic. Islamic education is available at primary level, but there is no secondary provision. One of Liverpool's important early schools was The Liverpool Blue Coat School; founded in 1708 as a charitable school. It is now a state grammar school. The Liverpool Blue Coat School is the top-performing school in the city with 100% 5 or more A*-C grades at GCSE resulting in the 30th best GCSE results in the country and an average point score per student of 1087.4 in A/AS levels.[495] Other notable schools include Liverpool College founded in 1840 Merchant Taylors' School founded in 1620.[496] Another of Liverpool's notable senior schools is St. Edward's College situated in the West Derby area of the city. Historic grammar schools, such as the Liverpool Institute High School and Liverpool Collegiate School‚Äîboth closed in the 1980s‚Äîare still remembered as centres of academic excellence. Bellerive Catholic College is the city's top-performing non-selective school, based upon GCSE results in 2007. Liverpool has three universities: the University of Liverpool, Liverpool John Moores University and Liverpool Hope University. Edge Hill University, founded as a teacher-training college in the Edge Hill district of Liverpool, is now located in Ormskirk in South-West Lancashire. Liverpool is also home to the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA). The University of Liverpool was established in 1881 as University College Liverpool. In 1884, it became part of the federal Victoria University. Following a Royal Charter and Act of Parliament in 1903, it became an independent university, the University of Liverpool, with the right to confer its own degrees. It was the first university to offer degrees in biochemistry, architecture, civic design, veterinary science, oceanography and social science. Liverpool Hope University, which was formed through the merger of three colleges, the earliest of which was founded in 1844, gained university status in 2005. It is the only ecumenical university in Europe.[497] It is situated on both sides of Taggart Avenue in Childwall and has a second campus in the city centre (the Cornerstone). The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, founded to address some of the problems created by trade, continues today as a post-graduate school affiliated with the University of Liverpool and houses an anti-venom repository. Liverpool John Moores University was previously a polytechnic, and gained status in 1992. It is named in honour of Sir John Moores, one of the founders of the Littlewoods football pools and retail group, who was a major benefactor. The institution was previously owned and run by Liverpool City Council. It traces it lineage to the Liverpool Mechanics' institute, opened in 1823, making it by this measure England's third-oldest university. The city has one further education college, City of Liverpool College in the city centre. Liverpool City Council operates Burton Manor, a residential adult education college in nearby Burton, on the Wirral Peninsula. There are two Jewish schools in Liverpool, both belonging to the King David Foundation. King David School, Liverpool, is the High School and the King David Primary School. There is also a King David Kindergarten, featured in the community centre of Harold House. These schools are all run by the King David Foundation located in Harold House in Childwall; conveniently next door to the Childwall Synagogue. Liverpool is one of the most successful footballing cities in England, and is home to two top flight Premier League teams. Everton F.C. was founded in 1878 and was one of the twelve founder members of the Football League. It plays at Goodison Park. Liverpool F.C. were founded in 1892 and play at Anfield. Between them, the clubs have won 28 English First Division titles, 12 FA Cup titles, 10 League Cup titles, 6 European Cup titles, 1 FIFA Club World Cup title, 1 European Cup Winners' Cup title, 3 UEFA Cup titles, and 24 FA Charity Shields. The two clubs contest the Merseyside derby, dubbed the 'friendly derby'. Despite the name the fixture is known for its keen rivalry, having seen more sending-offs in this fixture than any other. Unlike many other derbies it is not rare for families in the city to contain supporters of both clubs.[498] Liverpool F.C. is the English and British club with the most European Cup titles with six, the latest in 2019. Liverpool has played at Anfield since 1892, when the club was formed to occupy the stadium following Everton's departure due to a dispute with their landlord. Liverpool are still playing there 125 years later, although the ground has been completely rebuilt since the 1970s. The Spion Kop (rebuilt as an all-seater stand in 1994‚Äì95) was the most famous part of the ground, gaining cult status across the world due to the songs and celebrations of the many fans who packed onto its terraces. Anfield as capacity for 54,000 spectators in comfort and is a distinctive landmark in an area filled with smaller and older buildings. Liverpool club also has a multimillion-pound youth training facility called The Academy. After leaving Anfield in 1892, Everton moved to Goodison Park on the opposite side of Stanley Park. The ground was opened on 24 August 1892, by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the FA but the first crowds to attend the ground saw a short athletics meeting followed by a selection of music and a fireworks display. Everton's first game there was on 2 September 1892 when they beat Bolton 4‚Äì2. It was one of the host venues during the 1966 FIFA World Cup. It now has the capacity for just under 40,000 spectators all-seated, but the last expansion took place in 1994 when a new Park End Stand gave the stadium an all-seater capacity. The Goodison Road Stand dates back to the 1970s, while the Gwladys Street Stand and Bullens Road Stand are refurbished pre-Second World War structures. Everton is currently in the process of relocating, with a stadium move first mooted as early as 1996.[499] In 2003, the club were forced to abandon plans for a 55,000-seat stadium at King's Dock due to financial constraints,[500] with further proposed moves to Kirkby (comprising part of Destination Kirkby, moving the stadium just beyond Liverpool's council boundary into Kirkby) and Walton Hall Park similarly scrapped. The club will relocate to the multimillion-pound Everton Stadium designed by the American architect Dan Meis at the nearby Bramley-Moore Dock on the River Mersey waterfront during the 2025/26 season, with ground broken on the project in August 2021.[501] The new stadium will have a capacity of 52,888 which could be expanded to 62,000 demand permitting and it will be a host venue for the UEFA Euro 2028. Everton also have a multimillion-pound training facility based at Finch Farm. The Everton Women's Team play in the Women's Super League at the Walton Hall Park Stadium. Boxing is massively popular in Liverpool. The city has a proud heritage and history in the sport and is home to around 22 amateur boxing clubs, which are responsible for producing many successful boxers, such as Nel Tarleton, Alan Rudkin, John Conteh, Andy Holligan, Liam Smith, Paul Hodkinson, Tony Bellew and Robin Ried. The city also boasts a consistently strong amateur contingent which is highlighted by Liverpool being the most represented city on the GB Boxing team, as well as at the 2012 London Olympics, the most notable Liverpool amateur fighters include; Jimmy Lloyd, George Turpin, Tony Willis, Robin Reid and David Price who have all medalled at the Olympic Games. Boxing events are usually hosted at the Echo Arena and Liverpool Olympia within the city, although the former home of Liverpool boxing was the renowned Liverpool Stadium. Aintree Racecourse in the adjacent Metropolitan Borough of Sefton is home to the world's most famous steeple-chase, the Randox Grand National which takes place annually in early April. The race meeting attracts horse owners/ jockeys from around the world to compete in the demanding 4-mile (6.5-kilometre) and 30-fence course. There have been many memorable moments of the Grand National, for instance, the 100/1 outsider Foinavon in 1967, the dominant Red Rum and Ginger McCain of the 1970s and Mon Mome (100/1) who won the 2009 meeting. In 2010, the National became the first horse race to be televised in high-definition in the UK. The Royal Liverpool Golf Club, situated in the nearby town of Hoylake on the Wirral Peninsula, has hosted The Open Championship on a number of occasions, most recently in 2023. It also hosted the Walker Cup in 1983. Liverpool once contained four greyhound tracks, Seaforth Greyhound Stadium (1933‚Äì1965), Breck Park Stadium (1927‚Äì1948), Stanley Greyhound Stadium (1927‚Äì1961) and White City Stadium (1932‚Äì1973). Breck Park also hosted boxing bouts and both Stanley and Seaforth hosted Motorcycle speedway. Wavertree Sports Park is home to the Liverpool Harriers athletics club, which has produced such athletes as Curtis Robb, Allyn Condon (the only British athlete to compete at both the Summer and Winter Olympics), and Katarina Johnson-Thompson; Great Britain was represented by Johnson-Thompson at the 2012 London Olympics in the women's heptathlon, and she would go on to win the gold medal at the 2019 World Championships, giving Liverpool its first gold medal and breaking the British record in the process. In August 2012, Liverpool gymnast Beth Tweddle won an Olympic bronze medal in London 2012 in the uneven bars at her third Olympic Games, thus becoming the most decorated British gymnast in history. Park Road Gymnastics Centre provides training to a high level. Liverpool has produced several swimmers who have represented their nation at major championships such as the Olympic Games. The most notable of which is Steve Parry who claimed a bronze medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics in the 200m butterfly. Others include Herbert Nickel Haresnape, Margaret Kelly, Shellagh Ratcliffe and Austin Rawlinson. There is a purpose-built aquatics centre at Wavertree Sports Park, which opened in 2008. The City of Liverpool Swimming Club has been National Speedo League Champions 8 out of the last 11 years. The city is the hub of the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition, an ECB Premier League.[502] Sefton Park and Liverpool are the league's founder members based in the city with Wavertree, Alder and Old Xaverians clubs having joined the league more recently.[503] Liverpool plays host Lancashire County Cricket Club as an outground most seasons, including six of eight home County Championship games during Lancashire's 2011[504] title winning campaign[505] while Old Trafford was refurbished.[506][507] Since 2014 Liverpool Cricket Club has played host[508] to the annual Tradition-ICAP Liverpool International tennis tournament, which has seen tennis stars such as Novak Djokovic, David Ferrer, Mardy Fish, Laura Robson and Caroline Wozniacki. Previously this had been held at Calderstones Park, situated in Allerton in the south of the city. Liverpool Tennis Development Programme at Wavertree Tennis Centre is one of the largest in the UK. Professional basketball came to the city in 2007 with the entry of Everton Tigers, later known as Mersey Tigers, into the elite British Basketball League. The club was originally associated with Everton F.C., and was part of the Toxteth Tigers youth development programme, which reached over 1,500 young people every year.[509] The Tigers began to play in Britain's top league for the 2007‚Äì08 season, playing at the Greenbank Sports Academy before moving into the newly completed Echo Arena during that season. After the 2009‚Äì10 season, Everton F.C. withdrew funding from the Tigers, who then changed their name to Mersey Tigers. The club were expelled from the British Basketball League in 2013 due to financial problems.[510] Liverpool is one of three cities which still host the traditional sport of British baseball and it hosts the annual England-Wales international match every two years, alternating with Cardiff and Newport. Liverpool Trojans are the oldest existing baseball club in the UK. The 2014 Tour of Britain cycle race began in Liverpool on 7 September, using a city centre circuit to complete 130 km (80.8 mi) of racing.[511] The Tour of Britain took nine stages and finished in London on 14 September.

                "title": "Scouse - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Scouse (/ska äs/ skowss), more formally known as Liverpool English[2] or Merseyside English,[3][4][5] is an accent and dialect of English associated with the city of Liverpool and the surrounding Liverpool City Region. The Scouse accent is highly distinctive as it was influenced heavily by Irish and Welsh immigrants who arrived via the Liverpool docks, as well as Scandinavian sailors who also used the docks,[6] and thus has very little in common with the accents found throughout the rest of England.[7] People from Liverpool are known as Liverpudlians, but are usually called Scousers; the name comes from scouse, a stew originating from Scandinavian lobscouse eaten by sailors and locals.[8][9][10][11] The development of Liverpool since the 1950s has spread the accent into nearby areas such as the towns of Runcorn and Skelmersdale.[12] Variations within Scouse have been noted: the accent of Liverpool's city centre and northern neighbourhoods is usually described as fast, harsh, and nasal,[13] while the \"Beatles-like\" accent found in the southern suburbs of Liverpool is typically referred to as slow, soft, and dark.[14] Popular colloquialisms have shown a growing deviation from the historical Lancashire dialect that was previously found in Liverpool,[12] as well as a growth in the influence of the accent in the wider area.[7][15][16][17][18] Scouse is often considered by other Britons to be one of the country's least popular accents due to its difficulty, but it conversely also performs very well in polls of British accents that people perceive as happy and friendly.[19] The word scouse is a shortened form of lobscouse, the origin of which is uncertain.[20] It is related to the Norwegian lapskaus, Swedish lapskojs, and Danish labskovs (skipperlabskovs), as well as the Low German labskaus and refers to a stew of the same name commonly eaten by sailors. In the 19th century, poorer people in Liverpool, Birkenhead, Bootle and Wallasey commonly ate scouse as it was a cheap dish and familiar to the families of seafarers. Outsiders tended to call these people \"scousers\".[21] In The Lancashire Dictionary of Dialect, Tradition and Folklore, Alan Crosby suggested that the word only became known nationwide with the popularity of the BBC sitcom Till Death Us Do Part (1965‚Äì1975), which featured a Liverpudlian socialist and a Cockney conservative in a regular argument.[10] Originally a small fishing village, Liverpool developed as a port. After the 1700s, it developed into a major international trading and industrial centre. The city consequently became a melting pot of several accents and dialects as sailors and traders from different areas (specifically Wales and Ireland) established themselves in the area. Until the mid-19th century, the dominant local accent was similar to that of neighbouring areas of Lancashire. For instance, the comedian and actor Robb Wilton (1881‚Äì1957), despite coming from the Everton district of Liverpool, spoke with a dry Lancashire accent rather than a Scouse accent.[22][better source needed] The influence of immigrants from Ireland (especially Dublin) and Northern Wales, as well as visiting Scandinavian sailors, contributed to a distinctive local Liverpool accent.[23][24] The first reference to a distinctive Liverpool accent was in 1890. Linguist Gerald Knowles suggested that the accent's nasal quality may have derived from poor public health in the 19th century, by which the prevalence of colds among many people over a long time resulted in a nasal accent coming to be regarded as the norm and copied by newer incomers learning the dialect of the local area.[25] Scousers tend to speak at a higher pitch than most other English speakers, sometimes approaching falsetto. The Victorian phonetician Alexander John Ellis said that Liverpool and Birkenhead \"had no dialect proper\", as he conceived of dialects as speech that had been passed down through generations from the earliest English speakers. Ellis did research some locations on the Wirral, but these respondents spoke in the traditional Cheshire dialect at the time and not in Scouse.[26] The 1950s Survey of English Dialects recorded traditional Lancastrian dialect from the town of Halewood, finding no trace of Scouse influence. The phonetician John C. Wells wrote that \"the Scouse accent might as well not exist\" in The Linguistic Atlas of England, which was the Survey's principal output.[27] An academic study of Scouse was undertaken by Gerald Knowles at the University of Leeds in 1973. He identified a key problem: that traditional dialect research had focused on developments from a single proto-language, but Scouse (and many other urban dialects) had resulted from interactions between an unknown number of languages.[28] The phonemic notation used in this article is based on the set of symbols used by Watson (2007). Scouse is highly distinguishable from other English dialects. Because of this international recognition, Keith Szlamp made a request to IANA on 16 September 1996 to make it a recognised Internet dialect.[47] After citing a number of references,[48][49][50][51][11] the application was accepted on 25 May 2000 and now allows Internet documents that use the dialect to be categorised as Scouse by using the language tag \"en-Scouse\". Scouse has also become well-known globally as the accent of the Beatles.[52] While the members of the band are famously from Liverpool,[53] their accents have more in common with the older Lancashire-like Liverpool dialect found in the southern suburbs; the accent has evolved into Scouse since the 1960s. Other northern English dialects include:",

Liverpool, a city and seaport in northwestern England, forms an irregular crescent along the north shore of the Mersey estuary a few miles from the Irish Sea. It is the nucleus of the metropolitan county of Merseyside in the historic county of Lancashire. The location that became the city of Liverpool was granted a charter for a planned new town by King John of England in 1207. In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first in England to link two major cities, was opened. A rail network providing easy and cheap access to all major British industrial centers was soon created. All four of the Beatles‚ÄîJohn Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr‚Äîwere born and started their musical careers in Liverpool. Liverpool, city and seaport, northwestern England, forming the nucleus of the metropolitan county of Merseyside in the historic county of Lancashire. The city proper, which is a metropolitan borough of Merseyside, forms an irregular crescent along the north shore of the Mersey estuary a few miles from the Irish Sea. The first significant date in the history of Liverpool is 1207, when King John of England granted a charter for a planned new town there. The town‚Äôs medieval growth was slow, but in the 18th century it expanded rapidly as a result of profitable trade with the Americas and the West Indies and became the second most important port in Britain. A major element in the general trading pattern was the Liverpool Triangle‚Äîthe exchange of manufactured goods from the Mersey hinterland for slaves in West Africa who were in turn traded for sugar, molasses, spices, and other plantation crops in the West Indies. The first dock in Liverpool was built in 1715. By the end of the century, four other docks had been established along the Mersey, so that the port outranked even London in dock space. In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first in England to link two major cities, was opened. A rail network providing easy and cheap access to all major British industrial centres was soon created, and steam ferry links between Liverpool and the Wirral, across the Mersey estuary, were established. This growth was accompanied by high levels of immigration from surrounding areas and from Ireland, especially during and after the Irish Potato Famine (1845‚Äì49). By the beginning of the 20th century, Liverpool had become the centre of 7 miles (11 km) of docks extending along the Mersey from Hornby (1884) in the north to Herculaneum (1866) in the south. Additional improvements were made to the docks, but after World War II Liverpool declined as an exporting and passenger port. That change can be attributed mainly to the decreasing significance, in the economic life of Britain, of Liverpool‚Äôs industrial hinterland and its traditional trade with the United States and West Africa. Low capital investment and unemployment in the docks intensified the situation. Liverpool continues to exert a great degree of dominance over the surrounding metropolitan region. Although the traditional activities of transport, communication, distribution, and shipping have declined, they are still important in the economic life of the city. The port, in addition to handling general cargo, has developed as a major facility for containerized shipping, and in 2012 it became a terminus for cruise ships. The docklands and several areas of the historic centre of the city collectively were named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004. However, that designation was rescinded in 2021 because of developments that have caused ‚Äúthe irreversible loss of attributes.‚Äù Paramount among Liverpool‚Äôs important contributions to 20th-century popular culture were the Beatles, who emerged from the Cavern (a nightclub that was part of the city‚Äôs musical scene in the 1960s) to become the world‚Äôs best-known rock group. Local ‚Äúperformance‚Äù poets such as Roger McGough, Adrian Henri, and Brian Patten helped popularize poetry in the 1960s. And from the heyday of the music hall to the radio comedy of Tommy Handley in the 1940s, Liverpudlians contributed to the British comedy tradition. Tourism has grown in importance and includes a rise in interest for visiting locations associated with the Beatles. Architectural landmarks include the 18th-century Town Hall and the 19th-century St. George‚Äôs Hall; the Neo-Gothic Anglican cathedral, founded in 1904 and completed in 1978; and the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral (1967), of strikingly modern design. Tate Liverpool (a branch of the national Tate galleries), Merseyside County Museum and Library, the Walker Art Gallery, the Picton Library, the International Slave Museum, and the University of Liverpool (chartered 1881) are among the many cultural institutions. Liverpool also has a well-known symphony orchestra, and the city is home to two world-class professional football (soccer) teams (Everton and Liverpool FC). Area 43 square miles (112 square km). Pop.

Flagg scored 42 points, grabbed 6 rebounds, and dished out 7 assists, shooting 11-of-14 from the field, 4-of-6 from three-point range, and 16-of-17 from the free-throw line.

                "title": "Jim Harbaugh - Wikipedia",
                "content": "James Joseph Harbaugh (/Ààh…ëÀêrb…îÀê/ HAR-baw; born December 23, 1963) is an American professional football coach and former quarterback who is the head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL). He previously served as the head coach at the University of Michigan from 2015 to 2023, the San Francisco 49ers from 2011 to 2014, Stanford University from 2007 to 2010, and the University of San Diego from 2004 to 2006.[1][2] Harbaugh played college football at Michigan from 1983 to 1986 and in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons from 1987 to 2000, with his longest tenure (1987‚Äì1993) as a player with the Chicago Bears. Harbaugh was born in Toledo, Ohio. His father, Jack Harbaugh, was a football coach, and the family lived in Ohio, Kentucky, Iowa, Michigan, and California. He attended high school in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Palo Alto, California, when his father was an assistant coach at Michigan and Stanford, respectively. After graduation from high school in Palo Alto in 1982, Harbaugh returned to Ann Arbor and enrolled at the University of Michigan and played quarterback for the Wolverines, starting for three seasons. As a fifth-year senior in 1986, he led Michigan to the 1987 Rose Bowl and was a Heisman Trophy finalist, finishing third. The Chicago Bears selected Harbaugh in the first round of the 1987 NFL draft. He played 14 years as a quarterback in the NFL, with Chicago from 1987 to 1993, the Indianapolis Colts from 1994 to 1997, the Baltimore Ravens in 1998, and the San Diego Chargers in 1999 to 2000. He first became a regular starting quarterback in 1990 with Chicago. In 1995 with Indianapolis, he led the Colts to the AFC Championship Game, was selected to the Pro Bowl and was honored as NFL Comeback Player of the Year. From 1994 to 2001, while still playing in the NFL, Harbaugh was an unpaid assistant coach at Western Kentucky University, where his father Jack was head coach. In 2002, he returned to the NFL as the quarterbacks coach for the Oakland Raiders. Harbaugh returned to the college ranks in 2004 as the head coach at the University of San Diego. After leading San Diego to consecutive Pioneer League championships in 2005 and 2006, he moved to Stanford in 2007, where he led the Cardinal to two bowl berths in four seasons, including a win in the 2011 Orange Bowl. Immediately afterward, Harbaugh signed a five-year deal as head coach of the NFL's San Francisco 49ers, where he led the team to the NFC Championship game in each of his first three seasons after the franchise missed the playoffs for eight consecutive seasons beforehand. He and his older brother, Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh, became the first pair of brothers to serve as head coaches in NFL history. Their teams played in a Thanksgiving Classic game in 2011 and in Super Bowl XLVII at the end of the 2012 season.[3] Harbaugh accepted the job as head football coach for the University of Michigan Wolverines in 2015. Harbaugh led the team to three consecutive Big Ten Conference titles, including berths in the College Football Playoff in the 2021 and 2022 season, eventually winning a national championship in 2023: the school's first since 1997, and the first undisputed national championship since 1948.[4] On January 24, 2024, Harbaugh left Michigan to return to the NFL, signing a five-year contract to become the head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers, leading them to a playoff appearance in his first year as head coach. Born in Toledo, Ohio, on December 23, 1963, Harbaugh is the son of Jacqueline M. \"Jackie\" (n√©e Cipiti) and Jack Harbaugh.[5] His mother is of half-Sicilian and half-Polish ancestry and his father is of Irish and German ancestry.[citation needed] Both Jim and his brother John were born in Toledo, while his father was an assistant football coach at nearby Perrysburg High School in Perrysburg.[6] During Harbaugh's childhood, the family moved frequently, as his father held assistant coaching positions at Morehead State (1967), Bowling Green (1967‚Äì1970), Iowa (1971‚Äì1973), Michigan (1973‚Äì1979), Stanford (1980‚Äì1981), and Western Michigan (1982‚Äì1986). Harbaugh played for the junior league Ann Arbor Packers and then for Tappan Junior High before moving on to Pioneer High School. When his father became defensive coordinator at Stanford, he transferred to Palo Alto High School, graduating in 1982.[7][8] Harbaugh received a Bachelor of Arts with a major in communications from the University of Michigan in 1986.[9] In February 1982, Harbaugh committed to play football for Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football team.[10] He came to Michigan with a \"high school reputation as a slick California passer.\"[11] As a freshman in 1982 Harbaugh, age 18, and junior Dave Hall were backups to quarterback Steve Smith who had broken Michigan's single season record with 2,335 yards of total offense in 1981.[12] In the 1982 season, Smith started all 12 games, and Hall handled the limited backup role.[13][14] Even as Smith struggled, coach Schembechler expressed a reluctance to play Harbaugh, saying, \"To suddenly pull some freshman out of the bag, I don't think you can do that in today's football.\"[15] Harbaugh did not see any game action in 1982, registered no statistics, and retained four years of eligibility under the NCAA's redshirt rule.[13][16] Harbaugh performed well in the annual spring game in April 1983, completing 10 of 15 passes for 116 yards. After the game, coach Schembechler noted, \"Harbaugh is a fresh talent who'll be all right, but he has a lot to learn.\"[17] While Harbaugh was touted as the team's \"pass-oriented quarterback of the future,\"[16] he spent the 1983 season as Michigan's No. 3 quarterback behind Steve Smith and Dave Hall. Smith started 11 games, and Hall started one game, while Harbaugh completed two of five passes for 40 yards in limited action.[18][19] Harbaugh completed his first pass for Michigan on November 5, 1983, in a 42‚Äì10 victory over Purdue. In the spring of 1984, Harbaugh was in a three-way competition for Michigan's starting quarterback job. Three-year starter Steve Smith had graduated, and his backup, Dave Hall, was lost to a knee injury. The 1983 competition pitted Harbaugh against sophomores Chris Zurbrugg and Russ Rein.[20] In April 1984, Schembechler said, \"Harbaugh is coming along pretty well. He's having a pretty good spring. Zurbrugg has emerged as a good prospect. There's kind of a battle in there.\"[21] In the 1984 spring game, Harbaugh impressed observers as he completed 17 of 26 passes for 161 yards and an interception. Schembechler said after the game, \"We've been happy with Jim all spring. He's shown a lot of maturity.\"[22] After spring practice, Schembechler announced his depth chart with Harbaugh as his No. 1 quarterback.[23] In his first collegiate start, Harbaugh led the Wolverines to a 22‚Äì14 upset victory over a Miami Hurricanes team that was led by Bernie Kosar, had won the 1983 national championship, and was ranked No. 1 in both the AP and UPI polls. Harbaugh completed 11 of 21 passes for 162 yards and two interceptions.[24] The Detroit Free Press praised Harbaugh for \"pinpoint passing\" that \"kept Miami's defense on the run.\"[25] In his second start, the Wolverines (ranked No. 3) lost to a Washington team that finished the season ranked No. 2 in both the AP and UPI polls. Harbaugh threw a career-high 37 passes in the game, completing 17 passes for 183 yards, three interceptions, and his first collegiate touchdown pass to Vince Bean.[26] After the loss to Washington, Harbaugh led Michigan to victories over Wisconsin (20‚Äì14) and Indiana (14‚Äì6). Harbaugh completed 25 of 39 passes for 272 yards in those games. On October 6, 1984, a 19‚Äì7 loss to Michigan State in the fifth game of the season, Harbaugh sustained a badly broken left arm in the third quarter when he dove for a loose ball and collided with Spartan linebacker Thomas Tyree. Harbaugh had to be carried from the field on a stretcher and missed the remainder of the season.[27][28] Harbaugh completed 60 of 111 passes for 718 yards, three touchdowns and five interceptions during his shortened 1984 season.[29] By April 1985, Harbaugh's arm had healed, and he completed 10 of 16 passes for 146 yards in the annual spring game.[30] Harbaugh was the starting quarterback in all 12 games for the 1985 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 10‚Äì1‚Äì1 record, outscored opponents 342‚Äì98, defeated Nebraska in the 1986 Fiesta Bowl, and finished the season ranked No. 2 in the final AP and UPI polls.[31] On October 26, 1985, Harbaugh set a school record with 283 passing yards in a 42‚Äì15 victory over Indiana.[32] After the game, Harbaugh was asked for his reaction to setting the school's passing record and responded, \"Records are nice, but everything we do here is team oriented. Everyone's telling me about the record, but they should tell it to Paul Jokisch and Eric Kattus and John Kolesar. They caught the passes.\"[32] On November 16, 1985, in a 48‚Äì7 victory over Minnesota, Harbaugh completed 13 of 18 passes for 243 yards and three touchdowns. After the game, Harbaugh praised the offensive line, noting, \"I've never had more time to throw in my life‚Äîjunior high, high school.\"[33] Harbaugh's 13 completions against Minnesota gave him 123 for the season, breaking the school record of 118 set by Steve Smith in 1982.[34] On November 23, 1985, Harbaugh led Michigan to a 27‚Äì17 victory over Ohio State. In the fourth quarter, Harbaugh completed a 77-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver John Kolesar, giving Michigan a 10-point lead with nine minutes remaining. Coach Schembechler said after the game that the 77-yard touchdown was \"a play that took the starch right out of their sails.\"[35] Columnist Mitch Albom wrote after the game that Harbaugh's pass to Kolesar was an image that would last: \"The image that repeats will be that of Jim Harbaugh dropping back in the fourth quarter and uncorking a soaring spiral that rose high and long as flanker John Kolesar ran underneath it, his steps seemingly in sync with the revolutions of the ball, so [that] when it fell, it fell right into his arms, almost gently.\"[36] Harbaugh completed 16 of 19 passes for 230 yards and three touchdowns.[35] In the final three games of the 1985 regular season, Harbaugh completed 41 of 50 passes for 706 yards, nine touchdowns, and no interceptions.[37] For the season as a whole, he completed 145 of 227 passes for 1,976 yards, 18 touchdowns and six interceptions.[29] He also led the nation with a 163.7 passing efficiency rating in 1985.[38] In 1986, his final season at Michigan, Harbaugh started all 13 games at quarterback for the 1986 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled an 11‚Äì2 record, lost to Arizona State in the 1987 Rose Bowl, and finished the season ranked No. 8 in the final AP Poll and No. 7 in the final UPI Poll.[39] In the first game of the season, Harbaugh led Michigan to a 24‚Äì23 victory over Notre Dame. Harbaugh completed 15 of 23 passes for 239 yards and a touchdown.[40] In the fourth game of the season, he broke his own Michigan school record with 310 passing yards in Schembechler's 200th career victory, a 34‚Äì17 victory over Wisconsin.[41] Harbaugh caused controversy when he guaranteed a victory over Ohio State in 1986.[42] Harbaugh's guarantee proved valid as the Wolverines defeated the Buckeyes, 26‚Äì24. Harbaugh completed 19 of 29 passes with two interceptions.[43] For the season, Harbaugh completed 180 of 277 passes for 2,729 yards, 10 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions.[29] His 2,729 passing yards set a Michigan season record that stood until 2002. He also finished second in the country in passing efficiency behind Heisman Trophy winner Vinny Testaverde.[44] Harbaugh won numerous honors in 1986 including the following: Harbaugh finished his college career as Michigan's all-time record holder for passing yards with 5,449 yards. He also tallied 620 passing attempts (second in Michigan history at the time), 387 completions, a 62.4% completion percentage, 31 touchdown passes (third in Michigan history at the time), and 22 interceptions. He held the career NCAA Division I-A passing efficiency record (149.6) for 12 years.[50] Harbaugh earned a B.A. in communications from Michigan's College of Literature, Science, and the Arts in 1986.[51] The Chicago Bears selected Harbaugh in the first round (26th overall) of the 1987 NFL draft.[52] During the 1987 season, playing under head coach Mike Ditka, Harbaugh completed only one of 15 passes in an August 27 exhibition game against the St. Louis Cardinals.[53] During the regular season, he played in a reserve capacity in six games.[54] On November 22, in a 30‚Äì10 win over the Detroit Lions, Harbaugh took only one snap and was sacked for 15 yards.[55] On December 14, in a 41‚Äì0 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, Harbaugh threw his first NFL passes, completing 8 of 11 (72.7%) for 62 yards, was sacked 3 times for 30 yards, and rushed 15 yards on three carries.[56] Harbaugh played 10 games in 1988 and completed 47 of 97 passes (48.5%) for 514 yards and two interceptions. He rushed 110 yards on 19 carries. Harbaugh started his first game on Week 14 (December 5), a 23‚Äì3 loss to the Los Angeles Rams in which he completed 11 of 30 passes for 108 yards and two interceptions, rushed 32 yards on six carries, and was sacked twice for nine yards. The following game on December 12, Harbaugh earned his first win as an NFL starter with a 13‚Äì12 victory over the Detroit Lions. Harbaugh completed 18 of 26 passes for 174 yards and rushed 36 yards in seven carries.[57][58] Harbaugh saw more playing time in 1989 after Jim McMahon left the team and started five games for Chicago while Mike Tomczak started 11 in a 6‚Äì10 season for Chicago.[59] 1989 was his first season with over 1,000 passing yards, completing 111 of 178 passes in 12 games for 1,204 yards for five touchdowns and nine interceptions and was sacked 18 times for 106 yards.[60] His 62.4% completion rate earned him the team record for single-season completion percentage.[61] In 1990, Harbaugh played and started in the first 14 games of the season.[62] Chicago improved to 11‚Äì5 and won the NFC Central division, and Harbaugh passed for 2,178 yards with 180 of 312 (57.7%) passes completed for 10 touchdowns and 6 interceptions. He was sacked 31 times for 206 yards and rushed 321 yards in 51 carries.[63] Due to a shoulder injury, Harbaugh sat out the last two games of the year as well as the playoffs.[64] Harbaugh passed for a career-high 3,121 yards with Chicago in 1991 and became the first Chicago quarterback since Vince Evans to start all 16 regular season games.[65] He completed 275 of 478 (57.5%) passes for 15 touchdowns and 16 interceptions, was sacked 24 times (including a franchise-record 9 times on October 25 against the Minnesota Vikings) for a loss of 163 yards, and rushed 338 yards on 70 carries.[66] Chicago finished the season 11‚Äì5 like the year before, but in second place in the NFC Central.[67] On December 29, 1991, he made his postseason debut in the NFC Wild Card Round, a 17‚Äì13 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. The Dallas defense overwhelmed him throughout the game, sacking him three times; and in the final drive of the game that started from Chicago's 4-yard line with 1:50 left, he threw an interception to Bill Bates on the fourth play from scrimmage. He went 22-of-44 for 218 yards.[68][69] Chicago regressed to a 5‚Äì11 record in 1992, and the team fired coach Ditka afterwards.[70][71] Harbaugh played all 16 games but started only 13 and had a 5‚Äì8 record as starter. He completed 202 of 358 (56.4%) passes for 2,486 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, was sacked 31 times for 167 yards, and rushed 272 yards over 47 carries, including one rushing touchdown.[72] In 1993, Chicago went 7‚Äì9.[73] Harbaugh played in and started 15 games and completed 200 of 325 (61.5%) passes for 2,002 yards, seven touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. He was sacked 43 times for 210 yards and rushed 277 yards over 60 carries.[74] Harbaugh ended his tenure with Chicago with a 35‚Äì30 (.538) record.[75] On April 7, 1994, Harbaugh signed with the Indianapolis Colts.[76] He played and started in just nine games in the 1994 Colts season, completing 125 of 202 (61.9%) passes for 1,440 yards, nine touchdowns, and six interceptions. Harbaugh took 17 sacks for 72 yards and rushed 223 yards over 39 carries.[77] For the first eight games, Harbaugh was starter, and coach Ted Marchibroda re-instated Harbaugh as starter for Week 15 (December 18) after Indianapolis struggled on offense under quarterback Don Majkowski.[78][79] In 1995, Harbaugh achieved career highs in completion percentage (63.7%), passer rating (100.7), and touchdown passes (17) and led Indianapolis to the AFC Championship Game. Harbaugh played 15 games in the regular season and started 12, with a 7‚Äì5 record as starter for a 9‚Äì7 team.[80] Harbaugh completed 200 of 314 passes for 2,575 yards and just 5 interceptions with his 17 touchdowns and was sacked 36 times for 219 yards. In 52 carries, Harbaugh rushed for 235 yards and two touchdowns.[81] He strained his right knee after being sacked six times and left the Week 14 (December 3) game against the Carolina Panthers in the third quarter.[82] Indianapolis lost to the defending AFC champion San Diego Chargers in Week 16 (December 17) 27‚Äì24, with John Carney kicking the winning field goal with three seconds left after Harbaugh's drive with three straight passes had led to Cary Blanchard's field goal that tied the game at 24 with 48 seconds left.[83] In the regular season finale on December 23, Harbaugh's 32nd birthday, Indianapolis clinched a playoff berth with a 10‚Äì7 win over the New England Patriots. Completing 20 of 30 passes, he threw for 225 yards and a touchdown.[84] On December 31, 1995, in the AFC Wild Card Round against San Diego, Harbaugh scored on a 3-yard quarterback sneak in the fourth quarter after a 32-yard interception return by Jason Belser and Indianapolis won 35‚Äì20.[85] Indianapolis won the Divisional Round game on January 7, 1996, over the Kansas City Chiefs 10‚Äì7, despite only 112 passing yards (with 12 of 27 passes completed, one touchdown, and one interception) from Harbaugh.[86] In the AFC Championship Game on January 14, Harbaugh completed 21 of 33 passes for 267 yards and a touchdown and rushed 29 yards on six carries.[87] Aaron Bailey dropped Harbaugh's last-second Hail Mary pass in the endzone, and the Pittsburgh Steelers won 20‚Äì16 and went on to Super Bowl XXX, which they lost to the Dallas Cowboys.[88] For the season, he was voted to the Pro Bowl, was named the PFWA Comeback Player of the Year and AFC Player of the Year.[89][90][91] With new coach Lindy Infante,[92] Indianapolis again finished 9‚Äì7 and made the playoffs in 1996 with Harbaugh as signal caller.[93] Harbaugh played and started in 14 games with a 7‚Äì7 record; he completed 232 of 405 (57.3%) passes for 2,630 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions, with 36 sacks for 190 yards lost and 192 rushing yards on 48 carries and a touchdown.[94] Defending AFC Champion Pittsburgh Steelers defeated Indianapolis in the Wild Card Round 42‚Äì14 as Harbaugh completed only 37.5% of his passes (12 of 32) for 134 yards, one touchdown, and one interception.[95] Indianapolis fell to 3‚Äì13 in 1997.[96] Despite passing for 2,060 yards, 10 touchdowns, and four interceptions in 12 games and 189-for-309 (61.2%) passing, Harbaugh had a 2‚Äì9 record as starter. Harbaugh was sacked 41 times for a career-high 256 yards lost.[97] Harbaugh missed four games of the season after he punched former quarterback Jim Kelly in the face because Kelly had called him a \"baby.\"[98] On February 14, 1998, the Indianapolis Colts traded Harbaugh to the Baltimore Ravens for third-round and fourth-round draft picks in the 1998 NFL draft.[99] With that trade, Harbaugh reunited with his former Colts coach Ted Marchibroda.[100] During the 1998 season with Baltimore, Harbaugh played in 14 games and started 12, with a 5‚Äì7 record as starter in a 6‚Äì10 season for the Ravens.[101] Harbaugh completed 164 of 293 (56.0%) passes for 1,839 yards, just his third season with fewer than 2,000 passing yards since 1989. He had 12 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in passing, was sacked 23 times for 145 yards, and rushed 172 yards on 40 carries.[102] The Ravens opened a new stadium for 1998, Ravens Stadium at Camden Yards (renamed M&T Bank Stadium in 2003).[103] Starting the game in Week 1 (September 6) and completing 4 of 7 passes for 33 yards, Harbaugh left during the second quarter after injuring a finger, and with backup Eric Zeier in for Harbaugh, Baltimore lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 20‚Äì13.[104][105] Baltimore won its next game 24‚Äì10 over the New York Jets on September 13; Harbaugh started and made 5 of 10 passes for 36 yards but again left early and was replaced by Zeier due to injury.[106] Coach Marchibroda again split quarterbacking duties in the following game on September 20, a 24‚Äì10 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, with Harbaugh starting and Zeier taking over during the second quarter. With 4 of 9 passes completed for 59 yards, Harbaugh led a drive for a Matt Stover first quarter field goal.[107] Harbaugh then sat out two games and played as Zeier's backup for Weeks 7 (October 18) and 8 (October 25). Those two games had poor performances: Harbaugh completed none of six passes and had one 3-yard rush in the Week 6 loss to Pittsburgh.[108] Despite only 9 of 20 passes completed and two interceptions in the Week 7 28‚Äì10 loss to the Green Bay Packers, Harbaugh made his first passing touchdown as a Raven, a 46-yard pass to Jermaine Lewis in the fourth quarter.[109] In the next game on Week 8 (November 1), Harbaugh improved in his first full game, with 27 of 34 passes completed over 243 yards for three touchdowns and one interception and 57 rushing yards in 10 carries.[110] In Week 9 (November 8), with Baltimore winning 13‚Äì10 over the Oakland Raiders, Harbaugh got his first win in a full game started despite passing for only 102 yards, no touchdowns, and an interception.[111] In the final two drives of the game, Harbaugh made crucial first-down conversion passes of a 28-yard pass to Jermaine Lewis and 10- and 11-yard passes to Michael Jackson.[112] In Week 12 (November 29), a 38‚Äì31 win over the Indianapolis Colts, Harbaugh had his first interception-free full game, with 16-for-25 passing over 198 yards for two touchdowns.[113] It was the Colts first trip back to Baltimore after the team left it for Indianapolis. In an emotional moment, Harbaugh presented Johnny Unitas with the game ball.[114] Referee Ed Hochuli called a controversial unnecessary roughness penalty against Joe Bowden in Baltimore's 16‚Äì14 loss to the Tennessee Oilers for his hit on Harbaugh on a 2nd-and-24 play with Tennessee leading 14‚Äì13 after his 9-yard scramble towards the sideline, ruling that Harbaugh was in bounds when hit. On 3rd-and-15 in the next series, however, Harbaugh was sacked and Baltimore was forced to punt, so the penalty did not hurt the Oilers.[115] Harbaugh completed 15 of 28 passes for 214 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception and rushed 22 yards over five carries.[102] After a three-game losing streak, Harbaugh won the final game of the season (and his final game with Baltimore) on December 27, 19‚Äì10 over the Detroit Lions with 17 of 26 passes completed for 141 yards and a touchdown.[116] Harbaugh played two years with the San Diego Chargers. Signed as the backup to Ryan Leaf, Harbaugh played most of the 1999 season after Leaf sustained a season-ending injury in training camp.[117] Harbaugh started 12 games out of 14 played and had a 6‚Äì6 record as starter in an 8‚Äì8 season, completing 249 of 434 (57.4%) passes for 2,761 yards, 10 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions. He was sacked 37 times for a total loss of 208 yards and rushed for 126 yards over 34 carries.[118] In his debut with San Diego in the September 19 season opener (Week 2), Harbaugh threw two touchdowns in 15-for-27 passing for 159 yards in a 34‚Äì7 win over the Cincinnati Bengals.[119] However, San Diego lost their next game to Harbaugh's former team, the Indianapolis Colts, 27‚Äì19. Harbaugh completed 15 of 37 passes for 188 yards.[120] With very few seconds left and the ball on the Colts' 24, Harbaugh threw an interception to Tyrone Poole.[121] Harbaugh started the Week 4 (October 3) game against the Kansas City Chiefs completing 6 of 9 passes for 38 yards and an interception before leaving due to a bruised right elbow;[122][123] he missed the Week 5 (October 10) and Week 6 (October 17) games because of that injury and two broken ribs.[124][125] Harbaugh returned in Week 7 (October 24) in a 31‚Äì3 loss to the Green Bay Packers as backup to starter Erik Kramer; both quarterbacks threw 3 interceptions each.[126] Harbaugh next started a game on Week 9 (November 7) and completed 25 of 39 passes for 235 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions and rushed 14 yards in two carries in a 33‚Äì17 loss to defending champion Denver Broncos.[127] The Chargers lost its sixth game in a row after a 4‚Äì1 start in Week 12 (November 28) to the Minnesota Vikings 35‚Äì27.[128] Robert Griffith intercepted a Harbaugh pass at the Vikings' 1-yard line with 4:29 left, and Minnesota ran out the clock to seal the win.[129] A 12‚Äì9 loss to the Miami Dolphins on December 19 (Week 15) disqualified the Chargers from the postseason. Miami's defense sacked Harbaugh five times, and Rich Owens strip-sacked Harbaugh at San Diego's 20-yard line. Harbaugh finished the game with 20 of 40 passes completed for 178 yards. With 17 seconds left, Chris Penn caught Harbaugh's attempt at a game-winning touchdown pass albeit slightly outside the back of the end zone. John Carney missed a game-tying 36-yard field goal.[130] After failing to make a passing touchdown for three games, Harbaugh made two passing touchdowns and just one interception on 23-for-36 passing over 325 yards in San Diego's 23‚Äì20 win over the Oakland Raiders on the home finale on December 26 (Week 16).[131] Following an 8‚Äì8 season in 1999, San Diego finished 1‚Äì15 in 2000 with a rotation of Ryan Leaf, Harbaugh, and Moses Moreno as starters.[132] Playing in seven games and starting five, Harbaugh completed 123 of 202 (60.9%) passes for 1,416 yards, 8 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions, was sacked 14 times for 96 yards, and rushed 24 yards on 16 carries.[133] Harbaugh played his first game in Week 4 (September 24), a 20‚Äì12 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. On 8-for-14 passing, Harbaugh passed for 67 yards and an interception.[134] He became starter in Week 5 (October 1). In the 57‚Äì31 loss to defending champion St. Louis Rams, Harbaugh was 27-for-40 for 348 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception and was sacked three times for 15 yards.[135] Starting the Week 6 (October 8) game, a 21‚Äì7 loss the Denver Broncos, Harbaugh was 18-for-43 for 237 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions.[136] Two of Harbaugh's interceptions led to short Denver touchdowns, and Harbaugh threw his third interception on fourth-and-goal at Denver's 5-yard line.[137] In Week 7 (October 15), an overtime 27‚Äì24 loss to the Buffalo Bills, Harbaugh's second interception of the game, by Henry Jones, was in overtime and paved way for Steve Christie's game-winning field goal.[138] Following the game, coach Mike Riley said he regretted rotating between Harbaugh and Moses Moreno in the first half, as Moreno lost two fumbles, one of which Buffalo returned for a touchdown.[139] San Diego had an ESPN Sunday Night Football game in Week 9 (October 29) following a bye week, lost to the Oakland Raiders 15‚Äì13, and fell to 0‚Äì8. San Diego took a 13‚Äì12 lead with 5:47 left after Harbaugh made a 21-yard touchdown pass to Freddie Jones, but failed the two-point conversion attempt paving the way for the Raiders' Sebastian Janikowski to kick the winning field goal with 13 seconds left.[140] In the final play of the game, following a 47-yard kickoff return by Ronney Jenkins, Marquez Pope intercepted Harbaugh's attempt at a 50-yard Hail Mary pass that was intended for Trevor Gaylor in the end zone.[141][142] In that game, Harbaugh completed 25 of 35 passes for 222 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception and was sacked three times for 27 yards.[133] The following game on November 5 (Week 10), San Diego lost its ninth straight in a 15‚Äì13 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. In the second quarter, Harbaugh lost two fumbles, both of which preceded 10-yard Seattle passing touchdowns. Having completed 22 of 32 passes for 236 yards, one touchdown, and one interception, he left the game after the third quarter due to groin and abdomen injuries.[143] Harbaugh played what would be his final career game in Week 11 (November 12), a 17‚Äì7 loss to the Miami Dolphins. In the final drive of the game he filled in poorly for an injured Ryan Leaf, completing only 2 of 5 passes for 19 yards and throwing an interception.[144] By that time, coach Riley had relegated Harbaugh to emergency duty due to injuries including a mild hernia.[145] Riley had planned to start Harbaugh for the next game on Week 12 (November 19), but decided to start Leaf instead.[146][137] Harbaugh signed with the Detroit Lions prior to the 2001 season, where he was expected to back up incumbent starter Charlie Batch.[147] However, on the eve of the regular season, the Lions cut him and traded for Ty Detmer.[148] He closed out his NFL career with the Carolina Panthers in 2001, where he dressed for six games but did not play.[149] The 2001 Panthers, like the Chargers the year before, finished with a 1‚Äì15 record.[150] For his NFL career, Harbaugh played in 177 league games with 140 starts. He completed 2,305 of 3,918 passes for 26,288 yards with 129 touchdowns.[151] Particularly during his time with Indianapolis, such as when he led the Colts to come-from-behind wins over the Chiefs and Chargers in the 1995‚Äì96 NFL playoffs and a near upset over the No. 2 AFC seed Steelers, he earned the nickname \"Captain Comeback\" (the second player to be so nicknamed after Roger Staubach) for his ability to win games in the fourth quarter when his team was significantly behind.[152][153][154] Harbaugh is second in the Bears' record book for completions with 1,023, while Jay Cutler holds the record with 1,034.[155][156] Harbaugh also ranks second with 1,759 attempts and third in yards with 11,567.[155] In January 2005, he was inducted into the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor as one of the most successful and popular players in the club's Indianapolis era.[157] During his final eight seasons in the NFL (1994‚Äì2001), Harbaugh was an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant coach under his father Jack Harbaugh at Western Kentucky University (WKU). Serving as an offensive consultant, he scouted and recruited high school student-athletes throughout several states including Florida, Indiana and Illinois. He was involved in recruiting 17 players on WKU's 2002 Division I-AA national champion team. His father was a football coach for 18 years, including 14 years as head coach at WKU.[7][158][159] Harbaugh was quarterback coach for the Oakland Raiders in 2002 and 2003 under Bill Callahan.[7] During his tenure with the Raiders, Harbaugh coached starting quarterback Rich Gannon, who led the Raiders' run to Super Bowl XXXVII, won the 2002 AP NFL MVP award, and was selected to the 2003 Pro Bowl after the 2002 season.[160] Other Raiders quarterbacks coached by Harbaugh include Rick Mirer, Tee Martin, Marques Tuiasosopo, and Rob Johnson.[161] Prior to the 2004 season, Harbaugh was named head football coach at the University of San Diego.[162] In his first year, he directed the Toreros to an overall mark of 7‚Äì4, including five straight wins to end the season. The following year, the team improved to 11‚Äì1 and won the 2005 Pioneer Football League championship.[163] In 2006, USD again went 11‚Äì1, winning their second consecutive Pioneer League title in the process.[164][165] Harbaugh was named the head football coach at Stanford University in December 2006, replacing Walt Harris.[166] Harbaugh's father, Jack, was Stanford's defensive coordinator from 1980 to 1981, while Harbaugh attended Palo Alto High School, located directly across the street from Stanford Stadium.[167] Harbaugh stirred some intra-conference controversy in March 2007, when he was quoted as saying rival USC head coach \"Pete Carroll's only got one more year, though. He'll be there one more year. That's what I've heard. I heard it inside the staff.\" Upon further questions, Harbaugh claimed he had heard it from staff at USC. The comment caused a rebuke from Carroll.[168] (In fact, Carroll would be at USC for three more years.) At the Pacific-10 Conference media day on July 26, 2007, Harbaugh praised the Trojans, stating \"There is no question in my mind that USC is the best team in the country and may be the best team in the history of college football.\" The declaration, especially in light of his earlier comment, garnered more media attention.[169][170] Later in the season, Stanford defeated #1 USC 24‚Äì23 with a touchdown in the final minute. With USC being the favorite by 41 points, it was statistically the greatest upset in college football history.[171][172] In the 2008 season, Stanford went 5‚Äì7.[173] In January 2009, Harbaugh was confirmed to have been interviewed by the New York Jets for the head coach position,[174] although the job was eventually offered to Rex Ryan.[175] Although Stanford lost to USC in 2008, Harbaugh and the Stanford Cardinal upset USC at home again with a score of 55‚Äì21 on November 14, 2009.[176] Stanford's 55 points was the most ever scored on USC in the Trojans' history until Oregon scored 62 in a 62‚Äì51 win over USC on November 3, 2012. It was Pete Carroll's first November loss as USC head coach. After an infamous \"What's your deal?\" verbal exchange with Carroll following that game, Harbaugh and Carroll would go on to speak favorably about each other as NFL coaches.[177] From that game on, Stanford would buck the rivalry for the next decade (even after Harbaugh) left, winning eight of the next eleven matchups.[178] In 2009, the Cardinal had a comeback season, finishing the regular season at 8‚Äì4 and receiving an invitation to play in the 2009 Sun Bowl, the Cardinal's first bowl appearance since 2001.[179][180] Running back Toby Gerhart was named a Heisman Trophy finalist, finishing second to Mark Ingram II in the closest margin of voting in Heisman history.[181] On December 13, 2009, Harbaugh was rewarded with a three-year contract extension through the 2014 season.[182] The 2010 season brought more success for Harbaugh and the Cardinal. The team went 11‚Äì1 in the regular season, with their only loss coming from Oregon, a team that was undefeated and earned a berth in the BCS National Championship Game.[183][184][185] The first 11 win season in program history earned the Cardinal a #4 BCS ranking and a BCS bowl invitation to the Orange Bowl.[166][186][187] Stanford defeated Virginia Tech 40‚Äì12 for the Cardinal's first bowl win since 1996 and the first BCS bowl victory in program history.[188] Second year starting quarterback Andrew Luck was the runner-up to for the Heisman Trophy, the second year in a row that the runner-up was from Stanford.[189] Harbaugh was named the winner of the Woody Hayes Coach of the Year Award.[190] On January 7, 2011, four days after winning the Orange Bowl, Harbaugh agreed to a five-year, $25 million contract to become the head coach for the San Francisco 49ers.[191] He succeeded Jim Tomsula, who was interim head coach for only the last game of the preceding season after succeeding the fired Mike Singletary.[192] Prior to Harbaugh's arrival, the 49ers had not had a winning season nor a playoff appearance since 2002.[193] Though the 49ers were expected to struggle in what was anticipated to be a rebuilding season, with a new scheme and many new players as well as shortened summer practices due to the lockout, Harbaugh led the team to a 13‚Äì3 record in the regular season, winning the NFC West division while finishing second overall in the NFC and bringing the team to the NFC Championship Game.[194][195] This was the first time the 49ers had made the playoffs since 2002, generating widespread praise.[196][197] On November 24, Harbaugh played his brother John and the Baltimore Ravens, losing the Thanksgiving showdown 16‚Äì6.[198] John and Jim Harbaugh are the first pair of brothers to serve as NFL head coaches in the same season.[199] Harbaugh's work in San Francisco had resulted in an extremely successful season, revitalizing the career of quarterback Alex Smith and with defensive coordinator Vic Fangio creating one of the leading defensive squads of the 2011 season.[200] The 49ers' season ended with a 20‚Äì17 loss in overtime to the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants in the NFC Championship.[201] At the conclusion of the season, Harbaugh was named the AP NFL Coach of the Year.[202] In addition, he was named Coach of the Year by the PFWA and Sporting News.[203][204] In the 2012 season, Harbaugh resolved a quarterback controversy by replacing incumbent starter Alex Smith with backup Colin Kaepernick. Smith was ranked third in the NFL in passer rating (104.1), led the league in completion percentage (70%), and had been 19‚Äì5‚Äì1 as a starter under Harbaugh, while Kaepernick was considered more dynamic with his scrambling ability and arm strength.[205][206] Smith began 2012 with a 6‚Äì2 record as a starter before suffering a concussion in the following game.[207][208] He missed the following game, and Kaepernick was 16 for 23 for 243 yards with two touchdowns in a 32‚Äì7 win over the Chicago Bears.[208] Harbaugh was impressed with Kaepernick, and said \"we have two quarterbacks that have a hot hand\" while dismissing any rule that a player should not lose their starting job due to an injury.[209][210] Smith was medically cleared to play the day before the next game, but Harbaugh chose not to rush him back and again started Kaepernick, who threw and ran for a touchdown in a 31‚Äì21 win over the New Orleans Saints.[211][212] The following week, Harbaugh announced that Kaepernick would start for the 8‚Äì2‚Äì1 49ers, while also stating that the assignment was week-to-week and not necessarily permanent.[213] However, Kaepernick remained the starter for the remainder of the season as the 49ers again qualified for the playoffs.[207] Harbaugh led the team to an 11‚Äì4‚Äì1 record in the regular season, winning back to back NFC West titles.[214] Harbaugh's quarterback decision was on display in the first game of the playoffs.[207] The 49ers won 45‚Äì31 in the Divisional Round over the Green Bay Packers, as Kaepernick had 444 yards of total offense (263 passing, 181 rushing) and four touchdowns. Kaepernick set the record for rushing yards by a quarterback in any NFL game with his 181-yard outburst against Green Bay.[215] On January 20 in the NFC Championship, Harbaugh led the 49ers to a 28‚Äì24 win over the Atlanta Falcons, which sent the 49ers to Super Bowl XLVII, and on February 3, Harbaugh faced his older brother John and the Baltimore Ravens in the Super Bowl.[216][217] It was the first time that the opposing teams' head coaches in the Super Bowl were brothers;[218] the Ravens won the game with a score of 34‚Äì31 despite a third quarter comeback by the 49ers.[219] In the 2013 season, Harbaugh led the 49ers to a 12‚Äì4 regular-season record and a third consecutive appearance in both the playoffs and NFC Championship, where they lost to the Seattle Seahawks 23‚Äì17, who went on to win Super Bowl XLVIII.[220][221][222] In doing so, Harbaugh became the first NFL head coach to reach a conference championship game in each of his first three seasons.[223] The 49ers had an 8‚Äì8 season in 2014, failing to reach the playoffs for the first time under the Harbaugh era. On October 5, it was rumored that Harbaugh would not return in 2015 regardless of that season's outcome, although owner Jed York denied the claims at the time.[224] It has been suggested that Harbaugh, despite his success on the field, was involved in a power struggle with 49ers general manager Trent Baalke starting from the 2013 season onward.[225][226] On December 28, 2014, the 49ers announced that they had mutually agreed to part ways with Harbaugh as their head coach.[227] York claims Harbaugh and the 49ers agreed to mutually part ways immediately after a win over the Arizona Cardinals in the final week of the regular season.[228] Harbaugh, however, later said: \"I didn't leave the 49ers. I felt like the 49er hierarchy left me.\"[229] He further added that the 49ers informed him that he would no longer be the 49ers coach after suffering a loss on December 14, but that he decided to remain as the team's head coach for the final two games of the season because \"I wanted to finish what I started‚Äîwhat we started.\"[230] Harbaugh left the 49ers as one of their most successful head coaches in just four years, as well as becoming the first successful NFL head coach to depart for a college team.[225][226] New head coach Jim Tomsula was fired after just one season in which the 49ers finished 5‚Äì11.[231] Until the 2019 season, in which the 49ers went 13‚Äì3 and advanced to Super Bowl LIV, the 49ers had losing seasons every year following Harbaugh's departure.[232][233] On December 30, 2014, Harbaugh was introduced by the University of Michigan as the school's new head football coach.[234] His return to Michigan was the subject of a book, Endzone: The Rise, Fall, and Return of Michigan Football, by John U. Bacon.[235] On September 3, 2015, Harbaugh lost his first game as head coach of Michigan, a 24‚Äì17 road loss against Utah.[236] On September 12, Michigan won 35‚Äì7 against Oregon State, giving Harbaugh his first win as Michigan's head coach.[237] On September 26, Harbaugh led Michigan to a 31‚Äì0 victory over No. 22-ranked Brigham Young University, leading Michigan to move into #22 in the AP Poll.[238] This was Michigan's first appearance in the AP Top 25 since 2013.[239] On October 3, Harbaugh led the Wolverines to a 28‚Äì0 shutout win against the Maryland Terrapins, posting back to back shutouts for the first time since 2000.[240][241] The following week, Michigan beat #13 Northwestern 38‚Äì0, making the Wolverines the first team with a pair of 30-point shutouts against ranked opponents since Notre Dame's 1966 championship team.[242] He finished his first season as the Wolverines' head coach with a 10‚Äì3 record, with losses against Utah, Michigan State, and Ohio State,[243] and a redeeming victory in the Citrus Bowl over No. 19 Florida, 41‚Äì7.[244] After being tied, 7‚Äì7, in the first quarter, Michigan scored 34 unanswered points as they held Florida to just 28 yards in the second half.[245] Michigan was ranked 7th in the AP Poll to start the season.[246] After defeating Hawaii in the opening game of the 2016 season, Michigan was ranked 5th in the AP Poll. It was the first time Michigan had been ranked in the top five since the start of the 2007 season.[247][248] Michigan cruised through its non-conference slate before defeating #8 Wisconsin.[249] This was Michigan's first win over a top ten ranked team since 2008.[250] In week six, the Wolverines soundly defeated Rutgers 78‚Äì0, the third-largest margin of victory in program history and the largest margin since 1920.[251] Three weeks later, Michigan defeated Michigan State on the road, its first victory in East Lansing since 2007.[252] They then suffered their first loss of the season to Iowa, before beating Indiana for their 10th victory;[253][254] Harbaugh is one of only two coaches in program history to win 10 games in each of his first two seasons as head coach, joining Fielding H. Yost (1901‚Äì02).[255] The regular season finished with a highly anticipated matchup against #2 Ohio State, with a likely College Football Playoff bid on the line. In a game that went to two overtime periods, Ohio State finally defeated the Wolverines 30‚Äì27; Harbaugh said afterward he was \"bitterly disappointed with the officiating\", especially for a controversial 4th-and-1 call, and was reprimanded by the Big Ten with a $10,000 fine.[256][257] Michigan finished the season in the Orange Bowl, where it lost 33‚Äì32 to #10 Florida State, after losing Heisman-finalist Jabrill Peppers before the game and losing two-time All-American Jake Butt early in the game.[258][259] Michigan finished the season 10‚Äì3 and another third-place finish in their division.[260][261] Michigan finished the season in the Outback Bowl, losing 19‚Äì26 to South Carolina, becoming the only team in the Big Ten Conference to lose its bowl game in the 2017‚Äì2018 bowl season and giving them an 8‚Äì5 record on the year.[262][263] Michigan began the 2018 season ranked 14th in the AP Poll.[264] They lost their first game of the season against No. 12 Notre Dame 17‚Äì24, but rebounded the next two weeks with a 49‚Äì3 win over Western Michigan University and a 45‚Äì20 win over SMU.[265][266][267] Three weeks later, the 5‚Äì1 Wolverines faced the No. 15 Wisconsin Badgers in a Saturday night showdown. Michigan won the game 38‚Äì13, moving to No. 6 in the AP Poll.[268] The next week, the Wolverines beat rival Michigan State 21‚Äì7, moving to 5th in the AP Poll.[269] After a bye week, the Wolverines trampled Penn State 42‚Äì7, moving to 4th in both the AP poll and the College Football Playoff Rankings.[270][271] They would stay at that ranking after a 31‚Äì20 win over Indiana that earned the Wolverines a share of the East Division title.[272][273] Michigan lost at #10 Ohio State 62‚Äì39, denying Michigan a chance to play in the Big Ten Championship Game.[274] Ohio State's 62 points set a record for points against Michigan in regulation.[275] Harbaugh became the first Michigan coach to lose his first four starts against the Buckeyes.[276] The Wolverines lost to the Florida Gators 41‚Äì15 in the Peach Bowl, finishing with another 10‚Äì3 season.[277] During Harbaugh's fifth season, the Wolverines lost to Wisconsin 35‚Äì14 and to Penn State 28‚Äì21, both on the road. Michigan won decisively against rivals Notre Dame 45‚Äì14 and Michigan State 44‚Äì10, but concluded the regular season with a loss to then #1-ranked Ohio State by a score of 56‚Äì27 to end the regular season.[278][279][280][281][282] When asked about the gap between the two schools, his reply was testy: \"I'll answer your questions, not your insults.\"[283] The Wolverines finished the season in the Citrus Bowl, where they lost to Alabama, 35‚Äì16.[284] Michigan finished the season 9‚Äì4 overall.[285] Michigan's 2020 season was significantly shortened due to the Big Ten Conference's policies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.[286] On November 14, Michigan hosted Wisconsin and Michigan suffered its largest halftime deficit at home since Michigan Stadium opened in 1927 (28‚Äì0), as well as its largest home loss (49‚Äì11) since 1935.[287][288] On November 28, 2020, Michigan hosted Penn State and for the first time in Michigan football history, lost to a team that was 0‚Äì5 or worse.[289] Michigan was winless at home during the 2020 season, marking the first time in program history that Michigan did not win any games at home.[290] On January 8, 2021, Michigan signed Harbaugh to a four-year contract extension through the 2025 season.[291] Michigan, led by Harbaugh, finished the regular season 11‚Äì1. The Wolverines beat Western Michigan, Washington, Northern Illinois, Rutgers, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Northwestern, Indiana, No. 23 Penn State, and Maryland.[292] Michigan's lone loss came in a top-10 matchup on the road at Michigan State. Following the loss, according to Harbaugh, the Big Ten acknowledged that there were errors made by the officials on multiple calls, including one that could have resulted in a Michigan touchdown.[293] Michigan ended the regular season with a 42‚Äì27 victory over Ohio State, giving Harbaugh his first win over Ohio State and his second Big Ten East divisional title. Michigan advanced to the Big Ten Championship Game for the first time, where the Wolverines defeated Iowa in Indianapolis, 42‚Äì3, earning an Orange Bowl berth against Georgia in the College Football Playoff.[294] Following the season he was named the Associated Press College Football Coach of the Year Award.[295] By winning the award, Michigan became the first school to win both the AP coach of the year in men's basketball (Juwan Howard) and football since the football award was established in 1998.[296] In January 2022, reports emerged that Harbaugh would take the Las Vegas Raiders head coaching job if he was offered it.[297] Although he never interviewed with the Raiders, Harbaugh did interview with the Minnesota Vikings in late January and was a lead candidate for a head coaching job.[298] Reports emerged that Harbaugh was preparing to accept the Vikings head coaching position if he was offered it, but he ultimately did not receive an offer following his second interview with the team, and informed the University of Michigan that he would be returning to coach the Wolverines in the 2022 season.[299] The 2022 Wolverines began the season ranked sixth and eighth in the coaches' and AP polls, respectively.[300][301] They climbed into the top five in both polls as they opened the season with a seven-game winning streak, including a 27‚Äì14 win at Iowa on October 1 ‚Äì the program's first at Kinnick Stadium since 2005[302] ‚Äì and a dominating 41‚Äì17 win over previously unbeaten Penn State on October 15.[303] The Wolverines continued their winning streak on October 29 by defeating Michigan State 29‚Äì7, to reclaim the Paul Bunyan Trophy.[304] The team then defeated Rutgers 52‚Äì17, followed by a 34‚Äì3 win over Nebraska to reach 10‚Äì0 ‚Äì the program's best start to a season in Harbaugh's tenure, and best overall since 2006.[305] The Wolverines improved to 11‚Äì0 by defeating Illinois on a last-minute field goal, 19‚Äì17, then won a second straight Big Ten East Division title with a 45‚Äì23 victory over Ohio State.[306] It was the Wolverines' first 12 win regular season since 1905,[307] fourth 12 win season overall[307] and their first victory in Columbus, Ohio, since 2000.[308] Harbaugh was named Big Ten Coach of the Year for the 2022 season.[309] On December 3, the Wolverines reached 13‚Äì0 for the first time in school history by winning the Big Ten Championship Game over Purdue, 43‚Äì22.[310] The following day, Michigan was awarded its second consecutive College Football Playoff bid, seeded second and placed in the Fiesta Bowl.[311] On December 31, the Wolverines lost their semifinal match in the Fiesta Bowl to TCU, 51‚Äì45, to end the 2022 season 13‚Äì1.[312] On August 23, 2023, Michigan announced that it was self-imposing a suspension on Harbaugh for the first three games of the 2023 season due to violating recruiting regulations.[313] Michigan won all three games in his absence.[314] Harbaugh returned to lead Michigan to six straight victories,[315] including a 49‚Äì0 win at Michigan State, the largest margin of victory in that rivalry since 1947.[316] On November 10, the Big Ten Conference announced another three-game suspension against Harbaugh, as part of the investigation into the Michigan Wolverines football sign-stealing scandal.[317][318] On November 23, Michigan informed the NCAA that they would credit Harbaugh with the win‚Äìloss record from the three games to conclude the regular season.[319] Despite the suspensions, Michigan went undefeated in the regular season, including a 30‚Äì24 victory over Ohio State.[320] Harbaugh resumed as head coach to lead Michigan to a 26‚Äì0 win over Iowa in the Big Ten Championship,[321] a 27‚Äì20 overtime win over Alabama in the Rose Bowl,[322] and a 34‚Äì13 win over Washington in the CFP National Championship on January 8, 2024. The win gave Michigan its 12th claimed national championship in school history, their first since 1997, and first undisputed title since 1948.[323] Harbaugh served as head coach for 9 games and was officially credited with 12 wins during Michigan's 15‚Äì0 national championship season.[324] On January 24, 2024, Harbaugh was hired by the Los Angeles Chargers as their head coach.[325] On September 8, 2024, in Harbaugh's coaching debut with the franchise, the Chargers defeated the Las Vegas Raiders 22‚Äì10 as Harbaugh won his first NFL game as a head coach since December 2014.[326] Harbaugh comes from a coaching family and is the son of college football coach Jack Harbaugh. He has seven children. From his first marriage, to Miah Burke (m. 1996‚Äì2006),[328] he has sons Jay (a graduate of Oregon State University and the special teams coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks),[329] and James (a graduate of the University of Michigan's School of Music, Theatre & Dance); and a daughter, Grace (a water polo player and student at the Ross School of Business). From his second marriage, to Sarah Feuerborn Harbaugh (m. 2008),[330] he has two daughters, Addison and Katherine, and two sons, Jack (named after his grandfather) and John (named after his uncle).[331][332] Harbaugh is a Roman Catholic who has done charity work in Piura, Peru.[333][334] Jim Harbaugh's older brother, John, is the head coach of the Baltimore Ravens, and they became the first pair of brothers to serve as head coaches in NFL history, facing each other in the Thanksgiving Classic game in 2011 and Super Bowl XLVII on February 3, 2013, both of which Jim eventually lost.[335][336][337][338] In 1994, Harbaugh appeared as a cowboy in the Western/science fiction show The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. He also made an appearance on the popular TV show Saved by the Bell: The New Class in 1996, playing the cousin of the character Screech.[339] Harbaugh was the co-owner of Panther Racing in the IndyCar Series. The main car for the team carried Harbaugh's old jersey number, 4. When the team won the 2001 and 2002 IRL championship, the team, which had the option of going to No. 1, chose instead to keep the No. 4 for its association with Harbaugh's career.[340] On October 30, 2005, Harbaugh was arrested for DUI after running a stop sign in Encinitas, California.[341] He initially pleaded not guilty, but later entered into a plea deal. He pleaded guilty to a charge of reckless driving and was sentenced to three years of probation, a $1,300 fine and a drunken-driving educational program. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported his blood-alcohol level was .09.[342][343][344] In November 2012, Harbaugh had a cardioversion procedure to correct an arrhythmia (i.e., an abnormal heartbeat rhythm).[345] In 2018, Harbaugh portrayed himself on the Comedy Central series Detroiters in the episode \"Little Caesars\".[346][347] Harbaugh has championed equal access to justice for Americans through his involvement with the Legal Services Corporation (LSC).[348] On June 13, 2017, Harbaugh spoke in Washington, D.C., in the Senate Building about the gap in access to justice for low-income earning Americans which was showcased in the 2017 LSC report, \"The Justice Gap: Measuring the Unmet Civil Legal Needs of Low-Income Americans.\"[349] Harbaugh has also stated his opposition to abortion. In a podcast interview in April 2020, Harbaugh labeled medical abortion as \"horrendous\" and said, \"And lastly, abortion‚Äîwe talk about sanctity of life, yet we live in a society that aborts babies. There can't be anything more horrendous.\"[350] In July 2022, speaking at an anti-abortion event Harbaugh said, \"Have the courage to let the unborn be born\".[351][352][353] You got Jim Harbaugh, the coach of Michigan football, marching today. That's not something that was happening five to six years ago. Although Jim I know, and he's been on the right side of this issue for quite some time. In the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd by an on-duty police officer, Harbaugh expressed his outrage and said, \"All injustice should be confronted and punished. It has to be equal and fair to all, and no one can be above the law.\"[355][356] On June 2, 2020, a week after Floyd's murder, Harbaugh participated in an anti-police brutality commemorative protest in Ann Arbor.[357] Michigan offensive coach Josh Gattis separately thanked Harbaugh and his family for their impact on African American coaches and players, stating \"in challenging times of racial inequality and injustice I am even more thankful for the Harbaugh Family!\" Gattis credited Harbaugh for \"the fairness and promotion of black coaches in leadership roles like David Shaw, Derek Mason, Willie Taggart, Jim Caldwell, Pep Hamilton\" and himself.[358] Harbaugh's participation in the equality and anti-brutality protest was also singled out by former president Barack Obama, who praised him for \"being on the right side of this issue.\"[354] # denotes interim head coach # denotes interim head coach # denotes interim head coach # denotes interim head coach",

                "content": "As player: Jim Harbaugh (born December 23, 1963) is an American football coach and former player. He is the current head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League & former head coach of the Michigan Wolverines, the team representing the University of Michigan. Before returning to Michigan, where he had played in college, he coached the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League. Harbaugh is also a former NFL quarterback. Harbaugh was previously a quarterback in the NFL, and had a mediocre playing career in the 1990s. After his playing days were over, Harbaugh became a coach. He was notably the head coach of the Stanford Cardinal in college football. Harbaugh was known for his energetic style. He was then hired by the San Francisco 49ers of the NFL to be their head coach. In a game against the Detroit Lions (49ers win), a postgame handshake made national news. In the game, Harbaugh challenged a scoring play. However, under NFL rules, scoring plays are always reviewed. Detroit coach Jim Schwartz reportedly screamed a curse. After San Francisco won, the coaches went to midfield to shake hands. However, Schwartz accused Harbaugh of \"smacking his back and shaking his hand too hard.\" Shartz chased Harbaugh down the field, and they had to be separated. This is often called \"The Handshake Game.\" Harbaugh later led the San Francisco 49ers to the NFC Championship. He won the NFL Coach of the Year award for taking a struggling team (and quarterback, in Alex Smith) and taking them deep into the playoffs. Jim also adopted a chant used by his father. It has regularly been referenced in the 49ers' locker rooms. It goes: \"Whooo's got it better than us?\" Answer: Nooooobody! He left the 49ers after the 2014 NFL season and returned to Michigan as the Wolverines' new head coach. Jim Harbaugh is part of the famous Harbaugh coaching tree that includes father Jack Harbaugh and older brother John Harbaugh.",

                "content": "Filed under: What can we learn about the Chargers‚Äô new head coach Jim Harbaugh from the Amazon Prime documentary All or Nothing: The Michigan Wolverines from 2017? Jim Harbaugh spent eight long years in Ann Arbor as the Michigan Wolverines‚Äô head coach before leaving to take up the mantle of leading our Chargers last month. We all saw his enthusiastic personality front and center when he was introduced to the world as the new head coach. I thought about what kind of article I wanted to write about a man that, for many, epitomizes what a head coach should be and I realized that we are lucky enough to have access to a resource that can provide a deeper look into the nature of our new leader. In 2017, after back-to-back 10 win seasons, Amazon Prime‚Äôs camera crew started to follow Harbaugh, his staff and players around to film their documentary ‚ÄòAll or Nothing: The Michigan Wolverines‚Äô. This kind of insight, 340 minutes worth, into Jim and the team he created in his image, is invaluable to those seeking to understand him. So I decided to rewatch the series to see if we can find out what kind of coach we have on our hands. I distinctly remember watching this series soon after its release with very little understanding of Jim beyond his sideline persona, and I thought to myself; this man is the very spirit of football in human form. From his borderline corny catch phrases to his terrifying war cries, the man oozes energy in all the ways you want your commanding officer to, but it is his love for his players and the team they represent that makes me believe in him. There is a scene in the first episode where Harbaugh is going to meet the incoming freshman as they are moving into their dorms for the first time. He spends time talking with a fresh faced James Hudson III, the current starting right tackle for the Cleveland Browns, after he helped his mother carry his possessions from the lobby all the way to his room. I liked this moment because it seemed to me that he didn‚Äôt do this for the cameras where others would have done. He was excited, he wanted to be there for himself as much as for them, to travel down memory lane and remind himself once again as to how it felt to be at the very beginning of a glorious journey. There are many examples where Harbaugh rallies his troops through impassioned words but of all the times he spoke to the team there was one moment that stood out to me. He wrote a poem which he read out during a team meeting: ‚ÄúI am obliged for the hard service that you have laid down for me, it is what I expected, it is ordained from on high from the football gods that you should put this suffering in my path. To be tested by you, is the making of my soul‚Äù. Now this may be the most Catholic poem about football ever written but it peels back the curtain as to who Jim Harbaugh is. For him the ‚Äòsuffering‚Äô is a necessary part of the journey to becoming a great football player so he is actually grateful for it. He recited this piece of poetry just weeks after taking the entire team to meet the Pope in the Vatican City, for him football is faith and whilst his belief in a higher power may alienate some of his players, all of them will be able to understand the concept of suffering for a greater good. Jim is not just a tough character though, in fact he comes across just as goofy as he is hard nosed. When he was asked to judge a faculty members diving contest in the bye week he did so with a smile on his face, knowing that he is the Michigan brand personified. What he didn‚Äôt expect was that he was going to be corralled into doing a dive himself. Harbaugh didn‚Äôt even blink, he climbed up to the 3m platform and jumped off fully clothed to the adoring cheers of a surprised audience. As we saw from his introductory press conference, Coach Harbaugh has many catchphrases that really seem to motivate players. He utilizes these memorable slogans to affirm the mentality he wants to see reflected in his players and staff. Whether this kind of rhetoric can manage to have the same effect with professional players when times are tough is another matter, but for now I am going to enjoy watching this team grow to love them the same way Michigan, ‚ÄòNiner and Stanford fans still do after he has left their shores. Harbaugh graduated from the University of Michigan in 1986 having started at quarterback for 30 games, leaving on a high after coming third in the Heisman trophy in his senior year. It was this time wearing the blue and maize that made Jim into a ‚ÄòMichigan Man‚Äô, the phrase coined to describe the type of person that the University could be proud to represent the alumni beyond their days in Ann Arbor. The phrase can roughly be distilled down to the following; Loyalty, Integrity, Work Ethic, Teamwork, Excellence, Leadership, Respect. Jim embodies this description and to be honest I think he has molded himself around it, everything he does tries to follow the ideals of the organization where he spent his formative years. In a speech to the Michigan team in 2004, long before he came back to Ann Arbor, he talked about a meeting with Bo Schembechler during his playing days: ‚ÄúSitting in Bo‚Äôs office and I said ‚ÄúCoach, what kind of team are we going to have this year?‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúJimmy, when you guys come back in 15, 20 years from now and we know what kind of men you are, what kinds of husbands you become, what kind of fathers you are, then we‚Äôll know how good this football team is.‚Äù‚Äù The type of person and coach Jim is can be found in the anecdotes he chooses to portray what he expects of his players, of the Michigan Men in front of him. He very deliberately and repeatedly installs a mentality in his players by surrounding them with the type of people he believes uphold the principles on which he has built his attitude to winning. The Harbaugh family are football royalty; Jim‚Äôs father, brother and son have all been coaches with the culmination coming as Jim and his brother Jack faced each other in Super Bowl XLVII. Jim took the opportunity to ask his brother John, the current head coach of the Baltimore Ravens, to speak to the team when they were in the hotel before their game at Maryland. John said: ‚ÄúWe like Michigan players, we like you guys. There‚Äôs a reason 19 guys were drafted last year; you know what they do? they run to the ball, they play hard, they know what they‚Äôre supposed to do. You can trust them, they‚Äôre accountable, they‚Äôre going to come to practice. There‚Äôs no coach in the national football league that wants some guy who‚Äôs not going to do the right thing, not going to be on time, not going to work hard, not going to be thinking about football. We want football players, we play football. I want guys who want to be out there, I want to win . . . I want a bunch of badasses on my team, that‚Äôs what I want because I‚Äôm from a Michigan family.‚Äù With this move Harbaugh showed me that he will utilize every resource available to him to instill a tough mentality that embodies his vision of a ‚ÄòMichigan man‚Äô. ‚ÄúBe nasty. Be tougher. Be meaner‚Äù Jim Harbaugh expects his players to be tough above anything else. It was clear whilst watching his 49ers team hammer their opponents without mercy and this series portrayed a Michigan team that reinforced those same characteristics. This was no coincident, toughness is a behavior rather than an action and Jim takes every chance he has to establish those patterns within his players; ‚ÄúFootball is a game that I don‚Äôt know any other like it. It tests you, this game will work every muscle in your body. When you get on the field you have to tell the truth, there‚Äôs no way to bullcrap your way through it. Are you prepared, are you trained, are you talented enough, are you going to give the extra effort?‚Äù At times his pre-game messages go beyond the tried and tested motivational jargon, his eccentric charisma takes center stage and it results in some memorable moments. I think we can look forward to some ‚ÄòHarbaughisms‚Äô that could even rival Dan Campbell‚Äôs now infamous ‚ÄúBite their kneecaps‚Äô‚Äô speech. Let‚Äôs hope the Chargers experience the same success the Lions have since that day. ‚ÄúBe like a hitman, be like an assassin out there. Be like a vampire bat, let‚Äôs go suck the blood right out of these people tomorrow from start to finish.‚Äù Harbaugh described his brother as ‚Äútough as a two dollar steak‚Äù during his introductory press conference but it was clear throughout this documentary that this description extends his way. If any coach could turn a team with a history of falling short due to not being built for the tough moments, it is Jim Harbaugh. The Los Angeles Chargers have appointed a type of coach that they haven‚Äôt been able to find since Don Coryell; an experienced winner. Winning is a habit, an attitude that feeds into how you approach everything you do. After a win over Rutgers, Harbaugh is playing football with his son, Jack, out in the driveway and his son says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Michigan and you‚Äôre Rutgers‚Äù and without hesitation Jim pops the ball out of his then five year old son‚Äôs hands and extends over his head exclaiming ‚Äútouchdown Rutgers‚Äù. Even in a moment of pure joy, he can‚Äôt help but be a competitor and a winner even if it‚Äôs for the other side. There were times in a difficult 2017 season when Jim was faced with opportunities to show how a winner handles adversity. After the blowout loss to Penn State Jim knew their season had drastically changed for the worse however he knew that this was a chance for him to impart some wisdom for the next time they have to deal with a setback: ‚ÄúThere ain‚Äôt nowhere to go to surrender in football. There‚Äôs no Appomattox in football. We got opportunities ahead of us, we got to take advantage of them. Don‚Äôt look for people outside of here to help you, all you got is right here. All the medicine is right here, the only place you can get fixed is right here.‚Äù Before ‚ÄòThe Game‚Äô against Ohio State, defensive coordinator Don Brown addresses his players highlighting the efforts of his star players in practice this week, a list that boasted players that went on to play in the pros. However when it was Harbaugh‚Äôs turn to speak he took a different route to inspire his players. Instead of looking to his stars he decided to talk about John O‚ÄôKorn, the second choice quarterback who lost the starting job to the sophomore Brandon Peters, only to gain it back through an injury. Harbaugh shines a light on the way in which John conducted himself throughout this tumultuous season, saying that he has handled the adversity admirably. ‚ÄúEvery time we have asked him to play, every time we‚Äôve needed him to play, he‚Äôs the one standing. There‚Äôs no one I‚Äôd rather have at quarterback for us tomorrow than you John. Let‚Äôs go get this done.‚Äù Now this may seem like a simple case of backing the horse you‚Äôre sat on but to me the way in which Jim deliberately chose the whole team meeting to deliver this message, to show the trust he had in a quarterback who has let him down in pivotal moments, speaks volumes as to the type of coach he is. Every player in that room looks up to Jim, so when he placed his faith in John in that moment, he instilled a new level of trust that his players would match. This is what a players‚Äô coach looks like, this is a man who commands a respect that goes both ways. This is a man who can turn a franchise into winners. The man Jim Harbaugh truly is, can be found all over the eight episodes of the documentary. There are characteristics that some players will shy away from; he accepts nothing less than full effort and he isn‚Äôt afraid to tell anyone what he thinks in moments of hardship. If there is fault to be found then he will identify it and correct it without hesitation, his experience has afforded him this privilege but you get the feeling he has been like this throughout his career. He showed his ruthless side when speaking to the team in preseason by quoting Bill Belichick saying ‚ÄúCoaches don‚Äôt cut players, players cut players‚Äù. One thing that Jim values highly is putting his faith in his players to take care of business. After an overtime win over unranked Indiana that was, by all accounts, unnecessarily scrappy he said to his players: ‚ÄúThere was a lot of pressure on everybody here, we put our best people on it: our players and you guys came through. Hell of a job.‚Äù I liked this moment because he found a way to empower his players despite them underperforming. A lot of coaches would say use the ‚Äúwe‚Äù in this moment, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that when referring to team victories, but Harbaugh made sure his players know that when the tough moments arrive, his players believe they are trusted to execute. He particularly puts pressure on his quarterback. ‚ÄúA quarterback‚Äôs job is: do not let this team lose‚Äù. Justin Herbert will almost certainly welcome this, even when he has performed well above expectations Justin is ready to take blame for a loss saying he has to ‚Äúexecute better‚Äù. This documentary certainly highlighted just how well these two men of integrity will match up. At any team meeting held in the 2017 season Harbaugh was addressing 31 future NFL players. Although they came up short on their lofty goals, I am sure every player in that room learned valuable lessons in how Jim Harbaugh handled the difficult moments. At the end of the day there are no surprises when it comes to Jim Harbaugh; he speaks like a winner because he has proven he is a winner everywhere he has been. He comes across with a certainty in how to get the best out of his players because he has a track record of fulfilling the promises he made to those young men‚Äôs parents when sitting in their living room‚Äôs during recruitment drives. Harbaugh strives to be a ‚ÄòMichigan Man‚Äô in everything he does but in reality he upholds that standard more than anyone asks of him. It is his self appointed requirement to be the best, more than just to win, that should give Charger fans hope for a bountiful future. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537).

                "title": "Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team is an NCAA Division I college basketball team competing in the Big Ten Conference, that represent the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Home games are played at the State Farm Center, located on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's campus in Champaign. Illinois has one pre-tournament national championship and one non-NCAA tournament national championship in 1915 and 1943, awarded by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Illinois has appeared in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament 34 times, and has competed in 5 Final Fours, 10 Elite Eights, and has won 18 Big Ten regular season championships, and 4 Big Ten Tournament Championships. The team is currently coached by Brad Underwood, who was hired on March 18, 2017. Through the end of the 2023‚Äì24 season, Illinois ranks 13th all-time in winning percentage and 13th all-time in wins among all NCAA Division I men's college basketball programs. The Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team began play during the 1905‚Äì06 season with Elwood Brown guiding the team to a 9‚Äì8 record as their first coach. Frank L. Pinckney took control of the team before the start of the 1906‚Äì07 season. The team would win their first game but would end up dropping the next 10 contests. Another coaching change led to Fletcher Lane being in charge of the team for the 1907‚Äì08 season. After starting the season 14‚Äì1 in non-conference, Illinois would finish the season losing five of their 11 conference games, ending the year third in the Western Conference with a 20‚Äì6 (6‚Äì5) record. Even though Lane led a successful season, his style of coaching was deemed subpar. Former Illini player Herb Juul was then hired as the head coach of the 1908‚Äì09 squad. The Illini would not see the same success as the season prior, finishing the season with a 7‚Äì6 (5‚Äì6) record. Despite the struggles, Juul became the first coach in Illinois history to return for more than one season. However, the 1909‚Äì10 season would be his last as the Illini finished with a 5‚Äì4 (5‚Äì4) record. Thomas E. Thompson took the reigns before the 1910‚Äì11 season. The Illini would finish fourth in the Western Conference after earning a 6‚Äì6 (6‚Äì5) record. The 1911‚Äì12 season was Thompson's last year as head coach of the Illini after they finished with an 8‚Äì8 (4‚Äì8) record. Before the start of the 1912‚Äì13 season, Illinois hired former Purdue head coach, Ralph Jones. During his three seasons in West Lafayette, Jones compiled a 32‚Äì9 record, while also winning the previous two Western Conference titles. During his first season with Illinois, Jones led the Illini to a 10‚Äì6 record which was Illinois' second 10-win season in school history. During the 1914‚Äì15 season, Illinois won their first-ever Big Ten title, going 16‚Äì0 (12‚Äì0). They were retroactively declared champion of that season by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. They would earn another Big Ten title during the 1916‚Äì17 season, sharing it with Minnesota. Before the start of the 1936‚Äì37 season, Douglas R. Mills began acting as the head coach and athletic director of the Illinois men's basketball team. In his first season, the Illini finished with a 14‚Äì4 (10‚Äì2) record, which was good enough to share the Big Ten title with Minnesota. Before World War II broke out, the Fighting Illini men's basketball program had achieved a status that had never been seen prior. Mills grouped a team of players, all around 6-foot-3, into a nearly undefeatable lineup later known as the \"Whiz Kids\". The 1941‚Äì42 freshman and sophomore lineup of Arthur Smiley, Ken Menke, Andy Phillip, Gene Vance, Victor Wukovits, and Art Mathisen dominated the Big Ten by posting a 13‚Äì2 conference record and winning the conference title outright. It would be their first unanimous Big Ten championship since 1915. The Illini finished 1942‚Äì43 season with a 17‚Äì1 (12‚Äì0) record, winning their second-straight Big Ten title. Despite being ranked No. 1 in the nation, they opted not to play in the 1943 NCAA tournament after three of their five starters were called to duty in World War II. At the end of the season, they were named Premo-Porretto Pre-Associated Press Poll national champions. The 1946‚Äì47 season, would be Mills' last season as the head coach of the Illini. The team ended the season with a 14‚Äì6 (8‚Äì4) record, finishing one game behind Wisconsin in the Big Ten standings. Under Mills, the Illini compiled a record of 151 wins and 66 losses while winning three conference championships in the process. Champaign High School basketball coach Harry Combes was hired to succeed Doug Mills as Mills left the position to focus on his duties as the athletic director. Through his first five seasons as head coach, Combes led the Fighting Illini to three NCAA Final Four appearances in 1949, 1951, and 1952.[2] During his tenure as coach, Combes increased the Fighting Illini's offensive output by changing their style of play. Combes implemented Full-court press defense, causing turnovers at a high rate which translated into Fast break points.[2] In 1951, Combes signed the first black player to don an Illinois uniform, 3x All-State point guard Walt Moore of Mount Vernon. Along with teammate and future Illinois standout Max Hooper, Moore led the Rams to back-to-back state championship titles, culminating with a perfect 33‚Äì0 record in 1950. During the 1957‚Äì58 season, Mannie Jackson and Govoner Vaughn were inserted into the starting lineup as the first two African-Americans to start and letter in basketball at Illinois.[3] Combes also oversaw the Illini's move from Huff Hall to Assembly Hall in 1963 and during that same season the Illini won a fourth Big Ten Conference championship under Combes. However, the Illini lost to eventual national champion Loyola (Chicago) in the Elite Eight of the 1963 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The following 1964‚Äì65 season, saw several upset victories over defending national champion UCLA Bruins and national powerhouse Kentucky Wildcats at Memorial Coliseum in Lexington, Kentucky.[2] Combes' tenure came to an end as a result of the University of Illinois slush fund scandal. As head coach of the basketball team, he was primarily responsible for the basketball fund, and thus held a key role in the scandal. Assistant basketball coach Howie Braun also lost his job due to the scandal. Former Illini player Harv Schmidt was hired to fill the head coaching vacancy ten days after Combes' forced resignation. During his tenure, the Illini compiled an 89-77 overall record but went 43-55 in conference play. The team did not have any postseason appearances during his tenure. Gene Bartow would later sign a five-year contract to replace Schmidt in 1974, but he left after one season in which the Illini finished last place in the conference to replace John Wooden at UCLA. In 1975, after having taken New Mexico State (and future Illinois assistant coach Jimmy Collins) to the 1970 Final Four, Lou Henson moved to the University of Illinois to replace Gene Bartow, after Bartow left Illinois to replace the legendary John Wooden at UCLA. Henson would lead the Fighting Illini back to their glory after having a number of difficult years following the Illinois slush fund scandal (where Illinois was hit with severe penalties for infractions that other Big 10 schools had in years prior been punished much more leniently (according to Sports Illustrated) at the time). In 21 years at Illinois, Henson garnered 423 wins and 224 losses (.654 winning percentage), and with a record of 214 wins and 164 losses (.567) in Big Ten Conference games. The 214 wins in Big Ten games were the third highest total ever at the time of his retirement. At Illinois, Henson coached many future NBA players, including Eddie Johnson, Derek Harper, Ken Norman, Nick Anderson, Kendall Gill, Kenny Battle, Marcus Liberty, Steve Bardo, and Kiwane Garris. In 1981, Illinois made strides in its return to the national spotlight with a 21‚Äì8 record, a third-place Big Ten finish and an invitation to the NCAA Tournament. The team received a first-round bye in the NCAA Tournament and beat Wyoming, 67‚Äì65, in Los Angeles to advance to the regionals in Salt Lake City, where Illinois lost to Kansas State, 57‚Äì52. During this season, the Fighting Illini led the Big Ten in scoring for the second consecutive season and were again led by Eddie Johnson and Mark Smith. Guards Craig Tucker and Derek Harper arrived to add backcourt punch, and Harper began his Illini career being named First-Team Freshman All-America by ESPN and ABC. The top-seeded and top-ranked 1989 Illini were upset 83‚Äì81 in the Final Four on a last second basket by Michigan's Sean Higgins, ending the school's deepest run in the tournament at that time. Illinois had beaten the Wolverines by 12 and 16 points in two previous meetings that season. The 1988‚Äì89 Illinois Fighting Illini team gained the moniker \"Flyin' Illini\" by Dick Vitale during an ESPN broadcast that season. The team also gained national prominence for its athletic players, such as NCAA slam dunk champions Kenny Battle and Kendall Gill, as well as Lowell Hamilton, Nick Anderson, Marcus Liberty, and Stephen Bardo. The early 1990s Illini were dominated by players such as guards Andy Kauffman, Richard Keene, and Kiwane Garris, as well as centers Shelly Clark and Deon Thomas. Thomas was at the center of a report of misconduct by Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball assistant coach Bruce Pearl, who alleged that Thomas had been offered cash to attend Illinois. The Illini were suspended from postseason play for one season for unrelated violations uncovered during the investigation. After longtime coach Lou Henson's departure, Illinois hired Lon Kruger to fill the vacancy for the 1996 season. Kruger was the 14th head basketball coach in program history. During his four-year tenure he compiled a 59‚Äì38 record. He immediately made an impact at Illinois leading them to a 22‚Äì10 record and a second round NCAA tournament appearance in his first year. This created excitement because of the ninth-place finish the Illini had taken just before his arrival. Kruger inherited players such as Victor Chukwudebe, Jerry Hester, Kevin Turner, Jerry Gee, Matt Heldman, Brian Johnson, Kiwane Garris and Cleotis Brown. During his four seasons at Illinois, three of which resulted in NCAA Tournament berths, (all three of which saw the Illini eliminated in the 2nd round) Kruger became the only Big Ten coach to successfully sign three consecutive Illinois Mr. Basketball winners, inking Sergio McClain, Frank Williams, and Brian Cook between 1997 and 1999.Several times during his coaching tenure the Illini were predicted to be at the bottom of the Big Ten, however he overcame adversity each time performing far better than expected. Illinois picked Tulsa coach Bill Self from a list of numerous candidates, including popular assistant Jimmy Collins, to succeed Kruger, who moved on to the NBA to coach the Atlanta Hawks. Bill Self was hired to the Illini coaching staff as the 15th head coach in the history of the program. He spent his previous seven years as the head coach of Oral Roberts University and Tulsa University where he compiled an overall record of 129‚Äì71. In 2001, his first season at Illinois, Self coached his new Fighting Illini squad to a 27‚Äì8 record, a share of the Big Ten title, and a number 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. That 27-game winning season in Self's first year was the second most winning season in school history at that time. McClain, Cook and preseason Big Ten player of the year Cory Bradford led the Illini to the Elite Eight, where they fell to eventual finalist Arizona in a much disputed contest. The Illini were accused of being overly physical most of the season, especially McClain and pesky guards Sean Harrington and Lucas Johnson (younger brother of former Illini forward Brian Johnson). The '01 Illini team also included Robert Archibald, Damir Krupalija and Marcus Griffin. With mostly the same core, Illinois followed up the season with impressive 2002 and 2003 campaigns, but fell in the Sweet 16 in 2002. He was the first head coach in the Big Ten, since 1912, to lead his team to conference championships in each of his first two seasons. It was also the first time Illinois won back-to-back titles in 50 years. Self, also, had an overall record of 78‚Äì24 in his three years as Illinois head coach. Self left for Kansas after the 2003 season.[4] Bruce Weber served as the head coach of Illinois basketball for nine seasons from 2003 to 2012. After Bill Self left, Illinois AD Ron Guenther hired Weber to coach the Fighting Illini on April 30, 2003. Weber came from Southern Illinois University (SIU) in Carbondale and was touted as a loyal coach, which was valued by the Illinois AD after both Kruger and Self left Champaign with relatively short tenures. In his five seasons as head coach at SIU, Weber took the Saluki program to the top of the Missouri Valley Conference, winning league titles in 2002 and 2003. He posted records of 28‚Äì8 and 24‚Äì7 in his last two seasons, leading the Salukis to back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances, including a run to the Sweet 16 in 2002 with wins over Texas Tech and Georgia at the United Center in Chicago. His .689 (62‚Äì28) winning percentage in MVC play ranked 12th in the long history of the league. Weber earned Missouri Valley Conference Coach of the Year honors following the 2003 season. Illinois totaled 210 victories under Weber from 2004 to 2012. He ranks third on the Illinois career coaching wins list. He won 67.5 percent of his games while in charge of the Fighting Illini (210‚Äì101). Under Weber, the Illini had two Big Ten Championships (2004, 2005), two runner-up finishes (2006, 2009) and seven upper-division finishes. Illinois had five players selected in the NBA draft under Weber, as Deron Williams (No. 3, Utah Jazz) and Luther Head (No. 24, Houston Rockets) were taken in the first round of the 2005 NBA draft, and James Augustine (No. 41, Orlando Magic) and Dee Brown (No. 46, Utah Jazz) were chosen in the second round of the 2006 NBA draft. Meyers Leonard was chosen 11th by the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2012 NBA draft following Weber's final season. Utah's selection of Williams at No. 3 overall in the 2005 lottery made him the highest-drafted player in Illinois history. It took just one season for Weber to etch his name in the Big Ten and Illinois record books after leading the Fighting Illini to its first outright Big Ten title in 52 years during the 2003‚Äì04 season. In leading his young team that featured just one senior on the roster, Weber became just the third coach in the history of the Big Ten to win an outright title in his first season. Illinois had to win 10 straight to end the regular season to claim the championship, including six-straight wins on the road. Illinois' 26 wins in 2003‚Äì04 tied the fourth-winningest season in school history. Weber also led the Illini to the Sweet 16 with NCAA Tournament victories over Murray State and Cincinnati. Weber's second year at Illinois, the 2004‚Äì05 season, will be remembered as one of the greatest in Fighting Illini history, finishing 37‚Äì2 as the National Runner-Up in the NCAA tournament. In a remarkable year where Illinois celebrated its centennial season of basketball, the Illini reeled off 29 straight wins to start the year, tying the 12th-best start in NCAA Div. I history and the third-best start in Big Ten history. Illinois also secured its second-straight outright Big Ten championship with a 15‚Äì1 league record, as Weber became the first coach in Big Ten history to win consecutive outright titles in his first two seasons. Illinois then added a Big Ten tournament championship in addition to its regular season title. The Illini were ranked No. 1 in the nation for 15 straight weeks, including a first-ever No. 1 ranking in the final Associated Press poll. They gained the #1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament and prevailed in one of the most memorable games in NCAA history against Arizona. Down 15 points with around 4 minutes left, the Illini rallied with a run led by Luther Head and Deron Williams. The game was sent into overtime and the Illini pulled off a one-point win to advance to the 2005 Final Four in St. Louis. It was the Fighting Illini's first Final Four Appearance since the 1988‚Äì89 season. Against the Louisville Cardinals in the national semifinal game, the Illini posted their final victory of the season. All of the five Illini starters‚ÄìDeron Williams, Luther Head, Dee Brown, James Augustine, and Roger Powell, Jr.‚Äìwould eventually play in the NBA. Williams and Brown both joined the Utah Jazz roster, while Luther Head went on to play for the Sacramento Kings. With all that Illinois accomplished during the season, Weber swept the 2005 National Coach of the Year awards, claiming the following: the Naismith Award, the most prestigious coaching award in college basketball; the Henry Iba Award, presented by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association; and, the Adolph F. Rupp Cup. Weber was also named National Coach of the Year by the NABC, Associated Press, The Sporting News, Basketball Times, CBS/Chevrolet, Victor Awards and Nike Championship Basketball Clinic. Despite losing three starters and 63 percent of its scoring from the 2004‚Äì05 NCAA runner-up squad, Weber directed the 2005‚Äì06 Illini to a third-consecutive 4829-win season, a runner-up finish in the Big Ten, the second round of the NCAA Tournament, and a ranking among the nation's top 17 teams throughout the entire season. The Illini spent the majority of 2005‚Äì06 ranked in the Top 10 and recorded 26 wins on the year to tie the fourth-winningest season in school history. The Illini were given a number 4 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they beat Air Force in the opening round, before falling to the University of Washington in the second round. The 2006‚Äì07 team finished with a record of 23‚Äì12 (9‚Äì7) and finished tied for fourth in the Big Ten. With a depleted roster that had six different players combine to miss a total of 58 games due to injury, the Illini still advanced to the NCAA Tournament. They were awarded a 12 seed and lost in the opening round to Virginia Tech. The 2007‚Äì08 season was one of the worst seasons in Illinois history, highlighted by a string of close losses. The lone bright spot came as Illinois came on strong to win four of its last five and five of its final seven games, which culminated with a runner-up finish at the Big Ten tournament. Weber's Illini became the first No. 10 seed in the tournament's history to advance to the title game, winning three games in three days with victories over Penn State, No. 17 Purdue, and Minnesota to reach the championship game vs. No. 8 Wisconsin. However, with an overall record of 16‚Äì19 (5‚Äì13), the Illini were not selected to participate in postseason play. Weber's 2008‚Äì09 UI squad was one of the most improved teams in the country finishing with a record of 24‚Äì10 (11‚Äì7). With 10 more regular season victories than it achieved the year before, Illinois posted the third-biggest turnaround in NCAA Division I and the second-biggest turnaround among BCS programs on the year. The Illini recorded 24 wins, ranking as the 10th winningest season in school history. Illinois was the Big Ten runner-up, earned a No. 5 seed in the 2009 NCAA Tournament, and finished the year ranked 24th in the Pomeroy rankings. The Illini lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament to the 12th-seeded Western Kentucky Hilltoppers. During the 2009‚Äì10 season, the Illini finished 21‚Äì15 (10‚Äì8) and finished 5th in the Big Ten. The team was widely considered to be \"on the bubble\" for the NCAA tournament and missed the tournament field by a narrow margin. The Illini competed in the NIT, falling at home to the Dayton Flyers in the NIT Quarterfinals. Illinois rebounded in 2010‚Äì11 to finish 20‚Äì14 (9‚Äì9) and tied for fourth in the Big Ten. The Illini were selected to join the NCAA tournament as a #9 seed, where they defeated the #8 seeded UNLV Rebels setting up a matchup with the #1 seeded Kansas Jayhawks and former coach Bill Self. Kansas proved to be too much for the Illini, and the season came to an end in the round of 32. In 2011‚Äì12, Weber's last as coach of the Illini, the team finished 17‚Äì15 (6‚Äì12), good for 9th in the conference. The team did not compete in the postseason. Illinois' new AD Mike Thomas fired Weber after the 2011‚Äì12 season. John Groce was hired by the new athletic director Mike Thomas on March 28, 2012.[5] During the 2012‚Äì13 season, the Illini were the Maui Invitational champions and later made the NCAA tournament, losing their second game to the Miami Hurricanes by a score of 63‚Äì59. The Illini spent eight weeks nationally ranked in the NCAA Division I rankings, and for two weeks were ranked as high as 10th in the country. The 2013‚Äì14 season saw major roster turnover, with nine players leaving and nine players joining the program. This season was one to forget, as the Illini would ultimately miss the NCAA Tournament and lose in the second round of the NIT. In 2014, Groce continued Illinois' success in November, improving to 21‚Äì0 under Groce and 32‚Äì0 overall during the past four seasons. Illinois is the only program in the nation with an undefeated November record dating back to 2011.[6] The 2014‚Äì2015 season was once again disappointing for the Illini. Illinois finished with a record of 19‚Äì14, finishing tied for 7th place in the Big Ten with a record of 9‚Äì9. The Illini were then beaten in the first round of the NIT. The 2015‚Äì16 season ended with the fewest total wins in almost 20 years since the 98‚Äì99 Lon Kruger crew won only 14 games. Groce's squad finished with a record of 15‚Äì19, taking 12th place in the Big Ten and receiving no post-season tournament invitations. The 2016‚Äì17 season was another disappointing season for the Fighting Illini, as they finished the season at 18‚Äì14 and 8‚Äì10 in the conference, failing to make the NCAA Tournament for the fourth consecutive year. On March 11, 2017, the university announced via press release that Groce had been relieved of his duties as head men's basketball coach. The next day, the team was put into the NIT as a 2-seed. The team was coached during the NIT by interim coach Jamall Walker, making it to the quarterfinals before being eliminated by the University of Central Florida. On March 18, 2017, Brad Underwood was hired by athletic director Josh Whitman.[7] Underwood previously coached at Stephen F. Austin from 2013 to 2016, before spending one year at Oklahoma State. In Underwood's first season at Illinois, the team won each of their first five contests. After beginning conference play 0‚Äì8, they ended the season with a record of 14‚Äì18. While the 2018‚Äì19 season featured the debut of key pieces including Ayo Dosunmu, Giorgi Bezhanishvili, Andres Feliz, and Alan Griffin, the Illini posted one of the worst records in program history at 12‚Äì21 (7‚Äì13 in Big Ten). Despite the poor record, Illinois had many memorable moments such as upsetting #9 Michigan State at home and Bezhanishvili scoring 35 points against Rutgers, breaking the Illini record for most points by a freshman in a single game. The 2019‚Äì20 season was the freshman year of highly ranked center Kofi Cockburn. The Illini started the season slow in the first game, barely beating Nicholls State 78‚Äì70 in overtime. During the ACC‚ÄìBig Ten Challenge, Illinois played Miami where they lost 81‚Äì79 after they mounted a huge comeback before a charge was called against Dosunmu on the game's final play. The next game they traveled to College Park to play against #3 Maryland. The Illini led by 14 at the half, but Maryland outscored Illinois 34‚Äì19 in the second half and won the game by an Anthony Cowan free throw. The Illini next played #5 Michigan at the State Farm Center. They would beat the Wolverines 71‚Äì62 to improve to 7‚Äì3 on the season. Over the next 12 games, the Illini went 10‚Äì2, including Dosunmu's game-winning shot during their second matchup against Michigan to give Illinois a 64‚Äì62 lead with half a second left on the clock. Illinois would finish the season with a 21‚Äì10 (13‚Äì7) record which would be good enough for 4th in the Big Ten. They would also finish ranked 21st in the AP Poll and 22nd in the Coaches Poll. The 2020‚Äì21 season that Underwood finally had mostly his recruits running the team and it certainly showed on the court. After much deliberation, Ayo Dosunmu returned to Illinois for his junior season instead of going to the NBA. He, along with Kofi Cockburn, helped make Illinois into a top-10 team. They went 16-4 (0.800) in the B1G conference but had a worse record than Michigan (14-3, 0.824), and therefore did not earn even a share of the title. This title was disputed as Michigan had failed to play three extra games because of COVID protocols, and only one loss in those three games would have given Illinois the title; Illinois had beaten Michigan by 23 without leading scorer Ayo Dosunmu in Ann Arbor. The team went on to win the Big Ten tournament title, however, after a hard-fought, overtime 91‚Äì88 win over OSU. Illinois became a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament for the 4th time in school history. They were upset by Loyola-Chicago in the 2nd round and finished the season 24‚Äì7. Dosunmu became the first player in Illini history to earn 1st-team All-America honors by the AP. Cockburn was named to the AP All-American 2nd-team. Before the 2021‚Äì22 season, Ayo Dosunmu was drafted by the Chicago Bulls, and Adam Miller transferred to LSU, leading to Andr√© Curbelo being expected to serve as the primary ball handler. Unfortunately, Curbelo suffered a concussion prior to the season opener that would continue to affect him throughout the season. The team was led by fifth-year players Trent Frazier and Da'Monte Williams. Kofi Cockburn returned for his junior year but was suspended for the first three games for selling his team jerseys during the off-season. The team tied with Wisconsin for a share of the Big Ten regular season title, with a record of 15-5. Due to the tiebreaker rules, the team was seeded first in the Big Ten Tournament but lost its first game to ninth-seeded Indiana. The team was given the #4 seed in the South region of the NCAA tournament. After a 54-53 victory against Chattanooga, the team lost in the second round to Houston. Cockburn was named to the AP All-American 1st-team. The roster suffered from some major turnover before the 2022‚Äì23 season, with five players transferring out of the program, four players graduating, and Kofi Cockburn electing to stay in the NBA draft (and ultimately going undrafted). Three players transferred into the program and six freshmen were recruited. As a result of the roster changes, the team would be led by Terrence Shannon Jr. and Coleman Hawkins. The Illini would secure two major wins in non-conference play, beating #8 UCLA in the Continental Tire Main Event semifinal and #2 Texas in the Jimmy V Classic. Both Zacharie Perrin and Skyy Clark left the program during the season. Ultimately the season was a step back for the program, as due to tiebreaker rules, the team received a seven seed and lost to Penn State in their first game of the Big Ten Tournament. The team then received the #9 seed in the West region and lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Arkansas. For the first time since Underwood's second season, the team finished the season unranked in the AP Poll. The 2023-24 season would be one to remember. Three pivotal graduate transfers, Marcus Domask, Quincy Guerrier, and Justin Harmon joined the team, with Domask and Guerrier starting most games. The Illini went on an undefeated trip to Spain and then beat #1 ranked Kansas in a televised exhibition game. The team lost only two games to non-NCAA tournament teams, once to Penn State and once to Maryland. After finishing second in the Big Ten standings, the team ultimately won the Big Ten Tournament, prevailing over Wisconsin. The team was selected to the NCAA tournament as the #3 seed in the East region. For the first time in Underwood's tenure, the team made the Sweet Sixteen, where it beat the #2 seed, Iowa State. For the first time since the 2004‚Äì05 season, the team made the Elite Eight, where it lost to #1-overall and eventual national champion UConn.

Kenney Gym Annex is a 5,000-seat multi-purpose arena that is the practice facility for the Fighting Illini gymnastics team. Before the opening of Huff Hall in 1925, Kenney Gym housed the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team. It also was home to the Women's Volleyball program from 1974 until 1989, after which the program moved to Huff Hall in 1990. Huff Hall is a 4,050-seat multi-purpose arena in Champaign, Illinois, United States. The arena opened in 1925 and was known as Huff Gymnasium until the 1990s. It is named after George Huff, the school's athletic director from 1895 to 1935. Huff Hall is home to the University of Illinois Fighting Illini volleyball and wrestling teams. Before the opening of Assembly Hall in 1963, it was home to the basketball team as well. Assembly Hall opened on March 2, 1963, and hosts the home games for the men's and women's basketball teams. Max Abramovitz, an Illinois alumnus, was the lead architect behind the building of the indoor arena. At the time of its opening, Assembly Hall could hold 16,128 people, making it the largest dome structure in North America until the Houston Astrodome opened in 1965. In 2008, school officials, led by athletic director Ron Guenther, conducted a study to decide whether to refurbish the Assembly Hall or build a new basketball arena. In 2010, they decided to keep the arena. In 2014, renovations began under the watch of AECOM, an architectural firm based out of Dallas Texas. The estimated cost of the project was estimated to be around $169.5 million and in turn State Farm Insurance decided to buy the naming rights of the stadium. The 2-story, 40,000-square-foot building is home to the University of Illinois Men's and Women's basketball programs. The facility includes offices, locker areas, weight training facilities and team meeting rooms in addition to the practice basketball courts. The Illinois Champions Campaign was a major catalyst of the $40 million renovation.[8] In November 2015, the arena hosted the team for five games while renovations to the State Farm Center were completed.[9] Illinois and Indiana's rivalry started because the teams share a state border and they are located about 153 miles (246 km) apart. They have played annually since 1906. Indiana currently leads the series 96‚Äì92. The teams have played each other in five top-ten matchups, the first coming in 1952 when 2nd-ranked Illinois beat 4th-ranked Indiana 78‚Äì66. The longest winning streak was when Indiana won nine consecutive matchups from 1972 to 1977. Illinois has had a total of 34 players who have claimed All-American status. ‚Ä† = Consensus All-American In 2004, during the celebration of the program's 100th year of basketball as a varsity sport, the University of Illinois Division of Intercollegiate Athletics announced its All-Century Team.

He added six rushes for 42 yards. Spin: Stroud took some time to get the offense moving, as a lost fumble by John Metchie and an interception ended a few of Houston's drives early on. However, Stroud hit his stride on a possession late in the second quarter, connecting on long passes of 34 and 37 yards before delivering a 13-yard touchdown to Nico Collins. That was his only score of the game, but Stroud put together an efficient performance the rest of the way to earn the second postseason victory of his career. ESPN Fantasy Projection: The former Buckeye looks to build on a momentous first season that included becoming just the fifth rookie quarterback to ever throw for at least 4,000 yards. Without much rushing volume or success in either his collegiate or professional profile, Stroud's fantasy production will be defined by his proficiency from the pocket. After finishing seventh in per-game fantasy output last season, another prolific passing season could unfold given the presence of a trio of talented receivers -- Nico Collins, Stefon Diggs and Tank Dell -- each of whom brings special route trees and skill sets to the field. Securing Stroud in the middle rounds is a sound strategy for those who wait a bit at the position.",

                "content": "Coleridge Bernard \"C. J.\" Stroud IV (born October 3, 2001) is an American professional football quarterback for the Houston Texans of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes, where he holds several school records, including most passing yards in a single game with 573, as well as being the first player to throw for six touchdowns three times. Stroud was a Heisman Trophy finalist in 2021 and 2022, and was subsequently selected by the Houston Texans second overall in the 2023 NFL draft. In his rookie season, he led the Texans to a division title and playoff victory en route to winning the Offensive Rookie of the Year Award. Stroud was born on October 3, 2001, in Rancho Cucamonga, California, the youngest of four children.[1][2] In 2016, his father, Coleridge Bernard Stroud III, received a 38-years-to-life sentence after pleading guilty to kidnapping, carjacking and robbery in connection with a drug-related incident under California's three-strikes law.[3] As of 2023, his father has been incarcerated since Stroud was in middle school,[2][4] and is serving his sentence in Folsom State Prison near Sacramento. The incarceration sent the Stroud family into severe financial debt; they lived in a small apartment above a storage facility as Stroud entered Rancho Cucamonga High School.[5][6][7] As a senior, he was the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin offensive player of the year after passing for 3,878 yards and 47 touchdowns.[8] In 2019, he was the MVP of the Elite 11.[9] Stroud was selected to play in the 2020 All-American Bowl.[10] Initially considered a 3-star recruit, Stroud finished high school as the third-highest rated quarterback of his class.[11][12] He committed to Ohio State University to play college football.[13][14][15] Stroud has been friends with Carolina Panthers quarterback Bryce Young since the two went to high schools located in Southern California. The two continued their friendship in college, and ultimately were selected with the first two picks in the 2023 NFL draft.[16] Stroud spent his true freshman year at Ohio State redshirting as a backup to Justin Fields.[17][18] He played just eight snaps in 2020, throwing no passes, but did score a 48-yard rushing touchdown against Michigan State.[19] He also played one snap in the 2021 Sugar Bowl against Clemson after Fields took a hard hit to the ribs.[20] Stroud was named the starting quarterback as a redshirt freshman following the departure of Fields to the 2021 NFL draft. He was chosen over freshmen Kyle McCord, Quinn Ewers, and fellow redshirt freshman Jack Miller III. Coach Ryan Day credited his decision-making, leadership skills, and accuracy as the reasons that he earned the starting spot.[21] Stroud started every game for the Buckeyes aside from a Week 4 game against Akron in order to rest a shoulder injury he sustained in the season opener.[22] Over the season, he earned first-team All-Big Ten Honors; was named the Big Ten quarterback of the year; won Big Ten Freshman of the Week six times; was a finalist for both the Davey O'Brien Award and the Heisman Trophy; and became the only quarterback in Ohio State history to throw five touchdowns against a Big Ten competitor four times in one season.[23] He led the team to a 10‚Äì2 record in the regular season, with losses to Oregon and bitter rival Michigan.[24] The loss to Michigan cost Ohio State the chance to play in the Big Ten Championship. Ohio State bounced back from this disappointment at the Rose Bowl; coming back from a 14-point deficit against Utah to win 48‚Äì45. Stroud broke both school and Rose Bowl records with 573 yards thrown in the Rose Bowl; he also tied a school record and set a Rose Bowl record with six touchdown passes.[25] He finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting.[26] Following a successful 2021 season, Stroud entered 2022 as one of the best players in college football, as well as the betting favorite to win the Heisman Trophy.[27][28] On October 8, 2022, Stroud threw six touchdown passes against Michigan State, setting a conference record for ‚Äúmost six passing touchdown games in a career‚Äù (with 3), and passed Justin Fields to move to second place on the Ohio State career passing touchdowns list.[29][30] Stroud and the Buckeyes once again came up short against rival Michigan in their annual meeting, this time losing at home in Columbus 45‚Äì23.[31] Despite the loss, the Buckeyes were selected as the fourth and final team for the College Football Playoff.[32] In the Peach Bowl semifinal against the top-seeded Georgia Bulldogs, Stroud had a strong performance, throwing for 348 yards and four touchdowns, but the Buckeyes lost 42‚Äì41, ending their season.[33] At the conclusion of the regular season, he again was named a finalist for the Heisman trophy for his season.[34] He finished third in the voting behind winner Caleb Williams from USC and Max Duggan from TCU.[35] On January 16, 2023, Stroud announced that he would forgo his remaining two years of college eligibility and enter the 2023 NFL draft.[36] Stroud was selected by the Houston Texans with the second overall pick in the 2023 NFL draft on April 27, 2023.[39] Being second overall, Stroud became the highest drafted quarterback in Ohio State's history.[40] On September 10, 2023, Stroud made his NFL debut in Week 1 against the Baltimore Ravens, where he threw for 242 yards in the 25‚Äì9 loss.[41] During Week 2 against the Indianapolis Colts, Stroud threw his first two NFL touchdowns, one to Nico Collins and the other to Tank Dell, and finished with 384 passing yards in the 31‚Äì20 loss. Stroud's 384 yards are the second-most in a single game by a Texans rookie quarterback.[42] The following week, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Stroud finished 20-of-30 for 280 yards with two touchdowns as the Texans won 37‚Äì17.[43] He also joined Cam Newton and Justin Herbert as the only players in NFL history to put up at least 900 passing yards in their first three games.[44] Stroud was named the Offensive Rookie of the Month for September, finishing the month with 78 completions on 121 attempts with 906 yards and four touchdowns with no interceptions.[45] In Week 5, Stroud threw his 177th pass attempt without an interception, breaking the previous NFL record set by Dak Prescott for the most pass attempts without an interception to begin a career in NFL history in a 21‚Äì19 loss to the Atlanta Falcons.[46] The streak ended the following week against the New Orleans Saints at 191 attempts; Saints linebacker Zack Baun intercepted the pass but had the ball punched out by wide receiver Nico Collins with offensive tackle Tytus Howard recovering the ball for the Texans.[47] In Week 8, Stroud faced his friend and fellow top draft pick Bryce Young for the first time in the NFL. Young came out on top in a defensive battle, 15‚Äì13. Stroud threw for 140 yards and had his first rushing touchdown in the loss.[48] In Week 9, Stroud passed for 470 yards, breaking the single-game passing yard record for a rookie quarterback that was previously set by Andrew Luck in 2012. Stroud also passed for five touchdowns, during a 39‚Äì37 comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[49] The game also marked just the third time in NFL history a quarterback has thrown for at least 470 yards and five touchdowns with no interceptions, joining Y.A. Tittle and Ben Roethlisberger.[50] In Week 14 against the New York Jets, Stroud suffered a concussion during the fourth quarter as the Texans lost 30‚Äì6.[51] After a two-game absence, Stroud made his return in Week 17 against the Tennessee Titans, completing 24 of 32 passes for 213 yards and one touchdown in a 26‚Äì3 victory.[52] In a win-or-go-home situation against the Colts, Stroud completed 20 of 26 passes for 264 yards and two touchdowns in a 23‚Äì19 win, clinching the Texans' first playoff berth since 2019.[53] During this game, Stroud became just the fifth quarterback in NFL history to pass for over 4,000 yards in their rookie season.[54] Stroud also became the third player in league history to lead the league in passing yards per game (273.9) and touchdown/interception ratio (4.6) in the same season, joining Tom Brady in 2007 and Joe Montana in 1989.[55] He was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team.[56] In his playoff debut against the Cleveland Browns in the Wild Card round, Stroud tied the rookie record for most passing touchdowns in a playoff game and became the youngest quarterback to win a playoff game in league history as the Texans won 45‚Äì14.[57] Stroud finished the game completing 16 of 21 passes for 274 yards, three touchdowns, and a near-perfect passer rating of 157.2.[58] In the Divisional round against the top-seeded Ravens in a rematch of Week 1, Stroud was held in check, completing 19 of 33 passes for 175 yards and a 72.2 rating as the Texans lost, 34‚Äì10.[59] Stroud began the season by leading the Texans to back-to-back victories over the Indianapolis Colts and Chicago Bears, throwing for a combined 494 yards, three touchdowns, and no turnovers.[60][61] In Week 4 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Stroud passed for 345 yards and two touchdowns, leading the Texans on a nine-play, 69-yard touchdown drive with under 20 seconds remaining to secure a 24‚Äì20 victory.[62] In Week 6, Stroud threw for 192 yards with three touchdowns in the 41‚Äì21 win over the New England Patriots, improving to 5‚Äì1 on the season.[63] Despite a strong start, Stroud faced challenges during his sophomore season. In Week 7 against the Green Bay Packers, Stroud completed under half his passes for 86 yards in a 24‚Äì22 loss.[64] Against the New York Jets in Week 9, Stroud completed only 11-of-30 passes and was sacked eight times in a 21‚Äì13 loss.[65] On Sunday Night Football in Week 10, he recorded 232 passing yards and a touchdown but threw two interceptions to Detroit Lions cornerback Carlton Davis as the Texans lost 26‚Äì23.[66] Stroud threw two more interceptions in a Week 12 loss to the Titans as the Texans dropped to 7‚Äì5.[67] On Christmas Day against the Baltimore Ravens, Stroud had one of the worst outings of his career, completing 54.8% of his passes for 185 yards and an interception in a 31‚Äì2 loss. His passer rating of 59.2 was one of the lowest of his career.[68] Stroud finished his second season with 3,727 yards, a 63.2 completion percentage, 20 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, an 87.0 passer rating, and 52 sacks, all of which were a decline from his breakout rookie campaign.[69] Despite a 5‚Äì6 finish to the season, the Texans were still able to clinch their second consecutive AFC South title.[70] Stroud is the son of Coleridge and Kimberly Stroud. He has two older brothers and one older sister.[74] He has spoken publicly about his Christian faith, and is known to say: ‚ÄúFirst and foremost I‚Äôve got to thank my Lord Savior Jesus Christ‚Äù during interviews.[75][76]",

With her wife and children by her side, Chief Crowley took the oath of office on March 25, 2022 ‚Äì becoming the first female and LGBTQ Fire Chief in the LAFD. Chief Crowley leads a diverse department ‚Äì about 3,400 sworn and more than 350 civilians ‚Äì in protecting four million people in Los Angeles (LA) ‚Äì the Nation‚Äôs second-largest City. From the ocean to the mountains, the Valley to the Port of LA, the LAFD responds to over 1,300 emergency calls a day. As a 22-year veteran of the LAFD, Chief Crowley has proven her credibility and character by promoting through the ranks. She served as a Firefighter, Paramedic, Engineer, Fire Inspector, Captain I, Captain II, Battalion Chief, Assistant Chief, Deputy Chief, Chief Deputy, and Fire Chief. She has gained valuable experience in both field assignments on emergency apparatus and administrative duty in multiple areas within the Department.

                "title": "Who Is Kristin Crowley? Los Angeles Fire Chief Faces Wave of Anger - Newsweek",
                "content": "Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley is facing a wave of anger amid wildfires in the state, which have forced thousands to evacuate from their homes. It comes as authorities have said the four fires, which have burned more than 4,000 acres, have not yet been contained. Some firefighters have also reported hydrants being dry, preventing them from being able to stop the blazes, according to reports. Such reports have prompted some social media users to slam Crowley's leadership of the fire department. Newsweek has contacted Crowley's office for comment via email. So far, two deaths have been reported as a result of the fires. The blazes remain a threat to human health, creating hazardous air-quality conditions that pose serious health risks. Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) levels in the air are expected to reach unhealthy or higher levels. This means \"everyone may begin to experience some adverse health effects, such as difficulty breathing and throat irritation, while sensitive groups could experience more severe impacts,\" according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Sensitive groups include people with heart or lung disease, children, pregnant women and older adults. Meanwhile, the fires have also seen schools close and hundreds of thousands of homes left without power. Four fires are currently burning in Los Angeles, including the Eaton fire near Altadena, which has burned 1,000 acres, the Palisades fire in Pacific Palisades, which has burned 2,900 acres so far, and the Hurst fire, north of San Fernando, which has burned 500 acres. In the last hour or so, a fourth, smaller fire‚Äîthe Tyler fire‚Äîhas been reported by the state's fire authority in Riverside County, which is currently burning about 15 acres in size. Authorities say none of the blazes have been contained and that there is \"no possibility\" of bringing them under control. According to the LA Fire Department, the situation remains \"very dangerous\" and wind speeds are \"worsening.\" The Los Angeles Times also reported that some firefighters battling the blazes said on internal radio systems that hydrants were coming up dry, meaning they did not have enough water to put out the fire. An LA Department of Water & Power spokesman confirmed reports of reduced water flow from hydrants but provided no details on the number or scope of the issue. In a statement to the Los Angeles Times, the agency said crews were working to maintain water supplies, which rely on water tanks. The extent and cause of the problem remain unclear. Similar hydrant issues hampered firefighting efforts during Ventura County's Mountain fire in November when inactive water pumps delayed hillside water delivery. Amid such issues, Crowley is facing scrutiny. Crowley is the first woman and first openly LGBTQ+ person to hold her post. She is married to retired firefighter Hollyn Bullock. Her nomination came after former Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas stepped down amid growing scrutiny for not doing enough to stop sexist and racist behavior within the Los Angeles Fire Department. Mayor Eric Garcetti said at the time that he nominated Crowley to the position not due to her gender but due to her abilities and skill with public safety challenges. \"I look for who's best, not just who makes history,\" Garcetti said at a press conference. \"Because the protection of our city first and foremost has to go to the human being who is best prepared to lead. But, let me be clear, that is Kristin Crowley. And this progress is incredibly important and long overdue.\" When she was nominated to her position in 2022, she had been with the fire department for 22 years, having been a firefighter, paramedic, engineer, fire inspector, captain, battalion chief, assistant chief, fire marshal and deputy chief. She became Los Angeles' first female fire marshal in 2016. When she took the firefighter exam in the late 1990s, she ranked among the top 50 out of 16,000 applicants. Crowley accepted the nomination, saying: \"As the fire chief, if confirmed, I vow to take a strategic and balanced approach to ensure we meet the needs of the community we serve. We will focus our efforts on increasing our operational effectiveness, enhancing firefighter safety and well-being, and fully commit to fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture within the LAFD.\" The MAGA Voice X account wrote: \"The Los Angeles Fire Chief was more focused on LGBTQ initiatives than refilling water reservoirs.\" Commentator Rogan O'Handley, also known as DC Draino, wrote on X: \"On the left is the LA Fire Chief allowing her city to be burned down with no water in fire hydrants. On the right is the New Orleans Police Chief who allowed a terrorist attack on Bourbon without street barriers. DEI is quite literally getting people killed. Bring back merit.\" LAFD Captain Erik Scott told Newsweek: \"We did experience some challenges with water pressure while battling the Pacific Palisades Fire. LADWP proactively filled all available water storage tanks, including three 1-million-gallon tanks located in the Palisades area. However, water availability was impacted at higher elevations, which affected some fire hydrants due to limited replenishment of water tanks in those areas. The extreme demand caused a slower refill rate for these tanks which created a challenge for our firefighting effort.\" Firefighters and emergency workers are continuing to respond to the fires, evacuating residents from their homes. Santa Ana winds are forecast to diminish on Thursday as the storm system moves away from the region, offering some relief to affected areas.

                "content": "Manage your account Kristin Crowley was elevated to Los Angeles fire chief in 2022 at a time of turmoil in a department consumed by complaints of rampant hazing, harassment and discrimination among its 3,400-member ranks. As a career firefighter, she was portrayed by the then-mayor as a stabilizing force. Three years later, the mood between Crowley and City Hall has changed. The wildfire in Pacific Palisades that has burned more than 5,000 structures to become the most destructive in city history has put leaders on the defensive and led Crowley to engage in a public spat with Mayor Karen Bass over resources even as the battle against flames continues across the Los Angeles area. See for yourself ‚Äî The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. Crowley publicly criticized the city Friday for budget cuts that she said have made it harder for firefighters to do their jobs at a time when they are seeing more calls. She also cast blame on the city for water running out Tuesday when about 20% of the hydrants tapped to fight the Palisades fire went dry. ‚ÄúI'm not a politician, I‚Äôm a public servant. It‚Äôs my job as the fire chief for Los Angeles city fire dept to make sure our firefighters have exactly what they need to do their jobs,‚Äù she told CNN. Her comments and perceived falling-out with Bass prompted so much speculation about her job security that the union issued a statement Friday assuring rank-and-file members that she had not been fired. The following day the mayor sought to tamp down the tension. ‚ÄúLet me be clear about something: The fire chief and I are focused on fighting these fires and saving lives, and any differences that we might have will be worked out in private,‚Äù Bass said at a news conference. ‚ÄúBut right now our first and most important obligation to Angelenos is to get through this crisis.‚Äù This followed several days of Crowley getting swept into the national political fray over diversity, equity and inclusion policies that conservatives believe have gone too far in American institutions. Crowley, who is openly gay and the city‚Äôs first female fire chief, has made diversifying the overwhelmingly male department a priority. ‚ÄúWhat we are seeing (was) largely preventable,‚Äù talk show host Megyn Kelly said on her show. ‚ÄúLA‚Äôs fire chief has made not filling the fire hydrants top priority, but diversity.‚Äù There‚Äôs no evidence that Crowley‚Äôs efforts to diversify the department have hampered the fight. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is in charge of providing water for the hydrants, and its leaders have said they were overwhelmed by the intense demand on a municipal system not designed to fight wildfires, particularly as firefighting aircraft was grounded. Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered an investigation into what happened, and Crowley herself added to the criticism. ‚ÄúWhen a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there's going to be water,‚Äù she said during a local news interview. Philadelphia Managing Director Adam K. Thiel, who previously served as that city‚Äôs fire commissioner, suggested that people reserve judgment until the fires can be investigated. He noted that firefighters cannot control the weather, a key factor in battling wildfires. ‚ÄúFirefighting, to a regular person, probably appears to be a relatively simple process of putting water on a fire,‚Äù said Thiel, who knows Crowley and praised her experience. ‚ÄúIn reality every firefighting operation, in any environment, is inherently volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous.‚Äù Former Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti appointed Crowley to the job amid complaints about a frat house culture in the department that was sometimes hostile to women and minorities. Several lawsuits alleged hazing and harassment, and federal investigators found evidence of discrimination. At the time Crowley was sworn in, women accounted for just 3.5 percent of the uniformed membership, a figure that‚Äôs not unusual for a department. A survey found that half the uniformed women in the department ‚Äî along with 40% of Blacks, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders ‚Äî felt harassment was a problem. Crowley, whose wife is a retired firefighter, told the Los Angeles Times in 2022 that she planned to ensure all of employees ‚Äúcome to work and feel safe and feel heard.‚Äù Two years later, she was facing budget cuts that she warned could hamper the department's ability to respond to emergencies, including wildfires. She highlighted the elimination of civilian positions and $7 million in overtime pay. The reduction in overtime has limited the department‚Äôs ability to prepare and train for ‚Äúlarge scale emergencies,‚Äù such as wildfires and earthquakes, Crowley said, and programs like air operations. The department has also lost mechanics, leading to delays in repairing the vehicle fleet, she said. Other city officials say the department's budget was later boosted, but it's unclear how much of that went to firefighting resources. Bass has said the department has the resources needed to do its job and she will address specifics once the crisis subsides. Crowley, who grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, came to firefighting after what she called ‚Äúa really unique journey.‚Äù A high school and college athlete, she studied biology at Saint Mary‚Äôs College in Notre Dame, Indiana, with plans to become an orthopedic surgeon. Two weeks after graduation, she moved to California. A stint as a paramedic changed her career path. She did an internship with the fire department and was hooked. ‚ÄúThat was it,‚Äù she told WBAY-TV in Green Bay in March 2022. ‚ÄúWithin a few seconds of me entering into the fire station, it was just such a wonderful connection to what I had being a student-athlete for the majority of my life, and I tell you, it was a perfect fit.‚Äù Crowley has now been with the department for a quarter century, serving in nearly every role, including fire marshal, engineer and battalion chief. Garcetti had described Crowley as not only a trailblazer but the most qualified person. ‚ÄúThe protection of our city first and foremost has to go to the human being who is best prepared to lead. But let me be clear, that is Kristin Crowley,‚Äù he said. ___ Associated Press reporter Zeke Miller in Washington contributed.",

                "content": "John Luman Smith (born June 5, 1969) is an American attorney who has served in the United States Department of Justice as an assistant U.S. attorney, acting U.S. attorney, and head of the department's Public Integrity Section. He was also the chief prosecutor at the Kosovo Specialist Chambers, an international tribunal at The Hague tasked with investigating and prosecuting war crimes in the Kosovo War. He served as a Special Counsel for the Department of Justice from November 18, 2022 until his resignation on January 10, 2025. In November 2022, attorney general Merrick Garland appointed Smith an independent special counsel, responsible for overseeing two preexisting Justice Department criminal investigations into former president Donald Trump, three days after Trump announced his 2024 presidential campaign: one regarding Trump's role in the January 6 U.S. Capitol attack, and the other into alleged mishandling of government records, including classified documents. The documents case resulted in a 37-count indictment of Trump in June 2023 to which three counts were later added in July.[2] In August, the January 6 case resulted in an indictment on four charges.[3] The classified documents case was dismissed by judge Aileen Cannon in July 2024, on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed as special counsel.[2] Smith's office initially appealed the ruling, but ultimately abandoned the appeal after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.[4] The election subversion case was dismissed by judge Tanya Chutkan in November 2024, on the grounds that the Office of Legal Counsel held that Trump as President-elect could not be charged consistent with the Constitution.[5] Smith was born on June 5, 1969.[6] He grew up in Clay, New York, a suburb of Syracuse.[7][8] His father was a draftsman of air-conditioning systems; his mother was a homemaker for most of Smith's childhood.[9] He graduated from Liverpool High School in 1987,[10] where he played football and baseball.[11] He then studied political science at the State University of New York at Oneonta, graduating in 1991 with a Bachelor of Arts, summa cum laude.[11][12][13] Smith then attended Harvard Law School, from which he graduated cum laude in 1994 with the degree of Juris Doctor.[8] After graduating from law school, Smith joined the Manhattan District Attorney's office, serving as assistant district attorney. He was a member of the sex crimes and domestic violence units of the DA's office.[14] He joined the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York in 1999. As an assistant U.S. attorney at the Brooklyn-based office, he prosecuted the police officers who brutalized and sexually assaulted Abner Louima, and led the case towards the death penalty‚Äîwhich was later overturned‚Äîagainst Ronell Wilson, who murdered two members of the New York Police Department.[8][15][16] On one occasion he reportedly slept in an apartment building hallway for an entire weekend so he could intercept a witness in a domestic violence case and convince her to testify.[17] From 2008 to 2010, Smith worked as investigation coordinator for the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands.[18][16] In that position, he oversaw cases against government officials and militia members accused of war crimes and genocide.[8][15] In 2010, Smith returned to the U.S. to become chief of the U.S. Department of Justice's Public Integrity Section (PIN).[7][16] Among his first responsibilities was evaluating current investigations, and he recommended closing investigations into several members of Congress.[8][a] He spent five years as chief of PIN, where he prosecuted a variety of corruption cases, including those against Virginia governor Bob McDonnell, U.S. representative Rick Renzi, Jeffrey Sterling, a Central Intelligence Agency officer who shared national secrets,[19][16] New York State Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver,[20] and North Carolina Senator John Edwards.[21] McDonnell, Renzi, Sterling,[19] and Silver were found guilty,[20] though the Supreme Court later unanimously overturned McDonnell's conviction.[22] Edwards' case ended in a mistrial.[21] In 2015, Smith became an assistant U.S. attorney in the Middle District of Tennessee, at Nashville.[23][16] He became the acting U.S. attorney in March 2017 upon the resignation of David Rivera, and resigned effective September 2017 after the nomination of Donald Q. Cochran.[24] Smith became the vice president and head of litigation for Hospital Corporation of America in 2017.[25] On May 7, 2018, Smith was named to a four-year term as chief prosecutor for the Kosovo Specialist Chambers in The Hague, investigating war crimes in the Kosovo War.[14][15][23] During his time as the chief prosecutor, he brought charges against several individuals, including Salih Mustafa[26][27][28] and the sitting President of Kosovo, Hashim Tha√ßi.[29] He took up the post on September 11, 2018, and was appointed to a second term on May 8, 2022, before stepping down on November 18, 2022.[30] On November 18, 2022, United States Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Smith special counsel to oversee the criminal investigations into Donald Trump's actions regarding the January 6 U.S. Capitol attack, and Trump's handling and storage of government records, including classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.[15][19][31][32] He worked initially from the Netherlands while recovering from a fractured leg, injured when he was struck by a scooter while cycling.[8] By early January 2023, Smith had returned to the U.S.[33] On June 8, 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump on seven federal criminal charges related to his handling of the classified documents. This marked the first time in American history that a serving or former president has been indicted on a federal criminal charge.[34] After repeated delays and postponement of the trial,[35] Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case on July 15, 2024 on the grounds that Smith's appointment as special counsel violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution.[36][37][38] On July 17, with permission from the Justice Department,[39][40] Smith filed a notice of appeal to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.[41] On August 1, 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump on four federal charges related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his conduct during the January 6 Capitol attack.[3] A year later, the Supreme Court decision on immunity directed Judge Tanya Chutkan to determine what parts of the indictment may proceed,[42] based on whether each act was official or private conduct; whether the official acts are part of core constitutional duties; and whether prosecuting the non-core official acts would have any \"dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive.\"[43][44] Before Chutkan could hold a hearing,[45] Smith issued a superseding indictment rewording the charges to exclude Trump's attempts to pressure his Justice Department, but did not drop any of the charges.[46] Two weeks before Trump won the 2024 presidential election,[47] he said in a radio interview that, were he to take office, \"I would fire him [Jack Smith] within two seconds.\"[48] On November 13, it was reported that Smith planned to step down before Trump took office.[49] On November 22, it was reported that Trump was planning to use the Justice Department to investigate his 2020 election loss as well as to fire Jack Smith's entire team.[50]In January 2025, Jack Smith resigned from the Justice Department as Special Counsel before Donald Trump took office. By law, the special counsel is required to present the full findings of the investigation to the Justice Department, which is headed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, who promised to release the report to the public.[51] Smith is a competitive triathlete, having taken up swimming when he was in his mid-thirties.[55][56] He has completed more than 100 triathlons and at least nine Ironman competitions around the world.[57] In July 2011, he married Katy Chevigny,[58] a documentary filmmaker[59] known for Becoming, a 2020 documentary about Michelle Obama. They have a daughter.[56] The couple lived in the Netherlands starting in 2018,[11] before moving to Washington, D.C. in December 2022, shortly after Smith was appointed as special counsel.[6]",

                "content": "A former war crimes prosecutor, Smith was appointed in November 2022 ‚Äì nearly two years after the US Capitol attack. Jack Smith, the special counsel who led two federal cases against Donald Trump, has left the United States Department of Justice before the Republican president-elect is inaugurated on January 20 for a second term. The two cases involve Trump‚Äôs alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left the White House and efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat. Trump was indicted in both cases overseen by Smith. ‚ÄúThe Special Counsel completed his work and submitted his final confidential report on January 7, 2025, and separated from the Department on January 10,‚Äù officials said in the document submitted to US District Judge Aileen Cannon, urging her last week not to extend her order blocking the release of Smith‚Äôs final report. The statement on Smith was a footnote in the filing to Cannon as she mulls whether to maintain a hold on the special counsel‚Äôs report on two cases. A former war crimes prosecutor, Smith was appointed in November 2022 ‚Äì nearly two years after the US Capitol attack ‚Äì to lead the Justice Department‚Äôs twin ongoing investigations into Trump. He brought two of the four criminal cases Trump faced after leaving office but saw them grind to a halt after a Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed one and the US Supreme Court found that former presidents have sweeping immunity from prosecution for official acts. Neither case went to trial. After Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election, Smith dropped both cases, citing a longstanding Justice Department rule against prosecuting sitting presidents. In asking courts to dismiss the charges, Smith‚Äôs team defended the merits of the cases they had brought, signalling only that Trump‚Äôs impending return to the White House made them untenable. Smith‚Äôs departure is another marker of the collapse of the criminal cases against Trump, which could end without any legal consequences for the incoming president and led to a backlash that helped fuel his political comeback. Meanwhile, Trump, who has frequently called Smith ‚Äúderanged‚Äù and said he would fire him immediately upon taking office, has suggested that he may pursue retribution against Smith and others who investigated him once he returns to office.

                "content": "Jack Smith, the special counsel who led two federal criminal cases against Donald Trump, has resigned from the Justice Department before the president-elect takes office later this month. According to a court filing submitted on Saturday, Mr Smith \"separated from the Department\" on Friday. CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, reported in November that Smith would resign from the Justice Department after completing his work. Mr Smith's departure comes amid a dispute over the release of his report into the findings of Trump's classified documents case. Mr Smith was appointed as special counsel in 2022 to oversee two Justice Department cases into Trump - one over the alleged improper hoarding of classified documents and the other over an alleged attempt to interfere in the 2020 election outcome. Both cases resulted in criminal charges against Trump, who pleaded not guilty and and sought to cast the prosecutions as politically motivated. Mr Smith's cases against the president-elect were closed last year following Trump's presidential election win. Prosecutors wrote that Justice Department regulations forbid the prosecution of a sitting president. CBS reported in November that Mr Smith's resignation was expected as it would allow him to leave his post without being fired by Trump or the incoming president's attorney general. His exit means he leaves without either of his criminal prosecutions of Trump seeing trial. Earlier this week, US District Judge Aileen Cannon - who oversaw the classified documents case and controversially dismissed it last July - temporarily barred Mr Smith and Attorney General Merrick Garland from \"releasing, sharing, or transmitting\" the report about the case. Trump's legal team received a draft copy of the report last weekend and it was expected to be released as soon as Friday. The move by Judge Cannon came after attorneys for Trump's former co-defendants in the case - Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveir - called on her to intervene. Both men had pleaded not guilty. Judge Cannon ordered the release be put on hold until a higher appeals court, the Eleventh Circuit in Atlanta, considered an emergency appeal from Mr Nauta and Mr De Oliveir. By law, special counsels must present the findings of their investigations to the Justice Department, which is headed by the attorney general. Garland has promised to release all reports to the public and has so far done so. Trump's attorneys argued that Mr Smith did not have the legal authority to submit the classified documents report because he was unconstitutionally picked to do the job and was politically motivated. Trump's legal team also wrote to Garland not to release the report, and urged him to end the \"weaponisation of the justice system\". On Friday, a judge sentenced Trump to an \"unconditional discharge\" in a criminal case related to hush money payments, meaning he has been spared jail and a fine, but he will still take office as the first US president with a felony conviction. Harris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution. Among the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans. The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The suspect used an ‚Äúimprovised incendiary device‚Äù to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election. A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds. Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years. The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power. Given all the things they‚Äôve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump‚Äôs meeting could be really awkward.

                "content": "WASHINGTON ‚Äî Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned from the Justice Department after submitting his investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump, an expected move that comes amid legal wrangling over how much of that document can be made public in the days ahead. The department disclosed Smith's departure in a court filing Saturday, saying he had resigned one day earlier. The resignation, 10 days before Trump is inaugurated , follows the conclusion of two unsuccessful criminal prosecutions against Trump that were withdrawn following Trump's White House win in November. At issue now is the fate of a two-volume report that Smith and his team had prepared about their twin investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn the results of his 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. The Justice Department had been expected to make the document public in the final days of the Biden administration, but the Trump-appointed judge who presided over the classified documents case granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt its release. Two of Trump's co-defendants in that case, Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, had argued that the release of the report would be unfairly prejudicial, an argument that the Trump legal team joined in. The department responded by saying that it would withhold from public release the classified documents volume as long as criminal proceedings against Nauta and De Oliveira remain pending. Though U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon had dismissed the case last July, a Smith team appeal of that decision related to the two co-defendants remained pending. But prosecutors said they intended to proceed with the release of the election interference volume. In an emergency motion late Friday, they asked the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to swiftly lift an injunction from Cannon that had barred them from releasing any portion of the report. They separately told Cannon on Saturday that she had no authority to halt the release of the report, but she responded with an order directing prosecutors to file an additional brief by Sunday. The appeals court on Thursday night denied an emergency defense bid to block the release of the election interference report, which covers Trump's efforts before Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, to undo the results of the 2020 election. But it left in place Cannon's injunction that said none of the findings could be released until three days after the matter was resolved by the appeals court. The Justice Department told the appeals court in its emergency motion that Cannon's order was \"plainly erroneous.\" \"The Attorney General is the Senate-confirmed head of the Department of Justice and is vested with the authority to supervise all officers and employees of the Department,\" the Justice Department said. \"The Attorney General thus has authority to decide whether to release an investigative report prepared by his subordinates.\" Justice Department regulations call for special counsels to produce reports at the conclusion of their work, and it's customary for such documents to be made public no matter the subject. William Barr, attorney general during Trump's first term, released a special counsel report examining Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential ties to the Trump campaign. Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland, has also released special counsel reports, including about Biden's handling of classified information before Biden became president. Copyright 2025 NPR",
